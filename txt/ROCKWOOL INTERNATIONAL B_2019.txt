Good results, challenging conditions

Dear stakeholders, Two-thousand nineteen was a good year for ROCKWOOL Group but also challenging in some respects. Overall, the year was characterised by mixed market conditions, volatility, and uncertainties about the macro political/economic direction of world affairs. We navigated the volatility well, anticipating evolving conditions early on while continuously adapting to minimise disruption, safeguard productivity, maximise opportunities, and enhance earnings levels.

"For the fifth year in a row, our customer satisfaction scores increased ­ for 2019, up 14 percent over the previous year".

The proof is in the numbers. We are financially strong and are continuing to invest in even more advanced production facilities, new technologies, strategic partnerships, and better services to customers like our new business-to-business e-commerce platform.
Solid financial performance Despite the overall mixed market conditions but helped by a growing demand for natural, recyclable building materials, we retained high productivity levels in 2019. We adapted in good time to changes in the marketplace, including adjusting capacity to match business demands.
That resilience and flexibility, together with our regular price increases, allowed us to maintain strong profitability despite slower sales growth. Net sales increased by 2.2 percent in local currencies, while EBIT margin reached 13.5 percent, up 0.7 percentage points compared to 2018. Profit for the year grew eight percent, reaching a total of EUR 285 million. We remain net debt free with a net positive cash position of EUR 269 million.

For the fifth year in a row, our customer satisfaction scores increased ­ for 2019, up 14 percent over the previous year. We continue to work hard every day to deliver quality products and services to meet evolving customer demands.
With an eye on the long-term, we invested in new and upgraded manufacturing facilities, including the Romania factory, which came online at the end of 2019. The expanded capacity in Poland will come online in early 2020, while the expansion in Germany is on track for start-up in Q2 2020.
At the factory in Wales, UK, we completed logistics upgrades and debottlenecking initiatives that will enable greater capacity throughput. Construction on the new factory in West Virginia, USA, continues with an expected start of operations in early 2021. Last year, we implemented multiple initiatives to improve our

overall operational efficiency, the result of which was to increase capacity output equivalent to more than two new production lines.
Transparency and innovation We started a new quarterly call for analysts this year, with a focus on environment, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues. During the first two calls, which focused on energy efficiency and circularity, we provided details on our overall efforts to maximise the benefits of our products while reducing the impact of our operations. The feedback on the calls is positive, and we will continue evolving our approach to reporting on ESG matters as we progress.
One important development that will help reduce the carbon intensity of our production is the large-scale

electric melting technology pilot project we are trialling in Moss, Norway. Once operational, expected in H2 2020, this innovative new technology is expected to reduce the factory's carbon emissions by 80 percent and waste going to landfill by up to 95 percent. We look forward to applying the learnings from this development project across other areas of the business as part of our overall strategy to reduce our carbon footprint.
During the year we opened our highly energy-efficient new laboratory next to the headquarters building, which will enable us to test and develop new products and processes using industry-leading equipment and technology. We also accelerated the rollout of Rockflow, a specially engineered stone wool product that helps urban areas combat flooding caused by sudden heavy rain storms. Rockflow is a costeffective way for cities to protect residents and valuable infrastructure from the increasing likelihood of urban flooding (see pp. 28-29).
Energy efficiency is the future The strategic direction of our company is driven largely by two megatrends ­ urbanisation and climate change. Every year brings a greater focus on how we handle the challenges and opportunities related to each. We know that a vital component of both megatrends is the energy efficiency of buildings. Cities account for around 70 percent of the world's energy use and CO2 emissions, most of which comes from buildings.
We also know that deep building renovations would achieve much of the energy efficiency gains needed to meet the Paris climate goals. Of course, knowing it isn't enough. Action is required from all parties ­ government, business, citizens ­ through ambitious legislation, partnerships, innovation, and the everyday decisions individual citizens make.
The release of the EU Commission's Green Deal framework in December is an encouraging development, the focus being the commitment to achieve a climate-neutral EU by

2050. This goes hand-in-hand with commitments from the European Investment Bank to provide up to 75 percent co-financing on building renovation projects, a particularly strong incentive for private capital to invest.
The business case for cities to renovate is a strong one. Together with C40 and leading cities like Copenhagen, Milan and New York, ROCKWOOL has developed a tool to help cities quantify the environmental, economic, and social benefits of large-scale deep renovation. This big picture view is already helping city leaders make the case for investing in renov ation. The results from the three pilot cities are encouraging, and we look forward to developing the tool further and taking it to more cities.
Stronger together Crucial in the fight against climate change, circularity is particularly relevant in the construction industry, which consumes more than 40 percent of all global resources annually and produces one-third of the world's waste. Taking advantage of stone wool's natural durability and recyclability, ROCKWOOL´s business model has many circular attributes, including products made from natural material mixed with upcycled materials from other industries.
To further develop our circular business model, we entered an important new partnership in 2019 with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circular Economy 100, which is leading efforts to gradually shift the prevailing economic model toward one that consumes and wastes less. We're also accelerating our collaborations across the construction sector to increase the number of countries where we offer reclaimed waste services.
Safety Sadly, we had a fatality in February when a sub-contractor fell through a floor opening where he was working at the Romanian factory construction site. An investigation of the incident revealed that we need stricter oversight of work at heights in our facilities. It also showed that the worker did not follow several safety protocols for working at heights.

Meeting our target for zero fatalities requires ensuring safe behaviour and work conditions must be a full-time job for all of us. On the positive side, we significantly reduced lost time incidents, which is an important indicator of increased focus on safety in the workplace.
The year ahead As we start the new decade, we anticipate continued volatility affecting several key markets as well as the overall construction sector, where we foresee flat growth in new residential and modest growth for non-residential activities. Steady progress in other markets and increased demand for naturally fire-resistant, recyclable stone wool products should help smooth out overall volatility. We will implement reasonable price increases, mainly to cover inflation and to support new investments in technology and digitalisation.
Financially, we forecast low single-digit sales growth in local currencies for 2020, with an EBIT margin of around 12 percent and investments excluding acquisitions of around EUR 400 million. As ever, we will remain agile to adapt to market opportunities and uncertainties.
During the coming year, we will adjust the company's capital structure via a share buy-back programme, totalling up to EUR 80 million.
We want to thank our hard-working, highly-committed employees for their contribution to the Group's success as well as our customers, whose loyalty we will work hard to earn throughout the year.

The ROCKWOOL purpose and strategy

The ROCKWOOL business strategy is driven by a passion for creating solutions that connect global trends with profitable business opportunities by creating superior solutions to protect life, assets, and the environment, and to create comfortable, healthy, and attractive spaces. In other words, by enriching modern living.

At the pinnacle of ROCKWOOL's strategy is our corporate purpose: to release the natural power of stone to enrich modern living. This reflects our purpose's unifying nature, conveying that stone is our core raw material and the bedrock on which our business is based.
And while the stone we use may be millions of years old, what we do with it is cutting-edge. Every day, ROCKWOOL's creative and entrepreneurial employees are developing and applying new technologies and innovations to release the potential of stone to enrich modern living.
As we look to the future, stone wool and the products we make with it will play an increasingly significant role in addressing two of the megatrends influencing virtually every aspect of modern society ­ urbanisation and climate change.
Every week, about 1.5 million people move to urban environments. By 2030, there will be an estimated 43 megacities around the globe with more than 10 million inhabitants. And by 2050, the earth's population is expected to be close to 10 billion, nearly 70 percent of whom will live in cities.
The combination of more people living in more densely populated urban areas and the worsening consequences

of climate change will increase the demand for modern housing and energy. At the same time, the world must feed its growing population using fewer resources, while also managing the effects of more frequent extreme weather events, particularly in urban environments.
The ROCKWOOL business strategy is driven by a passion for creating solutions that connect these global trends with profitable business opportunities by creating superior solutions to protect life, assets, and the environment, and to create comfortable, healthy, and attractive spaces. In other words, by enriching modern living.
Our aspiration is to grow faster than the market overall by offering superior products and s ervices, strengthening our brand, building long-term customer relations, and driving an operationally effective business across all segments and geographies where we are active.

In Europe, we will grow faster than the market by launching new products and services, while improving our customer-facing activities and the productivity of our production platform. We will expand capacity where needed to meet steadily growing demand in and near core markets and enhance our geographic coverage and customer service level.
In Asia, the approach is different, in that we will develop and grow our business selectively where there is a clear demand for our premium quality offerings.
At ROCKWOOL, everything we do is based on releasing the natural power of stone to enrich modern living. Profitably offering solutions to address the challenges created by enduring global megatrends will help ensure our successful future growth.

As our business is inherently capital intensive, we focus on exploiting our natural strengths to balance risks, which includes a differentiated approach across selected geographies.

In North America, for example, we are expanding our production capacity to capture significant growth opportunities within all major business areas.

There is something truly remarkable about the natural power of stone.
What do we mean when we say our purpose "is to release the natural power of stone to enrich modern living"? So far, we have identified 7 strengths that are inherent in the properties of stone wool that give it extraordinary versatility. Seven reasons why we believe the world's most abundant resource can be engineered to create uniquely useful and exciting solutions for our customers.
And by applying these 7 strengths to everything we do, we passionately believe that we can address some of the biggest challenges facing our world. We're sure that there are even more strengths of stone to be discovered. And when we discover them, we'll turn those strengths into new products that improve the quality of life of everyone who experiences them. That's why these 7 strengths lie at the heart of every R OCKWOOL product.

Volcanic rock is mixed with lime stone and can contain up to 75 percent recycled material before being heated to more than 1500°C.

What does ROCKWOOL Group do?
We transform volcanic rock into stone wool, a versatile material with many natural strengths that make it ideal for use in a range of applications in buildings, transportation, horticulture and water management.

The molten rock is spun into wool. A binder, special oil or wetting agent are added depending on the application of the end product.

A final heat treatment cures the binder, giving the stone wool dimensional stability, before final processing and production into a wide range of products.

Market review, outlook 2020

In 2019, we experienced mixed market conditions particularly in the insulation business. Key markets such as France, the United Kingdom, Russia and North America remained buoyant for ROCKWOOL, while Germany, eastern Europe and Asia slowed. Overall, global growth decelerated to the slowest pace since the Eurozone crisis with trade tensions and other geopolitical uncertainties negatively affecting the business climate for ROCKWOOL.
A growing demand for stone wool insulation nonetheless supported good growth for ROCKWOOL Group across other key markets. This has been most apparent in the United Kingdom, where regulation and increasing awareness of fire safety has driven demand and in France where the focus on energy efficiency to support climate initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions have spurred the renovation and thereby insulation of buildings.

Most central and northern European markets performed well, while main eastern European markets, after a record high demand previously, were down ­ with the noteworthy exception of Russia, which continued to develop positively throughout 2019.
In North America, we saw a steady development in sales, driven by a growing demand for non-combustible building insulation and horticultural growing solutions.
China and many southeast Asian markets declined or grew at a slower pace. However, continued urbanisation and expected tightening of building regulations will be substantial growth drivers for ROCKWOOL in these markets going forward.
Overall, construction growth in 2019 was largely positive in most key regions, but the level of growth has been losing speed, and the construction business in several countries is expected to show slightly negative or slow growth in 2020.

Future growth drivers for Insulation segment Insulation demand has outperformed construction output per annum in the last 15 years, and we believe that sales of our stone wool products should grow on average at least one percentage point faster in our core markets than the market overall. Energy efficiency requirements and other regulation have been driving this development. We anticipate these factors will continue to push demand for insulation, as social and government commitments to reduce emissions to sustainable levels are converted to policies, regulations and funding support programmes.
Governments and cities are increasingly putting in place regulations intended to help accomplish the global goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions agreed to at the 2015 COP21 in Paris. Insulation demand should benefit from such regulation for both new buildings and renovation projects.
The increased focus on climate change has elevated awareness as well as consumer and customer attention on sustainability and circularity of building materials. Since our products are made from basalt stone and recycled materials and because our stone wool is recyclable, we are in a good position to benefit from this trend.
Meanwhile, continuing urbanisation both in emerging and developed markets represents a big opportunity for ROCKWOOL.
Cities account for around 70 percent of the world's energy use and CO2 emissions, and therefore play a big role in the efforts to fight climate change. The use of insulation and other ROCKWOOL products in the construction and retrofitting of buildings is in this context an important means to that end.
As the global economic expansion slows, renovation offers cities a way to create multiple benefits, including jobs and energy savings for residents (pp. 36-37) while also delivering on climate promises.

Protecting residents against noise pollution they experience in densely populated cities is another growth opportunity. Whether it's between walls of attached buildings or rooms within buildings, acoustic comfort contributes to human health and wellbeing.
ROCKWOOL is also pleased to see that fire safety is receiving greater attention among regulators and architects. The continued tightening of building regulation across the globe is a growth driver for ROCKWOOL products. The fire-resistant properties of stone wool insulation help prevent fires from spreading, which is especially important in urban and other population-dense areas. As society puts greater focus on circularity, the fact that our stone wool is a natural product and can be recycled is another advantage in the market.
The strength of stone wool in Systems segment All businesses in the Systems segment performed well during 2019, which lifted growth for the year to doubledigits and improved the EBIT margin.
Our acoustic tile business under the Rockfon brand, which offers superior acoustic performance, continued pursuing growth opportunities in the European and North American markets. During the year we entered into a legal settlement related to Rockfon in North America, positively affecting results by around EUR 10 million.
The introduction of a new range of high-quality façade panels supported a satisfactory growth for Rockpanel in the main markets in Benelux. Successful market penetration in more markets in Europe contributed to the good performance.
Lapinus stone wool offerings designed for reducing vibrations, noise and dust continued to gain support. While the friction-related business slowed down, the innovative water management solution under the Rockflow product line contributed to positive development for the year.

The benefits of our Grodan products supporting sustainable growing methods gained further traction during the year with growth in all markets. We see a greater awareness and interest in pesticide-free growing environments and experienced healthy growth in all markets including Russia and North America.

Outlook 2020 At the start of a new decade, we are preparing ourselves for another year of volatility especially around the large market in Germany and the non-residential segment in eastern Europe and Asia. Continued governmental incentives in France for energy efficiency is vital for the 2020 growth plan as is the conversion to stone wool solutions in the UK market.

Overall, we see the same level of uncertainties affecting the construction markets as in the second half of 2019, which is confirmed by a less optimistic forecast from Euroconstruct, with a flat new housing market and a modest growth limited to non-residential activities.

If trade tensions were to ease, it could contribute to a recovery of growth in Asia and part of the European industrial sector, especially Germany.

The release of the European Commission's Green Deal framework in December is an encouraging development aimed at achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050. Together with the European Investment Bank's co-financing commitments (up to 75 percent on building renovation projects), EU member states are expected to announce more detailed energy efficiency plans, which over time could help accelerate the renovation of building stocks and increase the demand for insulation.

Stone wool production capacity in Europe has increased, both from our own opening of new stone wool manufacturing lines as well as from other stone wool producers. While we are confident about long-term

demand for stone wool products, we recognise that the additional availability of stone wool in the coming year could increase competition in certain market segments and geographies.
We forecast low single-digit sales growth in local currencies for 2020, with growth opportunities for France, the United Kingdom and North America as well as Systems segment, though still with some uncertainties for markets in Germany, eastern Europe and Asia.
The focus for our operational excellence programme will be on productivity. At the same time, we have several new manufacturing lines, which will improve productivity and optimise our logistics footprint.
With a significant number of new production lines coming online, the level of depreciation will increase for 2020. We estimate the increased depreciation will affect EBIT margin by around one percentage point.
Inflation on input costs was reduced during the second half of 2019, and we forecast a similar picture for the coming year.
All in all, we predict an EBIT margin of around 12 percent, which is comparable to 2019, when adjusting for additional depreciation and start-up costs in Germany and costs in connection with the melter conversion in Norway.
Investment level excluding acquisitions will remain high during 2020 at around EUR 400 million. The main investments include capacity expansion in Germany, which will come online during the second quarter and the new factory in the United States, planned to open in early 2021.

Case study

A big building with a small footprint

Despite covering an area the size of 20 football fields, the Lagoh Shopping Centre and leisure complex in sunny Seville, Spain, won't be sweating the energy bills.
From design to construction, the energy efficiency, sustainability and circularity of the building were top priorities for owners, Lar España. It received a "Very Good" BREEAM rating in the design phase and expects the same result now that it is complete.
Among its credentials, the building operates on 100 percent certified renewable energy and was built with all natural or recyclable materials. This includes ROCKWOOL stone wool insulation and Rockpanel cladding that line the facades as well as 50,000 m2 of double-density insulation panels under its green roof.

This insulation wrapper prevents the spread of fire, sharply lowers energy consumption and keeps the sounds of traffic from the nearby highways out of the building and from travelling between the shopping and leisure areas and cinemas. For moviegoers, Rockfon acoustic tiles help keep the sounds of the movies from blending together as noise.
"We set out to build a world-class shopping centre for Seville that would also meet the highest standards for sustainability, circularity and energy efficiency", says José Antonio García Agüera, Head of Retail Development, Lar España. "ROCKWOOL's stone wool products help us achieve all of those while also optimising the fire safety and comfort of the building for the nearly 14 million guests we expect to visit Lagoh each year".

Overall, we saw a satisfactory demand for our thermally efficient and fire-safe stone wool insulation and a clear need for constructing new energy efficient buildings and renovating the existing building stock to mitigate climate change and achieve the UN climate-related goals.
In 2019, ROCKWOOL Building Insulation showed modest growth compared to 2018. We saw mixed market conditions across countries and our different insulation applications.
On one hand, we saw solid growth in South West Europe driven by demand for energy efficiency improvements supported by regulatory schemes. France is a good example, where powerful policies are driving energy efficiency and increasing the role of energy renovation. In the United Kindowm, we also saw an increasingly strong public demand for non-combustible insulation. At the same time, we saw declining or negative growth rates for instance in Germany, due to low

economic activity and a tight labour market, and in Eastern Europe and Asia, where the uncertainty in the commercial marketplace was affected in particular by the project business.

The construction markets in North America and Russia continued to grow, but geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions led to slower growth rates in Asia in 2019 compared to what we have seen in recent years.

Within Technical Insulation we saw higher uncertainty in the process industry, particularly in Europe and Asia, leading to a less favourable development in this business area, while again in 2019 we saw significant growth in the sandwich panel market, where the conversion to non-combustible insulation continues.

A gem in the heart of Moscow

It may resemble a futuristic spacecraft, but the stunning VTB Arena has taken great care to preserve its ties to history. The reconstructed and refurbished home of FC Dynamo Moscow, one of Russia's most storied football clubs, is built on top of the original 1928 stadium's perimeter wall, with a statue of legendary goalkeeper, Lev Yashin, gracing the main entrance.
The stadium, part of the spectacular project referred to as VTB Arena Park, is much more than a world-class football stadium. The 300,000 m2 project also includes the Dynamo hockey rink--next door and under the same roof as the football--as well as a park, shopping and entertainment centre, office and apartment buildings, five-star hotel, and an underground parking garage with 1,600 spaces.
The project's size and prestige--it has received several design awards--required that only the best materials could be considered, with fire safety,

energy efficiency, thermal insulation and noise reduction high on the list of the owners' priorities.
As a primary supplier, ROCKWOOL is proud to have a variety of its stone wool products installed across all VTB Arena Park spaces. This includes more than 130,000 m2 of several types of stone wool insulation in the floors, walls and roof. In addition, 70,000 m2 of stone wool technical insulation cover heating pipes and ductwork, ensuring the building's utility infrastructure is fire-safe and doesn't leak precious heat energy used to keep visitors warm in Russia's cold winters.
"If you look at the diversity of the spaces in this complex, combined with the millions of people expected to use them each year, helping the owners achieve a high level of fire safety, energy efficiency and comfort is quite rewarding, especially for such an important project like this", says Marina Potoker, Managing Director, ROCKWOOL Russia.

In Brussels, a symbol of circularity

As remarkable as the building will be when completed in 2023, the most impressive feature of Befimmo's ZIN project in Brussels might be how it is built.
Circularity and sustainability were dual aims of the Flemish authorities when they awarded Befimmo the public tender for the redevelopment of the nearly 50-year old towers known as WTC 1 and WTC 2. Befimmo's ZIN project will reuse or recycle as much of these existing towers and materials as possible, and where new materials are needed, they should be recyclable.
The results will be impressive: nearly 65 percent of the two existing towers will be maintained as part of the structure of the new building, another 0.5 percent of the materials will be reused in the

project or somewhere else, and about 30 percent will be recycled, including thousands of tonnes of materials like aluminium, concrete and glass.
ROCKWOOL has a key role in this recycling effort. Through its own recycling service, ROCKWOOL removed 23,000 m2 (45 tonnes) of Rockfon acoustic ceiling tiles from the existing buildings and took them to ROCKWOOL's factory in Roermond, the Netherlands, where they will be used to make new stone wool products.
When finished, ZIN will be an exemplar of circular design, energy efficiency, fire safety and good acoustics. These characteristics will be key to the building's multi-purpose use, which will include office space for 3,900 Flemish officials, hotel rooms and apartments as well as public spaces on the ground floor.

The internet of peppers

Business is good for Antoni de Bruin. The Dutchman recently doubled the size of his sweet pepper company, ACB Agro, in Klazienaveen, the Netherlands, from three to six hectares. And with the help of a suite of Grodan technology, he's now expanding into consulting for other growers.
Like his parents before him, de Bruin grows his sweet peppers in Grodan stone wool instead of soil or other growing media, finding it easier to manage with better quality produce, higher yields and a lower environmental impact. The big difference between the generations is the younger de Bruin's use of technology.
Antoni started using Grodan's GroSens water and nutrient metres a few years ago to precisely manage the irrigation of his pepper crop. More recently he's moved his whole operation on to Grodan's greenhouse management software platform, e-Gro.

With one dashboard, e-Gro lets Antoni see a complete picture of his peppers, from root zone irrigation information to greenhouse climate data, harvest and crop data and more. All of this in realtime from anywhere he can connect to the internet. "I can check how my crops are doing from my phone or computer, and even change settings if I need to", says de Bruin.
This freedom has allowed him to develop another business, consulting to other growers in Germany and Canada. "I learn a lot about my own business from getting out and meeting with other growers and I couldn't do both without Grodan's technology. Growing and consulting reinforce each other and I believe that my customers appreciate the combination".

We manufacture board material mostly used in ventilated constructions, for façade cladding, roof detailing, soffits and fascia. Our cladding and other boards are robust and flexible, and fit perfectly with modern architectural trends such as organic shapes and sustainability, while also providing cost efficiency and short installation times.
In early 2019, Rockpanel launched a fire safety awareness campaign across Europe, designed to increase the appreciation of the important role that non-combustible products, like the ones offered by Rockpanel, play in the marketplace.
A shortage of labour to refurbish at-risk buildings and insufficiently ambitious national regulations on the use of noncombustibles in some markets are limiting factors. Fortunately, we see more stakeholders getting involved in this transition, which we expect to gain momentum.
All Rockpanel boards are as durable as stone, easy to cut, and resistant to the effects of moisture, temperature and the weather

Rockpanel also intensified its focus on online marketing and digitalisation in 2019, resulting in strong growth in incoming leads. As a result, we also expanded our sales department to follow up on these opportunities and serve customers better.
After successful entry into Sweden in 2019, we are looking for more opportunities to expand. We also launched our new concealed fixing system in our high-end segment, Rockpanel Premium, which are products that offer customers all the design and technical possibilities of Rockpanel in one product.

From down-and-out to dashing

Named one of London's "best places to live" for the last five years by the Sunday Times, the Bermondsey neighbourhood is a fine example of the city's transformation in recent years.
Once a rundown part of the city, residential and commercial buildings with poor energy efficiency and insufficient fire safety performance are being renovated or demolished and replaced, making the neighbourhood more attractive for residents and safer against the risk of fire.
The Eyot House apartment building in the Bermondsey Spa area is a good example of this transformation. The Hyde Group, a housing association leading much of the neighbourhood's well-publicised rejuvenation, asked Rockpanel to completely replace the external façade of the seven-story building for safety and design reasons.

Per the United Kingdom's 2018 fire safety regulations, developed in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, all buildings over 18 metres tall must have exterior cladding systems made of non-combustible materials.
Importantly, all residents could stay in their homes during the renovation of the building, limiting discomfort and disruption to their lives and helping the owner avoid relocation costs.
"Rockpanel was specified as the only nonaluminium, fire safe A2-rated product able to meet our design brief, being light, flexible and a great aesthetic choice in terms of colour and surface finish", says Daniel Assander, designer and contract administrator of the project from Martin Arnold consultancy.

Rain, rain, come this way

The newly renovated Langelands Plads square doesn't look like a critical piece of Copenhagen's anti-flooding defences. And that's the intention.
The square, located in Frederiksberg on the border with Copenhagen municipality, is one of 300 so-called "dual use" projects Copenhagen has prioritised over the next 20 years to adapt existing parks, playgrounds and other spaces so that they also help protect against flooding caused by extreme rains. It's a key part of what the city refers to as its Cloudburst Management Plan.
Expanding sewers is one part of the plan, but the main focus is on projects like Langelands Plads that create spaces to help keep excess storm water from reaching sewers in the first place while also improving quality of life for residents ­ and in the long-term, bolstering property values and city tax revenues.

How? Underneath the surface of Langelands Plads and surrounding roads is 400 m3 of Rockflow, a buffer of specially engineered stone wool, with connections to a system of pipes, drains and gullies that lead the water to the sewer.
Heavy rains are quickly absorbed and gradually discharged over the following 24-hours into the sewer system (or soil in some cases). The stone wool in a Rockflow system can absorb 95 percent of its volume in water. (Note: stone wool made for insulation purposes does the opposite, it repels water.)
"Before, we talked about once-in-a-hundred-years rain events, but those can happen three times a year now", says Ole Larsen, Director of CALL Copenhagen, an organisation advising the city of Copenhagen and others in Denmark on climate adaptation and green growth. "Rockflow gives us better opportunities to build a sustainable city that is climate ready", he says.

Climate change and energy efficiency Our products help save energy and combat climate change on a large scale and we will continue to work to increase positive climate impact even more, through new product innovation.
We are committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our production and have set a goal to reduce carbon intensity by 20 percent by 2030 compared to 2015.
In addition to capital investments, we focus on leadership, training, knowledge-sharing and awareness programmes to create a culture of continuous improvement in energy efficiency that will facilitate reaching our CO2 goal.
Part of our decarbonisation commitment is to use, where feasible, less carbon-intensive fuels in ROCKWOOL production facilities. In May 2019, we announced a project to install electric melter technology at our production facility in Moss, Norway. The innovation project, a EUR 34 million investment, is in partnership with Enova, a public company owned by Norway's Ministry of Climate and Environment.
Once it begins operations in H2 2020, CO2 emissions from the Moss facility are expected to decline 80 percent. It will be the largest electric melting furnace in the Group thus far and is expected to provide valuable learnings and experience for ROCKWOOL as we continue efforts to decarbonise operations.

In 2019, ROCKWOOL signed on as a supporter for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. We live up to these recommendations by disclosing climate-related risks, opportunities, targets and emissions to CDP and have initiated quarterly ESG calls with investment analysts to facilitate dialogue about those risks and opportunities, among other things.
We also have a goal to improve energy efficiency in our non-renovated office buildings by 75 percent by 2030, compared to 2015. This is an ambitious but necessary goal that we are on our way to achieving. The deep renovation of our office in Gladbeck, Germany, designed to improve energy efficiency by more than 80 percent, is one example of an investment approved to support this goal and shows how our products can significantly improve energy efficiency of older buildings.
Renovation is our preferred approach to reaching our energy efficiency targets. Deep renovation of our offices will reduce the use of resources and carbon emissions associated with demolition and new build. In some instances, the economic payback of a deep renovation may not be attractive, but we might choose to pursue it anyway because of the many other benefits it creates, such as creating healthier and safer work environments or achieving broader sustainability goals.
Environmental management We continuously aim to minimise the impacts of our processes on people and the environment. When we are

building new production facilities or expanding existing ones, we use state-of-the-art abatement technology.
We conduct internal audits, and as part of our ISO certifications we are externally audited to improve the safety, health and environmental performance and awareness across the Group.
By the end of 2019, 80 percent of our stone wool production facilities had at least one external certification within safety, health, environment or energy management and several were certified across all areas.
Water and waste We have a goal to reduce waste from operations going to landfill by 85 percent by 2030 compared to 2015. In 2019, four new recycling plants were installed at our Asian and Russian factories. These investments are driving a significant reduction in the waste sent to landfill.
The new electric melter in Moss, Norway will also have a significant effect on this target with an estimated reduction of up to 95 percent in waste to landfill for this site.
We are implementing more systematic water management at all factories. In 2019, work continued with water mapping and installation of additional water meters. This will help drive progress on our Group Sustainability goal in 2030 to reduce water consumption per tonne of product by 20 percent compared to 2015.

Reclaimed waste ROCKWOOL has a goal to offer recycling services for our products in 30 countries by 2030. We are also tracking our performance against an interim goal to have product recycling services in 15 countries by 2022.
In 2018, we took a significant step forward, as we deployed product recycling programmes in five additional countries, bringing the total number of countries with a product recycling service programme to 10. In 2019, we began preparations to expand recycling services in additional countries.
Stakeholder engagement ROCKWOOL's factories are essential to the Group's success, as is maintaining constructive, positive relations in the communities around our facilities. This applies for greenfield and existing facilities. Our factories create local employment and investment in the host communities, and we always work to create and maintain positive relations with community members, their representatives, and other stakeholders.
Health and Safety As an international industrial company, there is an inherent level of safety risk for all our employees, whether at production sites, in our offices or while traveling. We take the management of this risk seriously and continuously work to create safe and healthy work places and conditions for all employees and people working with us across the world.

Sadly, in February, we experienced a fatal accident at the construction site for a new production facility in Romania. An employee from a local sub-contractor died in a fall from height. Following this accident, we increased supervision of subcontractors by direct personnel from ROCKWOOL, focusing on the daily contractor management process and sharing the findings with all production facilities.
This is the second consecutive year we had a fatality following an accidental fall. In 2019, we put extra efforts into increasing awareness of our standards for working at heights and roof protection. All production facilities have created action plans for ensuring implementation of the standards, and an increased focus will be placed on working at heights during safety audits.
In March 2020, ROCKWOOL Group will publish its Group Sustainability Report with detailed information on the Group's sustainability performance.
Please go to www.rockwoolgroup.com/sustainability for more information.

We have a goal of zero fatalities for people working with and for us and have an ambition to incrementally reduce the Lost Time Incident (LTI) rate by 10 percent every year. In 2019, we reduced our LTI rate by 17 percent.

Bending the curve on carbon emissions

The global imperative to act on climate change has never been more important. Cities are on the front lines ­ both as a source and as a key solution to a substantial part of the climate challenge.
Although urban areas occupy only about three percent of the world's land surface, their carbon footprint is enormous and continues to grow as more people move to cities. Cities account for around 70 percent of the world's energy use and CO2 emissions, most of it from buildings.1 Reducing and decarbonising the energy consumption of new and existing buildings is therefore critical for tackling the climate challenge.
The role of energy efficiency With growing populations and rising incomes, global primary energy use will likely double in this century.2 Effective management of the built environment is thus becoming increasingly important in reducing CO2 emissions.
For cities, it's an opportunity to lead a rapid transition toward more energy-efficient and climate-friendly buildings and make a major contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement's climate goals.
There are solutions readily available ­ the most important of which is energy renovation. Optimising the energy efficiency of existing buildings could provide up to 55 percent of GHG emission reductions needed to put cities on a 1.5°C pathway through 2030.3
Three different cities, one common solution While there is huge potential across all urban environments

to drastically improve energy efficiency, the specific challenges facing individual cities can vary substantially. Take New York City, Copenhagen and Milan. Each is very different in terms of size, building stock and the main challenges related to urbanisation.
What they have in common is they each see energy renovation of their building stock as a major part of the climate solution. And, municipal leaders in these cities realise that in addition to energy and climate benefits, there are also multiple social and economic benefits to building renovation ­ they just need help calculating them.
Counting the benefits of renovation That's where we come in. ROCKWOOL and the C40 have developed a toolkit that enables cities to calculate the environmental, social and economic benefits of energy renovation ­ and to show that renovating for energy efficiency is highly cost-effective.
With this tool, urban stakeholders can make a stronger case for energy renovation, facilitate a better dialogue with partners to unlock funding, and more rapidly scale up energy renovation actions.
Particularly when preparing city-led renovation programmes, the additional positive benefits can be instrumental in gaining buy-in from multiple public and private stakeholders.
Our hope is that the toolkit will contribute to accelerating building renovation rates in C40 cities and elsewhere ­ to the benefit of local populations as well as the global environment.

Milan, New York and Copenhagen. Three iconic and very different cities that share a common goal: reducing their environmental impact while continuing to be attractive places to live, work and play.
All three cities tested the ROCKWOOL/C40 renovation toolkit to investigate what deep renovation could accomplish in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits. The data from these pilots was then extrapolated to estimate what the impacts would be at a larger scale.

Business integrity

Our Code of Conduct serves as our most important instrument to communicate and provide guidance on ROCKWOOL Group's way of doing business with integrity. The Code of Conduct includes Group policies related to anti-corruption, gifts and hospitality, conflict of interest, competition law, data privacy, human rights and labour rights, health and safety, and environment.
As part of the enrolment package, new employees are asked to complete the Code of Conduct e-learning to focus attention from the outset on the importance of the Code of Conduct.
Beginning 2019, approximately 6,000 targeted employees concluded the new Code of Conduct e-learning. The focus of the e-learning was on ethical behaviour in the workplace, anti-corruption (including our new gift and hospitality policy), conflict of interest and how to report concerns. The e-learning programme was well-received by employees and will be repeated in 2020/21.
Also in 2019, as part of the Code of Conduct awareness programme, face-to-face training in competition law

was organised by local ROCKWOOL companies in local languages. The awareness training complemented the competition law e-learning concluded in 2018.
Tackling corruption ROCKWOOL Group has zero tolerance towards any kind of fraud, corruption, bribery and facilitation payments. The anti-corruption policy also applies to suppliers, agents and other third-parties. In 2019 a new policy on the use of agents was adopted. The focus was on compliance in relation to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Use of agents and compliance with the policy will form part of the internal audits.
In 2018, the Group adopted a new policy and manual on gifts and hospitality. It concerns the appropriate use of gifts and hospitality and respecting the required approval levels. In 2019 a new gift and hospitality register was launched. Use of gifts and hospitality over a certain amount requires registration and approval by relevant management level. The register allows monitoring and reporting to the Integrity Committee on the use of gifts and hospitality in the Group.
The 2018 initiative concerning anti-corruption and bribery training in four high-risk countries was completed in Q1 2019. It involved face-to-face training of employees in

In 2019, we initiated the process of replacing our existing whistleblower system. Increased requirements in relation to data privacy and the use of new technologies warranted the replacement of the existing setup.
sales, marketing, procurement, finance, HR, and other departments.
Whistleblower system All employees are encouraged and required to report knowledge or suspicion of non-compliance with the ROCKWOOL Code of Conduct to management, the Group Integrity Officer or through the whistleblower procedure. We do not accept any form of negative employment consequences for employees reporting in good faith actual or suspected non-compliance.

In 2019 a total of 13 cases were reported, compared to 15 in 2018. All reported integrity and whistleblower cases are investigated.

reported by the targeted employees themselves. This indicates that the focus on anti-corruption training has increased awareness. The new whistleblower system will simplify reporting of whistleblower cases for both employees and third parties and allow reporting of cases in local language via the web or mobile app.
The Management and our Group Integrity Officer continue to promote and increase the awareness and knowledge of business ethics and the whistleblower arrangement in ROCKWOOL Group, using tools like the new e-learning course.
The Audit Committee is informed about all integrity and whistleblower cases. To create awareness of unethical behaviour and underline the Group's zero-tolerance policy, a summary of integrity cases is communicated to all employees on Group intranet to make sure that we learn from past mistakes and breaches.
Respecting human rights In 2019 we continued to scrutinise our internal processes with respect to due diligence of human rights in our supply chain.
Supply chain due diligence We acknowledge there is a risk connected with the categories and countries we engage with in terms of compliance with international, national and local laws and guidelines relating to employment, environmental and manufacturing practices as well as ethics and bribery, particularly in relation to sustainable sourcing.

During 2019, we evaluated the sustainability risk related to three overall areas: human rights and labour rights; environment; and anti-corruption and bribery across the countries in which we currently operate and the type of materials and services we procure. This has resulted in a risk matrix that we will use for assessing new suppliers as well as to re-assess existing suppliers.
We expect to implement the new risk matrix in the existing population of suppliers within the identified high-risk categories in 2020.
Privacy and data protection Privacy compliance is essential to gaining and maintaining the trust of our employees, customers and suppliers. A global data privacy organisation with a regional presence ensures support and governance.
To enable our employees to act in accordance with their daily work requirements, our privacy compliance programme includes a privacy policy, a privacy manual and a handbook with guidelines for selected business areas as well as specialised templates and privacy notices. Additional e-learning has been targeted at employees in functions with highest potential risk.

The reported cases involved fraud, bribery, unethical behaviour or were related to SHE (safety, health and environment). Of the 13 cases, nine resulted in corrective actions ranging from dismissal of employees to changes in internal procedures.

ROCKWOOL's Supplier Code of Conduct is designed to mitigate this risk by explaining our expectations to the suppliers. Furthermore, ROCKWOOL Group expects our suppliers to enforce the same guidelines within their supply chain.

In relation to bribery, the two reported cases were attempts to bribe ROCKWOOL employees and were

Our people

Attracting and retaining talents Attracting and retaining the right employees with the right skills and mindset continues to be a focus area for ROCKWOOL Group. During 2019, we initiated several projects to further develop our ability to do just that, including updating the recruitment process and tools. Open positions are now posted at the Group website, and in 2020 we will ensure that we have a global onboarding process that supports the business in promoting
ROCKWOOL Group Annual Report 2019

the company culture, history and knowledge and further enables internal talent development. In addition, we are now globally aligned on our internal and external Employer Brand positions, including on the messaging we use to attract future employees and retain existing ones.
Engaging our employees We are continuously striving to improve the engagement level of our employees. In 2019, we implemented a new way of conducting our annual Employee Engagement Survey, which enabled leaders across the Group to gain a better understanding of the engagement status and how to further improve this.
The areas covered in the survey include: satisfaction and motivation, loyalty, immediate manager, senior management, co-operation, working conditions, job content, remuneration, learning and development and safety. New in 2019 was the fact that all employees -- office-based as well as production-based -- answered the same questionnaire online. The participation ratio across the Group was at an all-time high.
#iRockGlobalGoals Idea Challenge 2019: 600 ideas, 8 awards and a lot of positive energy

The areas where we scored high in comparison to the external benchmarks are Loyalty, Reputation and Job content. Immediate manager scores vary substantially, with a big proportion of our employees being satisfied with their immediate manager, while still leaving room for improvement in the lowest quartile of managers.
We can see that across the Group, we are slightly below the external High-Performance Norm benchmarks, though with some very positive and encouraging scores in certain areas of the organisation.
Developing our people In ROCKWOOL, we offer targeted learning and development opportunities to our employees. In 2019, we nominated the third group of participants in the Operational Excellence Programme, now a well-established Group programme supporting the development of the next generation of ROCKWOOL leaders. During the year, we also introduced changes to our performance management process, adding greater flexibility, including creating opportunities to adapt goals and provide more frequent feedback.
Reigniting The ROCKWOOL Way As a new decade begins, we have updated and relaunched the same strong values foundation that has brought us to the present to carry us through the years to come. The ROCKWOOL Way is based on our management principles

In 2018, Group Management set a target for 2020 of 25 to 35 percent female leaders in executive and middle management positions. In 2019, 27 percent of leaders in executive and middle management positions were women, the same as in 2018. Further, 29 percent of newly hired middle managers were women, on par with the level in 2017 after a peak year (39 percent) in 2018.

and our four values: Ambition, Integrity, Responsibility and Efficiency, while safeguarding a balanced management approach that leads to good, sustainable results.
Supporting our employees We are committed to provide equal opportunities, promote diversity, and work against all forms of discrimination among our employees. Promoting and raising awareness of policies and procedures is important and can be challenging in a global, culturally diverse organisation.
Reflecting the global nature of our company, 11,700 ROCKWOOL employees work in 39 countries.

Women in management It is our ambition to have a diverse working environment, and we are continuously working to increase diversity in management teams as well as Group functions.
As the industry has traditionally been male dominated, our primary focus has been to increase the number of women in different levels of management. While the gender split across the Group has been relatively stable the last few years with a 18/82 ratio of females to males, the proportion of females is higher at executive and middle management levels.

To support increased diversity among our leaders, we are maintaining several Group policies including, for example, a non-tolerance clause on harassment, and a whistleblower channel allowing all employees to anonymously initiate any type of discrimination or harassment case. In 2019, we have also further developed our recruitment process globally to strengthen the opportunities for internal candidates to search and apply for career opportunities across the Group, which supports equal opportunity to be considered for openings.
Additionally, we have a target (also for ROCKWOOL A/S, in Denmark) to have at least one shareholder-elected female member of the Board of Directors by end 2020. In 2019, the ROCKWOOL Board of Directors had only male members elected by the shareholders, as there was no change in the year. ROCKWOOL A/S had one female member of the Board.

Risk management

Systems and processes
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the Group's risk exposure is consistent with the targeted risk profile and evaluates that appropriate awareness and management processes are in place. Managing the risk process is part of the Chief Financial Officer's area of responsibility and includes providing regular updates to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors.
All managing directors of our subsidiaries and Group functional heads must ensure that a risk review within their areas of responsibility is conducted at least once a year; and that risks are discussed, described, scored for severity and likelihood, and quantified in terms such as predicted financial impact.
Appropriate mitigating actions for identified risks are proposed by the company or Group function and studiously evaluated to ensure effective risk management at Group level. The Group has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee, consisting of members from business area and Group functions. The committee is responsible for reviewing and updating the internal risk management framework and for implementing related processes.
Deep-dives into the Group's top risks are selected by the Audit Committee and presented by the risk owner for the Risk Committee, Group Management and finally to the Audit Committee and the Board. With these systems and processes, the Group identifies and mitigates, though cannot always eliminate, risks. The objective is to ensure that any residual risks are at an acceptable level.

Risks
IT security Like all other companies, ROCKWOOL Group is exposed to potential breaches of our IT infrastructure.
With increased digitalisation of business processes, the Group is vulnerable to disruptions of operations and is increasingly engaged in the protection of data and intellectual property.
IT security has a high priority within the Group. Key objectives include preventing digital theft of intellectual property; limiting and quickly rectifying operational disruptions; and protecting the rights of external and internal data subjects. Also high on the IT security agenda is the protection of consumers against misinformation or misuse of ROCKWOOL brands.
Finally, we strive to safeguard shareholders against valuedestroying cyber-attacks on ROCKWOOL brands and products or on ROCKWOOL Group's and its partners' value-delivery systems.
Group IT focuses on mitigating risks based on our own assessments as well as external IT auditors' findings, and dedicated tests of specific IT areas done by external experts. Part of this mitigation includes heightening IT security, testing disaster-recovery plans and improving data flow and network activity monitoring.
Competition law compliance Guided by our ethical values and Code of Conduct,

Managing risk is a natural part of doing business in the Group.

Corporate governance

Corporate governance at ROCKWOOL Group regulates the interaction among shareholders, the Board of Directors, and Group Management, with the aim to ensure optimal operational performance while at the same time securing an appropriate level of accountability and transparency of our business practices.
Organisation The supervision and management of ROCKWOOL Group is divided among the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of shareholders, the Board of Directors (with well-defined committees), and Group Management.
The Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting is the supreme body of the corporate governance structure and elects the Board of Directors as well as independent auditors. The Annual General Meeting approves any changes to the articles of association and to the capital structure, including any issuance of new shares. The company is not aware of shareholder agreements containing pre-emption rights or restrictions on voting rights. There is an agreement among members of the founding Kähler family to meet regularly to discuss their interests in the company, including items at AGMs, but there is no requirement for them to vote jointly.
The Board of Directors The Board of Directors outlines the overall purpose and strategy of the company and ensures that the business development is on track toward agreed short- and longterm goals. The majority of the members of the Board of

Directors are non-executive members in accordance with the Danish Companies Act.
The Board of Directors today consists of nine members. Six are elected by shareholders at the AGMs for a period of one year and may be re-elected. Of these, four members, including the chairman, are deemed independent per the Danish Recommendations on Corporate Governance. Three members are elected by employees, for a period of four years, pursuant to the Danish Companies Act. The next election is in 2022.
The Board of Directors conducts an annual evaluation facilitated by an external consultancy firm. Based on this year's evaluation, the Board concluded that its present composition is appropriate and sufficient for it to perform its tasks. As for the special competences of each Board member, reference is made to the CVs listed on the website, www.rockwoolgroup.com/about-us/people.
Group Management The CEO, together with his Group Management team, is responsible for the day-to-day management, strategy execution and timely reporting to the Board of Directors. The team currently consists of nine executives, of which the CEO and CFO are the registered directors with the Danish Business Authority.
Board Chairmanship and Committees Three substructures have been established by the Board of Directors.

The Chairmanship The Board of Directors has established a Chairmanship consisting of the Chairman and the two Deputy Chairmen. They prepare the Board meetings and undertake several functions of a nomination committee.
Audit Committee The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee consisting of three members. The majority of its members are independent. The Audit Committee monitors accounting and audit policies plus conditions which, if determined by the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee, should be subject to thorough evaluation. Further, the Audit Committee evaluates internal control and risk systems.
Remuneration Committee The Board of Directors has appointed a Remuneration Committee consisting of three of its members, the majority of whom are independent.
The Remuneration Committee ensures that ROCKWOOL Group maintains and that the Board of Directors adopts a Remuneration Policy concerning the remuneration of the company's Board of Directors and Registered Directors.
The remuneration policy and any material change thereto shall be submitted to the shareholders for approval at least every four years. A revised Remuneration Policy, which replaces the existing policy and guidelines for incentivebased remuneration, will be submitted for approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.

The Remuneration Committee: ­Evaluates and makes recommendations for the
remuneration of the Board of Directors, which are subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM. ­Is authorised by the Board of Directors to approve remuneration for Registered Directors and the rest of Group Management. ­Ensures that the company maintains Group-level variable pay schemes that support the business' success and value creation, short- and long-term. ­Prepares an annual Remuneration Report outlining the remuneration paid to the Board of Directors and Registered Directors.
As of the AGM in 2021, the Remuneration Report will be subject to a non-binding advisory vote from the shareholders.
Internal control Control environment ROCKWOOL Group considers strong internal control to be an essential management tool. The control environment in ROCKWOOL Group is based on clear guidelines and accountability and a continuous effort to maintain an appropriate control environment with due consideration of materiality and risk.
The entire structure of the Group is designed based on the Group's commercial activities with a clear segregation of management responsibilities.

All Group policies are approved by Group Management and assigned to one Group Management member overseeing implementation throughout the line organisation. Policies and manuals have been adopted within all essential areas of operation, legal compliance and financial reporting.
Control activities Minimum requirements of internal controls are stipulated in ROCKWOOL Group Standards, based on the risks identified. The control activities include procedures for authorisation, approval, reconciliation and separation of functions. The control system includes both manual and automated controls.
The local management teams are responsible for ensuring that the control environment in each local entity is sufficient to meet local and Group requirements.
Information and communication ROCKWOOL Group has established standardised information and reporting systems to identify, collect and communicate relevant information and reports on an ongoing basis and on all levels to facilitate an effective, reliable workflow. In addition, an in-depth business review is performed each quarter with participation of relevant members of Group Management.
The Group's position on risk management and changes in the reporting requirements is regularly communicated at financial meetings for the local finance directors, through the Group intranet and dialogue.

Monitoring The internal control systems in relation to the presentation of financial statements are monitored at various levels e.g. monthly reports to Group Management on segments and markets and by regular control visits to the local entities. In addition, the Group's Integrity Committee consisting of the CEO, CFO, a member of Group Management, the Group General Counsel and Group Integrity Officer, monitor integrity compliance and launch appropriate new initiatives to constantly improve compliance. The Integrity Committee furthermore reports on integrity issues to the Audit Committee.
Recommendations As a Danish listed company, we are guided by the recommendations issued by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. The company is generally in compliance with such recommendations but has, in four cases, chosen to differ as described below. The variations are generally due to company-specific views on the recommendations to optimise value for its shareholders.
The company complies with recommendation 3.1.5. The company's Board of Directors will, however, not exclude that a situation can arise, where the Board of Directors may wish to constitute itself with a former member of the company's management as Chairman or Deputy Chairman.
ROCKWOOL Group publishes its statutory report on Corporate Governance for the financial year 2019 cf. the Danish Financial Statements Act §107b on the company's website, including a detailed description of

the Board of Directors' consideration regarding all the recommendations. The statutory report on Corporate Governance can be found at www.rockwoolgroup.com/ about-us/corporate-governance/.
Exceptions To a broad extent, the company is following the Committee on Corporate Governance's recommendations, except for the following four sub-recommendations, where the company has assessed that its present set-up is more appropriate:
3.1.3 Recommendation The Committee recommends that the selection and nomination of candidates for the Board of Directors be carried out through a thoroughly transparent process approved by the overall Board of Directors.
Explanation The Board of Directors has authorised the Chairmanship to nominate qualified candidates to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will then evaluate the candidates before it recommends them for election at the Annual General Meeting.
3.3.2 Recommendation The Committee recommends that the management report includes information about the number of shares, options, warrants and similar in the company, and other Group companies, owned by each member of the Board of Directors, as well as changes in the portfolio of the member of the securities mentioned that have occurred during the financial year.

Explanation The company considers the portfolio of shares, options warrants and similar in the company of each member of the Board of Directors to be a private matter, and it is the company's judgement that disclosure of such information will not add additional value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Board member remuneration does not include share-based elements.
3.4.6 Recommendation The Committee recommends that the Board of Directors establish a nomination committee.
Explanation The Board of Directors has not established a nomination committee. Instead, the Chairmanship performs duties recommended concerning the candidates for the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors selects candidates to the positions as CEO and other Registered Directors based on their qualifications.
4.2.3 Recommendation The Committee recommends that the company prepares a remuneration report that includes information on the total remuneration received by each member of the Board of Directors and the executive board from the company and other companies in the Group and associated companies for the last three years, including information on the most important content of retention and resignation arrangements and that the correlation between the remuneration and company strategy and relevant related goals be explained.

Explanation The remuneration of each member of the Group Management is seen to be a private matter and it is the company's judgement that disclosure of the remuneration paid to each individual member of Group Management will not add additional value for shareholders and other stakeholders.
The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and committees is available on p. 48 and our website.

The aim of our tax policy is to reflect and support our business by ensuring a sustainable tax rate, mitigating tax risks and complying with rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

For example, we have applied for bilateral advance pricing agreements between Denmark and four key countries and once these are established our ambition is to expand this to other key markets.

In all tax matters, we apply the same values and integrity as in our general Code of Conduct by making sure that our primary focus is the ordinary operation of the Group. We only adopt tax positions that are defendable under full disclosure.
We are committed to being a responsible tax payer and avoid aggressive tax planning. We have a clear and transparent corporate structure with no contrived entities or structures.
There are many transactions among ROCKWOOL Group companies, and the transfer pricing policy for these transactions is driven by the activities undertaken and the value created in each part of our businesses. The key component in our profit allocation is our transfer pricing setup and methods in which we are committed to the principle of paying tax where value is created.

An advance pricing agreement is an up-front agreement between the tax authorities in two or more countries, covering the pricing methodologies for five tax years, thereby determining the level of taxable income for the countries in question. In addition to an open dialogue with tax authorities, we also participate and engage in tax matters through industry associations and other external bodies.
From time to time, ROCKWOOL Group is allocated different types of tax incentives. Tax incentives are government measures that are intended to influence business decision-making or to encourage businesses to invest by reducing the amount of tax they have to pay. Several of the territories in which we operate offer incentives of various kinds and we seek to use these incentives where they are aligned with our business and operational objectives.

Responsible tax We acknowledge that tax is an important part of society and an equally important part of responsible corporate citizenship. Tax matters and risks as well as our tax policy are governed by the Board of Directors and discussed on a regular basis with the Audit Committee.
Tax matters are operationally managed and monitored by the CFO and the Group Tax department in close relationship with the financial management of ROCKWOOL Group subsidiaries.

We acknowledge that international tax matters are increasingly complex and we are committed to assigning the necessary resources to ensure compliance with relevant tax laws and regulations.
ROCKWOOL Group is at the same time committed to being as transparent about its tax matters as can reasonably be expected and we pursue an open dialogue and relationship with tax authorities as a proactive approach to handle uncertainties.

Remuneration report

Remuneration of the Board of Directors and Group Management is based on the principles in our Remuneration Policy for the Board of Directors, Group Management and Senior Executives of ROCKWOOL International A/S and the separate General Guidelines for Incentive-Based Remuneration of Group Management of ROCKWOOL International A/S both approved at the Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2016. The guidelines are designed to ensure that remuneration for the target group is aligned to the company strategy and goals. In 2019, no revisions were made to the remuneration structures for executives.
Remuneration of the Board of Directors Board members receive a fixed annual base fee as approved at the Annual General Meeting each year. Members of the Board of Directors are not offered pension arrangements or any type of incentive-based remuneration.
An increase in the fees for the Board of Directors was approved at the Annual General Meeting in April 2019. The purpose of the increase was to align the remuneration of the board members with other Danish LargeCap companies. The previous update of the Board fees was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2016.

Remuneration of Group Management The remuneration package of Group Management includes base salary; variable pay in the form of short-term incentive schemes (annual bonus) and long-term incentive schemes (stock options or restricted share units); pension and other benefits, such as company car, free phone and internet.
The short-term variable part of the total remuneration (annual cash bonus) is dependent on achievement of financial targets for the Group as well as the relevant business area for Group Management members with profit and loss responsibility.

The long-term variable part of the total remuneration (stock options/restricted share units) is dependent on continuous service to the company.
The variable annual bonus can give up to maximum 40 percent of the base salary for all Group Management members. The long-term incentive programme is set to 20 percent of the base salary for Group Management, 30 percent for the CEO. Both vehicles are subject to a clawback in cases where an incentive payout was made based on data which proved to be materially inaccurate.
Share-based payments On 8 April 2019, the Restricted Share Units (RSUs) granted in April 2016 vested. At the time of vesting, the share price was DKK 1,566.
In 2019, a Restricted Share Unit allocation with a total fair value of EUR 2.3 million was granted after approval by the Board of Directors in accordance with the General Guidelines for Incentive-Based Remuneration of Group Management of ROCKWOOL International A/S. Similar to previous years, the RSUs were allocated to a group of 68 employees in leading positions including Group Management and are subject to a vesting period of three years. After the vesting period the shares are transferred to the participants, subject to continued employment with the ROCKWOOL Group in the vesting period.

Distribution It is ROCKWOOL International A/S's policy to pay out a stable dividend that is at least one-third of the net profit after tax. The intention is that the net debt should be maximum of one time the EBITDA, with due regard to the company's long-term financing requirements.
After assessing the outlook for the economic cycle, investment plans, and structural business opportunities, and considering the dividend policy, the company can further decide to initiate share buy-backs to adjust the capital structure.
At the Annual General Meeting on 1 April 2020, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of DKK 32.00 per share for the financial year 2019 (2018: DKK 29.90). This is equal to one-third of the net profit after tax for 2019, and will be paid out in DKK. The dividend payment occurs three banking days after the Annual General Meeting.
Further, the company will on 6 February 2020 initiate a share buy-back programme up to an amount of EUR 80 million, to be completed within the following 12 months, remaining within the authority granted by the Annual General Meeting to purchase up to 10 percent of the shares and assuming that this mandate will be extended at the Annual General Meeting on 1 April 2020. The shares will be purchased in accordance with the Safe Harbour Regulation and will cover both A-shares and B-shares. At the Annual General Meeting in 2021, the Board of Directors will propose that the shares purchased under this programme be cancelled.

Sales growth of 2.2 percent in a volatile market with strong profitability achieving an EBIT margin of 13.5 percent. Especially Systems segment showed strong performance in 2019.
Group performance In 2019, ROCKWOOL Group was faced with continued mixed market conditions across countries and businesses. Overall, positive market conditions were seen in the construction sector although global growth flattened. Both residential and non-residential segments in the construction market were affected, especially in the German and Eastern European markets. In contrast, infrastructure and renovation markets showed stronger growth supported by energy efficiency initiatives that increased demand for our non-combustible insulation products.
Net sales reached EUR 2,757 million, a growth of 2.2 percent in local currencies, which is in line with the latest announced expectation. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.0 percentage point on net sales, pri-

marily due to the U.S. dollar and Russian rouble, resulting in sales growth of 3.2 percent in reported figures for 2019.
The year started with higher sales growth within the Insulation segment in Western Europe and in Systems segment, but in the latter part of the year, market conditions in the Insulation segment weakened especially in Germany, Asia and Eastern Europe except Russia.
As sales slowed down after first quarter, we aligned capacity at our factories to match the slower market demand and thereby preserved or even improved productivity at our factories.
Sales price development, product mix and lately input costs on raw materials were favourable in 2019, while inflation on logistic costs remained high. Due to high pressure on the factories last year, 2019 was a year with increased maintenance activities.
Compared to the outlook announced in the Annual Report 2018, sales growth slowed down more than expected, while the earnings level exceeded expectations due to factors explained above.
Regional sales development Sales in Western Europe reached EUR 1,659 million, an increase of 4.5 percent in local currencies and 4.6 percent in reported figures. We achieved growth in many key markets, where especially the United Kingdom and France performed well due to increased demand for noncombustible insulation products and energy efficiency incentives driving an increase in renovation while net sales in Germany declined from a record high level in 2018.

Sales in Eastern Europe reached EUR 494 million, down 4.9 percent in local currencies and 3.8 percent in reported figures. Russia performed well but sales in most of the other countries in the region decreased due to slow down in the industrial segment and increased competition in several markets in the region.
In the rest of the world, sales reached EUR 604 million, a growth of 2.2 percent in local currencies, while reported growth was 5.6 percent due to positive currency impact from the U.S. dollar. North America performed well, while key markets in Asia declined mainly due to general economic circumstances in the region and thereby fewer projects.
Group profitability In 2019, sales price increases were introduced in markets where business demands and conditions allowed this. The sales price increases counterbalanced the negative impact from the increase in input and logistic costs including higher costs for warehouses during 2019. In Q4, we saw a positive effect from lower input costs on raw materials.

Strong profitability due to pricing acumen and factory performance

Operational efficiency improved as we continued prioritisation of cost savings activities during the year. This entailed a focus on driving efficiency, while still investing in new competencies, digitalisation and growth initiatives, which helped to deliver improved profitability for the Group.
Compared to 2018, Group profitability was negatively impacted by pre-start-up costs for the new factories in Germany, Romania and the United States amounting to around EUR 12 million.
EBITDA increased eight percent to EUR 548 million with an EBITDA margin of 19.9 percent, an improvement compared to 2018 of 0.9 percentage points. EBITDA was positively impacted by a settlement of a legal case in Rockfon North America of EUR 10 million in April 2019 and by the accounting reclassification from the new IFRS 16 lease standard of EUR 18 million. Like-for-like, the EBITDA margin decreased 0.2 percentage points primarily due to the pre-start-up costs.
In 2019 depreciation amounted to EUR 176 million, an increase of EUR 10 million compared 2018 due to investments in new capacity and digital solutions and the reclassification of lease costs from IFRS 16.
EBIT improved significantly and reached a high of EUR 372 million, resulting in an EBIT margin of 13.5 percent. This was in line with the trend during the year and at the top of the latest guidance, however with an improved impact from lower inflation on input costs.

Compared to the outlook announced in February 2019, EBIT margin ended better due to fewer operational constraints, pricing improvements and the settlement of a legal case in Rockfon North America of EUR 10 million.
Net financial costs amounted to EUR 5 million, a decrease of EUR 2 million compared to 2018. The decrease is mainly related to unrealised currency fluctuations and less impact from changes in fair value of phantom shares. During 2019, the level of borrowing and interest costs stayed low as the Group remained cash positive.
Tax for the year amounted to EUR 82 million compared to EUR 70 million in 2018. The effective tax rate increased to 22.4 percent (2018: 21.0 percent) mainly due to higher withholding taxes on dividends and lower adjustments to tax assets.
Profit after tax for the Group totalled EUR 285 million, an improvement of EUR 20 million and is considered a satisfactory result for the year.
Profit after tax in the parent company totalled EUR 274 million, a decrease of EUR 13 million mainly due to higher tax for the year.

Cash flow and investments At the end of 2019, the Group had a net cash positive position, amounting to EUR 269 million, down EUR 111 million as higher investments consumed more cash in 2019. In addition, the Group had unused committed credit facilities of EUR 428 million by year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities was EUR 402 million against EUR 408 million in 2018, showing a stable inflow of cash from the operation. The cash flow was positively impacted by higher operating profit while the negative change in net working capital was higher compared to 2018. The tax payments increased significantly due to increased withholding tax payments and an overall improved earnings structure.

Net working capital over annualised net sales was 9.0 percent, a increase of 1.6 percentage points from 2018 (7.4 percent). Net working capital amounted to EUR 247 million compared to EUR 198 million in 2018. The increase mainly stems from a lower level of payables from reduced production activity over the holiday period and timing in payments, which more than offset the positive impact from inventory and trade receivables.
Capital expenditure reached EUR 400 million in line with our latest expectation, which is an increase of EUR 178 million compared to 2018 excluding acquisitions and the sale of listed securities in Flumroc amounting to EUR 18 million in 2018. The largest individual investments in 2019 relate to ongoing factory projects in the United States (West Virginia) and Romania as well as the expansion in Germany. The new Romanian factory is now operational and running as expected.

ROCKWOOL Group Annual Report 2019

Free cash flow amounted to EUR 2 million, a decrease of EUR 194 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher investments and higher tax payments.
Cash flow from financing activities ended at negative EUR 120 million, an increased negative impact of EUR 66 million, stemming from increased dividends, a low level of sale of own shares and the new lease instalments from IFRS 16.
Invested capital Return on invested capital decreased slightly in 2019, mainly due to higher investments and right-of-use assets from the new IFRS 16 lease standard, reaching 21.7 percent compared to 22.8 percent in 2018. Invested capital amounted to EUR 1,889 million compared to EUR 1,542 million in 2018.
At the end of 2019, total assets were EUR 2,694 million, an increase of EUR 263 million compared to 2018.
Equity Equity of the Group totalled EUR 2,118 million as of 31 December 2019 compared to EUR 1,877 million in 2018, corresponding to an equity ratio of 78 percent. Equity was mainly affected by the profit for the year, dividend and exchange rate adjustments.
The proposed dividend for 2019 is DKK 32.00 per share, up DKK 2.10 per share compared to 2018.

Business segments Sales in the Insulation segment reached EUR 2,077 million, which is a slight decrease of 0.3 percent in local currencies but an increase of 0.6 percent in reported currencies. The sales decrease came from the building insulation business in Eastern Europe and Asia and was partly offset by an increase in Western Europe and the sandwich panel business.
The Insulation segment's EBIT reached EUR 269 million with an EBIT margin of 11.3 percent, stable compared to 2018 as operational efficiency compensated the pre-startup costs for the new factories in Germany, Romania and the United States.

Quarterly follow-up

Global sales development In Q4 2019, ROCKWOOL Group generated sales of EUR 715 million, a decrease of 0.6 percent in local currencies compared to Q4 2018. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.3 percentage points, mainly derived from the strengthened Russian rouble, British pound and Canadian dollar. This brings the sales growth to 0.7 percent in reported figures.
Increase in sales prices across the businesses had together with product mix a positive impact on growth during the quarter. The general market development in the Insulation segment was difficult with mixed market conditions across countries and businesses. Systems segment ended the year with record high sales and profit.
Regional sales development Western Europe saw growth of 0.2 percent in local currencies in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018, as net sales in the quarter ended at EUR 422 million. The German market was under pressure with a general slow down in the economy. We continued strong performance in France and the United Kingdom driven by focus on energy efficiency and fire safety.
In Q4 2019, net sales in Eastern Europe decreased to EUR 131 million, a decrease of 8.2 percent in local currencies, while reported figures decreased 5.3 percent compared to Q4 2018. Most countries in the region, except Russia, decreased caused by a lack of large industrial projects.
Sales in North America, Asia and other countries reached EUR 162 million in Q4 2019, equal to a growth of 4.5 percent in local currencies compared to Q4 2018. In reported figures, sales in Q4 2019 grew 7.2 percent. Net sales in North America was moderate in the Insulation segment, while Systems segment performed very well in the quarter.

1.1 Net sales and segmented accounts

Financial statements

Accounting policies
Net sales The Group produces and sells a range of fire resilient stone wool insulation products, including solutions for ceiling systems, ventilated facades, friction and water management and stone wool substrate solutions for the professional horticultural.
Sales are recognised when control of the products has transferred to the customer, being when the products are delivered to the customer and the risk has been transferred.
The products are often sold with retrospective volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12-month period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method.
The sales include no element of financing as the sales are made with credit terms of normally 30-60 days consistent with market practice.
A receivable is recognised when the products are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.
Segmented accounts Group Management has determined the business segments for the purpose of assessing business performance and allocating resources. Primarily segments are based on products and thermal performance, as Systems segment is primarily defined as nonthermal insulation products. Nearly all external sales consist of sales of products.
Segmental data is stated for business areas and geographical areas. The split by business areas is in accordance with the Group's internal reporting.

The segmental data is presented according to the same principle as the consolidated financial statements. The segmental EBIT includes net sales and expenditure including non-recurring expenditure operationally related to the segment.
Comments
ROCKWOOL Group operates in two business segments based on products: Insulation segment and Systems segment. The information is based on the management structure and internal management reporting to Group Management and constitutes the reportable segments.
Headquarters costs are allocated to the business segments based on allocation keys used in the internal management reporting. These allocation keys are reassessed annually based on planned activity in

the segments. Intangible and tangible assets and related amortisation/ depreciation are not fully allocated to business segments as all stone wool production is done in the Insulation segment. Financial income and expenses, and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments.
Internal net sales from the Insulation segment to the Systems segment are at arms' length prices. The Insulation segment includes among others interior building insulation, façade insulation, roof insulation and industrial and technical insulation. The Systems segment includes acoustic ceilings, cladding boards, engineered fibres, noise and vibration control, and horticultural substrates.
In 2019 and in 2018 a write-down of software under construction was recognised affecting both segments. For additional information please refer to note 2.4.

Remuneration of Group Management (key management personnel) complies with the principles of the Group's Remuneration policy. The variable part of the total remuneration (bonus and restricted share units (RSUs)) is dependent on achievement of individual targets and targets for the Group's financial performance, as approved by the Remuneration committee. The variable annual bonus can give up to 40% of the base remuneration. The long-term incentive programme (RSUs) is set to 20% of the base remuneration for Group Management and 30% for the CEO. No termination costs is included in the remuneration in neither 2019 nor 2018.

Accounting policies
Two different share-based incentive programmes have been established: A stock option programme and a restricted share programme (RSUs). Both programmes are classified as equity based, as they settle in shares. Due to local rules, a minor part of both programmes are given as phantom shares and is classified as cash-based, as they settle in cash. The programmes are offered to Group Management and other senior executives. The incentive programmes are part of the variable part of the remuneration and follows the Group's Remuneration policy. Participation in the
Consolidated financial statements

programmes are at the Remuneration Committees discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate or receive any guaranteed benefit.
Stock options On issuing of stock options, the fair value of the options is assessed using the Black & Scholes formula at the time of grant and is recognised in personnel costs in the income statement and in equity over the 3-year vesting period.
A part of the stock options are given as phantom shares (cash-based programme) and are adjusted to fair value through financial expenses in the income statement against a related provision.

Restricted Share Units (RSUs) When RSUs are issued, the value of the RSUs at grant date is recognised in personnel cost in the income statement and in equity over the 3-year vesting period. On initial recognition of the RSUs, the number of RSUs expected to vest is estimated. Subsequently, the estimate is revised so the total cost recognised is based on the actual number of RSUs vested. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the quoted share price at grant adjusted for expected dividend payout (based on historic dividend payout ratio). The participants are compensated for any dividend payment by receiving additional RSUs.
A minor part of the RSUs are given as phantom shares (cash-based programme) and are adjusted to fair value through financial expenses in the income statement against a related provision.

Restricted Share Units Restricted Share Units (RSUs) will be subject to a vesting period of three years. After the vesting period the shares are transferred to the participants without payment, subject to continued employment with ROCKWOOL Group in the vesting period.
The RSUs represent the employees right to shares but do not carry voting rights nor have any tangible value before the RSUs are exercised and become actual B shares of ROCKWOOL International A/S. The terms of the share incentive may provide that shares may be settled in cash in which case, the related provision equals the share price at the time of vesting.
The estimated fair value of RSUs granted was EUR 2 million (2018: EUR 2 million) at grant date.
EUR 2 million was expensed in 2019 relating to the RSUs (2018: EUR 2 million), of which EUR 1 million was recognised in personnel costs and EUR 1 million in finance expenses (fair value of phantom shares).
Cash-settled programmes The cash-settled programmes consists of phantom shares granted during the years 2012-2019.
The employees granted the phantom shares participate on terms and conditions similar to those applying to the share options and the RSUs.
The outstanding stock options from 2012-2015 include 2,350 phantom options (2018: 3,000). The outstanding RSUs from 20172019 include 7,652 phantom shares (2018: 8,259).
The total intrinsic value of the phantom stock options/RSUs at year-end amounts to EUR 1 million (2018: EUR 2 million), which is recognised as a liability.

The costs of research activities are carried as expenditure in the year in which they are incurred. The costs of development projects which are clearly defined and identifiable, and of which the potential technical and commercial exploitation is demonstrated, are capitalised to the extent that they are expected to generate future revenue. Other development costs are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement under operating costs.
Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and write-downs.
Amortisation of the following intangible assets is made on a straightline basis over the expected future lifetime of the assets, which is:
Development projects: 2-10 years Patents: up to 20 years Software: 2-4 years Trademarks: up to 20 years Customer relationships: 10-15 years
Goodwill arisen from acquisition of enterprises and activities is stated at cost. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units at the acquisition date. Identification of independent cash-generating units is based on business structure and level of internal control of cash flow. Acquired CO2 rights are capitalised under intangible assets. Granted CO2 rights are not capitalised.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and the book value of other assets is reviewed on indications of impairment. When testing for impairment, the value is written down to the estimated net sales price or the value in use, if greater.
Intangible assets under construction are also tested for impairment annually.

Intangible assets

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) in Insulation segment at an amount of EUR 41 million (2018: EUR 39 million) and to CGUs in Systems segment at an amount of EUR 56 million (2018: EUR 56 million).
Goodwill has been impairment tested in 2019 and 2018 for the identified CGUs, which for both years have not lead to any value adjustments.
The impairment test of goodwill is based on current and future results for the CGUs to where the results are allocated. Most of the goodwill in the Group is related to the acquisition of Flumroc in 2017, Chicago Metallic in 2013 and CSR in 2010 and they are performing according to plan.
Please refer to note 2.5 for further details.
In 2019 a write-down of EUR 2 million of assets under construction was recognised affecting both segments due to lower benefits and utilisation compared to the original expectation.
In 2018, a write-down of intangible assets under construction was recognised, amounting to EUR 8 million, due to a lower revenue stream compared to the original expectation. The value of the asset was written down to the net present value of future cash flows.
The net book value of other intangible assets includes brands amounting to EUR 11 million (2018: EUR 12 million) and development projects amounting to EUR 1 million (2018: EUR 3 million).

Financial performance

Financial statements

Accounting policies
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of technical plant and machinery manufactured by the Group comprises the acquisition cost, expenditure directly related to the acquisition, engineering hours, including indirect production costs and borrowing costs.
Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis, based on current assessment of their useful lives and scrap value.
The expected lifetimes are: Buildings: 20-40 years Plant and machinery: 5-15 years Other operating equipment: 3-10 years
On sale or scrapping of assets, any losses or gains are included under other operating income for the year.
Investment grants are deducted in the cost of the equivalent tangible assets. The investment grants are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets as reduced depreciation expense.

Critical estimates and judgements

The expected lifetime for tangible assets is determined based on past experience and expectations for future use of the assets. Especially the estimated lifetime of plant and machinery is linked to uncertainty due to varying utilisation and the significant amount of maintenance costs. Reassessments of the expected future lifetime are made in connection with changes in production structures.

When there is an indication of a reduction in the profitability of an asset, an impairment test is performed for the assets in question and write-downs are made, if necessary.
The recoverable amounts of the assets and cash-generating units are determined based on value-in-use calculations and fair value

less cost to sell. These calculations require the use of estimates as they are based on budgets, business plans and projections for 5 years and take into account previous experience and represent Management's best estimate of future developments. Key parameters are growth in sales margin, discount rate and future growth expectations. Please refer to note 2.5.

Tangible assets

Of the total net book value of buildings and sites, EUR 114 million (2018: EUR 111 million) represent sites not subject to depreciation.
Accumulated capitalised interests amounting to EUR 4 million (2018: EUR 4 million) are included in the cost of tangible assets. There is no additional capitalised interest neither this year nor last year..
For the recognised investment grants the conditions are fulfilled or are expected to be fulfilled. Some of the received investment grants are subject to repayment obligations provided that the attached conditions are not fulfilled within a number of years.
The Group's investment grants are for the main part received in Poland, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. The investment grants are in most cases linked to expansion of the Group including the amount of investment in tangible assets and the creation of jobs - and is given as cash or loans. Only limited contingent liabilities exist. For a description of impairment tests on tangible assets see note 2.5.
Contractual obligations for the purchase of tangible assets at 31 December 2019 amount to EUR 134 million (2018: EUR 141 million).

2.3 Right-of-use assets

Financial performance

Financial statements

Accounting policies
The Group's portfolio of leases covers leases of office buildings, warehouses and other equipment such as cars and forklifts. Leases for offices and other buildings have lease terms between 2-22 years, warehouses between 3-10 years while car and forklift leases generally have lease terms between 3-5 years. The Group also has a few longterm site leases with lease terms up to 99 years.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. For building leases, the determination of lease terms are generally based on contract terms, however for contracts with prolongation or termination options, strategic importance of e.g. location is also taken into consideration.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contracts to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. The Group has elected to exclude non-lease components from the measurement of its lease liabilities, except from those relating to cars. Non-lease components, except from those relating to cars, are expensed as operational costs.

RoU assets and lease liabilities are initially measured at present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: ­Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any
lease incentive receivable ­Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initial-
ly measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date ­Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual
value guaranties ­The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably
certain to exercise that option ­Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the Group exercising the option.
If the lease contract contains an extension or purchase option that the Group considers reasonably certain to be exercised, these are included in the measurement of the liability.
To measure the lease liability at an amount equal to the net present value of the lease payments, a discount rate is used. For this purpose, the Group generally uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR).
The IBR is calculated per main country/region per asset type. The length of the lease terms for the different asset types has also been taken into consideration. The IBR level in Europe is 3-7 percent p.a., in Russia around 12 percent p.a., in North America 5-6 percent p.a. while the level in Asia is 5-15 percent p.a.
RoU assets are measured at cost comprising the following: ­The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability ­Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date
less any lease incentives received ­Any initial direct costs ­Restoration costs.

RoU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected lease term and the asset's useful life. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life. RoU assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. RoU assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Payments associated with short-term leases (with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (e.g. computer, printers and photocopying machines) are recognised on a straight line basis as a cost in the income statement.

Accounting policies
When there is an indication of a reduction in the profitability of an asset, an impairment test is performed for the assets in question and write-downs are made, if necessary.
For goodwill, annual impairment tests are made. The recoverable amounts of the assets and cash-generating units (CGUs) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. When testing for impairment, the value is written down to the estimated recoverable amount, if lower than the carrying amount.
Other assets are tested for impairment when there are indications of change in the structural profitability.

2.5 Impairment tests (continued)

Financial statements

Critical estimates and judgements
When preparing impairment tests, estimates are used to calculate the future value. Significant estimates are made when assessing long-term growth rates and profitability. In addition, an assessment is made of the reasonable discount rate.
Changes in the growth rate in the budget period or discount rate may result in significantly different values. The assessments are made based on budgets, business plans and projections for 5 years and take into account previous experience and represent Management's best estimate of future developments.
Key parameters are growth in sales, margin, discount rate and future growth expectations.
Comments
Management has performed the yearly impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill. In addition, impairment test of other assets has also been made, where indication of reduction of value was found. In the impairment test, the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the discounted value of the future cash flows. The assessment of future cash flows is typically based on 5-year management reviewed budgets and business plans, where the last year is used as a normalised terminal year. Net sales, raw material prices, discount rate and future growth assumptions constitute the most material parameters in the calculation.
The average growth rate in the terminal period is set to 0.5% similar to last year. The weighted average growth rate in the budget period is estimated to be between 0-6% depending on the businesses.
The high growth rates are used in countries where we historically have seen steep increases after a slow period. Gross margins are based on

average values the last 3 years and adjusted over the budget period for efficiency improvements and expected raw material inflation based on past actual price movements and future market conditions. Future investment is derived from the historic investment level to secure a smooth operation of the factories and the capacity utilisation is based on the current situation including investment plans. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and the operating segments and is derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
2019 The impairment test for 2019 has not shown a need for write-downs or reversals of write-downs recognised previous years. During 2019 HECK Wall Systems has been monitored closely. HECK Wall Systems follows the expectations and market outlook outlined in the impairment test last year. The net present value of HECK Wall Systems amounts to EUR 28 million in 2019, which gives a headroom of EUR 1 million to the net book value. The main driver is conversion to stone wool products and this has shown good progress.
2018 The impairment tests for 2018 has not shown a need for write-downs or reversals of the write-downs recognised previous years. During 2018 HECK Wall Systems has been monitored closely. HECK Wall Systems follows the expectations and market outlook outlined in the

impairment test last year. The main driver is conversion to stone wool products and this has shown good progress.
Sensitivity analysis As part of the preparation of impairment tests, sensitivity analyses are prepared on the basis of relevant risk factors and scenarios that management can determine within reasonable reliability. Sensitivity analyses are prepared by altering the estimates with a range of probable outcomes.
2019 The sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other things being equal; an increase in the discount rate of 1%, a decrease in the growth rate of 1% p.a. and an increase of input costs of 1% p.a. The write-down in HECK Wall Systems would have been EUR 3-6 million if the discount rate was to increase 1% or the growth was 1% lower.
We consider the chosen scenarios as the most realistic why none of the impairment tests have given rise to adjustment of the value.
2018 The sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other things being equal; an increase in the discount rate of 1%, a decrease in the growth rate of 1% p.a. and an increase of input costs of 1% p.a. The write-down in HECK Wall Systems would have been EUR 3-4 million if the discount rate was to increase 1% or the growth was 1% lower.

2.6 Pension obligations

Financial performance

Financial statements

Accounting policies

Critical estimates and judgements

Pension payments concerning defined contribution plans are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement.
Defined benefit plans are stated at the net present value at the balance sheet date and included in the consolidated financial statements. Adjustments of the plans are carried out on a regular basis in accordance with underlying actuarial assessments. Actuarial gains or losses for defined benefit plans are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income. The actuarial assessment is carried out every year.
Funded benefit plans have assets placed in trustee-administered pension funds, which are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.
The payments to the pension funds are based on the usual actuarial assessments and are recognised in the income statement after maturity. Provided that the actuarial assessments of pension obligations show noticeable excess solvency or insolvency in relation to the pension fund's assets, the difference is entered to the balance sheet and the future payments are adjusted accordingly. With regard to these schemes, the actuarial assessment is also carried out every year.

The present value of defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Any changes to these assumptions

will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The discount rate and other key assumptions are based in part on the current market conditions.

Comments

A number of the Group's employees and former employees participate in pension schemes. The pension schemes are primarily defined contribution plans. However, defined benefit plans are also used, mainly in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. The plans in the United Kingdom and Germany are closed for new entries.
Under a defined benefit plan the Group carries the risk associated with the future development in e.g. interest rates, inflation, salaries, mortality and disability.
Defined benefit plans typically guarantee the employees a retirement benefit based on the final salary at retirement.
The pension benefit plans in the United Kingdom and Switzerland have assets placed in independent pension funds. The remaining plans are unfunded, where the main part relates to Germany. For these plans the retirement benefit obligations amount to approximately 22% (2018: 22%) of the total gross liability.
Except for the Swiss and UK plans, the mentioned defined benefit plans are not subject to regulatory requirements regarding minimum funding.
The granted pension payments of the mentioned defined benefit plans are based upon the salary of the participating employees during the period of employment. The Group's contributions are derived from the split of the pension premium between the employee and employer.

The actuarial assessment of the pension obligation is based on assumptions specific to each country. The latest actuarial calculation is prepared by authorised experts. The valuation of the assets is based on the composition and the expectations to the economic development. The assumptions used are weighted averages:

Accounting policies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and if it is probable it will lead to an outflow of financial resources and if the size of the liability can be measured on a reliable basis. The provision is calculated as the amount expected to be paid to settle the obligation.
Comments
Provisions relate primarily to jubilee obligations and retirement benefits, fair value provision for phantom shares, restructuring, warranties and ongoing disputes, lawsuits, etc.
As at 31 December 2019 other provisions include a provision of EUR 4 million (2018: EUR 2 million) for restructuring measures. This provision is expected to be utilised within 1 year.

3.2 Trade receivables

Financial performance

Financial statements

Accounting policies
Trade receivable are measured at amortised cost less allowance for bad debt based on the expected credit loss model.
The Group applies the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 60 months before 1 January 2019 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.
The costs of allowance for bad debts and realised losses during the year are included in other external costs.

4.2 Financial risks and instruments

Financial statements

Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost price and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised in other receivables and other payables.
Changes to the fair value of derivative financial instruments, which meet the conditions for hedging the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, are recognised in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Changes to the fair value of derivative financial instruments, which meet the conditions for hedging future cash flow, are recognised in other comprehensive income provided the hedge has been effective. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The accumulated value adjustment related to these hedge transactions is transferred from other comprehensive income when the position is realised, and is included in the value of the hedged position e.g. the adjustment follows the cash flow.
For derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify as hedging instruments, changes to the fair value are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.

4.2 Financial risks and instruments (continued)

Financial statements

Comments
The Group's listed equity securities, taken over as part of the acquisition of Flumroc AG, were sold during 2018.
As a consequence of ROCKWOOL Group's extensive international activities, the Group's income statement and equity are subject to a number of financial risks. The Group manages these risks in the following categories:
­ Exchange rate risk, ­ Interest rate risk ­ Liquidity risk ­ Credit risk
The Group's policy is to identify and hedge significant financial risks on an ongoing basis. This is the responsibility of the individual companies in which financial risks might arise and overall supported by the Group's treasury department. The parent company continuously monitors the Group's financial risks in accordance with a framework determined by Group Management and/or the Board of Directors.
Exchange rate risk As a consequence of the Group's structure, net sales and expenditure in foreign currency are to a significant degree set off against each other, so that the Group is not exposed to major exchange rate risks.
Commercial exchange rate risks in the companies, which cannot be set off are hedged on a continuous basis, to the extent that they may significantly affect the results of the individual company in a negative direction, using currency loans, currency deposits and/ or financial derivatives. Exchange rate risks are hedged in the individual companies. The Group's hedging reserve is disclosed under "Statement of changes in equity" with an insignificant amount.
The Group's net sales and expenditures will be subject to exchange rate fluctuations on translation into EUR.

Sensitivity analysis
Effect in EURm 5% change in exchange rate USD (+/-) RUB (+/-) CAD (+/-) PLN (+/-) GBP (+/-)
USD (+/-) RUB (+/-) CAD (+/-) PLN (+/-) GBP (+/-)
A sensitivity analysis is made for the Group's result and equity based on the underlying currency transactions. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are cash, receivables, payables, current liabilities and financial investments without taking hedging into consideration. The result of the sensitivity analysis cannot be directly transferred to the fluctuations on translating the financial result and equity of subs idiaries into EUR.
The impact on the net sales of the difference between average rate and year-end rate amounts to EUR 15 million (2018: EUR -11 million) for the 5 largest currencies (USD, RUB, CAD, PLN and GBP), which is a change of 0.5% (2018: -0.4%).
The Group's policy is not to hedge exchange rate risks in long-term investments in subsidiaries. When relevant, external investment loans and Group loans are, as a general rule, established in the local currency of the company involved, while cash at bank and in hand are placed in local currency.

In the few countries with ineffective financial markets loans can be raised and surplus liquidity placed in DKK, EUR or USD, subject to the approval of the Group's finance function.
Most Group loans, that are not established in DKK or EUR, are hedged in via forward agreements, currency loans and cash pools or via the SWAP market.
Interest rate risk Currently the Group does not have any significant interest-bearing debt or assets. The Group's policy is that necessary financing of investments should primarily be affected by raising 5 to 7 year loans at fixed or variable interest rates.
Drawings on credit facilities at variable interest rates generally match the funds, and all Group loans are symmetrical in terms of interest rates. Consequently, changes in interest rates will not have a significant effect on the result of the Group.

4.2 Financial risks and instruments (continued)

Liquidity risk The current surplus and deficit liquidity in the Group's companies is set off, to the extent that this is profitable, via the parent company acting as intra-Group bank and via cash pool systems. When considered appropriate, underlying cash pool systems are established in foreign companies.
To the extent that the financial reserves are of an appropriate size, the parent company also acts as lender to the companies in the Group.
To ensure adequate financial reserves as defined by the Board of Directors, investment loans can be raised on a continuous basis to partly cover new investments and to refinance existing loans. The parent company has made guarantees for some credit facilities and loans. The parent company has issued ownership clauses and/or deed of postponements in connection with intercompany loans.
The parent company ensures on an ongoing basis that flexible, unutilised committed credit facilities of an adequate size are established with Investment Grade credit-rated banks. The Group's

financial reserves also consist of cash at bank and in hand, and unused overdraft facilities.
Credit risk Due to the considerable customer spread in terms of geographical location and numbers, the credit risk is fundamentally limited. To a minor degree, when considered necessary, insurance or bank guarantees are used to hedge outstanding receivables.
As a consequence of the international diversification of the Group's activities there are business relations with a number of different banks in Europe, North America and Asia. To minimise the credit risk on placement of funds and on entering into agreements on derived financial instruments, only major, financially sound institutions are used.
Customer credit risks are assessed considering the financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal and external ratings. For impairment of trade receivable please refer to note 3.2.

No customer exceeds 10% of the Group's net sales neither this year nor last year.
Categories of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities at fair value are related to foreign exchange rate forward contracts, foreign exchange rate swaps or interest rate swaps all of which have been valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs (level 2).
The Group is using no other valuation technique. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions.
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly foreign exchange forward contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot rates.

5.1 Tax on profit for the year

Financial performance

Financial statements

Accounting policies
The parent company is taxed jointly with all Danish subsidiaries. Income subject to joint taxation is fully distributed. Tax on profit for the year, which includes current tax on profit for the year as well as changes to deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement.
In the course of conducting business globally, transfer pricing disputes, etc. with tax authorities may occur, and Management judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. The most probable outcome is used as the measurement method, and Management believes, that the provision made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with local tax authorities is adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and is dependent on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.
Tax on changes in other comprehensive income is recognised directly under other comprehensive income.

5.3 Deferred taxes

Accounting policies

Provisions for deferred tax are calculated on all temporary differences between accounting and taxable values, calculated using the balancesheet liability method.
Deferred tax provisions are also made to cover the re-taxation of losses in jointly taxed foreign companies previously included in the Danish joint taxation.

Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable, that the assets will reduce tax payments in coming years and they are assessed at the expected net realisable value.
Deferred tax is stated according to current tax regulations. Changes in deferred tax as a consequence of changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement.

Critical estimates and judgements
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining provision for uncertain tax positions or the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
A tax asset is recognised if it is assessed, that the asset can be utilised in a foreseeable future based on strong indications, that sufficient future profits are available to absorb the temporary differences including the Group's future tax planning.
The valuation of tax assets related to losses carried forward is done on a yearly basis and is based on expected positive taxable income within the next 3-5 years.
Comments
Tax assets not recognised amount to EUR 42 million (2018: EUR 25 million). The tax assets have not been recognised as they have arisen in subsidiaries, that have been loss-making for some time and there is no evidence of recoverability in the near future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the consolidated balance sheet, if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same legal tax entity/consolidation. Of the total deferred tax assets recognised, EUR 1 million (2018: EUR 3 million) relate to tax loss carry forwards.

5.7 New and changed standards and general accounting policies

The Annual Report for ROCKWOOL International A/S has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The financial year for the Group is 1 January ­ 31 December 2019.
5.7.1 New and changed standards and interpretations
The following EU adopted standards and interpretations with relevance for the Group were implemented with effect from 1 January 2019:
­ IFRS 16: Lease (effective date 1 January 2019)
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but have no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.
Impact from IFRS 16 "Lease" The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method under which the effect of the implementation is included in the opening equity as of 1 January 2019 without adjustment of comparative figures.
The standard has replaced IAS 17, and requires that lease contracts previously classified as operational leases are recognised in the balance sheet as a right-of-use (RoU) asset with the corresponding lease liability. In the income statement, the lease cost under operating costs are replaced by depreciation of the leased asset and an interest expense for the lease liability. The impact on profit for the period is neutral over time, but a timing effect does occur due to frontloading of interest expenses.
In addition, the cash flow will be impacted as part of the current lease payments will be moved from operating activities to cash flow from financing activities (instalments).

On adoption, lease liabilities related to leases previously classified as operating leases under the principle of IAS 17 Leases, were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019.
The Group has elected to use the recognition exemption for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less for all classes of underlying assets, as well as the exemption for lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low-value assets"), e.g. computers, printing and photocopying machines etc.
Further, the Group has elected to exclude any initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, as well as hindsight has been used in determining the lease term of contracts that contains extension and/or termination options.
The incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is calculated per main country/ region per asset type. The length of the lease terms for the different

asset types has also been taken into consideration. The weighted average IBR applied to the lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 4.3%.
The change in the accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019: ­ Right-of-use assets, increase by EUR 37 million ­ Lease liabilities, increase by EUR 37 million.
New and changed standards and interpretation not yet entered into force EU adopted standards and amendments issued by IASB with effective date after 31 December 2019 and therefore not implemented, comprise:
­ A mendments to IFRS 3: Business Combinations (effective date 1 January 2020).
It is assessed that the amendments to IFRS 3 might have an impact on the future recognition and measurement for the Group accounts.

5.7 New and changed standards and general accounting policies (continued)

5.7.2 General accounting policies
Group Accounts The consolidated financial statements comprise ROCKWOOL International A/S and the entities in which the company and its subsidiaries hold the majority of the voting rights.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a consolidation of the parent company's and the individual subsidiaries' financial statements, determined according to the Group's accounting policies, and with elimination of dividends, internal revenue and expenditure items, internal profits as well as intercompany balances and intercompany shareholdings.
Besides shares, capital investments in subsidiaries include longterm loans to subsidiaries if such loans constitute an addition to the shareholding.
Translation of foreign currency The Annual Report has been presented in Euro (EUR) which is the Group's presentation currency. Each company in the Group determines its own functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date or a hedged rate. Monetary items in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date for balance sheet items, and the periodic average exchange rates for items of the income statement.

All exchange rate adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items, apart from the exchange rate differences arising on:
­Conversion of equity in subsidiaries at the beginning of the financial year using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date
­Conversion of the profit for the year from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date
­Conversion of long-term intercompany balances that constitute an addition to the holding of shares in subsidiaries
­Conversion of the forward hedging of capital investments in subsidiaries
­Conversion of capital investments in associated and other companies
­Profit and loss on effective derivative financial instruments used to hedge expected future transactions
These value adjustments are recognised directly under other comprehensive income.
Critical estimates and judgements In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management makes various accounting estimates and assumptions that form the basis of the presentation, recognition and measurement of the Group's assets and liabilities. The most significant accounting estimates and judgements are presented below.
In applying the Group's accounting policies, Management make judgements that may significantly influence the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. When determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities it requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions concerning future events.

The judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, and are considered by Management as reasonable in the circumstances, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and therefore the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
Management considers critical estimates and judgements under the following items as significant to the consolidated financial statements:
­Impairment testing (note 2.5) ­Expected lifetime for tangible assets (note 2.2) ­Deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions (note 5.3) ­Pension obligations (note 2.6)

To the shareholders of ROCKWOOL International A/S

Our opinion In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the Group's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Moreover, in our opinion, the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Parent Company's financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the Parent Company's operations for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our Auditor's Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
What we have audited The Consolidated Financial Statements of ROCKWOOL International A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 (pp. 67-113) comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies.

The Parent Company Financial Statements of ROCKWOOL International A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies.
Collectively referred to as the "Financial Statements"
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.
Appointment We were first appointed auditors of ROCKWOOL International A/S on 9 April 2014 for the financial year 2014. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 6 years including the financial year 2019.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter Impairment of intangible and tangible assets Intangible and tangible assets might be impaired due to for example increased competition in local markets, changes in the global economy and changes in the strategy of the Group.
We focused on this area as the determination of whether or not an impairment charge for intangible and tangible assets was necessary involves significant estimates and judgements made by Management, including especially:
­ e stimation of future cash flows and the key assumptions underlying Management's expectations;

­ d iscount rates applied in discounting future cash flows; and ­ long-term growth rates
Reference is made to notes 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter We tested the impairment tests prepared by Management and evaluated the reasonableness of estimates and judgements made by Management in preparing these.
Our audit procedures included assessing the Group's impairment model.

Special focus was given to the key drivers of the future cash flows, including growth in net revenues, cost inflation and efficiency improvements, as well as the discount rates and long-term growth rates applied.
We tested the reliability of Management's estimates by comparing budgeted figures to actual figures for the past years and evaluated the discount rates and long-term growth rates applied.
Moreover, we examined sensitivity analyses performed over changes in discount rates, revenue growth and efficiency improvements.

Independent auditor's report

(continued)

Statement on Management's Review Management is responsible for Management's Review (pp. 3-66 and p. 114).
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management's Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read Management's Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management's Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, we considered whether Management's Review includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Management's Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Management's Review.
Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent

Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
­Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
­Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.
­Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.

­Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
­Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
­Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Independent auditor's report

(continued)

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

1.0 Accounting policies

Financial performance

Financial statements

The financial statements of ROCKWOOL International A/S have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (accounting class D).
The Financial statements for 2019 are presented in EUR.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies have been changed compared to last year, as the parent company is applying the Danish Financial Statements Act instead of IFRS as was the case in 2018.
Prior to the transition to the Danish Financial Statements Act, the parent company has changed the accounting policy for measurement of investments in subsidiaries from the cost price method to the equity value method. As a result hereof, the 2018 comparative figures have been adjusted, resulting in an adjusted profit for the year of EUR 287 million (previously EUR 481 million) and adjusted equity of EUR 1,867 million (previously EUR 1,662 million) at 31 December 2018.
When changing accounting policy to the Danish Financial Statements Act, the company has elected to use the carrying value of subsidiaries as deemed cost for subsidiaries under the Danish Financial Statements Act as per 1 January 2018 i.e. the company have not amortised goodwill before that date. From 1 January 2018 goodwill which forms part of the carrying value of subsidiaries have been amortised and recognised as part of income from subsidiaries.
The accounting policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. For a description of the Group's accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.
Recognition and measurement in general Income is recognised in the income statement as earned.
All costs incurred in generating the year's revenue are also recognised in the income statement, including depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses.
Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are also recognised in the income statement.
Parent company financial statements

Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be measured on a reliable basis. Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when they are considered probable and can be measured on a reliable basis. At initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as described below for each item.
Net sales The company produces and sells machinery and consultancy service under fixed price contracts. The projects typically include one deliverable. Revenue from the projects is recognised over time based on the progress and is based on the price of the projects. As the work is done at the customer's site, control is transferred along with the progress of the project. Recognition is based on the actual costs spent relative to the total estimated costs for the project, as this method is estimated to reflect the transfer of control. The credit terms are normally end of month plus 20 days.
Royalty is received for the use of the ROCKWOOL brand and technology. Royalty is based on the level of sales in the subsidiaries and recognised when earned according to the terms in the agreement.
Intangible assets The accounting policies for intangible assets follow those of the Group with the exception of goodwill, which is amortised over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.
An amount equal to the total capitalised development costs after tax is recognised under Shareholders' equity in the Reserve for development costs.
Fixed assets investments Investments in subsidiaries are recognised initially at cost and measured subsequently using the equity method. The company's share of the equity of subsidiaries, based on the fair value of the identifiable net assets on the acquisition date, minus or plus unrealised intercompany profits or losses, with addition of any residual value of goodwill, is recognised under Investments in subsidiaries in the balance sheet.

If the shareholders' equity of subsidiaries is negative and ROCKWOOL International A/S has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the company's negative equity, a provision is recognised. Net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries is recognised under Shareholders' equity in the Revaluation reserve according to the equity method. The reserve is reduced by payments of dividends to the parent company and adjusted to reflect other changes in the equity of subsidiaries.
The proportionate share of the net profits of subsidiaries less goodwill amortisation is recognised under Income from investments in subsidiaries in the income statement. Goodwill in subsidiaries is amortised over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.
Receivables from subsidiaries Receivables from subsidiaries are recognised at amortised costs and are subsequently measured after deduction of allowance for losses based on an individual assessment.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Dividend The dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Shareholders' equity.
Cash flow statement ROCKWOOL International A/S has in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, Section 86 (4) not prepared separate cash flow statements. Please refer to the consolidated cash flow statements.

4.3 Derivatives
Reference is made to note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements concerning derivatives.
Comments
The policy is not to hedge exchange rate risks in long-term investments in subsidiaries.
When relevant, external investment loans and Group receivables are, as a general rule, established in the local currency of the company involved, while cash at bank and in hand are placed in the local currency.
In the few countries with ineffective financial markets loans can be raised and surplus liquidity placed in DKK, EUR or USD, subject to the approval of the parent company's finance function.
Most Group receivables that are not established in DKK or EUR are hedged via forward agreements, currency loans and cash pools or via the SWAP market.
To ensure adequate financial reserves as defined by the Board of Directors, investment loans can be raised on a continuous basis to partly cover new investments and to refinance existing loans. Guarantees has been made for some credit facilities and loans. Please refer to note 3.3 for further specification of the receivables.
Ownership clauses have been issued and/or deed of postponements in connection with intercompany receivables. Please refer to note 5.4.
