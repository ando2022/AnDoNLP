" The financial strength allows us to both consider further growth opportunities from
acquisitions as well as fleet renewals."

A strong company
Continuous improvements have been the hallmark of DFDS' Executive Management Team over the last five years, with the financial strength of DFDS further increasing on the background of the higher earnings level.
Remarkable results have been achieved across the organisation to the benefit of all stakeholders, not least our shareholders. DFDS is today a very strong and well consolidated company.
The financial strength allows us to both consider further growth opportunities from acquisitions as well as fleet renewals. In 2018, the focus of DFDS will be on the execution of our digital strategy to further enhance our efficiency and customer experience.
At the Annual General Meeting, Pernille Erenbjerg, who joined the Board in 2014, will step down. I would like to extend our great appreciation for the contribution

Pernille Erenbjerg has made to the Board in general and to the development of our digital strategy and ambition in her tenure. Marianne Dahl Steensen, who joined the Board of Directors in 2017, will ensure the digital competencies in the Board are upheld. Furthermore, the Board will propose the election of Anders Götzsche as new Board member, further strengthening the business development and strategy competencies as well as securing the deep financial competencies.
On the Board of Directors, we continuously assess the capital structure to balance shareholder returns with investment opportunities to create future growth. Our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders is clear.
At the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will therefore propose to increase the dividend by 10% based on the strong result achieved in 2017 and expectations of further future earnings growth.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the DFDS management and everyone in the organisation for the dedication and contribution to the business optimisation and result improvements in 2017. The course is set for continuous improvement also in 2018.

Moving on from another strong result

DFDS has over the past five years achieved a considerably higher level of earnings.
We are strongly positioned in European markets and the return on invested capital has been raised to 19% compared to 4% in 2012. In the same period, the operating profit (EBITDA) has increased to DKK 2.7bn from DKK 1.1bn.
We now have a great platform for further development of our business. We are stepping up investment in our digital capabilities and increasingly assessing future opportunities offered by new business models and technologies.
The fundamental need for transport services will endure in a digital world as it has since DFDS' inception more than 150 years ago. Goods still need to be moved across sea and over land to end customers and people will increasingly be travelling. We move for all to grow ­ that is our Purpose that will guide us through the changes that lie ahead.
In 2018, we are investing in further development of digital capabilities, including people and systems, to enhance the customer experience and gain operational efficiencies. These investments go hand in hand with our

planned investments in shipping capacity, efficiency and reliability for routes and logistics solutions.
"W e move for all to grow ­ that is our Purpose that will guide us through the changes that lie ahead."
Our commitment to create value for our shareholders is unwavering. Digital solutions and new business models and technologies add opportunities as we continue to pursue new ways to enhance customer service, lessen our environmental impact, operate more efficiently and reduce costs.

Earnings level further improved
In 2017, the strong earnings level achieved in 2016 was further improved as operating profit (EBITDA) increased 4% to DKK 2,702m and profit before tax increased 8% to DKK 1,727m, both before special items.
Freight volumes continued to grow in northern Europe in line with the overall increase in activity in most of Europe. This benefited particularly the North Sea route network and the logistics activities in the Nordic and Continent business units.
Passenger volume growth was more subdued as the key UK and Norwegian markets were impacted by weaker currencies and a slowdown in growth.
The further improvement in earnings reflects an agenda of continuous improvement and benefits from moderate economic growth, and thereby volume growth, in most of DFDS' key markets in northern Europe.
Revenue increased 4% in 2017 adjusted for acquisitions, currency changes, the divested Belfast activity and excluding revenue from bunker surcharges. Reported revenue likewise increased 4% to DKK 14.3bn.
The outlook for the full-year revenue growth included in the Q3 2017 report was 3%, excluding revenue from bunker surcharges. The realised revenue growth, likewise excluding revenue from bunker surcharges, was slightly below this growth expectation mainly due to currency changes.

Operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) and special items increased 4% to DKK 2,702m. The result was thus in line with the latest outlook range for an EBITDA before special items of DKK 2,650-2,750m included in the Q3 2017 report.
The Shipping Division's EBITDA before special items increased 3% to DKK 2,513m while the Logistics Division's EBITDA before special items increased 4% to DKK 263m.
The Group's free cash flow was positive by DKK 1,102m after net investments of DKK 1,564m.
Financial leverage remained on level with 2016. The leverage ratio of net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) to operating profit (EBITDA) before special items was 0.9 at year-end. The equity ratio was 50% at year-end 2017 compared to 51% in 2016.
The average number of employees increased 2% to 7,235 in 2017. The increase was mainly due to the full-year impact of acquisitions, additional contract logistics activities and more employees in IT and digital functions.
Major events in 2017
The most important events of the year are listed on page 18, divided into three sections: business development and competition; operations and finance; and digital, people and environment.

Business development and competition Two new freight ships on UK-Netherlands route Two freight new buildings were delivered and deployed between Vlaardingen (Rotterdam) and Immingham in June and October respectively. The larger capacity of the ships have increased efficiency as the route is now operated with three ships instead of previously four ships. The ships comply with the latest environmental design requirements and as such are more fuel efficient. They also require less handling when loading and unloading in port.
The freight capacity of each ship is 4,076 lane metres, equal to around 260 trailers. The ships are bareboat-chartered for a five-year period, including options to purchase the ships.
Purchase of two Channel ferries completed The purchase of two Channel ferries purpose built for the Dover Strait was completed on 23 June 2017. In June 2015, DFDS and Eurotunnel entered into long-term bareboat charter agreements for the two Channel ferries. A put

option agreement was also entered into providing Eurotunnel with the right to require DFDS to purchase the ferries. This put option was exercised on 23 June 2017.
The purchase of the ferries amounted to DKK 739m. An additional amount of DKK 111m was paid to Eurotunnel and is subject to litigation due to a disagreement concerning the purchase price. DFDS is confident to be successful in the arbitration.
Order of two additional freight ships (ro-ro) to boost efficiency To enable our freight customers to grow their business and to support trade and growth in Europe, two additional freight ship (ro-ro) new buildings were ordered in June 2017 for delivery in early 2020. Both ships are planned to be deployed in DFDS' route network on the North Sea.
The ships are similar to the two ships ordered in September 2016, for delivery in early 2019, and are likewise de-

signed to each carry 6,700 lane metres of freight equivalent to around 450 trailers. The large size of the ships will decrease unit costs as well as the environmental impact per transported unit. The two ships will also be built by Jinling Shipyard in China.
The ships represent a new generation of environmentally friendly ro-ro ships as they comply with the latest environmental rules of the new IMO-standard EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index). Also included are scrubbers for the removal of sulphur, ballast water treatment systems and a number of energy efficiency initiatives.
The investment in the two ships totals around DKK 1.0bn to be paid during the period from ordering to delivery in early 2020. More than half of the payment is due on delivery.
Logistics activities in Belfast refocused DFDS' logistics activities based in Belfast were refocused to improve the return on invested capital. Going forward the focus will be on door-door trailer solutions for ambient cargo, mainly covering Northern Ireland and England/Scotland and contract logistics for major retailers.
The growth and financial performance of the door-door reefer line-haul business between Ireland and Great Britain have in recent years not met expectations and was lossmaking in 2017. This business was divested to Manfreight Ltd. effective from 1 November 2017, including more than 100 employees.

1 CSAT asks customers "How would you rate the overall performance, products and services of DFDS?" and is measured on a 10-point scale (1-Not satisfied at all; 10-Fully satisfied)
2 NPS asks customers "How likely would you be to recommend the products/services of DFDS?" on a 10-point scale (1-Not at all likely; 10-Extremely likely). The NPS is an aggregate score created by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who gave scores from 1 to 6) from the percentage of promoters (those who gave scores of 9 and 10)

The total annual revenue of activities included in the divestment was DKK 250m. A divestment cost of DKK 13m is reported under Special items in Q4 2017 in the UK & Ireland business unit.
The divestment is expected to lead to an earnings improvement for the Belfast activities in 2018.
Operations and finance Customer Focus Initiative (CFI) The overriding aim of DFDS' Customer Focus Initiative (CFI) is to increase customer satisfaction and grow revenues through ongoing improvements in customer experience and spending, retention and acquisition.
Through annual surveys customer satisfaction is monitored for three overall customer segments: freight shipping, transport and logistics solutions and passenger services.

As reported in the table on page 14, the scores for freight shipping services are at a high level although scores decreased somewhat in 2017. This was mainly due to capacity issues on the Gothenburg-Ghent route in the first half of the year and a delay in the introduction of an online booking app on the northern Baltic routes. Customer satisfaction continued to increase on the two routes out of Dover and the two routes out of Rotterdam.
The scores for transport and logistics solutions were on level with 2016. Adjusted for the addition of new locations in 2017, scores were below 2016 mainly due to activities in UK & Ireland where timely communication is becoming increasingly important to customers.
The number of freight locations that received a score of excellent (NPS of 50 or above) from customers increased to 33% while 17% received a score of very good (NPS of 30 or above).

On a scale from 1 to 10 passengers awarded a score of 8.0 points up from 7.9 in 2016 while the NPS-score increased to 35 from 31. The improvement was mainly due to higher scores from passengers on the Channel while scores for the two cruise routes were negatively impacted by changes in the on board entertainment.
Efficiency and improvement projects The pursuit of continuous improvement through targeted efficiency and improvement projects will in 2018 focus on several projects:
 Pricing & yield: improve revenue growth through enhanced capacity utilisation on both freight and passenger routes
 Starlight: improve on board experience and performance of the two cruise ferry routes
 Carpe Momentum: completion of project to improve on board sales and spend per passenger on Channel routes

NOK 1.25bn corporate bond issued On 22 September, a NOK 1,250m senior unsecured bond was issued. The bond is due on 28 September 2022 with a coupon of 3-month Nibor +132 bps and priced at par. NOK was subsequently hedged against DKK and the interest rate was swapped into a floating Danish interest rate. The main purpose of the bond issue was to refinance existing bonds and extend debt maturity.

IT and digital development 2017 saw intense focus on the way of working with business development, digital developments and IT. During the year decision-making processes were aligned and both the governance model and the working practice in this area were streamlined. There is continued focus both on the core transactional systems that support the business processes in IT, and on customer-facing experiences in Digital, and this is now underpinned by a significant push to develop a more agile architecture and increased cross-functional collaboration.
In 2018, some of the benefits are expected to be realised of this new operating model, which is geared to improving time to market, the ability to scale efforts and the management of a portfolio that balances internal process support, customer experience, smart data and innovation initiatives.
Planned investment in IT and Digital development continues to grow, with funds allocated primarily to architecture development, application portfolio renewals and IT & cyber security.
In addition, the annual strategy review in 2018 will focus on future customer requirements for digital capabilities and assess new technologies and business models.
IT development ­ getting the basics right The basis for digital transformation is a foundation of modern and well-functioning core systems. Seabook for passengers and Velocity for Logistics have been rolled out

across all business units, so a uniform IT platform is available everywhere. This enables provision of the same services across all routes and offices, while also allowing for process standardisation and best practice. Development of core backend systems is a time-consuming task, compromising the efforts on improved time-tomarket. To break that deadlock, the core systems are being broken up into smaller components, communicating both internally and externally via standardised API's (Application Programming Interface). This is a fundamental step towards working in ecosystems, rather than developing the full stack internally.
Both the concept of working in ecosystems via API's and the emerging IoT (Internet of Things) initiatives require improved connectivity and systems integration. Investments are therefore made in private 4G networks, radio links and other technologies to provide wifi capabilities on port terminals and ships. The system integrations team is strengthened, and software robots are used to bypass the need for manual steps.
DFDS is also involved in the Ferrygateway initiative that aims at standardising and simplifying the information flow between agents and ferry operators.
Customer experience, smart data and innovation Independent benchmarking studies commissioned in 2016 and 2017 show DFDS getting ever closer to the goal of delivering a best-in-industry customer experience via the responsive web presence. New apps were launched to support shipping freight customers ­ making the check-in pro-

Paris 8:26 PM Every year more than 15,000 truckloads of salmon and seafood pass through DFDS' transport centre in Larkhall to end up as a delicacy on the world's dinner tables. DFDS transports the fish from the coastal sea farms to Larkhall for refrigerated storage before transporting it to retailers and other customers in the UK and France - and to airports for onward transportation to Asia or the US.

cess at the terminal in Vlaardingen smoother and providing useful notifications for customers approaching the busy Channel ports.
Digital marketing efforts on web only have started to directly generate sales to shipping and logistics customers, while campaigns on web and social media to attract drivers and hauliers have supported delivery of road transport solutions.
Behind the scenes, digital teams have been developing a new customer experience management (CEM) platform in close collaboration with both IT and business stakeholders. This, in parallel with the reorganisation of the Passenger sales organisation, will enable more efficient support of a fully localized web presence across all business areas, and to automate more of the digital marketing effort.
During 2018 there will be a series of releases to establish the fully integrated web presence and the CEM platform. In combination with GDPR compliance (General Data Protection Regulation in EU), a new solution for user identity and access management is being implemented. This will over time provide customers with transparency on data collection. This will also support the full roll out and activation of the new MyDFDS solutions for freight and logistics customers.
A small, dedicated innovation team has been established to focus on radical technology and business model development. In parallel, a team of four data scientists are working on smart data solutions and experiments. For the

past three years, development has been ongoing of competences and culture to be fit to adapt to a more digital future for our industry, and now it is time to be a part of shaping it. DFDS expects over time to become part of an emerging transport ecosystem, underpinned by automation, connectivity and alternative energies, and with realtime data transparency throughout the supply chain. We will develop our role and partnerships in this ecosystem as we continue to experiment with both new technologies and new business models.
People and environment Reporting on people and environment is part of DFDS' CSR report. A summary of the report is included on page 37 and the full CSR Report for 2017 is available from this link: http://www.dfdsgroup.com/about/responsibility/.
Employees DFDS' HR activities aim to support people and business units in making the right decisions with regard to recruitment, retention, employee and management development, talent spotting, performance management, compensation and benefits as well as organisational efficiency. More information about employees and HR management is available from DFDS' CSR report, www.dfds.com/group/about/responsibility
Customer Focus Initiative (CFI) Being easy to work with, fast communication and bringing solutions to customers are the cornerstones of customer focus in DFDS.

CFI builds on both operational and sales excellence. Firstly, we must deliver what we promise and should exceptions arise procedures are in place to handle such situations, for example in connection with weather delays. Secondly, we continue to improve on bringing value-adding solutions to customers that, for example, can reduce warehousing costs or improve supply chains in other ways.
Our way of selling focuses on understanding customer's pain points and exploiting DFDS' wide network and specialised competencies to provide solutions. In Gothenburg, a new joint way of approaching customers with solutions that combine shipping and logistics is being tested with good results.
Passenger sales is already digitised to a large extent as more than 80% of bookings are made on line. Freight sales is increasingly being digitised and in the future this will be supported by smart data analysis. This can, for example, recognise changes in behaviour patterns among customers that can be helpful with regard to retention and offering of solutions that match customer needs as they develop over time.
As part of the CFI, a sales training programme for all sales people, direct sales and customer service, has been developed and implemented from year-end 2013. At the end of 2017 more than 350 sales people had completed the programme and started an 18 months certification included in the second phase of the programme. The certification ensures implementation of essential tools and tracking of documented sales accomplishments.

Major events after 2017
European logistics network expanded with Alphatrans To further expand and develop DFDS' European logistics services, the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of the Dutch company Alphatrans Group BV was completed on 3 January 2018 and will be consolidated in the DFDS Group per the same date.
Alphatrans provides transport solutions for customers with general and exceptional cargo using flatbed trailers and other specialised equipment. The fleet of 720 flatbed trailers and 125 trucks makes Alphatrans one of the largest flatbed trailer operators serving continental Europe, UK and Ireland.
In addition to UK and Netherlands, Alphatrans also has own haulage operations based in Hungary and Romania to support the customer solutions. Alphatrans has 197 employees and annual revenues of EUR 45m.
Alphatrans expands DFDS' activities between continental Europe and UK. It also adds Portugal to the network and provides access to haulage capacity and new customers.
DFDS has been developing traffic which specifically requires flatbed trailers, particularly between Sweden and the Baltics, and Alphatrans brings additional knowledge to enable further development across the DFDS network. Further operational synergies, including the combination of offices, are also expected.

Increased dividend and new share buyback The Board of Directors proposed on 8 February 2018 to the 2018 annual general meeting (AGM) a dividend of DKK 4.00 per share. In addition, the Board of Directors plan to distribute a further dividend of DKK 7.00 per share in August 2018. The total dividend per share is thus expected to increase 10% to DKK 11.00 per share in 2018.
The total dividend payment in 2018 is expected to amount to around DKK 580m, excluding dividend for treasury shares.
In addition, a share buyback of DKK 400m was launched on 8 February 2018 for completion on 15 August 2018 at the latest.
Later in the first half of 2018, the Board of Directors will reassess the capital structure, including further share buybacks, in view of potential investments.
Baltic routes to be strengthened by investment in two new ships The Baltic region is expected to continue to grow and prosper in the future. To improve our ability to support the growth of our freight customers and offer the best possible travel experience for passengers, the ordering of two combined freight and passenger new buildings (ro-pax) was announced on 12 February 2018 for delivery in Q1 and Q3 2021 respectively.

The ships are designed to each carry 4,500 lane metres of freight and passenger vehicles as well as 600 passengers. The two ships will be built by Guangzhou Shipyard International Co, Ltd. at their Nansha Yard in China.
Both ships are planned to be deployed on one of the routes connecting Lithuania with either Sweden or Germany. The deployment in 2021 is planned to be a catalyst for a reallocation of ships in the Baltic route network ultimately increasing the network's total freight capacity by around 30%.
The ships are built to the newest, environmental standard offering the lowest possible consumption and emissions. Scrubbers will also be installed on the ships.

Financial goals and capital structure
Return on invested capital (ROIC) DFDS' financial performance goal is a minimum ROIC of 10% over a business cycle. A 10% return is also the threshold rate used for assessing investments and acquisitions.
The achievement of the ROIC goal is underpinned by DFDS' ROIC Drive programme covering around 90 business activities. The programme includes a simple ROIC-scorecard, high-level three-year business plans, local sparring sessions with top management and internal performance benchmarking.
The Group's ROIC, including special items, was 18.6% in 2017 compared to 17.7% in 2016. Before special items, the return was 19.0% in 2017 compared to 17.8% in 2016. At the start of 2017, DFDS' cost of capital after tax was calculated at 5.5%. The ROIC is likewise calculated after tax.
In the Shipping Division, the ROIC of all five business units were above the 10% goal, ranging from 16% in North Sea to 36% in France & Med.
In the Logistics Division, the ROIC of Nordic and Continent were well above 10% while UK & Ireland's ROIC was below 10%.
For several activities within the business units of both divisions, the ROIC was, however, below the 10% minimum

goal in 2017. A primary focus of the ROIC Drive programme is to contribute to improving the performance of such activities by encouraging and monitoring the implementation of business plans, supplemented by structural solutions if required.
Capital structure The leverage of DFDS' capital structure is defined as the ratio of net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) to operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA). Target leverage is an

Business model and assets
Business model DFDS operates freight and passenger ferry routes as well as port terminal services supporting the routes. In addition, DFDS provides transport and logistics solutions that to a large extent are based on using DFDS' routes as part of the solution.
In total, around 80% of DFDS' revenue derives from freight activities and 20% derives from passenger activities.
To operate ferry routes and port terminals, including warehousing, a range of assets are deployed, mainly owned and chartered ships, leased and owned port terminals, and cargo carrying equipment.
The shipping of un- and accompanied trailers for forwarders and hauliers is the main activity of the route network. On the North Sea, trailers are mainly unaccompanied while trailers on the Baltic Sea mainly are accompanied requiring ro-pax ships with cabins to accommodate drivers on the crossings. On the Channel, trailers are likewise accompanied but no cabins are required due to the short duration of the crossing. On a number of routes, mostly from Scandinavia to the UK and the Continent, heavy industrial cargo is carried for manufacturers. This typically requires specialised equipment as well as port terminal and warehousing services.

Combining freight and passengers is an option in many ferry markets and key to the business model. The requirements of both customer types are accommodated by deploying ships with different combinations of freight and passenger capacity, including on board facilities for passengers and drivers.

To provide transport and logistics solutions DFDS mainly deploys owned and leased trailers while most transport typically is subcontracted to a network of carriers, i.e. hauliers, rail operators, ferry operators and container shipping operators. DFDS deploys own drivers and trucks in some contract logistics and distribution activities. A number of warehouses are also operated as part of the contract logistics services.

Annual Report / p 1213

Assets and invested capital At the end of 2017, the Shipping Division operated 40 ships in the route network of which 30 were owned and 10 ships were chartered in for varying periods.
The Shipping Division's ownership share of assets is determined by the degree of specialisation of ships required to match customer requirements on different routes. In addition, ferry companies with own route networks have in recent years increased their share of the ownership of ferries. Partly due to the specialisation and larger size of ships and partly due to fewer companies focused on a pure ship owner strategy in the ferry sector.
The specialisation of ro-ro- and ro-pax-ships is contingent on capacity requirements for passengers and freight, configuration of passenger areas, loading capacity, especially for heavy freight, hanging decks for cars, sailing speed, fuel efficiency and ramps, including requirements for the speed of turnaround in ports.
The lifespan of ro-ro-based freight and passenger tonnage is normally 30­35 years and the duration of port-terminal leases is typically 25­30 years.

At the end of 2017, the total invested capital was DKK 9,099m, including a net working capital of DKK -826m defined as all non-interest bearing non-current and current assets and liabilities. 86% of the invested capital consisted of ships and 12% consisted of port terminals, land and buildings and cargo carrying equipment.
The Shipping Division's invested capital was DKK 8,160m at year-end 2017 while the Logistics Division's invested capital was DKK 1,109m. The invested capital of non-allocated items was negative by DKK 170m.

Annual Report / p 1224

Outlook 2018
DFDS has over the past five years achieved a considerably higher level of earnings.
New customer agreements, continuous improvement projects and tailwind from European growth is expected to underpin and drive further earnings improvement.
On top of organic growth, acquisitions are also expected to increase earnings but are not included in the outlook.
In 2018, DFDS will invest in further development of digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and gain operational efficiencies. This is expected to entail additional costs of around DKK 100m as well as increased investments.
The Passenger business unit is expected to remain challenged by weaker market trends in Norway and UK as well as higher bunker and other costs.
The outlook for two key income currencies, NOK and SEK, is also not favorable compared to 2017.
European real GDP growth looks set to continue at a level of around 2% in 2018. This includes growth projections for the UK economy of around 1%.

Outlook 2018
DKK m Revenue growth EBITDA before special items Per division: Shipping Division Logistics Division Non-allocated items Depreciation increase Special items Investments
Revenue outlook The Group's revenue is expected to increase by around 2% driven by a mix of volume and price growth. The planned increase of the route network's capacity is overall limited for both freight and passengers, except for large increases on two freight routes.
Non-comparable revenue items in 2017 and 2018, divested activities and acquisitions, are on level and no adjustments are therefore included in the above growth outlook.
Freight volumes, particularly un-accompanied units, are expected to grow on most routes. Volume growth levels on routes calling the UK are expected to decline compared to 2017 due to expectations of a slowdown in UK GDPgrowth to around 1%.

Outlook 2018 2%
2,650-2,850
2,475-2,625 275-325 -100 4% -20 -1,300

2017 14,328
2,702
2,513 263 -74 -933 -41
-1,564

Passenger volumes are expected to be on level with 2017 as UK passenger volumes were normalised during 2017 following the depreciation of GBP since the Brexit vote in 2016.
Pricing is expected to remain competitive in both freight and passenger markets.
EBITDA outlook The Group's EBITDA before special items is expected to be within a range of DKK 2,650-2,850m (2017: DKK 2,702m).
The Shipping Division's EBITDA before special items is expected to be within a range of DKK 2,475-2,625m (2017: DKK 2,513m).
The Logistics Division's EBITDA before special items is expected to be within a range of DKK 275-325m (2017: DKK 263m).

Annual Report / p 1235

Special items Special items of DKK -20m are expected related to the award of shares to employees in connection with DFDS' 150th anniversary.
Investments Investments of around DKK 1.3bn are expected in 2018:
· Dockings and ship upgrades: DKK 350m · Freight ship (ro-ro) new buildings: DKK 500m · Port terminals: DKK 200m · Cargo carrying equipment and warehouses, mainly re-
lated to the Logistics Division: DKK 150m · Other investments, including IT and digital: DKK 100m.
A total of six new buildings are on order. Two freight ships (ro-ro) for delivery in the beginning of 2019 and another two for delivery in the beginning of 2020. Two combined freight and passenger ships (ro-pax) are on order for delivery in Q1 and Q3 2021 respectively.

A number of risks and uncertainties pertain to the outlook. The most important among these are possible major changes in the demand for ferry shipping and transport and logistics services. For DFDS, such demand is to a large extent linked to the level of economic activity in primarily Europe, especially northern Europe and in particular the UK following its decision to leave the EU, but also adjacent regions, as well as to competitor actions.
The outlook can also be impacted by political changes, first and foremost within the EU, as well as changes in economic variables, especially the oil price and exchange rates. Consequently, the future financial results may differ significantly from expectations.
Risk factors are reviewed on pages 39-42 in this report.

Immingham 4:30 PM Steel coils are stored in DFDS warehouses and transported across the sea on our ships. The reliable delivery of the steel keeps the production of machines, cars and other products running, maintaining local jobs and activities.

The Shipping Division's revenue increased 2% adjusted for the acquisition of a route and currency changes and excluding bunker surcharges while reported revenue increased by 4% to DKK 9,892m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items increased 7% to DKK 1,727m.
The return on invested capital, ROIC, before special items increased to 20.7% in 2017 from 19.6% in 2016. Average invested capital increased 1% to DKK 8,264m compared to 2016.
North Sea Revenue increased 6% excluding bunker surcharges while reported revenue increased 10% to DKK 3,699m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items increased 30% to DKK 670m.
Freight volumes increased 7% supported by 4% higher shipping capacity, continued growth in trading between UK and the Continent and higher automotive volumes from Sweden. The growth was thus primarily driven by the routes between UK-Continent and Sweden-Continent. On the former, a fourth ship was deployed on one route for most of the first half-year and on the latter, a fourth ship was deployed for most of the second half-year.
Higher volumes through the port terminals in the UK and Benelux also improved earnings.

Baltic sea Revenue decreased 1% adjusted for the acquisition of the Paldiski-Hanko route in October 2016 and excluding bunker surcharges. Reported revenue increased 9% to DKK 1,465m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items increased 5% to DKK 379m.
Freight volumes increased 13% while they decreased 1% adjusted for the addition of a new route, Paldiski-Hanko, in October 2016. Trading was overall stable in the Baltic region during the year, although some loss of market share was incurred between Sweden and Lithuania due to an extended docking period in the beginning of the year. From Q2, an additional ship was deployed following demand for more capacity.
Passenger volumes decreased 2% and by 3% adjusted for the addition of Paldiski-Hanko. The lower volumes were due to fewer passengers between Sweden and Estonia.

Channel Revenue decreased 1% adjusted for currency changes and excluding bunker surcharges while reported revenue increased 1% to DKK 2,306m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items decreased 12% to DKK 350m.
Freight volumes decreased 6% while passenger volumes were on level with 2016. The lower freight volumes was primarily due to Dover-Dunkirk as the route was negatively impacted by transfer of volumes back to Calais following the closure of the migrant camp in Calais in Q4 2016. In addition, some market share loss was incurred as freight rate increases at the beginning of the year coincided with a sharp increase in the bunker surcharge. This market share loss was mostly regained over the course of the year.
Passenger volumes were likewise down on Dover-Dunkirk but this was offset by higher volumes on Dover-Calais. Revenue per passenger was negatively impacted by the depreciation of GBP.

Activities and business model DFDS' Shipping Division operates one of the largest networks of ferry routes in Northern Europe providing both freight and passenger services.
Freight shipping services The routes are ideally located to service the freight volumes of forwarders, hauliers and manufacturers of heavy industrial goods. All routes operate on fixed, reliable schedules with a frequency adapted to customers' requirements.
Further visibility for customers is available by access to online tracking of shipments.
Bespoke shipping logistics solutions are developed in partnership with manufacturers of heavy goods such as automobiles, metals, paper and forest products, and chemicals.
To further enhance the efficiency of customer services, own port terminals are operated in strategic locations, including warehousing services.
Passenger ferry services The route network offers both overnight and short crossings. Passenger cars are transported on all routes. The on board facilities are adapted to each route's particular mix of passengers and their requirements for enjoying maritime travel.

France & Mediterranean Revenue increased 1% adjusted for currency changes and excluding bunker surcharges while reported revenue was on level with 2016. EBIT before special items increased 19% to DKK 13m.
Freight volumes decreased 5% and passenger volumes decreased 4%. The lower freight and passenger volumes were due to somewhat weaker market conditions in the Western Channel while volumes in the Mediterranean market increased. The concession agreement of the Newhaven-Dieppe route expired at the end of 2017 and was replaced with a new 5-year agreement running up to and including 2022.
Passenger Revenue decreased 2% adjusted for currency changes and excluding bunker surcharges while reported revenue likewise decreased 2% to DKK 1,674m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items decreased 28% to DKK 183m.
Passenger volumes increased 3% driven by both routes. The Norwegian market weakened through the year, also due to depreciation of NOK in the second half of the year, while the inflow of overseas passengers continued to increase. The UK market stabilised through the year following the large depreciation of GBP in 2016. Continent markets remained robust in the year.

The significant decrease in EBIT was mainly due to changes in the passenger mix that reduced on board sales, particularly on the Scandinavian route, and an increase in the bunker cost. In addition, freight volumes, that are mostly driver-accompanied, decreased 7%.
Non-allocated items Non-allocated items primarily include activities related to external chartering of ships not deployed in the route network.
Revenue decreased 2% to DKK 478m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items increased 78% to DKK 133m as 2016 was negatively impacted by the reclassification of a ship from assets held for sale to continuing operations as well as costs related to preparation of the ship for an external charter. In addition, 2017 includes a one-off income from a settlement with a former bunker supplier's bankruptcy estate.

Head of division Eddie Green
Share of DFDS Group revenue 2017 34%
Business areas  Nordic  Continent  UK & Ireland
· Revenue up 8%, adjusted
· EBIT up 3%
· ROIC of 13%

The Logistics Division's full-year revenue increased 5% to DKK 5,160m and by 8% adjusted for currency changes, primarily depreciation of GBP, the acquisitions of Shetland Transport and Italcargo, in November and December 2016 respectively, and the divested Belfast activity in 2017. EBIT before special items increased 3% to DKK 166m.
The return on invested capital, ROIC, before special items decreased slightly to 13.1% in 2017 from 13.4% in 2016. Average invested capital increased 4% to DKK 1,128m.
Nordic Revenue increased 18% to DKK 1,898m compared to 2016 and EBIT before special items increased 16% to DKK 62m.
Volumes and market conditions between Scandinavia and UK generally improved during the year, particularly for the Swedish activities. New contract logistics activities in Sweden also increased earnings as did the acquisition of Italcargo.
This was offset by higher operating costs in the rail, sideport shipping and Baltic activities that decreased margins.

Annual Report / p 2303

Continent Revenue increased 4% to DKK 2,035m compared to 2016 and EBIT before special items increased 36% to DKK 65m.
The improved result was mostly due to the forwarding activities in the Netherlands-UK and Belgium-Scandinavia corridors. Volumes and the share of solutions for valuable goods with higher margins were both increased. New contract logistics activities also added to the result.
The result for the German activities remained flat despite some loss of volumes. The Italian activities continued to be lossmaking in 2017 while the activities in the Czech Republic continued to grow strongly.
To further expand and develop DFDS' European logistics services, the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of the Dutch company Alphatrans Group BV was completed on 3 January 2018 and will be consolidated in the DFDS Group per the same date. See also page 19.
UK & Ireland Revenue increased 6% adjusted for the acquisition of Shetland Transport in November 2016, the divested Belfast activity and currency changes. Reported revenue decreased 7% to DKK 1,388m compared to 2016. EBIT before special items decreased 34% to DKK 40m, including a negative currency impact of DKK 6m.
The growth and financial performance of the Belfast reefer activity became lossmaking in 2017 and was divested to Manfreight Ltd. effective from 1 November 2017. This amounted to just over half of the decrease in EBIT. Costs

and write-downs of DKK 13m related to the sale of the reefer activity are reported under Special items.
The result for the continuing activities was positively impacted by the full-year effect of the acquisition of Shetland Transport in November 2016 and trading above 2016 for most activities. This was however more than offset by a lower operating margin for the acquaculture activities based in Grimsby following changes in the market. In addition, start-up costs related to a new refri-gerated distribution contract also reduced the result.
The performance of the acquaculture activities based in Scotland was stable in 2017.
Non-allocated items Revenue of non-allocated items is mainly related to an internal trailer equipment pool.

CSR summary
Safety and security People Environment

At DFDS, we recognise that our role as a supplier of vital services to Europe's transport infrastructure entails a high level of responsibility. We seek to contribute to sustainability and safety by focusing on areas where our influence and impact matter the most.
Year in review As signatories to the UN Global Compact we support the Compact as part of our CSR-approach. During 2017, we embedded the principles in our Code of Business Conduct, which provides guidance to our employees on behaviour and actions.
We strive to have a strong safety culture and continuously improve safety performance. Unfortunately, a fatality occurred in 2017 during the unloading of a freight ship in Tunisia. A full investigation into the accident has been conducted to avoid such accidents in the future.
With the exception of the above mentioned tragic accident, progress was in general made on safety in 2017. Both the accident frequency and the injury severity were lowered compared to 2016. Targets have been set to further improve safety performance both at sea and ashore. More information on safety performance is available in the full CSR Report.
As part of Europe's transport infrastructure, DFDS encounters migrants from the African continent and the Middle East. In 2017, a serious incident occurred when 12 migrants were forced to remain on board our ship Kaunas Seaways on the Black Sea for three months until a diplomatic solution was found.

Annual Report / p 2348

The total consumption of bunker oil increased 4% in 2017 due to more sailings but the average consumption of oil and emissions continued to decrease per capacity unit per mile. Reductions in fuel consumption continue to be of importance from environmental, compliance and financial perspectives.
Looking ahead, we expect to launch an updated CSR-strategy in 2018 to improve on our contribution to sustainability for all our stakeholders. The strategy update is inspired by customers, industry leaders and the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and not least our purpose ­ we move for all to grow.

Annual Report / p 2359

Risk factors
Risk management is an integral part of DFDS' management processes
Risks and opportunities are regularly reviewed and reported to the Board of Directors for appropriate responses and actions

General and specific operational risks
Macro-economic and market risks Risks of major fluctuations in earnings caused by market changes and changes in economic growth are higher for the Group's ferry shipping activities than for the transport and logistics activities. The difference in risk profile is due to a high share of fixed costs in ferry shipping as opposed to a high share of variable costs in transport and logistics as the majority of transport services is subcontracted to external carriers. This entails more flexibility to adapt activities to changes in demand.
The demand for ferry shipping of freight and passengers is reflected in customer volumes, which in turn are impacted by the general state of the economy and changes in economic variables such as exchange rates. Decreasing demand can lead to overcapacity, which can be remedied by reducing frequency of departures, replacing incumbent ships with smaller ships or by removing a ship from a route or, ultimately, by route closure. Overcapacity tends to increase downward pressure on prices and, hence, entails a risk of lower profitability.
Partly in order to counteract cyclical demand risk, part of the freight fleet is chartered to enhance flexibility. DFDS aims to charter a share of the fleet on contracts of shorter duration with options for extension to provide opportunities for redelivery of ships at a few months' notice.
All passenger ferries in the fleet are owned by DFDS which limits the options for adapting passenger capacity in the

2017

Annual Report / p 2460

short term. DFDS' container activities mainly deploy chartered ships through vessel sharing and slot charter agreements with container shipping companies, which provides flexibility. To a large extent, DFDS' logistics activities lease equipment.
DFDS' geographic diversification across mostly northern Europe, including activities related to Russia and adjacent countries, reduces dependence on individual markets. In addition, the diversified route network and logistics activities balance commercial risks, including opportunities for reallocation of ships between routes.
Freight and passenger shipping markets can, moreover, be impacted by changes in market conditions faced by competing transport modes such as road, rail and air ­ the latter mainly impacts the passenger sector.
In addition, markets are impacted by changes in local and regional competition, such as the opening or closing of competing routes and capacity increases on existing routes. On a few routes, a significant proportion of freight volumes are derived from a few industrial customers. Risks inherent in such relationships are mitigated by multiple-year customer contracts that also reflect investment requirements to service such contracts.
The shipping charter market and new buildings DFDS charters mainly freight ships for varying periods. Such charters are subject to price risks (charter rates) and risks concerning availability of ships that fit operational requirements. Similar risks, including counterparty risks, are relevant when chartering out excess ships. In addition,

there is a price risk related to the timing of acquiring or ordering ships. In connection with the ordering of ships, there is a default risk related to the shipyards constructing the ships, which can lead to additional costs, including delayed delivery.
Due to the ongoing process of replacing and renewing the fleet, the sale of ships or the cancellation of new building contracts may result in gains or losses and costs that cannot be anticipated in annual profit forecasts.
Risks associated with business development and investment DFDS' growth strategy entails business development and investment risks. This is related to both organic growth from investment in ships and growth driven by acquisition of companies and activities. The most important risk associated with organic growth is related to the expansion of capacity on a route by deployment of a larger ship(s).
The acquisition of companies and activities involves significant risks that are proportionate to the size of the investment and the complexity of a subsequent integration process. Risks associated with business development ventures are managed by thorough planning and decisionmaking processes governed by internal policies and guidelines for investment decisions, including a required rate of return on investments.

Operational, security and environmental risks The main operational risks are associated with ships and port terminals. Technical problems and accidents may lead to unplanned periods in dock, interruption of sailing schedules, and loss of revenue. Replacement tonnage can usually be deployed at short notice through chartering. In order to minimise operational risks, DFDS has a systematic and comprehensive maintenance programme in place for all ships, including regular docking schedules. In addition, extreme weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations, and strikes in ports can also disrupt services.
In the course of ordinary operations, DFDS deploys freight and passenger ships, port terminals, warehouses and cargo-carrying equipment, all of which are subject to the usual safety risks associated with such equipment. These risks are controlled and minimised partly through compliance with safety requirements and routines, as well as preventative work, and partly through insurance against risk.
More information on health and safety is available from www.dfds.com/group/about/responsibility
Environmental and safety measures are based on DFDS' environmental and safety policies, as well as rules and regulations and customer requirements. Changes in these factors can increase costs. The Group is insured against personal injury and environmental risks in line with industry standards, and participates in preparatory legislative procedures through industry organisations.

Copenhagen 11:03 AM DFDS has developed freight ferry and terminal apps for drivers and freight customers. Those are steps in a digital transformation of DFDS that will make it even easier for our customers to work with us via computers and mobile devices for booking, paying and planning round the clock. Next steps may include more automated functions, autonomous vessels and even new business models.

Annual Report / p 2472

More information on environmental risks is available from www.dfds.com/group/about/responsibility
Digital disruption New digital business models or platforms are emerging within the transport and logistics industry. Such platforms primarily seek to digitise the intermediary role between manufacturers and end users that today is managed by freight forwarders. To compete with such platforms, DFDS is developing digital solutions for freight customers and monitoring changes in the business environment closely in order to protect activities and exploit business development opportunities.
There are no perceived imminent digital threats related to ferry route operations, although a number of digital solutions are being implemented and developed to enhance the customer experience for both freight customers and passengers.
IT risks Disruptions to critical systems through breakdowns or virus and other cyberattacks can have a significant negative impact on commercial operations and thereby earnings. The scope of such risks is reduced by increasing investment in cyber security measures, constant monitoring of systems, installation of back-up systems and having proven procedures in place to restore functionality of systems.
Information security risks are related to the handling of data for passengers and freight customers. Such risks are

mitigated by internal controls and adherence to rules and regulations governing information security.
Political and legal risks
DFDS' activities are impacted by changes in rules and regulations governing the shipping and transport sector, as well as changes in the overall conditions that impact Europe's infrastructure. In addition to political bodies, DFDS is subject to International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions. The IMO is the UN body responsible for maritime issues, primarily safety and environment.
Changes in the above rules and regulations can have negative financial consequences, including higher costs and changes in the travel patterns of passengers and routing of freight, including the distribution between sea and land transport.
Other significant political risks concern the outcome of the Brexit-negotiations between UK and EU of which rules governing trade are most important for DFDS. Should UK leave the current customs union in March 2019 or after an extension period running until March 2021, then new trade rules could entail longer transit time in ports which could cause congestion and impact volumes. On the other hand, income from customs clearance services and tax free sales could mitigate possible negative effects.
Other possible changes concern taxation arrangements for staff at sea, the abolition of duty-free sales on ferry trips

from Norway if the country were to join the EU, cancellation of applicable VAT exemptions and changes to tonnage tax schemes. DFDS actively monitors these issues, including by participation in industry organisations.
Bunker risk
The cost of bunker was DKK 1.3bn in 2017 equal to 11% of the Group's total costs. Around 87% of the bunker consumption is commercially hedged through bunker clauses (BAF: bunker adjustment factor) in freight customer contracts. Hedging of USD is included in the BAF. The remaining consumption is consumed on passenger routes and financially hedged as appropriate.
In 2018, the consumption of bunker in the Shipping Division is expected to amount to around 500,000 tons. Currently, around 20% of the bunker consumed on passenger routes is financially hedged. A price change of 1% compared to the price level at year-end 2017 is expected to impact operating profit by around DKK 1.7m in 2018.
Financial risks

Financial review
Earnings level further increased
Revenue increased 4% to DKK 14.3bn
EBITDA increased 4% to DKK 2.7bn

Reporting structure DFDS' activities are organised in two divisions: the Shipping Division operating five business units and the Logistics Division operating three business units. The Group Non-allocated items consist of corporate costs not allocated to either division. Each of the divisions also have Non-allocated items which mainly include external charter activities in the Shipping Division and an equipment pool in the Logistics Division.
In order to provide a more transparent view of income and expenses, larger items that are considered not to have a recurring nature are classified as special items in the income statement.
Revenue Reported revenue increased 3.9% to DKK 14,328m in 2017 and by 3.5% adjusted for currency changes, acquisitions, the divested Belfast reefer activity and excluding revenue from bunker surcharges.
The Shipping Division's revenue increased 4.5% to DKK 9,892m and by 1.9% adjusted for currency changes, primarily depreciation of GBP, acquistion of a route and excluding revenue from bunker surcharges. The growth was primarily driven by higher freight volumes in the North Sea business unit as revenue was on level with 2016 in the other business units when adjusted for the acquisition of a route and excluding bunker surcharges.
The Logistics Division's revenue increased 4.7% to DKK 5,160m and by 8.1% adjusted for currency changes, primarily depreciation of GBP, the acquisitions of Shetland

Transport and Italcargo, in November and December 2016 respectively, and the divested Belfast reefer activity. Revenue growth was boosted in the Nordic business unit by new contract logistics activities. Continued growth in trading between the Continent and UK supported growth in Continent while mostly new cold store contracts increased UK & Ireland's revenue excluding adjustments.
EBITDA before special items Operating profit before depreciation, EBITDA, and special items increased 4% to DKK 2,702m.
The Shipping Division's EBITDA increased 3% to DKK 2,513m. The increase was mainly due to higher freight earnings in North Sea and Baltic Sea. The result for Non-allocated items, that relate to external charters, also increased. This was offset by lower passenger earnings in Channel and Passenger. Bunker costs also increased and reduced Passenger's result.
The Logistics Division's EBITDA increased 4% to DKK 263m. Earnings improved in the Nordic and Continent business units driven by the higher activity levels. The result for UK & Ireland decreased as the Belfast reefer activity became lossmaking and start-up costs were incurred for a new contract.
The Group cost of Non-allocated items decreased 29% to DKK -74m from DKK -103m in 2016.
Associates and profit on sale of assets The share of profit in associates and joint ventures was DKK 6m, an improvement of DKK 9m mainly related to the

port terminal activity Gothenburg RoRo. Profit on the sale of non-current assets amounted to DKK 7m.
Depreciation, impairment and EBIT Total depreciation and impairment decreased 2% to DKK 933m. A positive variance of DKK 24m was due to a one-off write-down on ship equipment in 2016 and a partial reversal of the write-down in 2017. Depreciations were otherwise mainly higher on software and IT-systems.
The Group's EBIT before special items increased 8% to DKK 1,782m.
Special items and EBIT Special items in 2017 was a net cost of DKK 41m primarily due to costs related to the award of anniversary shares to all employees, closure of own port operations in Esbjerg

and sale of the Belfast reefer activity. More information on special items is available in Note 2.6 on page 75.
Operating profit, EBIT, after special items was DKK 1,741m, an increase of 7%.
Financing The net cost of financing was DKK 55m, a decrease of DKK 4m compared to 2016 after adjustment for one-off incomes of DKK 25m from the sale of shares in Danish Ship Finance in 2016 and DKK 10m from a settlement with a former bunker supplier's bankruptcy estate in 2017. The remaining positive variance was primarily due to lower net interest costs.

Jinling, China 2:25 PM We are building four new ro-ro freight ships at the Jinling Shipyard in China. The ships will be delivered from 2019 onwards as the largest and `greenest' ever to join our fleet. They will support the exchange of goods across the North Sea, which continued economic growth in the UK and the rest of Europe will be demanding even after Brexit.

Annual Report / p 4668

1. Basis of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Reading guideline In preparing the Annual report, DFDS focuses on ensuring that the content is relevant to the reader, and that the presentation is clear.
In 2017 the structure of the notes in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been restructured, and the notes have been divided into the below five sections: 1. Basis of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) 3. Invested capital 4. Capital structure and finances 5. Other notes
The purpose is to provide a better overview of what drives performance. The structure of the notes reflect DFDS financial performance goal, ROIC, and the structure aims at providing an enhanced understanding of each accounting area, by describing relevant accounting policies and any significant accounting estimates and assessments related thereto in the end of each note.
In continuation hereof a more informative classification of revenue and costs has been made. Operating costs and Charter hire have been splitted into Ship operation and maintenance, Freight handling and Transport Solutions in the Income Statement. There is a further split of Ship operation and maintenance cost in the Costs note 2.3. The Revenue note 2.2 has been splitted further up in order to give a more transparent and informative structure. The comparative figures for 2016 has been adjusted accordingly.
The accounting policies have been made within the framework of the prevailing IFRS standards. The actual text of the standard is not repeated in the notes. The description of accounting policies in the notes form part of the overall description of DFDS accounting policies.
Basis of reporting The 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements of DFDS A/S have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies.
On 22 February 2018, the Board of Directors and the Executive Board considered and approved the 2017 Annual report of DFDS A/S. The Annual report will be presented to the shareholders of DFDS A/S for approval at the ordinary Annual General Meeting on 19 March 2018.
Basis for preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements are presented in Danish Kroner (DKK) which is the Parent Company's functional currency.
The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements are prepared according to the historical cost convention except that derivatives and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value.
Non-current assets and Assets held for disposal presented as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount before the changed presentation and the fair value less costs to sell.
The accounting policies set out below and in the notes have been used consistently in respect of the financial year and to comparative figures.

Roundings In general, roundings may cause variances in sums and percentages in the Annual report.
New International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations In 2017, the Group has adopted all relevant new and updated accounting standards. The adoptation has not had any impact on recognition and measurement in the Financial Statements, but has resulted in further specifications in the notes.
The other accounting policies for the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements are unchanged compared with last year.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The IASB has issued a number of new or amended standards and interpretations with effective date post 31 December 2017, some of which have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The new and amended Standards and Interpretations are not mandatory for the financial reporting for 2017. The Group expects to adopt the Standards and Interpretations when they become mandatory.
IFRS 9: Financial instruments was issued in July 2014 and is effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2018. The Group has performed an assessment of IFRS 9, based on which the Group expects no significant impact on recognition and measurement.
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a comprehensive model for recognising revenue from customer contracts. The Group has performed a detailed assessment of IFRS 15. The Group expects the impact to be immaterial (less than 0.2% of the Group's revenue) and it is assessed that the current accounting policy for variable considerations, such as volume rebates, is consistent with IFRS 15.
Thus, the Group has assessed that IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the Group's recognition and measurement of revenue.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2018 and the Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and that comparatives will not be restated.
IFRS 16: Leases: The standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will replace existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases - Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under IFRS 16 an asset (right-of-use asset) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The Group has carried out a preliminary assessment of the possible impact of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the Financial Statements in the period of initial application will depend on uncertain factors, such as the composition of the Group's lease portfolio and the Group's borrowing rates at 1 January 2019 and the Group's assessment of whether it will exercise any lease options.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of DKK 2,7bn (2016: DKK 2,7bn), on an undiscounted basis. Reference is made to note 5.7.

Annual Report / p 4679

1. Basis of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The preliminary assesment indicates that these arrangements in essence will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 and thereby be recognised on the balance sheet, however at discounted values.
Additionally IFRS 16 will also effect the Income statement since the lease payment will be split into interest and depreciation of the right-of-use asset contrary to the practice today, where the annual costs from operational leasing is recognised as one amount above EBITDA. Further the Group's cash flow will also be effected hence the lease payments from operational leases is presented as cash flows from operational activities where they according to IFRS 16 will be presented as payments related to financing activities.
No significant impact is expected for the Group's leases that already are categorised as finance leases.
Except from IFRS 16, none of the other standards and interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on recognition and measurement. However, all standards will lead to further specifications in the notes.
Application of materiality and relevance DFDS' Annual report is based on the concept of materiality and relevance, to ensure that the content is material and relevant to the user. This objective is pursued by providing relevant rather than generic descriptions and information.
When assessing materiality and relevance, due consideration is given to ensure compliance with applicable accounting legislation etc. and to ensure that the Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position at the balance sheet date and the operations and cash flows for the financial year.
The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements consist of a large number of transactions. These transactions are aggregated into classes according to their nature or function and presented in classes of similar items in the Financial Statements and in the notes as required by IFRS. If items are individually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of similar nature in the statements or in the notes. The disclosure requirements throughout IFRS are substantial and DFDS provides these specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the users of these Financial Statements or not relevant for the Group.
Subtotals and alternative performance measures In the Annual report DFDS presents certain financial performance measures such as subtotals and key figures which are not required or defined under IFRS. It is considered that these alternative measures provide relevant supplementary information for the stakeholders of DFDS.
Significant income and expenses which DFDS assesses not to be directly attributable to the operating activities or which are considered non-recurring are presented in the Income statement in a separate line item labelled `Special items' in order to distinguish these items from other income statement items. Reference is made to note 2.6 for more details on Special items. The income statement includes the subtotals `Operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) and special items' and `Operating profit (EBIT) before special items' as these are assessed to provide a more transparent and comparable view of DFDS' recurring operating profit. In note 2.6 it is disclosed how the line items in the income statement would have been affected if the `Special items' had not been presented in a separate line item.
For definitions of key figures please refer to the section `Definitions'.

Significant accounting policies Management considers the accounting policies for the following areas as the most important for the Group: Consolidated Financial Statements; Business combinations; Non-current intangible assets; Ships; Defined benefit pension plans; Deferred tax assets; Operational lease versus financial lease; Derivatives; Special items; Provisions and contingencies. Accounting policies for Consolidated Financial Statements are described below, while accounting policies for the remaining areas are included in the notes to which they relate.
In the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management undertakes a number of accounting estimates and assessments, and makes assumptions which provide the basis for recognition and measurement of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Group and the Parent Company. These estimates, assessments and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors which the Management considers reasonable under the circumstances, but which by their nature are uncertain and unpredictable. The assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events or circumstances may occur, for which reason the actual results may deviate from the applied estimates, assessments and assumptions.
In the opinion of Management, the following accounting estimates and assessments are significant in the preparation of the Annual report: Impairment testing of goodwill and other non-current intangible assets; Impairment testing of ships, including the assessment of useful life and scrap value; Defined benefit pension plans; Deferred tax assets; Leasing arrangements; Derivatives; Provisions and contingencies. Descriptions of the significant accounting estimates and assesments are included in the notes to which they relate.
DESCRIPTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidated Financial Statements The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Parent Company and the subsidiaries in which the Parent Company controls the financial and operational policies. Control is obtained when the Company directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the enterprise (i.e. subsidiary) or if it, in some other way controls the enterprise. The Parent Company and these subsidiaries are referred to as the Group.
Enterprises, which are not subsidiaries, over which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, are considered associates. Significant influence is generally obtained by direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 20% of the voting rights but less than 50% or by, according to agreement, jointly controlling the enterprise together with one or more other companies (joint venture).
The Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the Financial Statements of the Parent Company and the subsidiaries and are prepared by combining items of a uniform nature and eliminating inter-company transactions, shareholdings, balances and unrealised inter-company gains and losses. The Consolidated Financial Statements are based on Financial Statements prepared by applying the Group's accounting policies.
Investments in subsidiaries are eliminated against the proportionate share of the subsidiaries' net asset value at the acquisition date.
The Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the Group's proportionate share of the associate's / joint venture's net asset value. Unrealised inter-company gains and losses from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated by the Group's interest in the respective associate/jointly controlled enterprise.

Annual Report / p 4780

1. Basis of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Non-controlling interests In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the individual financial line items of subsidiaries are recognised in full. The non-controlling interests' share of the results for the year and of the equity of subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned are included in the Group's results and equity, respectively, but are presented separately in the proposed profit appropriation and the statement of changes in equity. If a non-controlling interest has a put option to sell its ownership interest to DFDS, the fair value of the put option is recognised as an interest-bearing liability, which means that the results for the year and equity attributable to non-controlling interests are not presented separately in the proposed profit appropriation and the statement of changes in equity.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Functional and presentation currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group's enterprises are measured using the functional currency of the primary economic environment in which the enterprise operates. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Danish Kroner (DKK).
Translation of transactions and balances On initial recognition, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of these transactions as well as from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement as Financial income or cost, except when deferred in equity as qualifying for cash flow hedges.
Currency gains and losses on non-monetary items recognised at fair value, such as securities `available for sale', are recognised in the same line item as the fair value gain or loss.
Non-current assets acquired in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on hedges relating to the acquisition of non-current assets are recognised as part of the value of the non-current asset on its initial recognition.
Translation of subsidiaries In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the income statement items of subsidiaries with a functional currency different from DKK are translated at the average exchange rate, while the balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.

Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of such subsidiaries' equity at the beginning of the reporting period to the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and on translation of the Income statements from average exchange rates to the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period, are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and attributed to a separate translation reserve under equity. The exchange rate adjustment is allocated between the Parent Company's and the minority interests' shares of equity.
When disposing of 100%-owned foreign enterprises, exchange differences which have accumulated in equity via Other Comprehensive Income, and which are attributable to the enterprise, are transferred from Other Comprehensive Income to the Income statement together with any gains or losses associated with the disposal.
When disposing of partially-owned foreign enterprises, the part of the foreign currency translation reserve which relates to the minority interests is not transferred to the Income statement.
In the partial disposal of foreign subsidiaries without losing control, a proportionate share of the accumulated currency translation reserve recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is transferred from the Parent Company's equity share of equity to that of the minority shareholders.
In the partial disposal of associates and joint ventures, the proportionate share of the accumulated currency translation reserve recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is transferred to the Income statement.
Repayment of balances which accounting wise are considered part of the net investment is not considered a partial disposal of the subsidiary.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS Government grants to investments are offset against the cost of the asset in question, and thereby reduce the depreciation base of the asset. Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable certainty that they will be received.
KEY FIGURES Key figures are calculated in accordance with the Danish Finance Society' guidelines, `Recommendations and Financial Ratios 2015'. The key figures stated in the overview with consolidated financial highlights are defined on the `Definitions and Glossary' page.

2. Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a strategic key ratio to DFDS when measuring the financial performance of our business. DFDS' financial performance goal is a ROIC of at least 10% over a business cycle.
This section provides the notes of the main components that forms the basis of the Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT), which is a measure of profit that excludes the costs and tax benefit of debt financing by measuring the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) adjusted for corporate income tax on EBIT.
Together with invested capital, NOPAT forms the basis of the ROIC calculation, reference is made to section 3.

Annual Report / p 5702

2.1 Segment information
The segments together with allocation of operating profit, assets and liabilities etc. are identical with the internal reporting structure of the Group. Management has defined the Groups business segments based on the reporting regularly presented to the Group Executive Management, which also forms the basis for management's decisions.
The costs of the segments are the directly registered costs including a few systematically allocated indirect costs, primarily concerning group functions.
Non-allocated costs reflect the general functions, which cannot reasonably be allocated to the segments. The costs consist primarily of costs concerning the Executive Board and Board of Directors but also parts of Group functions like IT, Treasury, Investor Relation, Legal, Procurement, Communication, Finance Control, Digital and depreciation on the Group's IT-systems etc. In addition the elimination of transactions between segments is included. Transactions between segments are concluded at arm's length terms.
Segment assets includes assets, which are directly related to the segment, including non-current intangible, noncurrent tangible and other non-current assets, inventories, receivables, prepayments, cash in hand and at bank of group enterprises and deposits at the Parent Company. Segment liabilities include current and non-current liabilities.
The Shipping Division's activities are divided into five business areas: North Sea, Baltic Sea, Channel, Passenger and France & Mediterranean.
The Shipping Division's activities are transport of freight on ro-ro and ro-pax ships, but also transport of passengers on ships. In addition, operation of terminals along with the Group's main routes are included. The freight customers are mainly transportation and shipping companies as well as manufacturers of heavy industrial goods with a high demand for sea transportation. The main customers for Passenger cover passengers with own cars, Mini Cruises, conferences and tour operators.
The Logistics Division's activities are divided into three business areas: Nordic, Continent and UK & Ireland.
The Logistics Division's activities are full- and part load transportation of freight, and also warehousing and logistics solutions for larger customers. In addition the division operates Lo-Lo tonnage and also transportation of freight on railway. The customers are primarily importers/exporters and manufacturers of industrial goods and consumables.

Geographical breakdown The Group does not have a natural geographic split on countries, since the Group, mainly Shipping Division, is based on a connected route network in Northern Europe, where the routes support each other with sales and customer services located in one country whereas the actual revenue is created in other countries. Consequently, it is not possible to present a meaningful split of revenues and non-current assets by country. The split is therefore presented by the sea and geographical areas, in which DFDS operates.

The adjusted split results in seven geographical areas: North sea, Baltic sea, English Channel, Continent, Nordic, UK/ Ireland and Mediterranean. As a consequence of the Group's business model the routes do not directly own the ships, but solely charters the ships from a vessel pool. The ships are frequently moved within the Group's routes. It is therefore not possible to meaningfull estimate the exact value of the non-current assets per geographical area. Instead an adjusted allocation has been used.

2.7 Tax (continued)
The majority of the shipping activities performed in the Danish, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Dutch and French enterprises in the Group are included in local tonnage tax schemes where the taxable income related to transportation of passengers and freight is calculated based on the tonnage deployed during the year and not the actual profits generated. Taxable income related to other activities is taxed according to the normal corporate income tax rules and at the standard corporate tax rates.
In 2017, the Group realised an effective tax rate of 4.0% (2016: 3.9%) combined and 31.1% (2016: 26.8%) on income subject to normal corporate income tax.
Adjustment of prior years' tax in 2016 (DKK 22m) primarily relates to the final settlement and utilisation of tax losses between the English companies in the Group, between the Danish companies in the Group, revised calculation of deductible financial expenses in the Danish joint taxation and reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets, etc.
DFDS A/S and its Danish subsidiary DFDS Stevedoring A/S are subject to compulsory joint taxation with LF Investment ApS and J. Lauritzen A/S and these two enterprises' Danish controlled enterprises. LF Investment ApS is the administration company in the joint taxation and settles all payments of corporation tax due by the joint taxed enterprises with the tax authorities. In accordance with the Danish rules on joint taxation, DFDS A/S and DFDS Stevedoring A/S are liable for their own corporate tax due whereas DFDS A/S and DFDS Stevedoring A/S are only subsidiary and pro rata liable for the corporation tax liabilities towards the Danish tax authorities for all other enterprises that are part of the Danish joint taxation.

The Group has unrecognised tax losses carried forward of DKK 89m with a tax value of DKK 18m (2016: tax losses of DKK 160m, tax value of DKK 35m). The change in unrecognised tax losses compared to 2016 is driven by the development in UK and Norway.

By joining the tonnage taxation scheme, DFDS A/S is subject to the requirements of the scheme until 2021. During the period covered by the tonnage tax scheme vessels and other assets and liabilities related to the tonnage taxed activities owned by DFDS A/S is deemed maximum depreciated for tax purposes. Hence, if DFDS A/S withdraws from the tonnage taxation scheme, deferred tax liability in the amount of maximum DKK 402m (2016: DKK 390m) may be recognised.

DFDS A/S is not expected to withdraw from the scheme and consequently no deferred tax relating to assets and liabilities subject to tonnage taxation has been recognised.

2.7 Tax (continued)
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax losses carried forward, are recognised to the extent that Management assesses that the tax asset can be utilised through positive taxable income in the foreseeable future which usually is within 3-5 years. Assessment is performed annually on the basis of forecasts, business initiatives and likely structural changes for the coming years.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Tax for the year comprises income tax, tonnage tax, and joint taxation contribution for the year of Danish subsidiaries as well as changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax relating to the profit/loss for the year is recognised in the Income statement, and the tax relating to amounts recognised in equity is recognised in equity. Additionally, adjustments to prior years are included.
The current payable Danish corporation tax is allocated by the settlement of a joint taxation contribution between the jointly taxed companies in proportion to their taxable income. Companies with tax losses receive joint taxation contributions from companies that have been able to utilise the tax losses to reduce their own taxable profit.
Tax computed on the taxable income and tonnage tax for the year is recognised in the balance sheet as tax payable or receivable or joint taxation contribution for Danish companies, taking into account on-account/advance payments.
Deferred tax is calculated on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of the assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to non tax deductible goodwill that arose on acquisition date without impacting the result or taxable income.
Deferred tax relating to assets and liabilities subject to tonnage taxation is recognised to the extent that deferred tax is expected to crystallise. Deferred tax assets are recognised at the value they expectedly can be utilised at in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the expected use and settlement of the individual assets and liabilities, and according to the tax rules and at the known tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. The change in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates is recognised in the Income statement.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Non-current intangible assets Generally the following applies unless otherwise stated:
· Assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. · The cost includes costs to external suppliers, materials and components, direct wages, salaries and
interests paid as from the time of payment until the date when the asset is available for use. · The basis for amortisation is determined as the cost less estimated residual value. · The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life to the estimated
residual value. · The effect from changes in amortisation period or the residual value is recognised prospectively
as a change in the accounting estimate.

3.1.1 Non-current intangible assets (continued)
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Goodwill At initial recognition goodwill is recognised in the balance sheet at cost, as described in the section `Business combinations'. Subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised.
An impairment test is performed at least once a year in connection with the presentation of next year's budget. The book value of goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units at the time of acquisition.
Software IT software purchased or internally developed is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development projects in progress Development projects in progress, primarily development of IT software, are recognised as non-current intangible assets if the following criteria are met:
· the projects are clearly defined and identifiable; · the Group intends to use the projects once completed; · the future earnings from the projects are expected to cover the development and administrative costs; and · the cost can be reliably measured.
The amortisation of capitalised development projects starts after the completion of the development project, and is recognised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which normally is 3-5 years, but in certain cases up to 10-15 years (where the latter goes for significant internally developed commercial and operational systems).
Other non-current intangible assets Other non-current intangible assets comprise the value of customer relations or similar identified as part of business combinations, and which have definite useful life. Other non-current intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which normally is 3-10 years.

On the basis of the impairment tests performed in 2017 there has been no impairment loss on ships (2016: DKK 0m). For further information regarding the impairment tests reference is made to note 3.1.4.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Generally the following applies unless otherwise stated:
· Assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. · The cost includes costs to external suppliers, materials and components, direct wages, salaries and interests
paid as from the time of payment until the date when the asset is available for use. The cost price also comprises gains and losses on transactions designated as hedges. · The basis for amortisation is determined as the cost less estimated residual value. · The assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life to the estimated residual value. · Estimated useful life and estimated residual values are reassessed at least once a year. In estimating the estimated useful life for ships it is taken into consideration that DFDS continuously is spending substantial funds on ongoing maintenance. · The effect from changes in depreciation period or the residual value is recognised prospectively as a change in the accounting estimate.

3.1.2 Non-current tangible assets (continued)
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Ships The rebuilding/upgrade of ships is capitalised if the rebuilding/upgrade can be attributed to: · Safety measures. · Measures to extend the useful life of the ship. · Measures to improve earnings. · Docking.
Maintenance and daily running costs for the ships are expensed in the Income statement as incurred.
Docking costs are capitalised and depreciated on a straightline basis until the ship's next docking. In most cases, the docking interval is 2 years for passenger ships and 2½ years for ro-pax and freight ships.
Gains or losses on the disposal of ships are calculated as the difference between sales price less sales costs and the book value at disposal date. Gains or losses on the disposal of ships are recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have transferred to the buyer, and are presented in the Income Statement as `Profit on disposal of non-current assets, net' or `Special items' if the gain/loss is significant.
Passenger and ro-pax ships Due to differences in the wear of certain components of passenger and ro-pax ships, the cost of these ships is divided into components with low wear, such as hull and engine, and components with high wear, such as parts of the hotel, catering/restaurants and shop areas.
Freight ships The cost of freight ships is not divided into components as there is no material difference in the wear of the various components of freight ships.
Depreciation ­ expected useful life and residual value Normally the depreciation period for components with low wear is 35 years for passenger ships and 30-35 years for ro-pax and freight ships from the year in which the ship was built. The residual value is calculated as the value of the ship's steel less estimated costs of scrapping.
Components with high wear are normally depreciated over 10-15 years down to a residual value of DKK 0.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Other non-current tangible assets Other non-current tangible assets comprise buildings, terminals and machinery, tools and equipment and leasehold improvements.

The estimated useful lifetimes are as follows:

Buildings Terminals etc. Equipment etc Leasehold improvements

25-50 years 10-40 years
4-10 years Max. depreciated over the term of the lease

Gains or losses arising from the disposal of other non-current tangible assets are calculated as the difference between the disposal price less disposal costs and the book value at the date of disposal. Gains or losses on the disposal of these non-current assets are recognised in the Income statement as `Profit on disposal of non-current assets, net' or `Special items' if the gain/loss is significant.

Annual Report / p 6813

3.1.4 Impairment testing
Introduction DFDS has as in previous years decided to impairment test all non-current assets at least at year-end, or more frequent if there is any indication of impairment.
Definition of cash-generating units The breakdown into cash-generating units takes its starting-point in the internal structure of the two segments, Shipping and Logistics, and their business areas, including the strategic, operational and commercial management and control of these, both separately and across business areas, and the nature of the customer services provided.
Based on this the following twelve cash generating units have been identified:
Shipping: · The business areas North Sea, Baltic Sea and France & Mediterranean · Two ro-pax ships not operating in a route schedule where each ship is a separate cash-generating unit (2 units) · The business area Channel · The Copenhagen ­ Oslo route, which is part of the Passenger business area · The Amsterdam ­ Newcastle route, which is part of the Passenger business area
Logistics: · The business area Nordic ­ comprising two sideport ships operating in a route schedule · The business area Nordic ­ comprising two terminals where each terminal is a separate cash-generating
unit (2 units) · The business area Nordic ­ comprising forwarding- and logistics activities in the Nordic and Baltic countries · The business area Continent ­ forwarding- and logistics activities at the European continent · The business area UK & Ireland ­ forwarding- and logistics activities in UK and Ireland
Non-current tangible and intangible assets are attributed to the above cash-generating units, unless this cannot be done with a reasonable degree of certainty. Software and other assets which cannot with reasonable certainty be attributed to one or more of the above cash-generating units are tested for impairment as a non-allocated Group asset, i.e. on the basis of Group earnings.
Basis for impairment testing and calculation of recoverable amount In the impairment test for cash-generating units, the recoverable amount of the unit is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher value of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the latter is written down to the lower value.
The value in use is calculated as the discounted value of the estimated future net cash flows per cash-generating unit. Impairment testing (value in use) is performed on the basis of management-approved budgets for the year 2018 and business plans. Key parameters for the budget are trends in revenue, EBIT, EBIT margin, future investments and growth expectations. These parameters are determined specifically for each individual cash-generating unit. No growth is incorporated in the impairment test for periods beyond 2018 if the value in use for the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying amount of the tested assets without using growth, which is the case for all cash-generating units in the year-end 2017 impairment test.
The recoverable amount for cash-generating units containing goodwill is determined based on value in use calculations. For a breakdown of goodwill on cash-generating units, reference is made to note 3.1.1.

The fair value of the Group's main assets, ships, is determined on the basis of the average of several independent broker valuations less estimated costs of disposal. The task of the brokers is to assess the value of the individual ships in a `willing buyer ­ willing seller' situation. The valuations have been obtained from the same recognised brokers as in previous years, and Management consider an average of these to be the best and most reasonable expression of the ships' fair value .

Determination of discount rate Management determines a discount rate for each cash-generating unit on the basis of a risk-free rate, plus a market risk premium and a risk premium associated with the individual cash-generating unit. The risk-free interest rate is based on a 10-year Danish risk-free rate at year-end. The market risk premium is calculated as a general equity market risk premium of 5.6% (2016: 5.6%), multiplied by the non-leveraged beta value of each cash-generating unit. Further, risk premium may be added if special conditions and/or uncertainties indicates a need hereto. Conversely, if the risk level for the individual cash-generating unit is considered to be lower than the general risk level, then the risk premium is reduced if special conditions indicates a need hereto.

The non-leveraged beta values are calculated by obtaining the non-leveraged beta values of peer-group companies for each business area via the Bloomberg database. The validity of each peer-group company's non-leveraged beta value is assessed in order to remove those with the lowest validity. There are generally few peer-group companies as values are available only for listed companies.

The pre-tax discount rates used in the two segments are within the following ranges:

Shipping Logistics

2017
7.7% - 9.2% 8.5% - 12.0%

2016
7.3% - 8.8% 8.4% - 11.9%

The applied discount rates in cash-generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill forms a significant part of the Group's total goodwill are 8.2% (2016: 7.8%) in `North Sea, Baltic Sea and France & Mediterranean', 8.8% (2016: 8.9%) in `Continent' and 8.5% (2016: 8.7%) in `UK & Ireland'.
Sensitivity analysis As part of the preparation of impairment tests, sensitivity analyses are prepared on the basis of relevant risk factors and scenarios that Management can determine with reasonable reliability. Sensitivity analyses are prepared by altering the estimates within the range of probable outcomes. The sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other things being equal:
· An increase in the discount rate of 0.5%-points. · A decrease in EBIT of 10%. · A decrease in broker valuations of 10%.
None of these calculations have given rise to adjustments of the results of the impairment tests prepared.

Annual Report / p 6824

3.1.4 Impairment testing (continued)
Order of recognising impairments If a need for impairment is identified, goodwill is the first to be impaired, followed by the primary non-current tangible and intangible assets in the individual cash-generating units. Impairments are allocated to the respective assets according to the carrying amount of the assets, unless this results in an impairment to a value below the fair value less costs of disposal of the asset; below the assets value in use (if determinable), or zero.
Impairment tests 2017 On the basis of the impairment tests prepared at year end 2017 it is not deemed necessary to impair any of the cash-generating units in 2017 nor reverse any impairment losses recognised in prior years.
However, the write-down of DKK 15.0m made in 2016 has been partly reversed in 2017 by DKK 9.3m as an agreement was concluded with the owners of the two chartered ships where the equipment is installed. The reversed write-down is recognised under `Amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses on intangible- and tangible assets'.
Impairment tests 2016 On the basis of the impairment tests prepared at year end 2016 it is not deemed necessary to impair any of the cash-generating units in 2016 nor reverse any impairment losses recognised in prior years.
For two chartered ships it has been necessary to recognise a write-down of DKK 7.5m for each ship related to specific installations on the ships as these were technically not working as they shall and will thus not bring the anticipated benefits until redelivery of the ships. The total write-down of DKK 15.0m is recognised under `Amortisation, depreciation and Impairment losses on intangible- and tangible assets'.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
Impairment testing of goodwill and other non-current intangible assets Impairment testing of goodwill and other non-current intangible assets, which primarily relates to IT and customer portfolio, is undertaken at least once every year, and in case of indication of impairment. The impairment tests are based on the expected future cash flow for the cash-generating unit in question. The key parameters are trends in revenue, EBIT, EBIT margin, future investments and growth expectations. These parameters are based on estimates of the future, which are inherently uncertain.
Impairment testing of ships, including the assessment of useful life and scrap value Significant accounting estimates and assessments regarding ships include the allocation of the ship's cost price on components based on the expected useful life of the identified components; the ship's expected maximum useful life; the ship's scrap value; and impairment testing. The expected useful life of ships and their scrap values are reviewed and estimated at least once a year. Impairment tests are also carried out when there is an indication of impairment.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The carrying amount of non-current intangible, tangible and financial assets are continuously assessed, at least once a year, to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. When such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is assessed. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The value in use is calculated as the present value of the future net cash flow, which the asset is expected to generate either by itself or from the lowest cash-generating unit to which the asset is allocated.
Impairment tests (value in use) of goodwill are performed at least once a year. Management has also chosen that Impairment tests of all the Group's non-current assets are performed at least once a year, typically at yearend. Additional impairment tests are performed, if indications of impairment occur in the period between the annual impairment tests.
3.1.5 Assets classified as held for sale
2017 During 2017 the former Norfolkline domicile in Scheveningen, with a carrying amount of DKK 13.5m, was sold. This resulted in an accounting gain of DKK 1.1m, which has been recognised under Profit on disposal of noncurrent assets, net in the Income Statement. At 31 December 2017 there are no assets presented as Assets classified as held for sale.
2016 At 31 December 2016 Assets held for sale (non-recurring fair value measurement) only comprise the former Norfolkline domicile in Scheveningen with a carrying amount of DKK 13.5m.
During 2016 the ro-pax ship Vilnius Seaways ceased to be classified as held for sale as management assessed that the criteria for being classified as held for sale was no longer met. Accordingly, the ship was moved back to Non-current tangible assets at the carrying amount the ship had before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for depreciations etc, that would have been recognised had the ship not been classified as held for sale.

3.2.4 Pension and jubilee liabilities
The Group contributes to defined contribution plans as well as defined benefit plans. The majority of the pension plans are funded through payments of contributions to independent insurance companies responsible for the pension obligation towards the employees (defined contribution plans). In these plans the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions irrespective of the financial situation of these insurance companies. Pension costs from such plans are expensed in the Income statement when incurred.
In primarily the United Kingdom the Group has defined benefit plans. In addition there are minor defined benefit plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The United Kingdom account for 92.6% (2016: 93.8%) of the total net liability and 80.8% (2016: 81.4%) of the funded and unfunded obligation. The majority of the defined benefit plans are pension plans that yearly pay out a certain percentage of the employee's final salary upon retirement. The pensions are paid out as from retirement and during the remaining life of the employee. The percentage of the salary is dependent of the seniority of the employee except for the closed plans in the United Kingdom and some of the other minor plans. The defined benefit plans typically include a spouse pension and disability insurance.
Some of the pension plans in Sweden are multi-employer plans, which cover a large number of enterprises. The plans are collective and are covered through contributions paid to the pension company Alecta. The Swedish Financial Accounting Standards Council's interpretations committee (Redovisningsrådet) has defined this plan as a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Presently, it is not possible to obtain sufficient information from Alecta to assess the plans as defined benefit plans. Consequently, the pension plans are similar to prior years treated as defined contribution plans. The contributions are DKK 4.2m in 2017 (2016: DKK 3.9m). The collective funding ratio at Alecta amounts to 158% as per September 2017 (September 2016: 142%). For 2018 the contributions are expected to be DKK 4.7m. DFDS' share of the multi-employer plan is around 0.009% and the liability follows the share of the total plan.
Based on actuarial calculations the defined benefit plans show the following liabilities:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
The Group's defined benefit pension plans are calculated on the basis of a number of key actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, the anticipated returns on the plans' assets, the anticipated development in wages and pensions, anticipated mortality, etc. Even moderate alterations in these assumptions can result in significant changes in pension liabilities.
The value of the Group's defined pension benefit plans is based on calculations undertaken by external actuaries.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Income statement in the period in which they relate, and any payable contributions are accrued in the balance sheet as other payables.
As regards defined benefit pension plans, an actuarial valuation of the value in use of future benefits payable under the plan is made once a year. The value in use is calculated based on assumptions of future development in wage/salary levels, interest rates, inflation, mortality, etc. The value in use is only calculated for benefits to which the employees have become entitled during their employment with the Group. The actuarial calculation of the value in use less the fair value of any assets under the plan is recognised in the balance sheet under pension obligations. Pension costs of the year are recognised in the Income statement based on actuarial estimates and finance expectations at the beginning of the year. The difference between the calculated development in pension assets and liabilities and the realised values are recognised in Other comprehensive income as actuarial gains and losses.
Changes in the benefits payable for employees' past service to the enterprise result in an adjustment of the actuarial calculation of the value in use, which is classified as past service costs. Past service costs are recognised in the Income statement immediately if the employees have already earned the right to the adjusted benefit. Otherwise, the benefits will be recognised in the Income statement over the period in which the employees earn the right to the adjusted benefits.
Other non-current employee obligations include jubilee benefits, etc.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Provisions are recognised when, due to an event occurring on or before the reporting date, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that the Group will have to give up future economic benefits to meet the obligation and that the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are recognised based on Management's best estimate of the anticipated expenditure for settling the relevant obligation and are discounted if deemed material.

Annual Report / p 6991

4.1 Financial and operational risks
DFDS' risk management policy DFDS' risk management policy is governed by the DFDS Financial Policies and Strategies document, which is approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The intention of the Financial Policies and Strategies is to manage the financial risks attached to operational and financial activities. DFDS does not enter into active speculation in financial risks. The most important financial risk factors for DFDS are 1) bunker price, 2) interest rate, 3) currency exchange, 4) liquidity and 5) credit. DFDS also manages its capital structure as described below.
Bunker risks The cost of bunker fuel constitutes a specific and significant risk partly due to large fluctuations in bunker prices and USD and partly due to the total annual bunker costs of approximately DKK 1,272m or 8.9% of the Group's revenue in 2017 (2016: DKK 999m or 7.2% of the Group's revenue).
An increase in the bunker price of 10% compared to the actual bunker price during 2017 would, other things being equal, have increased bunker cost payments by DKK 13.2m for the Group in 2017 (2016: DKK 14.1m). A decrease in the bunker price would have had a similar positive effect.
In the freight industry, bunker costs are primarily hedged by price-adjustment clauses (BAF) in freight customer contracts. In the passenger industry, fluctuations in the cost of bunkers are reflected in the ticket price to the extent possible. In addition, hedging transactions, primarily bunker swaps, are used to manage risk of the remaining bunker costs. DFDS uses bunker swaps to hedge the variability in bunker costs that are not commercially hedged through customer agreements.
An increase in the bunker price of 10% compared to the actual bunker price at balance sheet date would, other things being equal, have had a hypothetical positive effect on the Group's equity reserve for hedging of DKK 2.7m (2016: DKK 4.6m). A decrease in the bunker price would have had a similar negative effect.
Interest rate risks DFDS is primarily exposed to interest rate risks through the loan portfolio and DFDS seeks to limit the negative effects from interest rate fluctuations. The DFDS strategy is that 40-70% of the loan portfolio must be fixed-rate loans when taking contracted interest rate swaps and long-term charter agreements into consideration.
The total Net Interest-Bearing Debt (including currency derivatives on bond loans) amounts to DKK 2,352m at year-end 2017 (2016: DKK 2,424m), of which debt with a fixed-rate amounts to DKK 1,140m at year-end 2017 (2016: DKK 1,281m.) The share of debt with fixed-rate is 40% at year-end 2017 (2016: 50%) including the effect of all interest rate swaps. When including the long-term charter agreements the share of debt with fixed-rate increases to 57% (2016: 55%).
An increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to the actual interest rates during 2017 would, other things being equal, have increased net interest payments by DKK 16.1m for the Group in 2017 (2016: DKK 10.2m). A decrease in the interest rates of 1%-point would have reduced the net interest payment by DKK 14.3m (2016: 10.2m)
The Group's total interest-bearing debt primarily consists of floating rate mortgages with security in the ships, unsecured corporate bonds and revolving facilities. The debt portfolio had an average time to maturity of 5.2 years (2016: 4.2 years). As part of the financial strategy, interest rate swaps with a principal amount totalling DKK 313m (2016: DKK 312m) have been entered into in order to change part of the floating-rate bank loans and issued corporate bonds to fixed rate bank loans and bonds. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio (including charter liabilities) is 2 years (2016: 1.3 years).
An increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to the actual interest rate at balance sheet date would, other things being equal, have had a hypothetical positive effect on the Group's equity reserve for hedging by DKK 7.6m (2016: DKK 11.6m). A decrease would have had a similar negative effect.

Currency risks Currency risks are monitored continuously to ensure compliance with the DFDS Financial Policies and Strategies. DFDS aims to actively reduce currency exposure by matching the currency positions and by directing all currency balance positions towards the Parent Company, DFDS A/S. The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to hedge forecasted transactions in foreign currencies.
Approximately 87% of DFDS' revenues in 2017 were invoiced in foreign currencies (2016: 89%) with the most substantial net income being generated in EUR, SEK, GBP and NOK. USD was the most substantial net expense currency.
EUR is considered as minor risk bearing due to Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy. USD risk is reduced by entering into forward exchange contracts in connection with hedging of future bunker consumption and payments on shipbuilding contracts. The expected future cash flow in other currencies than USD is currently not hedged as they are within the limits accepted in the Financial Policy. The commercial currency cash flow is defined as the Group's consolidated net currency cash flows from revenue and operational costs and the table below shows the impact on the Group's operating profit from changes in the foreign exchange rate.

The Group's most significant currency balance positions are in EUR, SEK, GBP, NOK and USD relating to cash holdings, debt and investments. Changes in exchange rates at a given balance sheet date, will have currency gain/loss reported under financial items in the profit & loss statement and hence impact the Group equity. A strengthening of SEK, GBP, NOK and USD, as indicated below, against the DKK at 31 December 2017 balances, would have increased/decreased financial items in the income statement by the amounts presented below.

In addition to currency risks arising from operations, the need to translate foreign currency Financial Statements of subsidiaries into DKK in order to prepare Consolidated Financial Statements also represents a risk. The Group's most substantial translation risks are in SEK, GBP and NOK. The impact on net profit from an increase of the average exchange rates in 2017 is outlined in below table.

The cash resource at 31 December 2017 is DKK 2,633m (2016: DKK 2,296m), of which undrawn credit facilities amounts to DKK 1,600m (2016: DKK 1,600m).

1 DKK 768.8m relates to the two Channel vessels chartered from Eurotunnerl, where we expect that Eurotunnel will use their option to sell the vessels to DFDS during 2017.

Assumptions for the maturity table: The maturity analysis is based on undiscounted cash flows including estimated interest payments. Interest payments are estimated based on existing market conditions.

The undiscounted cash flows related to derivative financial liabilities are presented at gross amounts unless the parties according to the contract have a right or obligation to settle at net amount.

Credit risks DFDS' primary financial assets are trade receivables, other receivables, cash and derivative financial instruments. The credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables and other receivables.

The amounts in the balance sheet are stated net of write-downs on receivables, which have been estimated based on a specific assessment of the present economic situation for the specific customer.

DFDS' risks regarding trade receivables are not considered unusual and no material risk is attached to a single customer or cooperative partner. According to the Group's policy of undertaking credit risks, credit ratings of all customers and other cooperative partners are performed at least once a year. A few counterparties have provided bank guarantees for payments for the benefit of DFDS. These guarantees amounts to DKK 10.0m in 2017 (2016: DKK 9.5m), the fair value of the bank guarantees is DKK 10.0m (2016: DKK 9.5m).

Annual Report / p 7913

4.1 Financial and operational risks (continued)
DFDS has credit risk with its financial counterparties when placing excess liquidity and entering into hedging contracts with these. Based on credit ratings from international credit rating agencies, monitored on a systematic and current basis, DFDS sets an upper limit for exposure for each financial counterpart. These limits are approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure Capital distribution to shareholders is based on a target leverage of a NIBD/EBITDA multiple between 2.0 and 3.0. At year-end 2017 the NIBD/EBITDA multiple was 0.9 (2016: 0.9).
Dividend is paid semi-annually to facilitate a faster return of capital to shareholders and to align payments with DFDS' seasonal cash flow that peaks during the third quarter, the high season for passenger travel. After distribution of dividend, excess capital is determined based on the leverage target, including future investment requirements, and distibuted through share buybacks.
The Board of Directors proposes to the 2018 annual general meeting (AGM) a dividend of DKK 4.00 (2017: DKK 3.00). In addition, the Board of Directors plan to distribute an extraordinary dividend of DKK 7.00 (2017: DKK 7.00) in August 2018.
At year-end 2017, the Group´s cost of capital (WACC) was calculated at 5.5% (2016: 6.0%) and the return on invested capital (ROIC) before special items was 19.0% (2016: 17.8%).
The targeted financial leverage is a Net Interest-Bearing Debt (NIBD)/EBITDA multiple of between 2.0 and 3.0. The target can be suspended, for example in connection with large investments, including acquisitions, and other strategic initiatives. At year-end 2017 the NIBD/EBITDA multiple was 0.9 (2016: 0.9).

1 For instruments used to hedge ship investments the recycling from equity will be recognised under non-current tangible assets.

The fair value of the interest swaps have been calculated by discounting the expected future interest payments. The discount rate for each interest payment is estimated on the basis of a swap interest curve, which is calculated based on market interest rates.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts and bunker contracts are calculated based on actual forward curves in DFDS' Treasury system.

1 Assets held for sale (non-recurring fair value measurement) comprised the former Norfolkline domicile in Scheveningen which has been sold in Q1 2017. Reference is made to note 3.1.5 for further information on assets held for sale.

Derivative financial assets and liabilities are all measured at level 2. Reference is made to note 4 .1 for description of the valuation method.

Financial assets available for sale comprise other shares and equity investments as well as other investments of DKK 9.5m (2016: DKK 9.5m). These are some minor unlisted enterprises and holdings. They are measured at cost reduced by impairments, if any, and consequently, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy.

During 2016 the financial assets available for sale measured at level 3 has included non-listed shares in Danish Ship Finance (Danmarks Skibskredit A/S). In prior years these shares have been measured at cost by DKK 8.8m and accordingly not been included in the fair value hierarchy. However, in September 2016 the majority of Danish Ship Finance's share capital was traded and consequently, DFDS' holding of these non-listed shares were measured at fair value based on the published price per share according to the transaction in September 2016 as this price was also offered to the remaining shareholders. In November 2016 DFDS sold its shareholding in Danish Ship Finance for DKK 34.1m, resulting in a gain of DKK 25.2m which is recognised in the income statement under financial income.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
Derivatives When entering into agreements involving derivatives, Management assesses whether the derivative in question meets the requirement as to effective hedging, including whether the hedging relates to recognised assets and liabilities, projected future cash flows, or financial investments. Monthly effectiveness tests are carried out, and any inefficiency is recognised in the income statement.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured in the balance sheet at fair value as from the date where the derivative financial instrument is concluded. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are presented as Derivative financial instruments under current receivables if positive or under current liabilities if negative. Netting of positive and negative derivative financial instruments is only performed if the company is entitled to and has the intention to settle more derivative financial instruments as a net. Fair values of derivative financial instruments are computed on the basis of current market data and generally accepted valuation methods.
Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as a fair value hedge of recognised assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income statement together with changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability based on the hedged proportion. Hedging of future cash flows according to agreements (firm commitments), except for foreign currency hedges, is treated as a fair value hedge of a recognised asset and liability.
Cash flow hedge Changes of the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for cash flow hedging and which effectively hedge changes in future cash flows, are recognised in Other comprehensive income. The change in fair value that relates to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised as a separate equity reserve until the hedged cash flow impacts the Income statement. At this point in time the related gains or losses previously recognised in Other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income statement into the same line item as the hedged item is recognised.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains or losses previously recognised in Other comprehensive income are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset.
For derivative financial instruments that no longer qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge is dissolved prospectively. The accumulated fair value in equity is immediately transferred to the Income statement into the same line item as the hedged item is recognised.
Other derivative financial instruments For derivative financial instruments that do not fulfil the requirements of being treated as hedge instruments, the changes in fair value are recognised successively in the Income statement as Financial income and cost.

1 Eurotunnel has in June 2017 exercised their option to sell the two previsouly chartered Channel ships Côte des Dunes and Côte des Flandres to DFDS.

In 2017 DFDS has issued a five-year corporate bond of NOK 1,250m, which run for the period 28 September 2017 until 28 September 2022. The bond is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The five-year bond has been issued with a floating rate based on three month NIBOR + 1.32% margin in NOK, but swaped to CIBOR + 0.99% margin in DKK.

The fair value of the interest-bearing liabilities amounts to DKK 3,435.4m (2016: DKK 3,097m). The fair value measurement is categorised within level 3 in the fair value hierarchy except for the part that relates to the corporate bonds for which the fair value measurement is categorised within level 1.

The fair value of the financial liabilities is determined as the present value of expected future repayments and interest rates. The Group's actual borrowing rate for equivalent terms is used as the discount rate. The fair value of the issued corporate bonds has been calculated based on the quoted bond price at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively.

DKK 596m of the interest-bearing liabilities in the Group fall due after five years (2016: DKK 476m). No unusual conditions in connection with borrowing are made. The loan agreements can be settled at fair value plus a small surcharge, whereas premature settlement of the corporate bonds requires a repurchase of the bonds.

The Group's actual borrowing rate for equivalent terms is used as the discount rate. The fair value of the issued corporate bonds has been calculated based on the quoted bond price at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Reference is made to note 4.1 for financial risks, etc.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Interest-bearing liabilities comprise amounts owed to mortgage/credit institutions and banks as well as amounts owed to owners of issued corporate bonds including liabilities arising from derivatives relating to issued corporate bonds. The amounts are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction expenses. Subsequently, the financial liability is measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest method, so that the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the Income statement under `financial costs' over the term of the loan.
Interest-bearing liabilities also include capitalised residual lease obligations on finance leases. Other liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which corresponds to the net realisable value in all material respects.

4.6 Equity
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Dividends Proposed dividend is recognised as liabilities at the date on which they are adopted at the annual general meeting (time of declaration). The expected dividend payment for the year is disclosed as a separate item in the equity.
Reserve for treasury shares The reserve comprises the nominal value of treasury shares. The difference between the market price paid and the nominal value as well as dividend on treasury shares are recognised directly in equity under retained earnings. The reserve is a distributable reserve.
Currency translation reserve The reserve comprises DFDS A/S shareholders' share of currency translation adjustments arising on the translation of net investments in enterprises with a functional currency other than DKK. The reserve is dissolved upon disposal of the entity.
Reserve for hedging The hedging reserve comprises the fair value of hedging transactions that qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges and where the hedged transactions have not been realised. Hedge accounting ceases when the hedging instrument matures or if a hedge is no longer effective.
Reserve for value adjustment of securities The reserve for value adjustment of securities comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of the securities classified as `available-for-sale'. The reserve is dissolved and transferred to financial items in the Income statement when the securities are sold or impaired.

In accordance with the Annual General Meeting in March 2017 the Board of Directors is authorised ­ until 21 March 2022 ­ to acquire treasury shares equal to up to 10% of DFDS A/S' share capital. The price cannot deviate by more than 10% from the listed acquisition price on NASDAQ Copenhagen at the time of acquisition.

DFDS A/S has during 2017 acquired treasury shares for a total payment of DKK 1,105.8m (2016: DKK 914.1m). Furthermore, DFDS A/S has during 2017 disposed treasury shares for a total consideration of DKK 55.3m (2016: DKK 64.2m) in connection with employees' exercise of share options.

The Parent Company's holding of treasury shares at 31 December 2017 is 2,348,887 shares of DKK 20 each (2016: 2,946,498 shares), corresponding to 4.12% (2016: 4.91%) of the Parent Company's share capital. Treasury shares have been acquired for the share buy-back programme and to cover the share option scheme and restricted shares for employees.

On the Annual General Meeting in March 2017 it was decided to cancel 3,000,000 of the treasury shares. This resulted in a reduction of the Company's share capital by nominally DKK 60,000,000. The cancellation had legal effect from 21 April 2017.

5.3 Share options
The decision to grant share options is made by the Board of Directors. Share options have been granted to the Executive Board and leading employees. Each share option gives the holder of the option the right to acquire one existing share in the Parent Company of nominal DKK 20. The share option schemes equals a right to acquire 1.4% of the share capital (2016: 2.2%) if the remaining share options are exercised.

Share options are granted in 2012-2015 at an exercise price equal to the average share price of the Parent Company's shares 20 days before the grant with an addition of 5%. Share options are granted in 2016 and 2017 at an exercise price equal to the average share price of the Parent Company's shares 20 days before the grant with an addition of 10%.

Vesting is done on a straight line basis over three years from the date of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness and death and if the capital structure of the Parent Company is changed.

The share options can be exercised when a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years have elapsed since the grant dates. The options can only be exercised within a period of 4 weeks after publication of annual or interim reports.

Share options granted can only be settled with shares. A part of the treasury shares is reserved for settling the outstanding share options.

Jubilee shares In recognition of the contribution made by DFDS' employees in recent years to the company's growth and to celebrate the company's 150 year anniversary, the Board of Directors has awarded 30 shares free of charge to each full time employee.
The shares are awarded as a Restricted Stock Unit Plan, which contains certain conditions to be eligible for the shares. Only employees that are employed as per 1 December 2016 and continuously work until 1 February 2020 will receive the shares. Employees working more than 24 hours per week will get 30 shares, if they work more than 12 hours and up to 24 hours per week they get 20 shares and if they work up to 12 hours per week they get 10 shares. If an employee retires or has to leave his job because of disability during the period until 1 February 2020 he is entitled to the full number of shares.
In total 7,751 employees are at award date entitled to the shares. Based on historical attrition rates for each country the total expected number of shares to be transferred to the employees is 187,235 with a total fair value of DKK 55m, which will be expensed under Special items over the vesting period.
552 jubilee shares have been exercised during 2017 (2016: nil). The average weighted market price per share exercised in 2017 is DKK 337.50. Vesting of share options is expensed in the Income statement for 2017 with DKK 20.4m (2016: DKK 0.7m).

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group has set up equity-settled share option plans. Part of the Parent Company's holding of treasury shares is used for the share option plan.
The value of services received in exchange for granted share options is measured at the fair value of the share options granted.
The equity-settled share options are measured at the fair value at grant date and recognised in the Income statement under staff costs over the vesting period. The counter posting is recognised directly in equity as a shareholder transaction.
At initial recognition of the share options, an estimate is made over the number of share options that the employees will vest, cf. the service conditions described above in this note. Subsequent to initial recognition, the estimate of share options to be vested is adjusted whereby the total recognition is based on the actual number of vested share options.
The fair value of the granted share options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Terms and conditions for each grant are taken into account when calculating the fair value.

5.5 Acquisitions and sale of enterprises, activities and non-controlling interests (continued)
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Enterprises acquired or formed during the year are recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition or formation. Enterprises disposed are recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the date of disposal. The comparative figures are not adjusted for acquisitions or disposals.
Business combinations where control is obtained by the DFDS Group are recognised using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of newly-acquired enterprises are assessed at their fair value on the acquisition date. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they are separable or arise from a contractual right. Deferred tax related to the revaluations is recognised.
The acquisition date is the date on which the DFDS Group obtains actual control over the acquired enterprise.
Positive differences (goodwill) between, on the one hand, the purchase price, the value of minority interests in the acquired enterprise and the fair value of any previously acquired shareholdings, and, on the other hand, the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised as goodwill under non-current intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. The first impairment test is performed within the end of the acquisition year.
Upon acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units, which subsequently form the basis for the impairment test. Allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units is described in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.4.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign enterprise with a different functional currency than the DFDS Group's presentation currency are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign enterprise, and are translated and converted at first recognition to the functional currency of the foreign enterprise at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
The purchase consideration of an enterprise is the fair value of the agreed payment in the form of assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued to seller. If part of the consideration is contingent on future events or fulfilment of agreed conditions, this part of the consideration is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Costs attributable to business combinations are recognised directly in the Income statement when incurred.
If, at acquisition date, uncertainty exist regarding the identification and measurement of acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities, or determination of the purchase price, then initial recognition and measurement is done based on preliminary values. The preliminary values may be adjusted until 12 months from the acquisition date, provided that the initial recognition was preliminary or incorrect. Changes in estimates regarding contingent considerations are recognised in the Income statement as Special items.
Incremental acquisitions after control has been obtained, i.e. purchase of minority interests, are recognised directly in equity. Disposal of minority interests not resulting in loss of control is likewise recognised directly in equity.
Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are calculated as the difference between the disposal consideration and the book value of net assets at the date of disposal, including the book value of goodwill, accumulated exchange gains and losses previously recognised in the equity as well as anticipated disposal costs. Exchange rate adjustments attributable to the Group's ownership interest, and which previously were recognised directly in equity, are included in the calculation of the gain/loss. Any retained participating interests are measured at their fair value at the time at which the controlling influence was lost.

5.6 Guarantees, collateral and contingent liabilities
Guarantees amount to DKK 132.7m (2016: DKK 117.0m) for the Group. In addition, the Group has issued an unlimited guarantee to cover any obligations under a Payment Service Agreement for creditcard payments. The Group has issued letter of support to cover total underfundings in two defined benefit pension schemes in two English subsidiaries. The total underfunding amount to DKK 332.9m (2016: DKK 414.7m).
The Group is in 2017 as well as in 2016 part in various legal disputes. The outcome of these disputes is not considered likely to influence DFDS significantly, besides what is already recognised in the balance sheet.
In June 2017 DFDS acquired two channel ferries from Eurotunnel. DFDS paid additional amount of DKK 111.1m which is now subject to arbitration due to a disagreement concerning the purchase price. DFDS is confident to be succesful in the arbitration and has thus recognised the amount as a receivable.
In terms of the contaminated land in one of the Group companies discovered in 2005, there is still no obligation to clean the land. If such obligation should occur, the Group has the possibility to get the cost adjusted in the original purchase price for the company. The seller of the land has made a deposit of DKK 24.5m (2016: DKK 24.5m) on a bank account in DFDS' name to cover this.
Certain ships with a total carrying amount of DKK 2,228.9m (2016: DKK 1,343.8m) have been pledged as security for mortgage on ships with a total carrying amount of DKK 1,441.8m (2016: DKK 856.5m).
At year end 2017 DKK 0.6m (2016: DKK 0.0m) of the cash was deposited on restricted bank accounts as security for payment.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
Provisions and contingencies Management assesses provisions and contingencies on an ongoing basis, as well as the likely outcome of pending or potential legal proceedings, etc. Such outcome depend on future events, which are inherently uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome of significant legal proceedings, tax issues, etc., Management uses external legal advisers as well as relevant case law.

5.7 Contractual commitments and operational lease (continued)
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS
Leasing agreements The Group has entered into leasing/charter agreements for ships, buildings and other equipment, under usual terms and conditions for such agreements. At inception of each individual agreement, Management assess and determine whether the agreement is a finance or an operating leasing agreement.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Rental and lease matters For accounting purposes, leases are divided into finance and operating leases.
Leases are classified as finance leases if they transfer to lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The cost of assets held under finance leases is recognised at the lower of fair value of the assets and the net present value of the future minimum lease payments. For the calculation of the net present value, the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Group's incremental borrowing rate is used as discount rate. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated and impairment tested in accordance with the Group's accounting policies applying for similar owned non-current assets or maximum over the lease term, depending on the lease conditions. The corresponding lease obligation for assets held under finance leases is recognised in the balance sheet at an amount equal to the net present value of the remaining lease obligation. The calculated interest element of the lease payment is recognised in the Income statement under Financial expenses.
Lease payments regarding operating leases are recognised in the Income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another approach better reflects the utilisation of the asset. The remaining lease obligation for operating leases is disclosed as contingent liabilities in the Notes.
In respect of assets leased out on a finance lease, an amount equal to the net investment in the lease is recognised in the balance sheet as a receivable due from lessee. The asset leased out is derecognised, and any gain or loss arising from this is recognised in the income statement.
Lease income from assets leased out on an operating lease is recognised in the Income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.

5.8 Related party transactions
Lauritzen Fonden, Copenhagen with a nominal shareholding of 41.3% exercises de facto control over DFDS A/S. Accordingly, the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board at Lauritzen Fonden as well as all companies owned by Lauritzen Fonden are related parties.

The Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.

In our opinion the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 December 2017 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2017.

Further, in our opinion, the Management's review includes a true and fair account of the development in the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and financial matters, of the result for the year and of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position as well as a description of the most significant risks and elements of uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.

Independent Auditors' Report
Statements to the shareholders of DFDS A/S
Opinion We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent company Financial Statements (the "Financial Statements") of DFDS A/S for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2017, pp. 59-130, which comprise income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the Parent company. The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Parent company at 31 December 2017 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements" section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements.
To the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as described in article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014.
Appointment of auditor We were initially appointed as auditors of DFDS A/S before 1995 and accordingly, we have to resign as auditor of the Company at the annual general meeting in 2021 at the latest. We have been re-appointed annually by resolution of the annual general meeting for a total consecutive period of more than 23 years up to and including the financial year 2017.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for the financial year 2017. These matters were addressed during our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

Independent Auditors' Report (continued)
We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements" section of our report, including in relation to the key audit matters below. Accordingly, our audit included the design and performance of procedures to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the Financial Statements.
Valuation of ships DFDS operates 64 ships in its route network of which 35 is owned. Management's disclosures on the impairment testing of ships are included in note 3.1.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
This area is significant to our audit due to the size of the carrying values of ships of DKK 7.505.4m at 31 December 2017 as well as the management judgment involved in the assessment of the values, including component accounting of the cost price, assessment of useful life and scrap values and accounting estimates and assessments involved in impairment testing.
Management prepares impairment tests for all ships at year-end, or more frequent if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is based on the estimated recoverable amounts, which is the higher of fair value less estimated costs of disposal and value in use. Fair value of ships is for this purpose determined on the basis of the average of available independent broker valuations less estimated costs to sell. Value in use is calculated for the cash generating units determined by Management, which therefore means that the value in use of certain ships are tested together at the level of a business area or a route.
For details on the impairment tests performed by Management reference is made to note 3.1.4 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter Our audit procedures in relation to valuation of ships included:
· Test of the component accounting and comparison of the useful life and scrap values used with assessments made and data provided by DFDS' technical department and other sources as well as inquiries to DFDS' Management and DFDS' technical department.
· Examination of the value-in-use model prepared by Management, including consideration of the valuation methodology and challenging the reasonableness of key assumptions and input data based on our knowledge of the business and industry together with available supporting evidence such as available budgets and externally observable market data related to interest rates etc.
· Examination of fair value less costs to sell for ships calculated by Management, including comparison of carrying values of the ships with available valuations prepared by external and independent ship valuation experts.
· Review of the adequacy of disclosures about key assumptions and sensitivity in note 3.1.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Statement on the Management's review Management is responsible for the Management's review, pp. 8-58. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Independent Auditors' Report (continued)
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatements of the Management's review.
Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Statements.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.

Independent Auditors' Report (continued)
· Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the Financial Statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the parent company Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annual Report / p 10223

Note 17 Pension and jubilee liabilities
The Parent Company contributes to defined contribution plans as well as defined benefit plans. The majority of the pension plans are funded through contributions to an independent insurance company responsible for the pension obligation towards the employees (defined contribution plans). In these plans the Parent Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions irrespective of the financial situation of the insurance company. Pension costs from such plans are charged to the income statement when incurred.
The Parent Company has minor defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plans are pension plans that yearly pay out a certain percentage of the final salary the employee has when the employee retires. The pensions are paid out as from retirement and during the remaining life of the employee. The percentage of the salary is dependent of the seniority of the employees. The defined benefit plans typically include a spouse pension.
Based on actuarial calculations the defined benefit plans show the following liabilities:

1 Eurotunnel has in 2017 exercised their option to sell the two previously chartered ferries, Côte des Dunes and Côte des Flandres, to DFDS. 2 The carrying amount of Interest-bearing payables to subsidiaries relates to deposit facilities that are made available to subsidiaries.

The Parent Company has issued a 5 year corporate bond. Reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements note 4.5.

The fair value of the interest-bearing liabilities amounts to DKK 5,039m (2016: DKK 5,532m). The fair value measurement is categorised within level 3 in the fair value hierarchy except for the part that relates to the corporate bonds for which the fair value measurement is categorised within level 1.

The fair value of the financial liabilities is determined as the present value of expected future repayments and interest rates. The Parent Company's actual borrowing rate for equivalent terms is used as the discount rate. The fair value of the issued corporate bonds has been calculated based on the quoted bond price at year end 2017 and 2016 respectively.

DKK 345m of the Interest-bearing liabilities in the Parent Company fall due after five years (2016: DKK 476m). No unusual conditions in connection with borrowing are made. The loan agreements can be settled at fair value plus a small surcharge, whereas settlement of the corporate bonds requires a repurchase of the bonds.

Financial assets available for sale comprise other shares and equity investments as well as other investments of DKK 9.5m (2016: DKK 9.5m). These are some minor unlisted enterprises and holdings. They are measured at cost reduced by impairments, if any, and consequently, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 23 Financial and operational risks
DFDS' risk management policy The description of DFDS' risk management policy, financial risks and capital management is equal for the Group and the Parent Company. Reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements note 4.1.

The following specifications for the Parent Company are different to the similar specifications for the Group.

Financial risks Interest rate risks An increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to the actual interest rates in 2017 would, other things being equal, have increased net interest payments by DKK 28m for the Parent Company in 2017 (2016: DKK 17m). A decrease in the interest rates would have had a positive effect of DKK 26m (2016: 16m).

For further details of this acquisition reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements note 5.5.

Note 27 Guarantees, collateral and contingent liabilities
Issued guarantees amount to DKK 94.6m (2016: DKK 84.0m). In addition, the Parent Company has issued an unlimited guarantee on behalf of a subsidiary to cover any obligations under a Payment Service Agreement for creditcard payments. The company has issued letter of support to cover total underfundings in two defined benefit pension schemes in two English subsidiaries. The underfunding amount to DKK 332.9m at 31 December 2017 (2016: DKK 414.7m).
The Parent Company has issued letter of support for certain Group companies with negative equity. In June 2017 DFDS acquired two channel ferries from Eurotunnel. DFDS paid additional amount of DKK 111.1m which is now subject to arbitration due to a disagreement concerning the purchase price. DFDS is confident to be succesful in the arbitration and has thus recognised the amount as a receivable.
The Parent Company is in 2017 as well as in 2016 part in various legal disputes. The outcome of these disputes is not considered likely to influence the Parent Company significantly, besides what is already recognised in the balance sheet.
Certain ships with a total carrying amount of DKK 1,290.2m (2016: DKK 1,348.8m) have been pledged as security for mortgage on ships with a total carrying amount of DKK 788.0m (2016: DKK 856.6m).

The specified payments are not discounted.

1 The increase in the operating lease commitment for ships in 2017 versus 2016 is due to two new ro-ro freight ships leased from another DFDS Group entity.

Operating lease- and rent costs recognised in the income statement amount to DKK 720.1m for 2017 (2016: DKK 756.6m).

Operating lease contracts on ships are typically concluded with lease terms of up to 12 months, but where most of the lease contracts contain an option to extend the lease term.

However, 2 leases were initially entered with a 10 year lease period, of which 2-4 years remain at 31 December 2017.

A further 1 lease was initially entered with a 5 year lease period, of which 3 years remain at 31 December 2017.

Lease contracts on other assets are normal lease contracts including a minimum lease term after which the lease term can be terminated by giving 1 to 12 months' notice.

The Parent Company has not entered any substantial agreements, which will be effected, changed nor expired, if the control over the Group is changed as a consequence of a takeover of the Group.

The Parent Company has purchase options on the ro-ro freight ships Gardenia Seaways and Tulipa Seaways.

Note 30 Impairment testing
Introduction DFDS has in previous years decided to impairment test all non-current assets at least at year-end, or more frequent if there is any indication of impairment.
For a description of the definition of cash-generating units, basis for impairment testing and calculation of recoverable amount reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements note 3.1.4.
Impairment tests of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Impairment tests are carried out for each subsidiary, associates and joint ventures in the Parent Company if there is indication of impairment. The individual companies are regarded as the lowest cash-generating units.
The estimated value in use is based on cash flows according to management approved budget for the coming financial year. Expectations towards the cash flows are adjusted for uncertainty on the basis of historical results, and take into account expectations towards possible future fluctuations in cash flows.
The Parent Company uses a discount rate determined for each subsidiary, associate or joint venture, according to the business area to which it belongs. The applied discount rates for 2017 and 2016 are shown in the table in the Consolidated Financial Statements note 3.1.4.
2017 In 2017 investments in subsidiaries have been impaired by DKK 94.9m in total. DFDS Logistics SPA has been impaired by DKK 4.9m, DFDS Poznan Sp Z.o.o has been impaired by DKK 10.0m and DFDS Seaways SAS has been impaired by DKK 80.0m as the calculated value in use of the individual investments is lower than the book value. Furthermore, in 2017 previous impairments have been reversed by DKK 150.0m regarding DFDS Seaways PLC The total impairment of net DKK 55.1m in 2017 is recognised under Financial items reference is made to note 7.

Total write down of receivables at 31 December 2017 amounts to DKK 10.0m. Further, write downs in previous years have been reversed by DKK 169.5m. The write downs and reversals are recognised under Financial items.

The total impairment of net DKK 119.9m in 2016 is recognised under Financial items reference is made to note 7.
The Parent Company has issued letter of support to some subsidaries and associates with negative equity. Consequently, the investment in these subsidiaries and associates are written down to zero, and any receivables due from the subsidiaries and associates are written down by amounts equal to the respective negative equities. Total write down of receivables in 2016 amounts to DKK 52.8m. A provision of DKK 38.2m relating to a negative equity in a subsidary was also recognised in 2016. Further, write downs in previous years have been reversed by DKK 6.3m. The write downs and reversals are recognised under Financial items.

Note 31 Events after the balance sheet date
On 8 February 2018, a share buyback programme of DKK 400m was launched to align DFDS capital structure to the targeted leverage. The programme of DKK 400m is to be completed on 15 August 2018 at the latest.
An order of two ro-pax ships new buildings was finalised on 12 February 2018. The order is part of DFDS' ongoing fleet renewal to accommondate the needs and demands of our freight customers, increase operational efficiency and reduce the environmental impact. The new ships are combined freight and passenger ships and the 130 metres long ships will each have a capacity of 4,500 lane metres and will be able to carry 600 pax. The two ships will be built by Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) in China for delievery in 2021. The two ships represents a total investment of around DKK 1.75 billion.
Note 32 Accounting Policies
The Parent Company Financial Statements are prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act concerning preparation of separate parent company Financial Statements for companies reporting under IFRS.
The 2017 Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies.
Change in accounting policies Reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements note 1.
Critical accounting estimates and assessments In the process of preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements, a number of accounting estimates and judgements have been made that affect assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the reporting period. Management regularly reassesses these estimates and judgements, partly on the basis of historical experience and a number of other factors in the given circumstances.
Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries is carried out if there is indication of impairment. The impairment tests are based on the expected future cash flows for the tested subsidiaries. For further details of estimates and assessments relating to investments in subsidiaries reference is made to note 30, which mention impairment testing.
Management is of the opinion that, except for impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries, no accounting estimates or judgements are made in connection with the presentation of the Parent Company Financial Statements that are material to the financial reporting, other than those disclosed in section 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 32 Accounting Policies (continued)
DESCRIPTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Parent Company accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies described in the Consolidated Financial Statements with the following exceptions:
Business combinations In the Parent Company common control acquisitions (and disposals) of enterprises and activities are measured and recognised in accordance with the `book value method' by which differences, if any, between purchase price and book value of the acquired/sold enterprise/activity are recognised directly in equity.
Translation of foreign currencies Foreign exchange adjustments of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment in enterprises that have a functional currency other than DKK are recognised in profit for the year as Financial income and costs in the Parent Company Financial statements. Likewise, foreign exchange gains and losses on the portion of loans and derivative financial instruments that has been entered into to hedge the net investment in these enterprises are recognised directly in the profit for the year as Financial income and costs.
Dividends from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Dividends from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are recognised in the Parent Company's Income statement for the year in which the dividends are declared. If distributions exceed the subsidiary's, the associate's or the joint venture's Comprehensive income for the period, an impairment test is carried out.
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are measured at cost in the Parent Company's Balance sheet. Impairment testing is carried out if there is any indication of impairment. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised as Financial cost in profit for the year unless it qualifies as a special item. If the Parent Company has a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, a provision for this is recognised.
Equity Reserves for development costs The reserve for development costs comprise of DFDS' development costs corresponding to the capitalized development cost in the balance sheet. The reserve is non distributable and cannot be used to cover deficit. The reserve is dissolved upon disposal of the development cost either by sale or if the development cost is no longer part of the entity's operation. The reserve will then be transferred to the distributable reserves. The reserve will be reduced and the distributable reserves increased concurrently with either depreciations or write-downs.
For a description of the Hedging reserve, Revaluation of securities and Treasury shares, reference is made to Consolidated Financial Statements, note 4.6.

Moving for all to grow since 1866

C.F.Tietgen's initiative to merge four Danish steamship comp anies to DFDS (Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab) in 1866 had a strong purpose: The new company enabled trade that was growing exponentially in the wake of the industrialisation, creating growth for all.
Products and coal from the UK, the world's industrial locomotive at that time, were transported to the textile and energy demanding markets in Scandinavia and other countries. And in these countries, the steam ships conversely gave farmers access to the UK's rapidly growing market for food and raw materials.
DFDS developed quickly with the growth it helped create. Around 1900, DFDS steam ships connected farmers around the Black Sea with the new Russian industrial area around St. Petersburg. DFDS started routes to USA bringing back soya cake as feed to European farmers thus supporting their transformation from exporters of livestock to producers and exporters of processed products like butter and bacon. DFDS also connected Danish and Scandinavian cities with each other and with the world. All this was based on a fleet of more than 120 ships, among the largest in the world at the time.
DFDS transported immigrants who sought a better future in the USA. During the world wars, DFDS kept up supplies of critical food and coal to people in Europe who otherwise would have

been starving and unable to heat their homes. Jobs and industry were kept alive.
After the war, DFDS' ships, many now powered by diesel engines, kept moving ­ products from USA to Europe, people between countries, goods between UK and mainland Europe, between the Mediterranean and Scandinavia and to and from Iceland. At the end of the sixties, DFDS were the first to develop a ro-ro service, paving the way for more efficient shipping of trucks and trailers carrying industrial cargo.
The logistics activities were developed from 1972 with the same purpose. Connecting people and businesses from door-to-door to make everyone grow. When DFDS acquired Dan Transport in 1998, the business area became one of the largest forwarding and logistics companies in Northern Europe. DFDS Dan Transport was sold in 2000 to focus the company's resources on shipping.
After the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010 and several logistics acquisitions, DFDS has again transformed itself to become a unique European Shipping and Logistics Group providing vital infrastructure services in Europe.
Today, DFDS has set a firm course towards development of digital capabilities to continue fulfilling the purpose the company was born with: We move for all to Grow.
