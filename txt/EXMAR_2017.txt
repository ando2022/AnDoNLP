PANORAMA
EXMAR OVERVIEW 2017 MISSION STATEMENT FINANCIAL SUMMARY INFORMATION FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS EXMAR IN THE WORLD CARGO TRANSPORTED EXMAR FLEET

EXMAR OVERVIEW 2017
In 2017, EXMAR has weathered a prolonged, perfect storm of low hydrocarbon prices, oversupply of gas and excess shipping capacity. EXMAR's LNG division has sold its vintage vessel-based FSRUs and LNG carriers and is now focusing on two unique, barge-based floating terminals specifically designed to simplify the import and export of LNG in niche markets.
Four floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) which had previously been under long-term charter to Excelerate Energy (EE) were acquired by the same company following the buyout of EXMAR's 50% ownership share in each vessel. The LNG carrier EXCEL was also sold by EXMAR to an owner who is converting it into a floating storage unit.
The world's first FSRU barge was delivered to EXMAR in December 2017, with long-term employment for the unit secured with a reputable counterpart as of mid-2018 onwards. The floating liquefaction barge CFLNG was successfully commissioned in 2017 and is awaiting final deployment with several candidates under consideration.
EXMAR will reinforce its position in the Very Large Gas Carrier segment after securing a long-term charter agreement for two LPG-fueled 80,200 m³ newbuild gas carriers with Statoil ASA. The vessels will be built and delivered by 2020.
EXMAR's midsize LPG five-year fleet renewal programme started in 2014 is nearing completion with no less than 13 energy-efficient newbuilds having joined the fleet by end of 2018. The majority are committed to long-term charters with first class customers. These vessels are the sixth generation of midsize gas carriers to be designed

by EXMAR engineers and naval architects. Two older midsize vessels, BRUGGE VENTURE and COURCHEVILLE have been sold, one for recycling.
The Offshore division has focused its efforts on securing further partnerships with oil majors and private deepwater oil exploration companies with scalable, flexible OPTI® and FPSO solutions that enable low cost, high yielding exploration and production.
The EXMAR Holdings division concluded the sale in August 2017 of the 100%-owned insurance company Belgibo to long-term business partner Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc (JLT), generating a capital gain of USD 26,7 million.
The overall balance of all these transactions has significantly altered EXMAR's debt profile and has generated important levels of cash for further investment in growth.
EXMAR Ship Management has currently 84 vessels under management (compared to 46 in 2016). The company has further increased its focus on niche markets by offering operation and maintenance services to specialized vessels including FSRUs, LNG Carriers, Very Large Gas Carriers, midsize LPG vessels, Pressurized LPG vessels, product tankers and bulk carriers.
Ship owners, particularly those in the energy sector, must be able to live with cycles. EXMAR has passed through one of the biggest storms ever faced by the shipping industry and has emerged stronger and in excellent shape to make the most of the new market opportunities in 2018.

MISSION STATEMENT

MARKET OVERVIEW
VLGC Earnings across most segments have mildly fluctuated but remained largely depressed as a result of the extensive number of vessel deliveries. A lack of long-haul VLGC arbitrage opportunities has persisted despite strong overall US propane exports, in particular during the winter months. Over the summer there were a total of 38 cargo cancellations noted, impacting ton-mile rather severely.
US LPG exports have remained exceptionally strong and totaled more than 2016, with around 2.4 million metric tons (MT) per month on average mainly as a result of the consistently tight inventory situation. Furthermore, additional capacity in 2018 will result in another record breaking supply balance. Whilst the US ramps up exports and is gaining market share, Middle Eastern supply still accounts for the largest portion with an average monthly LPG supply of around 3.1 million tons per month.
China and India remain the main import drivers with Japanese imports hovering around 11 million tons per annum (MTPA). China imported 16.4 million tons in 2017, an increase of 15% compared to 2016 and India has seen growth of 25%, totaling 12.3 million tons in 2017. Demand for both countries is also expected to increase further in the coming year.
The LPG market-setting Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) segment has benefited from healthy demand East of Suez and robust US terminal capacity throughout 2016 and 2017 but a continued overhang of vessels has led to a steady but historically low yearon-year Baltic LPG Index with an average for

2017 of USD 27.59 per MT and an average of USD 26.64 per MT in 2016. The VLGC fleet has increased to a total of 264 ships, with 21 deliveries in 2017 and 44 in 2016. EXMAR has ordered two old-Panama VLGC's to be constructed by Hanjin Heavy Industries (HHIC) against long-term contracts with Statoil ASA.
The global LPG market has been quite able to absorb the vast batch of new deliveries

in recent years. However more orders have been placed towards the end of the year, often linked to specific projects or trading platforms. In fact, major traders have placed orders at various yards which have been promoting competitive deals. Although exports are expected to further increase in the US and Middle East, with strong demand in the East, shipping length will undoubtedly keep rates subdued.

AMMONIA VALUE CHAIN

MIDSIZE The increased vessel supply throughout 2016 (12 newbuilds) and 2017 (15 newbuilds), worldwide, has had the expected impact on overall earnings in the Midsize Gas Carrier (MGC) segment, causing rates to slide down further and averaging about USD 450,000 per calendar month (pcm) for 2017. Ten ships are still expected by early 2019 including the three EXMAR midsize carriers, bringing the total MGC LPG fleet to 104 ships. The segment has grown by 43% since 2016 and is expected to increase by another 10% within the next year and a half.
Whilst owners of Midsize carriers have managed to maintain relatively firmer rates compared to vessels with larger capacity during the first half of the year, the trickle-down effects from the weaker VLGC and Large Gas Carrier (LGC) markets have caused further significant corrections in this segment. Short-term and one-year contracts are being concluded at half the monthly rates experienced two years ago, i.e. around USD 450,000 per month.
PRESSURIZED The Pressurized vessel segment has solidified its recovery throughout 2017 with fixtures concluded at rates 35% higher than last year, following a prolonged period of vessel oversupply and a fragmented market with multiple ship owners. Additional volumes have been generated in the Far East for this segment as traders and Oil Majors have expanded their LPG downstream platforms, integrating more Pressurized vessels into their portfolio. The West has experienced an upwards momentum as well as a result of a tight market for vessels and continuous demand for smaller cargoes. A negligible order book (OB) for vessels in this class combined with firm LPG and petrochemical trading paves the way for further improvements in this segment.

HIGHLIGHTS 2017 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2018

VLGC BW TOKYO (83,000 m³, 2009 built) performed according to its contract but earnings remain under pressure as they are linked to the depressed Baltic Freight Index (BFI). EXMAR has re-enforced its position in the VLGC segment after securing a long-term charter agreement for two LPG-fueled 80,200 m³ newbuild gas carriers with Statoil ASA. The vessels will be built at Hanjin Heavy Industries Corporation in Subic Bay, the Philippines, and delivered by 2020. Exports of LPG are expected to further increase in the US and Middle East, with continuous strong demand in the Far East

and India. The vast supply of newbuild deliveries may add downward pressure on rates in this segment in 2018. Due to EXMAR's limited exposure in the VLGC segment in 2018, the impact on its earnings will be limited.
MIDSIZE EXMAR's midsize LPG five-year fleet renewal programme that started in 2014 is nearing completion with 11 energy-efficient newbuilds having joined the fleet up until now with two more expected by the end of 2018. The majority is committed to long-term charters with first class customers. These ves-

sels are the sixth generation of midsize gas carriers designed by EXMAR engineers and naval architects. Two older midsize vessels, BRUGGE VENTURE (35,440 m³ - 1997 built) and COURCHEVILLE (28,000 m³ - 1989 built) were sold, the latter for recycling. The capital gain of approximately USD 1.0 million on the sale of the COURCHEVILLE will be recorded in the first quarter of 2018. EXMAR continues to secure employment but at lower rates than 2017. Presently its fleet cover for 2018 is 71%.
PRESSURIZED Rates in the small segment continued their pronounced upwards shift, albeit more modestly in the 3,500 m³ segment. Five vessels are positioned West (Atlantic Basin) and are on charter and five vessels are in the Far East (China, India, Korea, Japan), also having secured medium-term employment. A negligible order book combined with firm LPG and petrochemical trading paves the way for further improvements in this segment. EXMAR is well positioned with its ten Pressurized vessels to benefit further from these solid rates. To date 84% of EXMARs seven 3,500 m³ Pressurized fleet is covered for 2018, with 91% coverage for its three 5,000 m³ ships.

LNG

EXMAR is a leading player in LNG shipping, regasification and liquefaction, having pioneered the ship-to-ship transfer of LNG at sea as well as on-board regasification of LNG to feed onshore energy grids. EXMAR has now successfully designed and built two unique, barge-based floating LNG terminals which will be used for the import and export of natural gas. The barge-based FSRU is already being deployed for a long-term commitment to regasify and import LNG into an energy grid. The bargebased liquefaction terminal will be deployed to treat, clean and liquefy natural gas from source for export.

LNG BUSINESS UNIT ­ MARKET OVERVIEW
Market experts remain optimistic about the global shifted focus toward cleaner-burning fuels. One of the main reasons for this is the abundance of cheap natural gas discoveries around the world. Demand of LNG is currently at around about 290 million (mio) tons and is estimated to be heading towards approximately 480 mio tons by 2030. Moreover the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that should the current trend persist, the rise in LNG will boost natural gas demand growth to outpace oil and coal by 2040. This view is supported by several factors: the rapid deployment and falling costs of clean energy technologies, the growing electrification of energy, a cleaner energy mix (especially in China) and the expected resilience of shale gas supplies in the US. The shift to a more services-oriented global economy also supports this view. This change will of course be impacted by the extent to which coal is phased out as a high-pollution source of energy.

The evolution of LNG import prices supports this increasing energy demand of the emerging countries. Current price levels, worldwide export capacity and the LNG import terminal alternatives available on the market, encourage these countries to launch fast track power supply initiatives.

West-East arbitrage and the first cargoes from the new Wheatstone LNG plant in Australia pushed freight levels significantly upwards. Modern LNG carriers reaped the benefit, whereas steam turbine ships were still insufficiently rewarded enough to cover both variable and fixed asset costs. By year end, the LNG fleet amounted to 450 LNG carriers, with a pending order book of 94 vessels to be delivered in the coming years. This represents 21% of the existing fleet.

LNG SHIPPING
LNG carriers employed on the spot market in 2017 were challenged by low energy prices, an oversupply of fleet tonnage and delayed LNG deliveries from new liquefaction plants, with existing plants experiencing lower utilization levels. Modern units earned below USD 30,000 per day, whilst older generation or steam turbine units were only obtaining rates below USD 20,000 per day. A sudden change in market fundamentals at the end of the year changed matters: a winter cold snap, higher LNG prices catering for

In contrast to previous years, worldwide traded LNG volumes substantially increased during 2017 to 292 mio tons, representing 12% growth over 2016. Most of the increase can be attributed to more exports from US, Australia, Angola, Nigeria and Malaysia. Plants in the US (Cove Point train one and two, Freeport train one, Elba Island) as well as in Australia (Ichthys, Prelude, Wheatstone train two) will continue to be the supply growth drivers in 2018 by ramping up production and bringing new projects online.

24 A CTIVITY REPORT

On the import side, and apart from the demand recovery in Japan and Korea, two developments stand out. First, there is the step up of LNG imports into China from 26 mio to over 38 mio tons. The government's push to ensure that industrial and residential sectors switch from burning coal to gas from May 2017 onwards fell behind schedule. Half of the deliveries were sourced from Australia. With this conversion programme expanding from the Northeast to other parts of the country, China is ready to use substantially more LNG in the years to come. Second, it has become a reality that the number of LNG buyers has become more and more dispersed. Supported by higher gas prices, most European customers did consume more LNG through 2017. Emerging countries in South East Asia will be needing more LNG in the coming years.

FLOATING REGASIFICATION
More than 40 LNG import projects under study and/or development seek to capitalize on the current lower LNG prices resulting from the large amount of export capacity on line. As these are looking to become on line in the next two to three years, FSRUs are definitely considered the preferred regasification solution.
FSRUs are believed to be cost-efficient for these import projects as these can be started up on a small- to medium scale basis and eventually be scaled up at a later stage when required.
Site specific factors, such as meteorological and maritime conditions, social and environmental factors and locally available infrastructure and pipeline grids, demand FSRU providers to be adaptive in developing the most flexible and competitive solution for the projects under consideration.
With only about ten FSRUs available or on order - which will be pre-dominantly delivered to emerging LNG importing countries facing gas supply shortages - the situation leaves quite some opportunities for FSRU providers.
FLOATING LIQUEFACTION
With the current large amount of export capacity coming on stream, the development of new LNG export initiatives in todays' markets remains challenging. Despite this, with current oil prices stabilizing above USD 60/barrel (bbl), a strong market interest exists to pursue FLNG schemes, allowing developers to monetize their existing stranded gas reserves on a fast-track basis.

HIGHLIGHTS 2017 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2018
EXISTING FLEET The LNG fleet performed according to their contract until the end of the year except for the LNG/C EXCEL which was active on the spot market until it was sold for conversion into a floating storage unit (FSU) in October 2017. Through this sale EXMAR has limited its exposure to challenging spot freight market conditions for steam turbine ships with LNG/C EXCALIBUR performing according to her long-term contract to Excelerate Energy (EE).
During the course of 2017, as charterer of EXMAR's FSRU fleet, the US-based company Excelerate Energy expressed an interest in acquiring the full 50% share held by EXMAR in the companies owning the respective FSRUs EXCELERATE, EXPLORER, EXPRESS and EXCELSIOR. Negotiations resulted in a win-win for both parties with EE enhancing their FSRU project portfolio and EXMAR monetizing its cooperation with its American partner over the past 15 years.
The sale of EXMAR's shares in the first three companies took place before the end of 2017 and the fourth was concluded for Excelsior BVBA in early 2018. EXMAR Ship Management, having operated and maintained the fleet to the entire satisfaction of both owners and charterers, will continue to perform ship management services for the nine FSRUs now owned by EE.
With this capital reallocation EXMAR LNG is well positioned to further focus on its next generation of floating LNG solutions.

EXMAR FLNG ACTIVITIES After having secured a USD 200 million asset financing, CARIBBEAN FLNG (CFLNG) has been delivered from the Wison shipyard (Nantong, China) on 27 July 2017. CFLNG consists of a floating liquefaction plant with 16,100 m³ of LNG storage capable of producing 500,000 tons of LNG per year. Costs accrued for the late delivery of CFLNG of approximately USD 11 milion has weighed on the operating result of 2017.
EXMAR is in dialogue with several potential partners for its deployment on multiple projects. With the required supporting local infrastructure and related operational permits in place, CFLNG can be mobilized, installed and commissioned on site within four to six months from contract signature. Until the successful conclusion of negotiations and confirmation of her deployment, CFLNG will remain at the yard, with all measures for preservation of the on-board equipment having been taken.
EXMAR FSRU ACTIVITIES In December 2017 delivery of the world's first barge-based FSRU has been taken from the same shipyard in Nantong, China. The unit has a

re-gasification capacity of up to 600 million standard cubic cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) and a storage capacity of 26,320 m³ of LNG. This is again a milestone in EXMAR's history as this FSRU is the first of the new generation of barge-based floating regasification assets, and is well positioned to add value to medium sized LNG import projects globally as it is a fast track, flexible and cost-efficient solution. Prior to delivery, long-term employment has been secured with a reputable counterpart and commercial operations are to commence from mid-2018 onwards.
In addition to this barge-based FSRU project, EXMAR has two purpose-built LNG import terminal projects under development for gasfired independent power production (IPP) projects. Final Investment Decision (FID) on both projects is targeted in 2018 to match project development outcome and related terms and conditions with global IPP project financing requirements.
For the India-based Swan Energy import terminal project, EXMAR and the various parties involved terminated discussions in view of the complexity of the set-up of this project.

EXMAR OWNED OFFSHORE FLEET

Accomm. Barges

OFFSHORE: MARKET OVERVIEW
Prior to the beginning of the dramatic fall in oil prices in 2014, world demand for oil was 92 million barrels per day (bpd). At that time, most experts were forecasting a growth in oil demand of one million bpd per year until 2020. The availability of cheaper oil unexpectedly drove demand up by 2.1 million bpd in 2015, 1.8 million bpd in 2016 and 1.6 million bpd in 2017. Some forecasters are now predicting demand will hit the 100 million bpd mark in the second half of 2018. This growth in demand has brought the price of oil up to its present price range of USD 60 per barrel. Higher prices have certainly helped the economics of some development projects. Nonetheless the lack of investment in some segments of the industry, particularly the offshore, may make meeting future oil demand challenging. This will create opportunities for EXMAR.

28 ACTIVITY REPORT

At the end of 2017, the offshore petroleum industry delivered approximately 30% of the world's daily oil supply and approximately 32% of global daily gas production. Historically, offshore project sanctions closely track oil prices. An example is floating production system (FPS) contract awards, which averaged 26 units per year from 2010 to 2012. As oil prices fell in 2014, there were only 19 FPS awards. When the price of oil dropped further, contract awards were also reduced as only nine FPS contracts were issued in both 2015 and 2016. Many offshore development schedules were delayed and some projects scrapped. With the oil price rise in 2017, a total of 21 FPS contracts were issued. The lack of investment in the past three years coupled with the natural decline of existing offshore fields may result in a net loss of offshore production. This in turn would contribute to an overall reduction in total daily output.
Deepwater projects compete for Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) investment against other opportunities, including onshore shale plays in North America. Many forecasters have predicted that quick-to-market shale production would more than make up for any losses in conventional oil supply. But as with offshore developments, some shale plays appear to be more cost-efficient than others, even with prices above USD 50 or USD 60 per barrel.
Forecasters cited the number of shale wells that have been drilled but "uncompleted" could be brought into production and more than make up for losses. These wells, called DUCs (Drilled and uncompleted wells), actually grew by more than 1,000 wells during 2017 to approximately 7,500. Possible explanations for this are that investment funds are reluctant to fund additional infrastructure to deliver new production to market, lack of logistics and development resources and reduced rig productivity.
To compete with onshore projects and attract the necessary CAPEX to fund projects, offshore operators have implemented plans to reduce costs by streamlining the entire development process and timeline and specify floating facilities with specifications that allow deepwater projects to effectively compete within the shale segment. EXMAR Offshore targets these operators with a proven low cost, high value Floating Production System (FPS) solution.

Globally, deepwater reserves remain an important source for development and monetization by resource owners. Numerous offshore prospects potentially requiring FPS development may reach Final Investment Decision (FID) in the coming years.
Brazil's deepwater portfolio makes for a good example with breakeven costs estimated at between USD 40 and USD 50 per barrel. Petrobras' commitment to development is demonstrated with its award of an FPSO in 2017 and is projected to award another three FPSOs for 2018.
Mexico presents an opportunity with recent lease offerings to attract foreign investment in promising deepwater areas.

OFFSHORE 29

However exploration drilling is yet to commence and FID for production is foreseen past 2020.
Offshore development following discoveries in developing countries such as Mozambique, Cyprus and Guyana will give these nations an opportunity for export revenue and possible energy independence. EXMAR competes to win these projects through an OPTI® FPS or FPSO application through experience, technical expertise, and operational skill.

By the same token, existing offshore projects will remain necessary to sustain the aforementioned increase in oil and gas demand. EXMAR accommodation units serve the need for offshore workers who perform operations and maintenance of these projects. While maintenance overhauls have been postponed in the last two years, oil companies cannot continue deferring the work necessary to maintain production levels. We see a recovery of offshore projects starting in 2018 ­ 2019, with the need to accommodate more offshore workers.

BEXCO
BEXCO is one of the principal fiber rope suppliers worldwide. The company designs, engineers, manufactures and supplies high-quality, made-to-measure synthetic fiber rope solutions for marine and offshore applications. Adverse market conditions significantly impacted the offshore market for deepwater mooring rope, with no tenders for new projects during the first three quarters of 2017. However, the market picked up by the end of the year, with BEXCO winning an important tender for deepwater mooring rope for installation in the Gulf of Mexico with an oil major. The order for over 20 DeepRope segments of over 1,000 metres each will be produced at its two production sites at Hamme and at the Antwerp quay facility in 2018. BEXCO maintained its market position in other offshore and marine segments, although its business was negatively impacted by sluggish vessel offshore installation and vessel newbuild activities. Despite this adverse market situation, BEXCO expanded its R&D activities in 2017 with the introduction of its new FLEXOR heavy lift round sling for offshore applications and a new subsea-buoyant mooring solution for the LNG sector, with both new products attracting their first customers. The company also successfully established new direct representation in the North American market in 2017 and plans further expansion to other geographical regions in 2018.

DVO
With its main office located near Paris, France, DV Offshore (DVO) is an independent firm of consulting engineers specialized in all the technical aspects of marine engineering and operations. Over a period of 40 years DVO has successfully completed more than 1,000 specialist assignments in 40 different countries. DVO has acted as consulting engineers in industrial maritime projects for oil majors, port authorities, governmental institutions and companies involved in the oil and gas industry, with recognized expertise in mooring engineering and installation. DVO has advised and participated in projects involving Open Sea Terminals (Single Point Mooring, Conventional Buoy Mooring), Port Terminals, Offshore floating storage, Liner shipping, Marine operations and Underwater engineering as well as operations. The past three years have been very difficult in the Engineering and Procurement offshore market but DVO has been able to sustain its activity due to a large commitment to various product terminals. 2018 should normally see some activities resuming due to the recommencement of oil and gas exploration.

HIGHLIGHTS 2017 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2018

OPTI® SERIES FLOATING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS Based on last year's indicators, it appears that the market has turned from a low barrel price of below USD 30/bbl (per barrel - source WTI) in early 2016 to a price of over USD 50/bbl during the final months of 2017. With the apparent bottoming of the market now left behind there has been an increase in activity around new developments in the Gulf of Mexico. While the general sentiment is positive many operators are proceeding with appropriate caution having commenced early planning and design work in 2017 with decisions to be made in 2018.
In 2017, EXMAR was contracted to perform early conceptual design work for a number of potential developments in the Gulf of Mexico based on the highly successful DELTA HOUSE production facility with its OPTI-11000TMdesign. It's owner-operator LLOG won the top industry OTC Distinguished Achievement Award 2017 in recognition of cost, time from discovery to first production, safety performance, reliability, and regulatory compliance. The breakeven price for DELTA HOUSE cited from inception was approximately USD 27/bbl and is below USD 20/ bbl going forward.
Even at barrel prices above USD 60/bbl, operators will favor less expensive and short-cycle development options such as subsea tie-backs to existing infrastructure with available production capacity. However by adopting EXMAR's proven low-cost OPTI® based floating production system, operators have the potential option to capture the benefits of additional production from their developments within a short timeframe.
ENGINEERING AND DESIGN EXMAR's USA office based in Houston was no longer able to rely on its previous main source of income from drilling contractors who continue to experience low levels of activity in Offshore exploration. The loss in revenue from drilling has been partially mitigated by increasing topsides engineering work primarily in support of EXMAR's LNGi projects involving the CFLNG and FSRU Barge. In 2017, EXMAR Houston was also contracted to perform work for additional tie-backs to the DELTA HOUSE that utilized EXMAR's proprietary, cost-effective FAST® riser pull-in procedure for connecting risers to the OPTI® hull.
ACCOMMODATION BARGES In early 2017, the KISSAMA accommodation barge was sold to Indian buyers for use outside the West African Market. The NUNCE accommodation barge was extended from 2019 to 2022 with Sonangol and the WARIBOKO continues to be employed by Total in Nigeria. Last year 50% of the total West African (WAF) accommodation barge fleet remained unemployed in long-term lay-up. Whilst this situation is expected to remain unchanged in 2018, an increase in activity from 2019 onwards is predicted with new projects coming online and the need for maintenance programmes that have been postponed from previous years.

FLOATING PRODUCTION STORAGE AND OFFLOADING VESSELS EXMAR Offshore submitted a bid for the FPSO SEPIA for Petrobras in early 2017. While unsuccessful in offering the lowest price to Petrobras, the results placed EXMAR in a close second position. Following this experience, EXMAR was invited to participate in the FPSO BUZIOS 5 tender to be submitted in the second semester of 2018. Petrobras is the world leader in FPSO utilization with close to 20 new units to be awarded within the next five years. Given EXMAR's experience with traditional floating production (FPSO, semi-submersibles, FSO) and innovative production infrastructure (LNGRV, FLNG, FSRU), EXMAR is well positioned to re-enter the FPSO market in 2018 and 2019.

EXMAR SHIP MANAGEMENT - MARKET OVERVIEW
The market for outsourcing has grown in recent times for the management of a vessel or vessels to a qualified ship manager who provides crew management, technical, operational and HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality) management as well as maintenance, training, ICT and cargo handling expertise.
According to the latest UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade & Development) Review of Maritime Transport, the overall world shipping fleet has grown reaching 93,161 vessels representing some 1.86 billion (bn) deadweight tons. Bulk carriers account for the highest share tonnage-wise, whilst offshore vessels and gas carriers have the highest share of value per merchant vessel.

However it is the emergence of new legislation requiring high levels of in-house expertise that has resulted in ship management appearing as a welcome blip on the radar of owners, especially new ones. The International Maritime Organization's 2020 Global Sulphur Cap and the recently-implemented Ballast Water Management convention continue to place ship owners under increasing economic pressure. The option to outsource management to expert ship managers continues to grow.

HIGHLIGHTS 2017 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2018
During the past year EXMAR Ship Management (ESM) has been actively pursuing external business opportunities. The strategy to further diversify the client portfolio has been successful and ESM has evolved to a service provider for any specialized floating asset. The portfolio of vessels in management increased to 84 vessels for 24 different owners ranging from Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) for LNG, LPG carriers, floating accommodation barges to specialized juice carriers.
In 2017 EXMAR's Floating Regasification Barge and Floating Liquefaction barge (CFLNG) entered into management. The world's first floating regasification (FSRU) barge is scheduled to commence it's long-term contract in the second half of 2018.
Also in 2017, the "Taking the SAFETY LEAD" programme that was started in 2014 remained well on course and is showing results in

all aspects of the operations. The Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) reached an all-time low of 0.53 for the LPG fleet and many other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) show a positive trend in ESM's HSEQ and sustainability performance.
Mid 2017 ESM and Ahlers combined forces for certain maritime services. This included the maritime training activities performed by Bureau International Maritime (BIM). Combined with the expertise of EXMAR Academy, training services are now available for all maritime and offshore sectors.
In 2018, ESM will continue to operate the LNG, LPG and other specialized assets for its existing clients and will remain the ship manager for the vessel-based FSRUs which are now fully owned by Excelerate Energy. ESM will also assist and supervise the conversion of EXCEL to a Floating Storage Unit (FSU) and will supervise commissioning and delivery of the remaining LPG newbuilds for EXMAR.

CARE FOR TODAY, RESPECT FOR TOMORROW
BEYOND COMPLIANCE PEOPLE - OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET OUR BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

BEYOND COMPLIANCE
The emphasis "care for today, respect for tomorrow" has been at the forefront of EXMAR's approach towards how it conducts business worldwide since its inception back in 2003.
EXMAR goes beyond compliance with legislation, having earned its certification as a floating asset owner-operator according to the ISO14001 standard (obtained in 2011) for its environmental management system as well as ISO50001 (obtained in 2014) for its energy management system.
EXMAR's Ship Management operations also has its quality management system recognized by the industry ISO29001 standard, its occupational health and safety management system is OHSAS 18001 certified and it has worked carefully with the local classification society RINA to ensure its operations off the Italian coast and with Italian partners to meet and exceed local legislation demands.

Anyone who has worked with these rigorous certification processes will be aware that the biggest challenge is not to attain these standards but to retain them by constantly demonstrating continuous improvement through innovation, respect and care. The Group's compliance, HSEEQ, Technical and legal teams work on a daily basis with each other as well as in industry forums to ensure performance is continuously improved.
The Company has now turned its attention to fully applying the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, which are designed to be used by organizations to report about their impacts on the economy, the environment, and society.
In terms of reducing vessel emissions, EXMAR has installed both closed and open loop exhaust gas scrubbers in its new midsize LPG fleet, and has also retrofitted its first midsize newbuild WAASMUNSTER with a scrubber. These scrubbers are capable of reducing more than 95% of SOx emissions and 60% of particulate emissions in air.
As a further step beyond compliance, the two EXMAR VLGC newbuilds for delivery in 2020 will be powered by LPG, the first of their kind in the industry. Gas fuel reduces more than 99% of SOx emissions and 80% of particulate emissions. In addition, LPG as a fuel reduces 17% of CO2 emissions as compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).

EXCELLING IN TREATING BALLAST WATER

The latest ballast water treatment system (BWTS) installed by EXMAR Ship Management involved the seagoing FSRU EXCELSIOR during its dry dock in the Navantia shipyard in Ferrol, Spain, in December. This is to comply with the latest Ballast Water Management Convention which came into force in September 2017.
All water to be used for ballast passes via two main pipes from below into two large filters for handling. There hypochlorite generated

from an on-board electrolysis skid is injected to eliminate any microorganisms before the water enters the hull's ballast tanks. If the water is expulsed less than three days after, it is chemically treated to remove the chlorine. Additionally, to minimize impact of the hydrolysis process, a degas tank is used to mix and breakdown the resultant gases which are then emitted through a vent in the accommodation.
EXMAR's new midsize LPG fleet has also been equipped with new BWTS solutions

PEOPLE ­ OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET

In 2017, the combined shore and sea staff serving EXMAR slightly increased by 1,969 to 1,981*. The number of staff serving at the various offices around the world saw a reduction from 341 to 290, whilst the number of seafarers experienced an increase of nearly 4% to 1,691. The changes in EXMAR office staff came following a reorganization exercise at EXMAR's offices in Houston as well as the sale of the insurance company Belgibo.

With the renewal of the LPG midsize fleet advancing further into 2018 and beyond with the two orders for VLGCs which will require additional staff, the growing number of seafarers is also being boosted by the activities of EXMAR Ship Management and its subsidiaries Seavie and Ahlmar. A further 154 crew members working on conventional bulk vessels are now under employment with additional shore-based superintendents and crew management, adding together with the crews already serving the luxury sailing and motor vessels managed by EXMAR Yachting.

WHERE SHIP MEETS SHORE: CREW CONFERENCES EXMAR Ship Management organized no less than six conferences across the world in 2017, with a total of 554 attendees from sea staff and shore-based personnel. These conferences have been a part of EXMAR working life since the Company's foundation, with internal specialists as well as external advisors and trainers offering a wealth of useful information on latest trends and technical developments. Key partners such as engine manufacturers, classification societies, cyrogenic hose suppliers, catering consultants and safety consultants are invited to speak and conduct workshops on all aspects of a professional life at sea.
WELL-BEING FOR EXMAR COLLEAGUES ON SHORE In recent months access to the Company headquarters has been severely hampered by infrastructure and roadworks which will last well into 2019 and beyond. To deal with this major challenge, EXMAR has joined forces with other large Antwerp-based companies and the Antwerp local authorities in a "Smart Ways to Antwerp" campaign to offer staff alternative means via a combination of public transport and freely available city bikes, electric bicycles, folding bicycles, cargo bicycles and bike wagons as well as the popular Velo city bike.
EXMAR has gone beyond this by offering free ferry services with a vessel using a hydrogen-propelled engine for staff located over the river Scheldt and beyond in partnership with its office neighbor CMB. EXMAR has also offered employees an advantageous bike leasing policy as an alternative to car pooling and public transport. EXMAR Ship Management has also opened satellite offices in Zandhoven to the East of the city and in Elversele to the West in Waasland which are fully connected to the enterprise network, allowing staff to also work from home with prior agreement from their Business Unit Directors.
42 CARE FOR TODAY, RESPECT FOR TOMORROW

SUPPORTING OUR EMPLOYEES' SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INITIATIVES In 2017, EXMAR has supported its employees' efforts to raise money for good causes, both locally and internationally.
This includes staff participation in the most recent Warmathon organized by the popular local radio station Studio Brussel in Belgium, where money raised by staff was matched by the Company for two causes, namely the Belgian Royal Society for Rheumatology and FONDS NGANGI, a charity which aims to support the development of the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo by supporting its youth in terms of further education, employment and startups.
EXMAR is also a patron to VZW ZachteKracht, which is a charity located at the Royal Yacht Club at the Belgian coast town of Nieuwpoort and which offers opportunities to young people with special needs to sail on a yacht at sea for a day. The Company sponsors various sports teams in Belgium, including Gantoise hockey club.
EXMAR Ship Management staff organizes an annual Fairtrade breakfast in recent years which supports the charity OXFAM and EXMAR has offered annual contributions in recent years to BEDNET, a charity which enables sick house-bound children in Belgium access via online computer to their school classrooms.

Teambuildings in 2017 have included an outside exercise weekend in Wallonia with staff from EXMAR's offices around the world as well as a Maori Haka training course for EXMAR Ship Management personnel and visiting sea staff on the banks of the river Scheldt. EXMAR holds an

annual global meeting of its management every September and joins this up with an annual staff and family reception which was held this year at the newly-renovated Royal Yacht Club of Antwerp.

EXMAR TECHNICAL AWARDED FUNDING TO RESEARCH INTO NEW LOW EMISSION PROPULSION SYSTEM

EXMAR Technical is proud to announce that it has been awarded funding by the European Union for the HyMethShip, an innovation project under the HORIZON 2020 programme. HyMethShip stands for Hydrogen Methanol Ship propulsion system using on-board pre-combustion carbon capture. In this project, EXMAR is jointly working with universities, a classification society, a shipyard, and

equipment suppliers to develop solutions in order to drastically reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency of the shipping industry.
EXMAR Technical is preparing this project since December 2016. Now is the time to go to the next step by designing and testing a prototype of our idea until end of 2020.

HOW DOES HYMETHSHIP WORK? HyMethShip bunkers methanol and reforms it onboard by separating the hydrogen molecules from the carbon and oxygen molecules. The hydrogen is then used as fuel while the carbon dioxide (CO2) is liquefied and stored onboard until next bunkering. When methanol is again bunkered, the carbon dioxide is given back to shore and used for the production of new methanol. This solution has the potential to reduce emissions for more than 97% and will enable EXMAR to gain experience handling different gases such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methanol.

3. POLICY REGARDING GENDER DIVERSITY
3.1 LEGISLATION The Board of Directors took note of the Belgian law of 28 July 2011 regarding to gender diversity on the level of the Board of Directors, the members of the Executive Committee and persons entrusted with the daily management of the Company.
In accordance with provision 2.1 of the Belgian Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors needs to be composed based on gender diversity and diversity in general.
Regarding the gender diversity at the level of the Board of Directors, Section 7 of the Law of 28 July 2011 stipulates that companies with a free float of less than 50% have a period of eight years rather than six years to regularise themselves.
3.2 CURRENT SITUATION The Board of Directors consists of three female members out of a total of 11 members. The necessary measures will be taken for future appointments to ensure that the required quotas (one third female directors) are reached. EXMAR aims to reach this goal before the imposed term (2019) included in the law.
A 47/53 female to male ratio was recorded for 2017 for the overall total of 193 employees working at Group headquarters (all the companies ­ see EXMAR in the world section on page 10). The appointment of a total of 15 female officers including two Captains and one Chief Officer serving in the EXMAR fleet has been a consequence of internal training and development combined with practical experience, with this same philosophy being applied on shore to develop female staff (see Care for today ­ Respect for tomorrow, page 45).
4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In order to assess the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, the Board introduced an evaluation process in 2011 (renewed in 2014). In the course of 2017, a new Board evaluation plan was set up which will be implemented in 2018 and consists of a questionnaire followed by a conduction of one-to-one interviews, an analysis of results and a formulation of recommendations which will result in an action plan with the necessary follow-up. The Board holds a closed session after every meeting.

RISKS

STRATEGIC RISKS
DESCRIPTION OF RISK
MARKET RISKS
The overall gas and oil market and the worldwide market for the transportation of gas is cyclical.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
A decline in the overall oil and gas market could impact the freight rates for transportation of gas and would affect our income and cash flows and could affect the value of our fleet.

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL
Diversified client base and a significant coverage with a mix of long-term and short-term charters. The value of our fleet is continuously monitored and assessed by using internal and external information.

Lower demand for gas carriers, FSRU's as well as other floating assets including our LNG infrastructure assets.

A lower demand would impact the freight rates and the number of off-hire days of our fleet. This would impact our business and cash flows as well as the value of our fleet and our financial position.

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

The overall gas and oil market and the worldwide market for the transportation of gas is cyclical.

A decline in the overall oil and gas market could impact the freight rates for transportation of gas and would affect our income and cash flows and could affect the value of our fleet.

A significant part of our fleet is secured on long-term charters. Geographical diversification and a qualitative client portfolio and network through integration in the markets thanks to years of experience. We are a flexible shipping company aiming for structural quality and durability for our clients.
Diversified client base and a significant coverage with a mix of long-term and short-term charters. The value of our fleet is continuously monitored and assessed by using internal and external information.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 55

DESCRIPTION OF RISK
COMPETITION
Competitors investing in LPG carriers, FSRU's or other floating assets through consolidation, acquisitions of second hand or newbuildings.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The process of obtaining a charter is highly competitive. Increased competition may cause greater price competition for price charters and might impact the price of vessels or other floating assets. This could have a material effect on our results and cash flows and the value of our fleet.

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL
Defining a strategy with a long-term vision and consistent management of ongoing trends in the industry. Experience of our management team and our Board of Directors. Investing in a variety of factors such as the quality of our operations, technical abilities and reputation, quality and experience of our crew and relationships within the industry.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

DESCRIPTION OF RISK

POTENTIAL IMPACT

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL

RISKS ENTAILED IN THE OPERATION OF VESSELS AND OTHER FLOATING ASSETS

Environmental accidents, work interruptions caused by mechanical defects, human error, war, terrorism, political actions in various countries, strikes and bad weather. Vessels not meeting certain performance standards.

Any such event would harm our reputation as reliable shipping company and would result in increased costs and an increase of the number of off-hire days. The cost of urgent repairs are more unpredictable and can be very high. In case performance standards are not met the charterer could withhold a portion of the hire.

Our experience within the industry and our policies and procedures such as our maintenance and training programme should limit or avoid certain risks inherent in our business. All our vessels and assets are covered by adequate insurance.

INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES

Operating expenses and maintenance expenses can be volatile.

Operating expenses and drydock capital expenditures depend on a variety of factors which are outside our control and affect the entire shipping industry. Drydocking of vessels can also result in loss of income.

Proactive in-house ship management and a continuous in-house and external inspection of our assets. Our maintenance policy is updated and improved on a day-to-day basis with the objective to maintain the highest quality levels.

FLEET AGE PROFILE

As a ship ages class requirements become more stringent and compared to new modern ships the vessel will be less competitive and more expensive to operate.

We must make substantial capital expenditure to maintain the operational capacity of our fleet. These expenditures could vary significantly and can increase as a result of customer requirements, competitive standards and regulations or organizations standards.

The average age of our fleet is monitored and our strategy includes regular investments in new vessels to keep our fleet competitive. Our in-house ship manager and commercial team has many years of experience to assess the operational and commercial performance. All our vessels are certified as "in class" by a classification society which is also a requirement for insurance coverage. Inspections of our fleet are carried out on a day-to-day basis at sea or in port. Based on these inspections the continual maintenance plan of each vessel is created, updated and implemented.

56 FINANCIAL REPORT

DESCRIPTION OF RISK
ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Specific risks apply to our assets under construction and include the solvency of our contractor as well as the delivery of the asset in accordance with all specifications and securing all required permits.
EMPLOYMENT
Vessels or other floating assets remain offhire for a substantial period or charters are not renewed or terminated early.
REGULATIONS
New regulation could come into force. Environmental law changes can also be implemented by public or other authorities.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
Failure by the shipyard to construct or deliver our assets under construction or bankruptcy by the shipyard would have a substantial impact on our financial position and our results. In the event the shipyard does not perform and we are not able to enforce the refund guarantee we might lose all or part of our investment. Additionally, we might fail to comply with our obligations towards the charterer.
In case we cannot enter into profitable long-term charters for our existing fleet or our floating assets under construction our result and cash flows might be substantially affected. We would be subject to a shortterm or spot market or charters based on changing market prices. In addition it might be more difficult to obtain financing for such assets at reasonable terms.
Regulatory changes could impact our ability to charter our vessels or floating assets and might increase expenditure to be made to comply with all requirements and legislation.

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL
Advance payments are made to the shipyards and these payments are secured by refund guarantees. Progress of the construction and compliance with all technical and regulatory specifications is closely monitored by our technical teams at the shipyards. Solvency of the shipyards is also continuously assessed by the management team.
Our management team and our commercial team have many years of experience and have an extensive network in the market. Our charter portfolio is very diversified. The commercial strategy is to remain flexible in the market by having a good balance between long-term and short-term charters.
Continuous monitoring and anticipation of changes in legislation and applicable requirements. Our in-house ship manager and our management team have many years of experience and an extensive network within the industry to monitor ongoing trends and changes.

FINANCIAL RISKS

DESCRIPTION OF RISK
COUNTERPARTY RISKS
Dependency on a limited number of clients, we receive a considerable part of our income from a limited number of clients.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
Deterioration of the financial viability of one of our significant clients would lead to a significant loss of income and cash flows.

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL
Obligations of clients under long-term charters can be secured by guarantees or other securities. Most of our significant clients have been client of EXMAR for many years, our management team has the necessary experience and knows how to assess the operations and financial viability of our clients.

Charterers can be in default or can become bankrupt.

In case of the loss of a client our income and cash flows would be impacted. The costs of rechartering the vessel can be high and the market conditions can be unfavourable.

Our customer base is diversified and consists of major companies active in the oil and gas market. Extensive credit checks are performed for new clients and additional securities or guarantees will be requested if deemed necessary. Charter hire is payable in advance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 57

DESCRIPTION OF RISK
FINANCING
EXMAR is subject to restrictions on credit agreements, such as financial covenants and restrictions for EXMAR and its subsidiaries to take on further debts, distribute dividends, undertake certain investments, sell part of its business without the consent of its lenders.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The existing financing arrangements for our fleet are secured by the vessels and parent company guarantees and contain restrictions and other covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. Any default could result in the acceleration of the maturity date and lenders could call on the guarantees of these facilities.

LIMITING FACTORS AND CONTROL
Our cash flows and our financial position, including the requirements under the financing agreements, are continuously monitored. Our financing strategy aims for a diversification of financing resources and a spread of maturity dates. A dialogue is maintained with different investors and financial partners in order to build a longterm relationship. As of 31 December 2017, all applicable financial covenants under the financing arrangements are complied with sufficient headroom.

Financing to be obtained for assets under construction and existing financing arrangements to be refinanced at maturity date.
INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES
A significant portion of our financing arrangements has a variable interest rate. Our operations are in USD but certain costs are in EUR, a portion of our financial debt is in NOK.
IMPAIRMENT
Negative variations in the fair market value of our fleet and other floating assets.

Impossibility to finance or refinance our assets under construction and our existing fleet would have a substantial impact on our financial position. The financing possibilities and the cost of financing can be volatile and dependent on the overall economic circumstances.
An increase of the interest rates on the international financial markets would negatively impact our cash flows and could negatively impact the fair value of financial instruments used to hedge the interest rate exposure. A weakening of the USD compared to the EUR/NOK would negatively influence our results.
A significant decline in the fair value of our fleet could lead to an impairment loss to be recognized and would have a significant impact on our financial position and result. The ratio of the fair value of our fleet compared to the outstanding debt is a financial covenant in our financing arrangements. A significant decline could trigger an event of default under such arrangements. Our activities tend to be cyclical resulting in changes in the overall fair value of the fleet on the short-term. A significant decline could trigger an event of default under such arrangements.

Financing is inherent to our activities and investments. Our management team has numerous contacts and support of different financing partners and has many years of experience in obtaining financing for a variety of activities and investments.
The interest rate exposure and the foreign currency exposure are actively managed and various instruments will be used to cover an appropriate part of the exposure.
The value of our fleet is continuously monitored using internal and external information. The carrying value of our fleet is supported by long-term cash flow projections. As of 31 December 2017 all financial covenants under our financing arrangements are complied with.

4. REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee, including the CEO, consists of:

The decision on the application of this dispensation was delegated by the Shareholders' Meeting to the Board of Directors.

4.1 FIXED ANNUAL SALARY The scale of the fixed remuneration for members of the Executive Committee, including the executive directors, is linked to the function performed by the person concerned, his responsibilities and competencies. The remuneration is determined on the basis of the remunerations of a reference group consisting of a number of comparable enterprises in the maritime industry. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee can, if necessary, call on an independent external consultant.
Once a year the various compensation components for the members of the Executive Committee (including the CEO) are evaluated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and tested against conditions in the market.

If the result deviates substantially from the basis on which the variable remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee is calculated, the Board of Directors can decide to revise the variable part of the remuneration and if need be to reclaim that part.
4.3 LONG TERM INCENTIVE (LTI) EXMAR works towards creation of sustainable economic value by means of long-term remuneration. This ensures that the interests of the members of the Executive Committee are more in line with those of shareholders and that they remain bound to the Company.
The long-term remuneration consists of a share option plan for existing EXMAR shares.

4.2 VARIABLE REMUNERATION The short-term variable remuneration (annual bonus) rewards members of the Executive Committee for achieving performance criteria and the amount is expressed as a percentage of the fixed annual remuneration. The evaluation period is the financial year.
The variable payment depends on the Company's results, as well as on other factors such as the performance of the individual, future prospects, the market situation, exceptional contribution(s) and/or special projects.

The options can only be exercised after a period of three years. In the event that a member of the Executive Committee resigns or is dismissed for compelling reasons by EXMAR the right to exercise the options lapses.
The amounts of share options offered are every year approved by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The granting of stock options is not linked to pre-determined and objectively quantifiable performance criteria.

The variable remuneration is linked to developments in the results and to the specific evaluation and the performance of each individual.The Board of Directors can deviate from this and decide to award a bonus to a member of the Executive Committee on the basis of other objective criteria.
The Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 17 May 2011 decided on the application of the provision of article 520ter of the Code of Companies and waived the staggering of the payment of the variable remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee.

4.4 INSURANCE PACKAGE The members of the Executive Committee with self-employed or employed status benefit from group insurance (type individual pension benefits for the self-employed) as well as guaranteed income insurance, accident insurance, hospitalisation insurance and travel insurance.
4.5 OTHER COMPENSATION COMPONENTS The members of the Executive Committee receive a company car, a cell phone and meal cheques.

REMUNERATION REPORT 61

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

Dear shareholders,
The Board of Directors submits for your approval the statutory and consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV (the "Company") for the year ended 31 December 2017. It's drawn up in accordance with articles 96 and 119 of the Belgian Companies Code.
Under the provisions of the Royal Decree of 14 November 2017 regarding the duties of issuers of financial instruments admitted to trading on the Belgian regulated market, the Company is required to publish its annual financial report.

The elements that are applicable to the Company as provided by the regulations mentioned above, as well as in the Companies Code, are addressed in the present financial statements, and also in the annual report under the Corporate Governance Statement.
This annual report should be read together with EXMAR's report on 2017.

1. THE STATUTORY ACCOUNTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH BELGIAN GAAP

SHARE CAPITAL The share capital of the Company amounts to USD 88,811,667 and is represented by 59,500,000 no-par-value shares. All shares have been paid up in full. The capital has not changed during the past financial year.
Notwithstanding the provisions laid down in Article 125 of the Companies Code, the capital and the accounting are expressed in US dollars. This derogation was granted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and was confirmed in writing on 2 July 2003. The Board of Directors believes that the reasons for which this derogation was requested still apply to the financial statements for the period under discussion.
During the past financial year, no capital changes have occurred that must be reported in accordance with article 608 of the Companies Code.
COMMENTARY ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The statutory result for the financial year amounts to USD 111.1 million (USD -3.6 million in 2016).
Operating expenses increased compared to 2016 with USD 3 million, mainly due to an increase in variable remunerations.
Financial income increased with USD 92 million in comparison with 2016, this is partly due to the sale of subsidiary Belgibo to JLT and the sale of joint-ventures Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV to Excelerate Energy. Another explanation is the reversal of the value reduction registered in 2016 (USD 24.5 million, see also explanation below under financial expenses).
Financial expenses decreased compared to 2016 with USD 23.9 million: the financial expenses in 2016 included a value reduction on other receivables (USD 24.5 million).
At the end of 2017, the total assets amounted to USD 762.7 million (USD 891.3 million at the end of 2016), including USD 674 million financial fixed assets (USD 680.2 million in 2016).

Shareholder's equity amounted to USD 649.1 million at the end of 2017 (USD 538 million in 2016). The increase of USD 111.1 million is the effect of the profit of the financial year 2017 for the same amount.
Total liabilities at the end of 2017 amounted to USD 111 million (USD 350.6 million at the end of 2016), of which USD 111 million short-term debt (USD 270.2 million debt exceeding one year, USD 79.1 million short-term debt and USD 1.3 million accrued charges and deferred income at the end of 2016). The decrease in the debt exceeding one year can be explained by the repayment of the bank debt as a consequence of the sale of joint-ventures Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV to Excelerate Energy.
The 2017 statutory annual accounts show a profit of USD 111.1 million. Including the results carried forward from the previous financial years, an amount of USD 260.3 million is available for appropriation.
APPROPRIATION OF THE RESULT The Board will propose to the General Shareholders' Meeting to appropriate the result for the year as follows:

Profit brought forward: Profit of the period:
Transfer from the reserves not available for distribution:
Result to be carried forward:

USD 146,750,420.81 USD 111,055,820.81 USD 2,529,401.55 USD 260,335,643.17

Following this appropriation, the shareholders' equity of USD 649,049,811.77 will be composed as follows:

Capital: Issue premium: Reserves: Retained earnings:

USD 88,811,667.00 USD 209,901,923.77 USD 90,000,577.83 USD 260,335,643.17

62 FINANCIAL REPORT

2. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)

Below commentary on the consolidated financial statements is based on the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.
In 2017, EXMAR Group achieved a consolidated result of USD 28 million (USD 40.4 million in 2016).
Revenue decreased in comparison with 2016 (USD -2.6 million). This decrease can be partially explained by the WARIBOKO transaction (Offshore segment). At the end of May 2016, EXMAR sold part of its ownership (60%) in the WARIBOKO to its Nigerian partner Springview. Another explanation for this decrease in the Offshore segment is the barge KISSAMA. The KISSAMA reached the end of her last time charter in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was sold during April 2017 to a Southwest Asian buyer. The decrease in the Offshore segment is partially offset by an increase of revenue in the LPG segment as a consequence of the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong end of June 2016.

The share of result of equity accounted investees amounted to USD 18.7 million (USD 34.6 million in 2016). The lower midsize gas carriers rates compared to 2016 explain an important part of this decrease. The vessels amounted to USD 563 million and comprise the LPG pressurized fleet, the CFLNG and the FSRU. The CFLNG and FSRU have been delivered during 2017, both platforms have been transferred from under construction to vessels.
The investment in equity accounted investees amounted to USD 104.4 million (2016: USD 147.6 million) and consists of our share in the different joint ventures and associates. The decrease compared to 2016 can be mainly explained by the sale of the LNG companies to Excelerate Energy and the classification as held for sale of the company Excelsior. On 31 January 2018, EXMAR has sold its 50% shares in Excelsior BVBA to Excelerate Energy for an amount of USD 81 million. EXMAR will record a capital gain of approximately USD 31 million on this sale in the first quarter of 2018.

The capital gain on the sales of assets amounted to USD 98.4 million and mainly relates to the sale of subsidiary Belgibo to JLT and the sale of joint-ventures Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV to Excelerate Energy.
The other operating income decreased compared to 2016 with USD 24.2 million. In 2016, the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet from Wah Kwong resulted in a badwill of USD 14.3 million which was recognized in other operating income. Another element of the other operating income in 2016 was the termination fee of USD 9 million paid by Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) as a consequence of the termination of the tolling agreement for the CARIBBEAN FLNG. Both elements are non-recurring elements and explain major part of the decrease in other operating income.
Operating expenses increased compared to 2016 with USD 20.9 million, mainly as a consequence of the fees paid to Wison in respect of the CARIBBEAN FLNG.
The net finance result for 2017 amounted to USD -40 million (2016: USD 4.3 million). The decrease can be mainly explained by the impairment loss registered on the shareholders' loan to Monteriggioni. Part of the shareholder loan has been repaid during 2017 with the proceeds of the sale of the vessel EXCEL. The remaining part of the loan has been waived during 2017 and resulted in the registration of an impairment loss. In the result from equity accounted investees, the income part of this waiver has been registered. Consequently, the waiver of the loan has no impact on the net result of the Group.

Borrowings to equity accounted investees amounted to USD 58.9 million (2016: USD 343.9 million) and comprise the shareholder loans granted to our LPG, LNG and offshore equity accounted investees. The decrease compared to 2016 is mainly caused by the repayment of the shareholder loans as a consequence of sale of Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV to Excelerate Energy.
The net cash position (cash and cash equivalents reduced by overdrafts at financial institutions) on 31 December 2017 amounted to USD 41.8 million (USD 121.1 million in 2016). The restricted cash relates to credit facilities and financial instruments agreements, they amounted to USD 67.4 million per 31 December 2017 (USD 34.9 million in 2016).
Total equity amounted to USD 477.6 million on 31 December 2017 (2016: USD 441.9 million). This increase in 2017 is mainly caused by the profit of 2017.
The financial debt amounted to USD 372.7 million on 31 December 2017 and decreased by USD 97 million compared to 2016. The financial debt primarily decreased as a consequence of the sale of the LNG companies Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV to Excelerate Energy. This decrease is partially offset by the new loan of USD 200 million for the financing of the CFLNG with the Bank of China.
The derivative financial instruments liabilities amounted to USD 0 per 31 December 2017 (2016: USD 36.2 million). In 2014 and 2015 EXMAR entered into two cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to cover its exposure on the issued bond in NOK. The term of the NOK bond has been extended until July 2019. The CCIRS-contracts have not been extended as a consequence of the extension of the term of the bond and have ended in July 2017.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 63

3. RISK FACTORS
The risks and uncertainties are described in the Corporate Governance Statement.

4. NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION
EXMAR recognizes the need for clear codes of conduct, structures and procedures to ensure compliance with the globally applicable standards, laws and practices relating to Corporate Governance.
EXMAR's Code of Business Ethics sets out the way in which our Company works, bringing together the values and setting out the rules and guiding principles.
The Code of Business Ethics describes rules and responsibilities of individuals and employees collectively when acting on behalf of EXMAR, as well as EXMAR's responsibilities towards employees, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, to ensure that each and every one of our colleagues understands what is expected from them and allowed when acting on behalf of EXMAR.

Compliance belongs to the overall business strategy and operations of the whole organization. To ensure even better compliance with rules and laws, and to reduce the risks of infringements and the adverse consequences for EXMAR and all the stakeholders, the Board of Directors implemented a Compliance Programme for EXMAR.
In order to comply with the EU Regulation (596/2014) on Market Abuse of 16 April 2014 effective in Belgium on 3 July 2016 a revised Dealing Code was and is included in the Corporate Governance Charter as Appendix 3. This Code summarizes the rules that must be observed in case of dealing in the Company's financial instruments. Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament obliges certain large companies to disclose non-financial information. EXMAR is subject to this Directive and relies on some of the frameworks named in the directive to disclose following info in the annual report.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES
Human Rights (see Business Principles)

POLICY
The EXMAR code of Business Ethics specifically refers to respect for all national and international laws and regulations that govern Human Rights, Forced labour, Child Labour and discrimination of all kinds both in letter and in spirit of the law. This code is translated into practice through several policies such as through sustainable procurement and procedures and processes for the Fleet Personnel management in line with and beyond Maritime Labour Convention. Control on the application of these policies and procedures is realised through careful selection of our key suppliers and internal and external verifications. Audits have also been conducted on key suppliers.

ACTIONS TAKEN
As a result of the policy, internal investigations have been conducted in cases where a risk for violation had been identified. Although none of the investigations were conclusive, procedures and processes were reviewed and internal communication was enhanced to ensure a more effective prevention of potential violations.

RISKS AND MITIGATION
The main risks for violations related to Human Rights must be sought within subcontractors of our suppliers. Therefore, suppliers' contracts contain the necessary clauses and in addition, a Sustainable Procurement Policy is being developed and is now being actively communicated to our business partners.

Anti-Corruption (see Business Principles)

The EXMAR code of Business Ethics contains a clear policy on business gifts, bribes and facilitation payments. This is supported by a procedure on Bribery and Facilitation payments for the use on board of the fleet and onshore. Control on the application is ensured through compliance officers, the Risk Committee and ultimately the Audit Committee.

All possible cases of facilitation payments are reported through the management system, which allows adequate follow up and response. In addition, internal communications via specific campaigns have been communicated on board.

The most frequent risks for violations against anti-corruption laws find themselves on board of vessels calling ports where corruption among civil servants is prevalent and systemic.

64 FINANCIAL REPORT

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES
Environment (see Care for today , Respect for tomorrow)

POLICY
Within the framework of its ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification, EXMAR Ship Management has developed an Environmental and Energy management manual which includes policies, procedures and records to support the mission of EXMAR Ship Management to contribute to a cleaner and more efficient energy supply for the world, as a world-class global provider of specialized services to the oil and gas industry.
These include procedures to ensure compliance of the operations with the international conventions and national legislations and a continuous improvement approach.

ACTIONS TAKEN
A younger fleet with more efficient propulsion and machinery, a more effective hull form and the retrofitting of exhaust gas treatment systems guarantee a continuous improvement on the emissions of our fleet.
In line with the European Monitoring, Reduction and Verification legislation, a detailed measuring plan was developed which over the next years will allow us to analyse and to take focused measures to further reduce the impact of our operations on the environment. This includes implementing the IMO global limit for sulphur in fuel oil used on board ships set for January 2020.
A fully developed Ballast Water Management plan is in force which includes the roll out of Ballast Water Treatment Systems including retrospective installations on board.
The reduction of our energy footprint is taken care of by optimizing the entire operation and management of the ships for Energy Cost Efficiency by measuring and improving on our Nautical Mile per Fuel ratio and increasing the efficiency of the cargo handling and conditioning processes. The adoption of both closed and open circuit scrubbers on board a number of the EXMAR LPG newbuilds to comply with the IMO 2020 global sulfur cap has yielded positive results. EXMAR has also retrofitted one of its newbuilds with a scrubber and plans further energy-saving innovations with its two VLGC newbuilds
For a recent recycling of a midsize LPG vessel, EXMAR has undertaken a careful and thorough due diligence and has selected a recycling yard that implements measures and policies in line with the Hong Kong Convention as adopted by the UN in 2009. EXMAR will further perform audits during the recycling to ensure that the agreed policies and standards are being respected. The VLGC newbuild programme EXMAR charter agreement foresees the use of LPG as fuel.

RISKS AND MITIGATION
Whereas Ballast Water Treatment systems are being retrofitted throughout the fleet; the different regional legislations and the application of new and unproven technologies are a concern.
In order to ensure correct implementation of the environmental and energy management system, environmental awareness trainings are being provided to all relevant staff members, weather routing is applied and ship performance enhancement tools are in use on board, the effective use of which is monitored by dedicated shore office staff grouped in the Energy Efficiency Team.
Finally, while accidental pollution cannot be ruled out, EXMAR has all the necessary systems in place to ensure a rapid and adequate emergency response to rapidly control any potential spill and effectively reduce its impact on the marine life.

POLICY
A safe environment for our personnel to work in, is our top priority. With a diverse workforce of over 15 nationalities both on board and ashore, effective leadership is considered the key to operating to the highest safety standards. To this extent, a safety vision was developed which was translated into the Company's HSEQ policy, an extensive HSEQ manual and a training programme. "Taking the SAFETY LEAD" is our roadmap to a strong and resilient safety culture, empowering every individual to take up his or her responsibility to make safety a natural part of their life, to stop unsafe acts or conditions and to be a role model to their colleagues and beyond.

ACTIONS TAKEN
Taking the SAFETY LEAD programme was launched several years ago with the first steps into creating the safety vision, the training programme and the development of a shared model. Now, four years later, Taking the SAFETY LEAD is a mature concept adopted by our seafaring and office staff, demonstrated by leading and lagging indicators, ranging from reporting and understanding of the concept to the factual accident statistics. The initiative will be further promoted using training and seminars at the various EXMAR offices around the world with a focus on how Taking the SAFETY LEAD can be further adopted in daily working life on shore.

RISKS AND MITIGATION
The overall success of any safety programme is dependent of the implementation by individuals and individual senior staff members in particular. The recently enhanced evaluation process of our fleet personnel and shore staff is the core of the Leadership development.
Some recent navigational incidents, often involving port services such as pilots or Vessel Traffic Control Centres, cause a concern in the way bridge teams interact during the final stretches of their voyage towards port. To mitigate this risk, navigational procedures, training on board and control over their application is improved.

5. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The activities carried out or planned in the area of research and development are described in the first part of this report and should be read together.
STAFF EMPLOYED On 31 December 2017, EXMAR employed 1,981 people worldwide, including 1,691 seagoing staff (2016: 1,969 of which 1,628 are seagoing personnel). Almost all seagoing personnel are employed on the assets held by our equity accounted investees. As a consequence, the related expenses are not included in the personnel expenses of the consolidated financial statements.
ACQUISITION OF OWN SHARES The authorization to acquire shares was granted to the Board of Directors by decision of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 20 May 2014, renewing the authorization of the Board of Directors ,

on 19 May 2015, to proceed, in case of a takeover bid for the securities of EXMAR NV, to a capital increase in accordance to the provisions and within the limits of Article 607 of the Companies Code. The Board of Directors is authorised to apply these measures if the notice of a takeover bid is given by the Financial Services and Markets Authority to the Company, not later than three years after the date of the abovementioned Extraordinary General Meeting. On 31 December 2017, EXMAR held 2,485,247 own shares, representing 4.18% of the total number of issued shares.
STOCK OPTION PLAN So far, the Board of Directors has decided on ten occasions to offer options on existing shares to a number of employees of the EXMAR Group.
Plan 1, 5 and 6 have been removed from below table as the plans matured. Plan 5 matured at the end of 2016, plans 1 and 6 matured at the end of 2017.

66 FINANCIAL REPORT

JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The accounting principles applied at the closing of the annual financial statements do not differ from the accounting principles that were applied in the previous financial year. The summary of the accounting principles is attached to the annual financial statements.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE The significant events occurred after the closing of the financial year 2017 are disclosed in note 37 of the consolidated financial statements.
OFFICES AND BRANCHES Besides the Head Office in Antwerp (Belgium), EXMAR has offices in Hong Kong, Houston, London, Limassol, Luxembourg, Mumbai, Paris, Singapore, the Netherlands and Livorno.
EXMAR has branches in Shanghai and Angola.
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR The Statutory Auditor did not carry out any exceptional activities or special assignments during the past financial year.
USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The long-term vision, that is typical of EXMAR's activities, is accompanied by long-term financing and therefore EXMAR's activities are also exposed to floating interest rates. EXMAR actively manages this exposure and if deemed appropriate could cover itself for rising interest rates.
EXMAR successfully closed a NOK 700 million senior unsecured bond issue in 2014 and issued an additional NOK 300 million in 2015. In 2014 and 2015 EXMAR entered into two cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to cover its exposure on the issued bond in NOK. The term of the NOK bond has been extended until July 2019. The CCIRS-contracts

have not been extended as a consequence of the extension of the term of the bond and have ended in July 2017. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. The FV of this contract per 31 December 2017 has been registered in the consolidated profit or loss (USD 1.1 million).
EXMAR operates in USD but has to settle certain annual costs in Euros. The EUR/USD exposure is managed by means of hedging instruments if deemed necessary. At the date of this report EXMAR has no cover of EUR/USD exposure.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 523 OF THE CODE OF COMPANIES During the meeting of the Board of Directors held on 6 December 2017, the directors had the item "Report of the Meeting of the Remuneration Committee" on the agenda.
Extract from the minutes: "Prior to discussion of this agenda item and in compliance with Article 523 of the Code of Companies, CEO Nicolas Saverys and COO Patrick De Brabandere inform the other Board members that, as members of the Executive Committee and as beneficiaries of the proposed remuneration, they have a pecuniary interest that conflicts with that of the Company. Nicolas Saverys and Patrick De Brabandere will not participate in the discussion or voting on the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee with respect to the remuneration of the Executive Committee. Both gentlemen will inform the auditors in writing in compliance with Art 523 of the Code of Companies."
There were no conflicts of interest as far as the Executive Committee is concerned.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 67

OUTLOOK 2018
Exports of LPG are expected to further increase in the US and Middle East, with stronger demand in the Far East and India. Due to EXMARs limited exposure in the VLGC segment in 2018, the impact on its earnings will be limited. EXMAR continues to secure employment but at lower rates than 2017. Presently its MGC fleet cover for 2018 is 71% and 86% of EXMAR's pressurized fleet is covered for 2018.
EXMAR will start to benefit from the contribution of the FSRU contract in the second half 2018.
EXMAR Offshore Company (EOC) has been preselected for a FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) project in Brazil.

Confirmation of selection of the contenders is expected in the second semester of 2018. Furthermore, the Company continues to make progress on several OPTI®-designed semisubmersible prospects.
All information which pursuant to Article 96(2) of the Companies Code must be included in the present annual report of the Board of Directors, more particularly the Corporate Governance Statement and the requirements of Article 34 of the Royal Decree of 14 November 2007, is shown under the chapter `Corporate Governance Statement'.

6. APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We request the General Meeting of Shareholders to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 in their entirety, and to appropriate the result as provided in this report.

7. DISCHARGE
We also request the Meeting to grant discharge to the directors and the Statutory Auditor for the performance of their mandates during the above-mentioned financial year.
Pursuant to the law and the Articles of Association, the shareholders will be requested on the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 15

May 2018 to grant discharge to the directors and the Statutory Auditor for the execution of their mandates during the past financial year.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 73

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. REPORTING ENTITY EXMAR nv ("the Company") is a company domiciled in Belgium whose shares are publicly traded (Euronext ­ EXM). The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the Company, its subsidiaries, and the Group's interest in associates and joint arrangements (referred to as "The Group"). The Group is active in the industrial shipping business.
B. BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by EU on 31/12/2017.
The group has adopted the following new standards, amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, and new interpretations with a date of initial application of 1 January 2017. These new standards and amendments did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
· Amendments to IAS 7 (disclosure initiative). · Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset for Unrealized Losses (Amend-
ments to IAS 12). · Amendments to IFRS 12 included in the 2014-2016 Annual Improve-
ments Cycle.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in July 2014 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements, which align hedge accounting more closely with risk management. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. This new standard has been endorsed by the EU. The Group does not plan to early adopt the Standard.
PHASE 1: CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES With respect to the classification and measurement, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS has been reduced; all recognized financial assets that are currently within the scope of IAS 39 will be subsequently measured at either amortized cost or fair value under IFRS 9.
Specially: · A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose
objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at amortized costs (net of any write down of impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option.

· A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and (ii) has contractual terms that give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option.
· All other debt instruments must be measured at FTPL. · All equity instruments are to be measured in the statement of financial
position at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with dividend income recognized in profit or loss.
IFRS 9 eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sales.
Based on its assessment, the Group does not believe that the new classification and measurement requirements for financial assets will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. At 31 December 2017, the Group had equity investments classified as available-for-sales with a fair value of USD 4.6 million. Under IAS 39 the fair value reserve in respect of these shares has been recycled to the statement of profit or loss in 2016 as a result of a significant and prolonged decline in the fair value of these shares. The current year's change in fair value has also been registered in the statement of profit or loss. This will also be the case for future changes in fair value. Consequently, under IFRS 9, the Group has designated these investments as measured at FVTPL.
IFRS 9 also contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and derecognition requirements. One major difference from IAS 39 relates to the presentation of changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as at FVTPL attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability. Under IFRS 9, such changes are presented in other comprehensive income, unless the presentation of the effect of the change in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability's credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Under IAS 39, the entire amount of the change in fair value of the financial liability designated as FVTPL is presented in profit or loss.
The Group has not designated any financial liability at FVTPL and it has no current intention to do so. The Group's assessment did not indicate any material impact regarding the classification and measurement of financial liabilities per 1 January 2018.
PHASE 2: IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

74 FINANCIAL REPORT

Based on its assessment, the Group does not believe that the new impairment model will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in note 29 of the consolidated financial statements, no important impairment losses have occurred in the past and no important credit losses are expected by management.
PHASE 3: HEDGE ACCOUNTING The general hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms under IAS 39. However, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specially broadening the types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting. In addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with the principle of an "economic relationship". Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer required. More disclosure requirements about an entity's risk management activities have been introduced.
When initially applying IFRS 9, the Group may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9. The Group has chosen to apply the new requirements of IFRS 9.
The types of hedge accounting relationships that the Group currently designates meet the requirements of IFRS 9 and are aligned with the entity's risk management strategy and objective.
Based on its assessment, the Group does not anticipate that the application of IFRS 9 hedge accounting will have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related interpretations. IFRS 15 is effective for the annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. This new standard and Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (issued on 12 April 2016) have been endorsed by the EU. The Group does not plan to early adopt the Standard.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach for revenue recognition:
· Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer · Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract · Step 3: Determine the transaction price · Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract · Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a per-
formance obligation
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when `control' of the goods or services

underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The Group recognizes revenue from the following major sources: · Time or bareboat charter revenue: revenue is recognized on an
accrual basis and in recorded over the term of the charter as the service is provided. This type of revenue falls within the scope of IAS 17/ IFRS 16 Leasing (see below). · Service revenue: the Group is involved in performing specialized supporting services to the oil and gas industry:
- Shipmanagement services: in accordance with IFRS 15, the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance as the entity performs (recurring services).
- Travel agency services: in accordance with IFRS 15, the Group acts as an agent for the services provided. As a consequence, the Group recognizes revenue not on a gross basis, but only recognizes to which it expects to be entitled to.
Apart from providing more extensive disclosure's on the Group's revenue transactions, the Group does not anticipate that the application of IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The Group plans to adapt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying this standard recognized at the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). As a result, the Group will not apply the requirements of IFRS 15 to the comparative period presented.
IFRS 16 Leasing: In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard for lease accounting, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The standard has been endorsed by the European Union. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases for a lessee and introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees. All leases, except leases with a term of lease less than twelve months or low-value leases, are capitalized by recognizing the present value of the lease payments and presenting them as a right of use asset in the statement of financial position of the lessee. Lease payments that are paid over time should be presented as a financial liability. In the statement of profit or loss, the depreciation charge of the lease asset will be presented separately from the interest expense on the lease liability. IFRS 16 does not change substantially lease accounting for lessors. A lessor will continue to classify leases as either operational or finance lease and account for those two types of leases differently. The group is currently investigating the impact that the application of the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. As the Group is mainly lessor in respect of time or bareboat charter revenue, the Group does not expect that IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The following new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. · Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate
or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28).

The consolidated financial statements were approved and were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on March 29, 2018.
C. FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY The consolidated accounts are presented in USD in accordance with the deviation granted by the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) by letter of 2 July 2003, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. USD is the Company's functional currency. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material assets and liabilities that have been measured on an alternative basis on each reporting date: derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and the net defined benefit liability. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
D. USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has made judgements, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value for the share options, the employee benefit plans, provisions and contingencies and the classification of new lease commitments and time charter agreements.On a yearly basis the residual value and the useful life of the vessels is reviewed. The carrying values of the vessels may not represent the fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of new buildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. The carrying amounts of each specific fleet are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a specific fleet may not be fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the highest of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use. The fair value less cost to sell is determined based upon independent valuation reports. The value in use is based upon future cash flows discounted to their present value. In developing estimates of future cash flows, we must make assumptions about future charter rates, ship operating expenses,

the estimated remaining useful lives of the fleet and the WACC. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. The vessels are mainly registered within our equity accounted investees.
A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When measuring the fair value, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques:
· Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
· Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
E. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The group has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
F. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of consolidation
Business combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.
A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed to provide a return to investors (or other owners, members or participants) by way of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits. A business generally consists of inputs, processes applied on those inputs and the ability to create outputs. This can for instance be the case when the acquisition also contains the transfer of current contracts in respect of chartering, crew,...
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

76 FINANCIAL REPORT

Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. All intra-Group balances, income and expenses, unrealized gains and losses and dividends resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full.
Loss of control Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit and loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.
Interests in equity-accounted investees The Group's interest in equity accounted investees comprises interests in associates and joint ventures.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power.
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.
When the share of the Group in the losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of future losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. In such case the negative investment in equity accounted investees is deducted from other components of the investor's interest in the equity accounted investee (borrowings to equity accounted investees). If the negative investment in equity accounted investees exceeds the investor's interest, a liability is recognized for the net amount. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

b) Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are converted to the respective functional currencies at the exchange rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to USD at the exchange rate applicable at that date. The non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated to USD at the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss statement, except for qualified cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial statements of foreign operations Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to USD using the closing rate at reporting date. The income and expenses of the foreign operations are converted to USD at the exchange rate at he date of the transaction (the average exchange rate during the relevant period is used in case the date of transaction approximates this average rate).
Foreign currency differences are recognized directly in other comprehensive income. These foreign currency differences are presented within the translation reserve. However, if the operation is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests.When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit and loss.
c) Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial assets Loans and receivables and deposits are initially recognised on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets are recognised initially at trade date. The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flow from the assets expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset when and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

NOTES 77

Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit and loss if it is classified as held for trading or designated as such on initial recognition. Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised in the profit or loss statement as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised in the profit or loss statement.
Held-to maturity financial assets/other investments If the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity, then such financial assets are classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value (normally equals transaction price) plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and demand deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of the cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets include equity securities, which are not classified as held for trading, designated at fair value through profit and loss or held to maturity. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Available-for-sale financial assets are, subsequent to initial recognition, measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within the fair value reserve. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to the profit or loss statement. Once an investment in equity instruments has been impaired, all subsequent results are recognized in profit or loss until the asset is derecognized.
Non-derivative financial liabilities The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other financial liabilities are recognised initially at trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The Group has the following non-derivative financial liabilities: loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts and trade and other payables. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value (normally equals the transaction price for trade and other payables) plus any directly attributable transaction costs for loans and borrowings. Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of tax effects. When share capital

recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of tax, is recognised as a deduction from equity. When treasury shares are sold, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit and loss.
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and the hedged item(s), including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are expected to be "highly effective" in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within the range of 80-125%.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the profit or loss statement as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are recognized at fair value and changes therein are generally recognized in profit and loss, except for:
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The amount recognized in other comprehensive income is removed and included in the profit or loss statement in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect the profit or loss statement under the same line item as the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the profit or loss statement. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the designation is revoked, then the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction affects the profit or loss statement. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, than the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.
d) Goodwill
Goodwill arising upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration

78 FINANCIAL REPORT

transferred; plus the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Company's interest in the recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Subsequently goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee as a whole.
e) Intangible assets
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially new improved products and processes.
Development cost is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets (e.g. software,...) acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisations and accumulated impairment losses. The amortisation is recognized in the profit or loss statement, and is spread over the useful life of the relevant intangible assets following the straight-line depreciation method. The amortization starts from the date that they are available for use. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or that are not yet available for use, are subject to an annual impairment test.
Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assets to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
f) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, which includes capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and capitalized borrowing costs.
Subsequent expenses associated with items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised only if a future economic advantage will result from this expenditure and its cost can be measured reliably. If a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced, the replacement cost is capitalised and the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-today servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss statement as incurred.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, less its residual value and is recognized in profit or loss.
Vessels or units in the construction process are separately classified on the balance sheet as vessels under construction. These vessels under construction are not depreciated, depreciation starts at the moment that the vessels are delivered. As from the moment of delivery, the vessels are no longer classified as under construction. The business model of the Group aims to rent or operate the constructed assets.
The vessels are depreciated on a straight-line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful life in the Group. The residual value amounts to USD 0 for all vessels and platforms.

NOTES 79

Dry-docking expenses are capitalised when they occur and depreciated over a period until the next dry-dock.

Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful life using the straight-line depreciation method. Land is not depreciated. The estimated depreciation percentages of the various types of assets are as follows:

Buildings:

3%

Leased real estate:

3%

Plant and equipment:

20%

Furniture:

10%

Cars:

20%

Airplane:

10%

IT equipment:

33%

The method of depreciation, the residual value, and the useful life values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.
Leased assets Lease agreements substantially assigning all risks and rewards inherent to ownership to the Group, are classified as finance leases. The leased assets measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, are subsequently reduced by the accumulated depreciation and possible impairment losses. The depreciation period matches the useful life. If there is uncertainty with respect to the transfer of ownership to the Group at the end of the contract, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life.
g) Investment property
Investment property is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The depreciation is recognized in the profit or loss statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the investment properties.
h) Impairment of assets
Financial assets Financial assets measured at cost Financial assets measured at cost are assessed, at both individual and collective level, each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. When there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amount is written off. In assessing impairment, historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred is used.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted

at the asset's original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in the profit or loss statement. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit and loss.
Available for sale financial assets Impairment losses on available-for-sale investment securities are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity to profit and loss. An impairment loss is recognized in the profit or loss statement if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. The amount reclassified is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss. If the fair value of an impaired available for sale security subsequently increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, than the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss, otherwise it is reversed through OCI.
Equity accounted investees After application of the equity method, the entity applies IAS 39 to determine whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss with respect to its net investment in the associate or joint venture. An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss and is reversed when there is a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets The carrying value of non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated on each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. All impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss statement.

80 FINANCIAL REPORT

Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
i) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or components of a disposal group) are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter the assets (or disposal group) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to assets not in the measurement scope of IFRS 5, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of equity-accounted investees ceases once classified as held for sale or distribution.
j) Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss statement as the related service is provided. Defined benefit plans The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the

period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net Interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Belgian defined contribution plans with return guaranteed by law Belgian defined contribution plans are subject to the Law of April 28, 2003 on occupational pensions (hereafter `the WAP'). According to article 24 of this Law, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 3.75% on employee contributions and of 3.25% on employer contributions and this for contributions paid until 31/12/2015. As from January 2016, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 1,75% on both employer and employee contributions (as changed by the Law of 18 December 2015). This guaranteed minimum return generally exceeds the return that is normally guaranteed by the insurer. Because the employer has to guarantee the statutory minimum return on these plans, not all actuarial and investment risks relating to these plans are transferred to the insurance company managing the plans. Therefore these plans do not meet the definition of defined contribution plan under IFRS and have to be classified by default as defined benefit plans. An actuarial calculation has been performed in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility or withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting date, then they are discounted to their present value.
Short-term employee benefit Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the options. The amounts recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the

NOTES 81

amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at vesting date.
k) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as result of a past event, that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Restructuring provisions Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
l) Income
Revenues from assets sold and services rendered The company and/ or its joint ventures generate revenues from charterers for the use of its assets. Assets are chartered using voyage/ spot, time or bareboat charters. For voyage/spot charters, a contract is closed in the spot market for the use of an asset for a specific voyage at a contractual agreed rate per metric tonnes transported. For time or bareboat charters, a contract is entered into for the use of an asset for a specific period of time at a contractual agreed daily or monthly rate. Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the duration of each voyage, time or bareboat charter.
Revenue from the sale of assets is recognised in the profit or loss statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the assets, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards can vary depending on the individual terms of the sales agreement.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the profit or loss statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due and associated costs.

Commissions: if the group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as a principal in the transaction, then the revenue recognised is the net amount of commission made by the Group.
Rental income from investment property is recognised in the profit or loss statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease agreement.
m) Leases
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease.
At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments and other considerations required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair value. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impractible to separate the payments reliably, than an asset and a liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognised.
Leased assets Leases of assets that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as an operating lease and are not recognised in the statement of financial position.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments made as lessee under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The Group does not have financial lease contracts acting as lessor.
Contingent lease payments are accounted for in profit or loss except when they relate to future benefits in which case the minimum lease payments are revised over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.
n) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant

82 FINANCIAL REPORT

and are then recognised in profit and loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
o) Finance income and expenses
Finance income consists of interests received, dividend income, gains on the disposal of availablefor-sale financial assets, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss and exchange rate gains. Interest income is recognised in the profit or loss statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset. Dividend income is recognised in the profit or loss statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
Finance expenses consist of interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, impairment losses recognised on financial assets, exchange rate losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis per currency as either other finance income or finance expense.
p) Taxes
Income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax is recognized in the profit or loss statement, except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or when they relate to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss of the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that is has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain conditions are met.
Tonnage tax is not accounted for as income taxes in accordance with IAS 12 and is not presented as part of income tax expense in the profit or loss statement but is shown under other operating expenses.
q) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The result for each segment includes all income and expenses generated directly by this segment, as well as part of the income and expenses that can reasonably be allocated to this segment. The assets and liabilities allocated to a segment include as a minimum the assets and liabilities which are periodically reported to the Chief operating decision maker, being the Group's CEO and the Executive Committee.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
r) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit and loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for treasury shares held and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares such as share options granted to employees.
s) Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale; is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale. Classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative profit or loss statement is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

NOTES 83

2. SEGMENT REPORTING (in thousands of USD)

In respect of joint-ventures, the company continues to manage its operations based on internal management reports applying the principles of the proportionate consolidation method. The reconciliation of the segment reporting to the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of profit or loss is presented in note 3. All differences relate to the application of IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, no other differences exist.

The Group has 4 reportable segments. The Group's operating segments reflect the level at which the Group's CEO and the Executive Committee review the business and make decisions about the allocation of resources and other operating matters. These segments offer different products and services and are managed separately. The LPG segment includes transportation of Liquid Petroleum Gas, ammonia and other petrochemical gases through the Midsize, VLGC and pressurised fleet. The LPG fleet is reported as one segment taken into account the similar characteristics of the fleet (eg nature of the products,...). Transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas and LNG Infrastructure activities and assets are comprised in the LNG segment. The activities in the offshore industry through the supply of services and equipment are allocated to the Offshore segment. The segment Services includes the specialised supporting services such as shipmanagement services and travel agency services. The company's internal and management structure does not distinguish any geographical segments as the company's fleet navigates between geographical segments. The intra-segment revenue mainly relates to management and crew services provided.

Major LNG client Excelerate Energy Llc represents 98% (89% in 2016) of the revenue of the LNG segment revenue and 29% (29% in 2016) of the EXMAR Group revenue in 2017. Major LPG client Statoil represents 24% (22% in 2016) of the revenue of the LPG segment and 10% (9% in 2016) of the EXMAR Group revenue in 2017.

2016

The increase in revenue in the LPG segment is mainly due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong end of June 2016. The decrease in the Offshore segment can be partly explained by the WARIBOKO transaction. End of May 2016, EXMAR sold part of its ownership in the WARIBOKO to its logistical partner Springview. As a consequence of this sale, the remainig investment is consolidated using the equity consolidation method. Another explanation for the decrease in revenue in the Offshore segment is the barge KISSAMA. The KISSAMA reached the end of her last time charter in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was sold during April 2017 to a Southwest Asian buyer.

At the end of August 2017, EXMAR reached an agreement to sell Belgibo (including CMC Belgibo) to Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc. On December 7, 2017 EXMAR has sold its 50% shares in the LNG companies Excelerate NV, Explorer NV & Express NV to Excelerate Energy. We refer to note 10 for more information regarding the Belgibo and LNG sale. During April 2017, EXMAR has sold the platform KISSAMA, the gain realized on this sale amounts to USD 1.6 million. End of May 2016, EXMAR has sold part of its ownership (60%) in the WARIBOKO barge to its logistical partner Springview.

The badwill pressurized fleet transaction relates to the acquisition at the end of June 2016 of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong (LPG segment). The revaluation to fair value of the existing investment in CMC Belgibo relates to the acquisition at the end of December 2016 of the remaining 50.10% in CMC Belgibo. The termination fee of USD 9 million paid by Pacific Exploration and Production ("PEP") in 2016 relates to the termination of the tolling agreement for the Caribbean FLNG.

Vessel operating expenses are expenses made to operate a vessel. The increase in the vessel operating expenses compared to 2016 is mainly due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong end of June 2016. Non-vessel operating expenses increase compared to 2016, this is mainly caused by the fees paid to Wison Shipyard in respect of the CARIBBEAN FLNG.

A significant part of EXMAR's seagoing personnel is employed on the assets held or operated by EXMAR's equity accounted investees, the related expense is not included in the personnel expenses disclosed above but presented as operating expenses in EXMAR's equity accounted investees.

Personnel expenses decrease in comparison with 2016, mainly as a consequence the decreased number of staff personnel. This decrease is mainly situated in the services segment (as a consequence of the sale of the Belgibo group, see also note 10 in this respect) and in Exmar Offshore Company (Houston).

The majority of these taxes in the past was paid for the accomodation barge WARIBOKO in Nigeria, for which the 2017 amount totaled USD 0 (2016: USD 1 million). The decrease of these taxes can be explained by the partial sale of the WARIBOKO during 2016. As a consequence of this sale, the remainig investment is consolidated using the equity consolidation method.

Interest expenses increase compared to 2016, mainly as a consequence of increased interest expenses on the NOK bond. We also refer to note 24 in this respect.

The unrealized exchange losses mainly relate to the revaluation of the NOK bond and to the revaluation of EURO cash pool accounts in EXMAR NV towards other group companies. The banking fees for 2016 mainly consist of financing costs relating to the cancelled ICBC financing for the CFLNG. The banking fees in 2017 mainly consist of financing costs for the NOK bond and for the Bank of China financing for the CFLNG. The impairment loss on available-for-sales financial assets in 2016 is a result of a significant and prolonged decline in the fair value of the Teekay and Sibelco shares, the fair value reserve in respect of these shares has been reclassified to the statement of profit or loss. The current year's change in fair value has also been registered in the statement of profit or loss.

A shareholder's loan existed between Exmar LNG Investment and Monteriggioni. Part of the shareholder's loan has been repaid during 2017 with the proceeds of the sale of the vessel EXCEL. The remaining part of the loan has been waived during 2017 (see also note 16). In the result from equity accounted investees, the income part of this waiver has been registered. Consequently, the waiver of the loan has no impact on the net result of the Group.

10. DISPOSAL OF A SUBSIDIARY/ EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEE (in thousands of USD)
DISPOSAL OF A SUBSIDIARY EXMAR reached an agreement on 31 August 2017 to sell insurance broker Belgibo NV (including CMC Belgibo BVBA) to Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc (JLT), one of the world's leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and employee benefits related advice, brokerage and associated services. The assets and liabilities of these former subsidiaries have been derecognised from the balance sheet. The sale resulted in a gain of USD 26.7 million.

The base price of the Belgibo sale amounts to EUR 20.25 million. This amount has been received in cash in September 2017 and has been translated to USD at the exchange rate of September 2017 (1 = 1.1825 USD). The balance of the base price amounts to EUR 2.25 million. This amount has not yet been received by EXMAR and is subject to a successful audit of the August 31, 2017 figures. EXMAR does not expect significant corrections to the balance of the base price as a consequence of this audit. The balance of the base price has been translated to USD at the closing rate of 2017 (1 = 1.1993 USD).

DISPOSAL OF AN EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEE On December 7, 2017 EXMAR has sold its 50% share in the LNG companies Excelerate NV, Explorer NV & Express NV to Excelerate Energy. The investments in these equity accounted investees have been derecognised from the balance sheet. The sale resulted in a gain of USD 70 million. The three LNG companies each owned an LNG regassification vessel. These vessels were financed via shareholder's loans from EXMAR NV and Excelerate Energy. EXMAR NV financed these shareholder's loans with bank loans.

(*) The advance payments in respect of vessels under construction have been presented under vessels in the consolidated statement of financial position. The advance payments made do not give EXMAR ownership rights on the vessels before their final delivery.

(**) IAS 23 requires that borrowing costs which are attributable to the construction of vessels are to be capitalized as part of the asset. As a consequence of the non-application of IAS 23 in prior periods, the opening balances of vessels under construction, the interest cost of the prior period as well as the equity have been restated. The table below summarizes the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

(***) The change in consolidation scope for the LPG segment relates to the acquisition at the end of June 2016 of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong. The change in consolidation scope for the offshore segment relates to the partial sale (60%) at the end of May 2016 of the WARIBOKO barge to Springview. (****) The barge KISSAMA has been sold during April 2017. The gain realized on this sale amounts to USD 1.6 million. (*****) The CARIBBEAN FLNG has been delivered on 27 July 2017. Discussions on future employment with different parties are still ongoing. However, no revenues are expected in 2018. The barge is layed-up at the shipyard until the unit will be towed to its place of employment. The FSRU has been delivered end of December 2017. The unit was able to obtain a long-term contract and its employment is expected to commence mid 2018. Both platforms have been transferred from under construction to vessels.
The vessels are pledged as a security for the related underlying liabilities. We refer to note 24 for more information in respect of these underlying liabilities.

For the wholly-owned fleet, internal and external triggers are evaluated which indicate that the carrying value of this fleet should be tested for impairment. The carrying amount of the fleet is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is based upon the average fair market value as determined by two independent ship brokers. The value in use is based upon the estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value and reflecting current market assessments relating to freight rate estimates, employment and operating expenses. The discounted cash flow model used by management includes cash flows for the remaining lifetime of the wholly owned fleet. Three year cash flow forecasts are estimated by management based upon the past experience as well as current market expectations regarding volumes and freight rates going forward. Freight rates as well as operating expenses subsequent to this three year period are expected to change in line with estimated inflation afterwards. The discount rate used is a weighted average cost of capital of 6.05%.

For the CFLNG and the FSRU, a fair value calculation was obtained based on a valuation report of an independent ship broker. Based on this valuation report and reasonable expected earnings under future employment, management has concluded that no impairment correction is required for both barges.

For the jointly-owned fleet, impairment triggers are evaluated in the same way as for the wholly-owned fleet. We refer to note 14 for more information in this respect. As a consequence of this analysis, an impairment loss has been registered for the vessels "EXCEL" (USD 22.5 million) and "TEMSE" (USD 2.6 million). The impairment loss for the EXCEL was already registered in the accounts per June 30, 2017, the vessel was sold in the second semester of 2017. For the LPG MGC fleet, a value in use calculation has been performed. As the value in use exceeds the carrying value, no impairment has been registered in this respect.

98 FINANCIAL REPORT

EXMAR has analysed the existing joint arrangements and has concluded that the existing joint arrangements are all joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11 "joint arrangements".
EXMAR has provided guarantees to financial institutions that have provided credit facilities to her equity accounted investees. As of December 31, 2017, an amount of USD 641 million (2016: USD 602 million) was outstanding under such loan agreements, of which EXMAR has guaranteed USD 320.5 million (2016: USD 301 million). We refer in this respect also to note 29.
Following regulatory requirements or borrowing arrangements, our joint ventures or associates may be restricted to make cash distributions such as dividend payments or repayments of shareholder loans. Under the borrowing arrangements our joint ventures or associates may only make a distribution if no event of default or no breach of any covenant would result from such distribution. Under corporate law, dividend distributions are restricted if the net assets would be less than the amount of paid up capital plus any reserves that cannot be distributed.
For the jointly-owned fleet, impairment triggers are evaluated in the same way as for the wholly-owned fleet. We refer to note 11 for more information in this respect. As a consequence of this analysis, an impairment loss has been registered for the vessels "EXCEL" (USD 22.5 million) and "TEMSE" (USD 2.6 million). The impairment loss for the EXCEL was already registered in the accounts per June 30, 2017, the vessel was sold in the second semester of 2017. For the LPG MGC fleet, a value in use calculation has been performed. As the value in use exceeds the carrying value, no impairment has been registered in this respect.

(*) At the end of June 2016, Exmar reached an agreement for the acquisition of 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah kwong. As a consequence, these companies are no longer considered as joint ventures and are no longer consolidated as an equity accounted investee.
(**) At the end of 2016, Exmar acquired the remaining 50.10% in CMC Belgibo. As a result of this transaction, CMC Belgibo is fully consolidated in the balance sheet instead of presented as an equity accounted investee.
(***) At the end of May 2016, Exmar has sold part of its ownership (60%) in the WARIBOKO barge to its Nigerian partner Springview. The remaining investment is remeasured at fair value and consolidated using the equity consolidation method.
(****) The allocation of the negative net assets has been allocated to the respective equity accounted investee.

(*) The equity accounted investees for whom the share in the net assets is negative, are allocated to other components of the investor's interest in the equity accounted investee and if the negative net asset exceeds the investor's interest, a corresponding liability is recognized.
(**) The change in consolidation scope in 2016 for the LPG segment relates to the acquisition at the end of June 2016 of the remaining 50% of the pressurized fleet held by Wah Kwong. The change in consolidation scope in 2016 for the offshore segment relates to the partial sale (60%) at the end of May 2016 of the WARIBOKO barge to Springview.
(***) See explanation under Monteriggioni Inc below.

The activities and assets of certain of our equity accounted investees are financed by shareholder borrowings made by the company to the respective equity accounted investees. The current portion of such borrowings is presented as other receivables. The balances mentioned below between brackets represent the outstanding balances including netting of negative net assets.
EXCELERATE NV (LNG SEGMENT) - USD 0 MILLION (2016: USD 41.7 MILLION) In 2004, Excelerate NV issued 258 subordinated bonds each to EXMAR and Taurus Charitable Income Trust, an affiliated company of Excelerate Energy. The bonds bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. Each bond represents an amount of USD 398,400. The bonds mature in 2018. The bonds include mandatory repayment clauses upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, as well as voluntary repayment options. Both shareholders of Excelerate NV have also extended a credit facility up to USD 8 million to finance Excelerate NV's working capital. The applicable interest rate on this working capital facility amounts to LIBOR USD 3 months + 0.60%. The bonds and the working capital facility have been repaid end of December 2017 as a consequence of the sale of the shares of the company Excelerate. We refer to note 10 for more information in respect of this sale.
EXPLORER NV (LNG SEGMENT) - USD 0 MILLION (2016: USD 99.3 MILLION) & EXPRESS NV (LNG SEGMENT) - USD 0 MILLION (2016: USD 103.6 MILLION) EXMAR granted two shareholder loans to Explorer NV and Express NV, respectively in 2008 and 2009. The shareholder loans are split into a variable interest rate bearing loan (three-month LIBOR plus 0.9%) and a fixed interest rate bearing loan (15%). These loans are repaid over a period of 25 years in quarterly installments. The shareholder loans include mandatory repayment clauses based on the occurrence of certain contingent events, including the sale or total loss of the vessels. EXMAR NV and Excelerate Energy LP also agreed a facility up to USD 15 million to finance the working capital of Explorer NV. This working capital facility bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.6%. The shareholder loans and the working capital facility have been repaid end of December 2017 as a consequence of the sale of the shares of the companies Explorer and Express. We refer to note 10 for more information in respect of this sale.

At the end of August 2017, EXMAR reached an agreement to sell Belgibo (including CMC Belgibo) to Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc. We refer to note 10 for more information in this respect.

(**) These deferred tax assets have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom or because the future taxable profits cannot be measured on a reliable basis.

TRANSLATION RESERVE The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and the financial statements of consolidated companies not reporting in USD as functional currency.
FAIR VALUE RESERVE The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets until derecognition. As a result of a significant and prolonged decline in the fair value of the Teekay shares and the Sibelco shares, the fair value reserve in respect of these shares has been reclassified to the statement of profit or loss in 2016. The current year's change in fair value has also been registered in the statement of profit or loss. As a consequence, the fair value reserve amounts to USD 0 at year-end.
HEDGING RESERVE The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to the hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. In 2014 and 2015 EXMAR entered into two cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to cover its exposure on the issued bond in NOK. These CCIRS-contracts have ended in July 2017 (see also note 24 and 29 in this respect). In certain of our equity accounted investees, interest rate swaps (IRS) contracts have been closed to cover their exposure on variable interest rates.

NOTES 109

BANK LOANS The bank loans mainly relate to the Excelerate facility, the Explorer/ Express facility, the LPG pressurized facilities and the Caribbean FLNG facility.
EXCELERATE FACILITY - USD 0 MILLION (2016: USD 55.2 MILLION) In 2005, EXMAR entered into a secured loan facility (the "Excelerate Facility") for the acquisition of certain bonds issued or to be issued by Excelerate NV to assist in financing the construction and acquisition of the vessel EXCELERATE. The Excelerate Facility consists of three tranches. A first tranche of up to USD 85 million that bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.515%. The principal amount is repayable in 24 consecutive equal semi-annual installments of approximately USD 3.5 million, ending on October 20, 2018. The other two tranches of respectively USD 22 million and USD 19 million which are referred to collectively as the "commercial loans", bear interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1% at all times when the EXCELERATE is under an acceptable charter and an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.1% at all other times. The principal amount of the commercial loans is repayable in full at maturity on October 20, 2018. EXMAR may prepay principal amounts owed pursuant to the Excelerate Facility at any time, with 30 days' written notice, without any penalty or premium. The Excelerate Facility includes mandatory repayment clauses based on the occurrence of certain contingent events, including the sale or total loss of the EXCELERATE. The loan has been repaid in December 2017 as a consequence of the sale of the shares of the company Excelerate. We refer to note 10 for more information in respect of this sale.
EXPLORER & EXPRESS FACILITY - USD 0 MILLION (2016: USD 230.1 MILLION) In May 2006, EXMAR entered into a secured loan facility totaling USD 280 million, consisting of two tranches of USD 140 million each, for the financing of the EXPLORER and the EXPRESS (the "Explorer & Express Facility"). The facility bears interest at an annual floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.9%. The principal amount of the Explorer & Express Facility is repayable in 48 quarterly installments ranging from approximately USD 0.62 million to USD 1.2 million for each tranche with a balloon payment of USD 98.7 for each tranche at the maturity date of the loan. The maturity dates of the facility are April 2020 and April 2021 for EXPLORER and EXPRESS respectively. EXMAR may prepay principal amounts owed pursuant to the Explorer & Express Facility at any time, with 14 days' written notice, without any penalty or premium. The Explorer and Express Facility include mandatory repayment clauses based on the occurrence of certain contingent events, including the sale or total loss of the vessels. The loans have been repaid in December 2017 as a consequence of the sale of the shares of the companies Explorer and Express. We refer to note 10 for more information in respect of this sale.
LPG PRESSURIZED FACILITIES - USD 59.4 MILLION (2016: USD 68.5 MILLION) In October 2008, EXMAR closed a senior secured loan facility of USD 29.6 million for the financing of 2 pressurized LPG vessels. The loan in repayable in quartely tranches and the applicable interest percentage amounts to three-month LIBOR plus 1%. The last repayment is foreseen end of March 2019. In December 2008, EXMAR closed 2 other senior secured loan facilities of respectively USD 67.2 million and USD 42.8 million for the financing of 8 pressurized LPG vessels. The loans are repayable in quartely tranches and the applicable interest percentage amounts to three-month LIBOR plus 3%. The last repayment is foreseen at the latest in December 2020. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor").
CARIBBEAN FLNG FACILITY - USD 200 MILLION (2016: USD 0) End of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited (a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV) has signed a financing agreement of USD 200 million with the Bank of China (Boc), Deutsche Bank and Sinosure for the financing of the CARIBBEAN FLNG. This loan has been drawn on 27 July 2017 at the time of the delivery of the CARIBBEAN FLNG. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 3%. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to USD 26.5 million. There is a requirement for EXPORT to deposit an amount equal to 30 months principal plus interest, i.e. an amount of USD 67.4 million, on an escrow account. This requirement will be reduced to 6 months principal plus interest when acceptable long-term employment is secured. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor").
OTHER LOANS The other loans relate to a NOK 700 million senior unsecured bond issue. This bond was closed in July 2014 by EXMAR Netherlands BV ("issuer"), a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV. During 2015, an additional amount of NOK 300 million has been issued (second tranche on the original NOK 700 million bond). The total nominal amount outstanding amounts to NOK 1 billion with initial maturity date in July 2017. In June 2017, the term of the bond has been extended until July 2019. As a consequence, the bond has been classified as a long term liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. As a consequence of the extension of the term of the bond, each bond holder had the possibility to exchange NOK bonds to USD bonds. The interest percentage applicable on the remaining NOK bonds amounts to three-month NIBOR plus a margin of 8%. The exchanged USD bonds bear an interest percentage of three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 8.5%. EXMAR has received instructions for exchanges which represents an amount of USD 15,622,732. EXMAR has a call option on the bond at anytime. The call option price and redemption price at maturity amounts to 105%. The call premium of 5% amounts to USD 6.1 million and has been registered in profit or loss during 2017.
110 FINANCIAL REPORT

All obligations of the issuer are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor"). EXMAR NV has to maintain direct or indirect a 100% ownership in the issuer. Restrictions exist in respect of dividend distributions. In 2014 and 2015 EXMAR entered into two cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to cover its exposure on the issued bond in NOK. These CCIRS-contracts have ended in July 2017. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. We also refer to note 29 in this respect.
EXMAR's barge based FSRU is delivered end of December 2017. The unit was able to obtain a long-term contract and its employment is expected to commence mid 2018. The last installment of the FSRU has been mainly financed with the proceeds of the sale of the three LNG companies (Explorer NV, Express NV and Excelerate NV, see note 10 for more information in this respect). EXMAR is currently negotiating with different parties for the financing of the FSRU. The unit is undergoing site specific modifications before the start of its operations in the second half of 2018.
In general, the borrowings held by EXMAR and its equity accounted investees are secured by a mortgage on the underlying assets owned by EXMAR and its equity accounted investees. Furthermore, different pledges and other types of guarantees exist to secure the borrowings. In addition, dividend restrictions may exist. EXMAR has pledged financial assets as collateral for liabilities. We refer to note 21 where the amount of restricted cash in respect of financing agreements and financial instruments agreements is disclosed.
Also different debt covenants exist that require compliance with certain financial ratio's. These ratio's are calculated semi-annually based on EXMAR's consolidated figures in which equity accounted investees are not accounted for under IFRS 11 but still on a proportionate basis (similar to accounting policies used for segment reporting purposes). In case of non-compliance with these covenants, early repayment of related borrowings might be required. As of December 31, 2017 EXMAR was compliant with all covenants with sufficient headroom. EXMAR is continuously monitoring compliance with all applicable covenants.

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (in thousands of USD)
The Group established a share option plan program that entitles certain employees to register for a number of shares. The share options are only exercisable after a period of three years and for employees still in service after this three year period. Each share option entitles the holder of the option to one EXMAR share. The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the exercise price of the granted share options. The estimated fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial lattice model. The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model.

(*) The number of options granted and the exercise prices for option plans have been adjusted due to the dilutive effect of the capital increase (adjustment ratio of 0.794) of November 2009, extraordinary dividend distributions (adjustment ratio of 0.929) of May 2012 and extraordinary dividend distributions (adjustment ratio of 0.9364) of September 2013. The number of options granted and the exercise price mentioned above reflect the adjusted amounts.

(**) The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

(***) The board of directors of 23th March 2009 decided to extend the exercise period for option plans 1 - 4 by 5 years, in virtue of the decision by the Belgian Government to extend the Act of 26 March 1999 regarding stock options. At modification date additional fair value calculations were made based on the remaining and extended life time of the options.

Plan 1, 5 and 6 have been removed from above table as the plans matured. Plan 5 matured at the end of 2016, plans 1 and 6 matured at the end of 2017. In respect of plan 1, 7,786 options have been exercised during 2017 and 57,592 options have forfeited as a consequence of the maturity of the plan. In respect of plan 6, 175,060 options have been exercised during 2017 and 13,212 options have forfeited as a consequence of the maturity of the plan.

26. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (in thousands of USD)
LIABILITY FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AND SIMILAR LIABILITIES
The group provides pension benefits for most of its employees, either directly or through a contribution to an independent fund. The pension benefits for management staff employed before 1 January 2008 are provided under a defined benefit plan. This plan is a defined benefit plan organized as a final pay program.
For the management staff employed as from 1 January 2008, the management staff promoted to management as from 1 January 2008 and the management staff who reached the age of 60, the pension benefits are provided under a defined contribution plan. Belgian defined contribution plans are subject to the Law of April 28, 2003 on supplementary pensions (WAP). According to article 24 of this law, the employer has to guarantee a fixed minimum return of 3.25% on employer contributions and of 3.75% on employee contributions and this for contributions paid until 31/12/2015. As from January 2016, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 1.75% on both employer and employee contributions (as changed by the Law of 18 December 2015). This guaranteed minimum return generally exceeds the return that is normally guaranteed by the insurer. Because the employer has to guarantee the statutory minimum return on these plans, not all actuarial and investment risks relating to these plans are transferred to the insurance company managing the plans. Therefore these plans do not meet the definition of defined contribution plan under IFRS and have to be classified by default as defined benefit plans. An actuarial calculation has been performed in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method. This calculation resulted in a defined benefit obligation of 115 KUSD which has been registered in the consolidated accounts through the statement of Other Comprehensive Income (see table below for composition of the net obligation). The contributions recognised in the profit or loss statement in respect of this defined contribution plan amount to USD 0.7 million (2016: USD 0.8 million).

29. FINANCIAL RISKS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (in thousands of USD)
During the normal course of its business, EXMAR is exposed to various risks as described in more detail in the Corporate Governance Statement. EXMAR is exposed to credit, interest, currency and liquidity risks and in order to hedge this exposure, EXMAR uses various financial instruments, mainly interest rate hedges. EXMAR applies hedge accounting for all hedging relations which meet the conditions to apply hedge accounting (formal documentation and high effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis). Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting, is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value and changes in fair value of financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial instruments other than those listed above are all measured at amortized cost.
As a result of a significant and prolonged decline in the fair value of the Teekay shares (which are presented as available-for-sale financial assets in the accounts and detailed in above overview under level 1) and the Sibelco shares (which are presented as available-for-sale financial assets in the accounts and detailed in above overview under level 2), the fair value reserve in respect of these shares has been reclassified to the statement of profit or loss in 2016. The current year's change in fair value has also been registered in the statement of profit or loss. As a consequence, the fair value reserve amounts to USD 0 at year-end.
EXMAR actively manages its interest exposure by means of various instruments to cover rising interest rates for a part of its debt portfolio. In certain of our equity accounted investees, interest rate swaps (IRS) contracts have been closed to cover exposure on variable interest rates. In 2014 and 2015, a NOK 1 billion senior unsecured bond was issued. The NOK/USD exposure was covered by two cross currency interest rate swaps. The fixed USD equivalent of the first CCIRS amounted to USD 114 million and the applicable fixed interest rate percentage was 5.72%. For the second CCIRS, the fixed USD equivalent amounted to USD 38 million and the applicable interest rate percentage was three-month LIBOR (USD) plus 4.8%. The interest percentage applicable on the NOK bonds equaled to three-month NIBOR plus 4.5%. The term of the NOK bond has been extended until July 2019 (see also note 24 in this respect). The CCIRS-contracts have not been extended as a consequence of the extension of the term of the bond and have ended in July 2017. The current interest percentage on the NOK bond is detailed in note 24. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. The positive FV of this contract per 31 December 2017 has been registered in profit or loss (USD 1.1 million).

CREDIT RISK
CREDIT RISK POLICY
Credit risk is monitored closely on an ongoing basis by the Group and creditworthiness controls are carried out if deemed necessary. At year-end no significant creditworthiness problems were noted. A considerable part of the income of our LNG joint ventures is dependent on the performance of one important client, Excelerate Energy. No creditworthiness issues have been identified in this context. The borrowings to equity accounted investees consist of shareholder loans to our joint ventures that own or operate an LPG vessel, LNG vessel or Offshore platform. As all vessels are operational and generate income, we do not anticipate any recoverability issues for the outstanding borrowings to equity accounted investees. The equity accounted investees for whom the share in the net assets is negative, are allocated to other components of the investor's interest in the equity accounted investee and if the negative net asset exceeds the investor's interest, a corresponding liability is recognized. The term of the shareholder loans are discussed in note 16 of this annual report. A shareholder's loan existed between EXMAR LNG Investment and Monteriggioni. Part of the shareholder's loan has been repaid during 2017 with the proceeds of the sale of the vessel EXCEL. The remaining part of the loan has been waived during 2017, this amount in mentioned separately in the statement of profit or loss under Impairment loss loan to equity accounted investee (see also note 8 in this respect). In the result from equity accounted investees, the income part of this waiver has been registered. Consequently, the waiver of the loan has no impact on the net result of the Group.

INTEREST RISK
INTEREST RISK POLICY
The interest-bearing loans are mainly negotiated with variable interest rates. In order to monitor this interest risk, the Group makes use of interest hedging instruments available on the market (mainly IRS contracts situated in our equity accounted investees). The Group applies hedge accounting when the conditions to apply hedge accounting are met. In case no hedge accounting is applied, the changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of profit or loss.

In 2014, a cross currency interest rate swap ("CCIRS") was entered into in order to hedge the currency and floating interest exposure on the issued NOK 700 million senior unsecured bonds. In July 2015, a new CCIRS was closed on the additional amount of NOK 300 million that has been issued in 2015. These CCIRS-contracts have ended in July 2017 (we also refer to annex 24 in this respect).

A significant portion of EXMAR's interest income is derived from borrowings to equity accounted investees with variable interest rates. Any increase/ decrease in the interest rate would result in an increase/decrease of interest income but would mainly be offset by an increase/ decrease in the interest expense recognized by the equity accounted investee for a corresponding amount. Accordingly, any increase/decrease in the variable interest rate applied on the borrowings to equity accounted investees would have no impact on the net result of the Group. Therefore, borrowings to equity accounted investees have not been included in the above sensitivity analysis.

CURRENCY RISK
The Group's currency risk is historically mainly affected by the EUR/USD ratio for manning its fleet, paying salaries and all other personnelrelated expenses. In order to monitor the EUR currency risk, the Group uses a varied range of foreign currency rate hedging instruments if deemed necessary. As per 31 December 2017 and 2016, no forward exchange contracts were outstanding to cover the EUR/USD exposure. In 2014 and 2015, a NOK 1 billion senior unsecured bond was issued. The NOK/USD exposure was covered by two cross currency interest rate swaps that matched the debt profile of the bond. These CCIRS-contracts have ended in July 2017. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. The positive FV of this contract per 31 December 2017 has been registered in profit or loss (USD 1.1 million).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
As per 31 December 2017 an increase in the year-end EUR/USD rate of 10% would affect the statement of profit or loss with USD 0.3 million (2016: USD -1.5 million), excluding the effect on any forward exchange contracts. A 10% decrease of the EUR/USD rate would impact the profit or loss statement with the same amount (opposite sign). The NOK/USD exposure on the outstanding NOK bond is no longer covered by the CCIRS-contracts. An increase in the year-end NOK/USD rate of 10% would affect the statement of profit or loss with USD -11.1 million, excluding the effect on any forward exchange contracts. A 10% decrease of the NOK/USD rate would impact the profit or loss statement with the same amount (opposite sign).

118 FINANCIAL REPORT

LIQUIDITY RISK
LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY
The Group manages the liquidity risk in order to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The risk is managed through a continuous cash flow projection follow-up, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratio's against internal and regulatory requirements and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources with adequate back-up facilities. Different debt covenants exist that require compliance with certain financial ratio's. As of December 31, 2017 EXMAR was compliant with all covenants with sufficient headroom. We also refer in this respect to note 24 regarding borrowings and to note 31 regarding capital commitments.
Maturity analysis of financial liabilities, borrowings to equity accounted investees and financial guarantees
Our current financial liabilities such as trade and other payables are expected to be paid within the next twelve months and are therefore not included in below tables. The contractual maturities of our financial liabilities and our borrowings to equity accounted investees, including estimated interest payments, are detailed in the tables below. The contractual maturities of our financial liabilities are based on the contractual amortization tables of the facilities. The contractual maturities of our borrowings to equity accounted investees are based on the contractual amortization table of the loan for the Electra Offshore Ltd facility (and in 2016 also for the Excelerate/Explorer/Express loans) and on the cash flow projections for future years for the Emar LPG shareholder's loan (and in 2016 also for the Monteriggioni facility). EXMAR has also provided guarantees to financial institutions that have provided credit facilities to her equity accounted investees. The amount that EXMAR could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, is disclosed below under financial guarantees.

(*) The financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are analysed and a hierarchy in valuation method has been defined: level 1 being quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, level 2 being inputs in other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the related assets and liabilities, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices), level 3 being inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The breakdown between level 1 and 2 of the available-for-sales financial assets is shown in the beginning of this note. In respect of the interest-bearing loans, the fair value of the bond is based on a level 1 valuation. The carrying amount of the bond amounts to USD 125.7 million, whereas the fair value amounts to USD 126.2 million. The other interest-bearing loans are based on a level 2 valuation.

BASIS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES:

Available-for-sale financial assets:

quoted closing bid price at reporting date for Teekay shares / non-quoted closing fixing price at reporting date through a public auction via Euronext for Sibelco shares

Derivative financial instruments: Interest-bearing loans:

present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date
quoted closing bid price at reporting date for NOK bond/ present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date

Borrowings to equity accounted investees:

present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date

For certain financial assets and liabilities (trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables) not carried at fair value, no fair value is disclosed because the carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values.

120 FINANCIAL REPORT

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The balance between a higher return that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position is monitored on a continuing basis. The Board monitors the return on capital and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
30. LEASES (in thousands of USD)

OPERATING LEASES
LEASE OBLIGATIONS
EXMAR leases a number of assets using operating lease agreements. The agreements don't impose restrictions such as additional debt and further leasing. The expense for 2017 relating to the operating lease agreements amounts to USD 11.0 million (2016: USD 11.0 million) of which USD 8.9 million is born by our equity accounted investees (2016: USD 8.9 million). No payments for non-cancellable subleases were received. The future minimum lease payments for our subsidiaries and equity accounted investees are as follows:

OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS (LEASES AS LESSEE)
Less than 1 year Between 1 and 5 years More than 5 years

The amounts disclosed for the equity accounted investees represent our share in the lease obligations. The average duration of the lease agreements amount to 3.6 years. The group has for some of the leased assets purchase options, some contracts foresee extension options. Such options have not been taken into account for determining above lease obligations.
LEASE RIGHTS
The Group entered into long-term time charter agreements for certain assets in its fleet. In respect of lease classification, it was judged that substantially all risks and rewards remain with the Group. As a consequence, these agreements qualify as operating leases. The income in 2017 relating to operating leases amounts to USD 157.6 million (2016: USD 197.4 million) of which USD 134 million is earned by our equity accounted investees (2016: USD 174.4 million). The future minimum rental receipts are as follows:

The amounts disclosed for the equity accounted investees represent our share in the lease rights. The average duration of the lease agreements amounts to 1.95 years. The Group has granted for some of these vessels purchase options and some contracts foresee a possible extension at the end of the lease agreement. Such options have not been taken into account for determining above lease rights.

The decrease of the lease rights in our equity accounted investees can be mainly explained by the sale of the LNG companies Excelerate NV, Explorer NV and Express NV (we refer in this respect also to note 10 of this report).

NOTES 121

FINANCE LEASES EXMAR leases 3 vessels under financial lease agreements. These vessels are all situated within our equity accounted investees. Hence, the financial lease obligations are not shown in our consolidated financial statements. The payments made in 2017 relating to the finance lease agreements amount to USD 5.1 million (2016: USD 1.2 million), all born by our equity accounted investees.
31. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS (in thousands of USD)
As per December 31, 2017 the capital commitments are as follows:

The amount disclosed for the equity accounted investees represents our share in the capital commitments of these equity accounted investees. The capital commitments relate to the midsize carriers under construction (LPG segment). The payments of these commitments will be spread over the coming year. In respect of these commitments, the necessary financing agreements are in place, except for the last ordered LPG vessel under construction (USD 33.3 million) which is expected to be delivered in July 2018.

On February 7, 2018 EXMAR has contracted 2 VLGC newbuilding's, to serve long-term commitments with Statoil ASA of Norway for worldwide LPG transportation. Both vessels will be constructed by Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) for delivery within the third quarter of 2020. The expected capital commitments amount to USD 140.1 million. These commitments have not been included in above overview as they originated after December 31, 2017.

32. CONTINGENCIES
Several of the Group's companies are involved in a number of minor legal disputes arising from their daily management. The directors do not expect the outcome of these procedures to have any material effect on the Group's financial position.
A vessel held by one of our joint ventures was party to a lease arrangement whereby the lessor could claim tax depreciation on the capital expenditures it incurred to acquire these vessels. As is typical in these leasing arrangements, tax and change of law risks are assumed by the lessee. Our joint venture terminated this lease arrangement in 2013. However, in case of a successful challenge by the UK tax authority ("HMRC") of the tax treatment of the lease by the UK lessor, we can be required to compensate the lessor for any tax amounts to be paid. At this point in time, the Board of Directors is not able to calculate the possible outflow as a consequence of this matter.

33. RELATED PARTIES (in thousands of EUR)
We also refer in this respect to the remuneration report (for remuneration policy) and to the Board of Directors report (for information relating to conflicts of interests).

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee is determined annually by the Board of Directors on the basis of a proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The remuneration consists of a fixed component and a variable component. The variable component is partly determined in function of the financial result of the Group. In 2017 the Executive Committee, excluding the CEO, consisted of six members on average. Four members of the Executive Committee (including the CEO) have a self-employed status. In the event of termination of their appointment, they have no right to any form of severance compensation. Two members of the Executive Committe are represented by means of their management company. In the event of termination by EXMAR, Lara Consult BVBA (represented by Bart Lavent) would be entitled to a compensation equivalent of seven month's salary and Chirmont NV (represented by Miguel De Potter) to a compensation equivalent to three month's salary. David Lim is employed through an agreement under United States law.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The significant judgements and estimates that might have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year relates to:
GOING CONCERN
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In making this assessment, the Board of Directors has made the following assumption: * Successful long term financing for the FSRU: The last installment of the FSRU has been mainly financed with the proceeds of the sale of the three LNG companies (Explorer NV, Express NV and Excelerate NV, see note 10 for more information in this respect). EXMAR is currently in negotiations with different parties for the financing of the FSRU. Management is confident that it will be able to successfully secure a long-term financing for the FSRU.

REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR
STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 In the context of the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV/SA ("the company") and its subsidiaries (jointly "the group"), we hereby submit our statutory audit report to you. This report includes our report on the consolidated financial statements together with our report on other legal, regulatory and professional requirements. These reports are one and indivisible. We were appointed in our capacity as statutory auditor by the shareholders' meeting of 16 May 2017, in accordance with the proposal of the board of directors issued upon recommendation of the audit committee. Our mandate will expire on the date of the shareholders' meeting deliberating on the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV/SA for the first time during the financial year referred to in this report.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unqualified opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the group, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year then ended, as well as the summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The consolidated statement of financial position shows total assets of 918 595 (000) USD and the consolidated statement of profit or loss shows a consolidated net profit for the year then ended of 27 952 (000) USD. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV/SA give a true and fair view of the group's net equity and financial position as of 31 December 2017 and of its consolidated results and its consolidated cash flow for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium.
Basis for the unqualified opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report. We have complied with all ethical requirements relevant to the statutory audit of consolidated financial statements in Belgium, including those regarding independence. We have obtained from the board of directors and the company's officials the explanations and information necessary for performing our audit. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTERS

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ­ VESSELS

· Property, plant and equipment ­ Vessels with a carrying amount of 563 021 (000) USD represent 61% of the consolidated balance sheet total as at 31 December 2017. Management's assessment of the valuation of property, plant and equipment was significant to our audit because this process is complex and requires significant management judgement. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of impairment due to the current low spot and charter rates.
· We refer to the consolidated financial statements, including notes to the consolidated financial statements: Note 11 Vessels

· We considered the process and the internal control implemented by management and we carried out testing relating to the design and implementation of management's controls to assess impairment indicators.
· We obtained external broker reports via management to evaluate the fair value less cost to sell, where applicable, of the vessels. We obtained a written confirmation from the appraisers on their independence, expertise and valuation basis.
· We tested management's assumptions used in the value in use calculations and we assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates, where applicable. In challenging these assumptions, we took into account actual results, negotiated contract terms, external data, independent market reports and market conditions.
· We involved our valuation experts to assist us in the evaluation of the discount rates used by the Group, performed sensitivity analysis where considered necessary and assessed the consistency of valuation methodologies applied and assumptions used throughout the Group.
· Furthermore, we evaluated the adequacy of the Group's disclosures regarding the impairments of property, plant and equipment.

128 FINANCIAL REPORT

KEY AUDIT MATTERS
GOING CONCERN
· The directors of the Group are required to make a rigorous assessment of whether the Group will remain a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements and assess whether there are any material uncertainties in relation to the going concern basis of preparation.
· The Group's liquidity and headroom on its financial covenants are closely linked to changes in spot and charter rates, occupation of the vessels and ongoing investment and divestment programs.
· Significant management judgement and estimate is required to forecast future cash flows and conclude on whether the Group will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to comply with its financial covenants for the period of at least 12 months from the date of authorizing the financial statements.
· We refer to the consolidated financial statements, including notes to the consolidated financial statements: Significant judgements and estimates.

HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTERS
· We have assessed the design and implementation of controls related to the assessment of going concern.
· We challenged the appropriateness and consistency of the assumptions used in the going concern model, in particular the spot and charter rates, the occupation ratio of vessels which are not employed under a time charter, the cash flows from investing and divesting transactions. In challenging these assumptions we took into account actual results, negotiated contract terms, external data, independent market reports and market conditions.
· We have tested the arithmetic integrity of the calculations including those related to management's sensitivities. We also performed our own sensitivity calculations to test the adequacy of the available headroom and we considered the mitigating actions available to management under these scenarios.
· We have tested the quality of management forecasting by comparing EBITDA forecasts for prior periods to actual outcomes.
· We have discussed and reviewed the financial covenants and recomputed the available headroom.
· We evaluated the adequacy of the Group's disclosures regarding the going concern assumption.

Other matters The consolidated financial statements for the previous financial year were audited by another statutory auditor who has issued an unqualified opinion with an emphasis of matters paragraph.
Responsibilities of the board of directors for the consolidated financial statements The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium and for such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the board of directors is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters to be considered for going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no other realistic alternative but to do so. Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: · identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; · obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control; · evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors; · conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern; · evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

NOTES 129

· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and we communicate with them about all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated to the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes any public disclosure about the matter.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL, REGULATORY AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS Responsibilities of the board of directors The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements.
Responsibilities of the statutory auditor As part of our mandate and in accordance with the Belgian standard complementary (Revised in 2018) to the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), our responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the director's report on the consolidated financial statements, as well as to report on these matters.
Aspects regarding the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements In our opinion, after performing the specific procedures on the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements, this report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2017 and it has been established in accordance with the requirements of article 119 of the Companies Code. In the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements we are also responsible to consider, in particular based on information that we became aware of during the audit, if the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements is free of material misstatement, either by information that is incorrectly stated or otherwise misleading. In the context of the procedures performed, we are not aware of such material misstatement. We do not express any kind of assurance on the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements. The non-financial information as required by article 119, § 2 of the Companies Code, has been disclosed in the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements. This non-financial information has been established by the company in accordance with the internationally recognized framework. We do however not express any opinion on the question whether this non-financial information has been established, in all material respects, in accordance with this internationally recognized framework. Furthermore, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion on individual elements that have been disclosed in this non-financial information.
Statements regarding independence · Our audit firm and our network have not performed any prohibited services and our audit firm has remained independent from the company during
the performance of our mandate. · The fees for the additional non-audit services compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements, as defined in article 134 of
the Companies Code, have been properly disclosed and disaggregated in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
