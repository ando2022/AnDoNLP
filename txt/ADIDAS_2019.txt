ANNUAL REPORT 2019

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
2019 marked a special year for adidas as we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the company and the completion of our modern workplace, `World of Sports', our company headquarters. What our founder Adi Dassler started officially as a Franconian crafts business with 47 employees in 1949 is now a truly global brand and international company that has almost 60,000 employees and a presence on all continents.
As we aspire to be the best sports company in the world, we are immensely proud of our history and our roots in Germany. To this day, we live up to the philosophy of Adi Dassler, who always wanted to create the best product for the athlete. Numerous sporting highlights, such as the first world title for the German national football team in 1954, will remain forever connected with the 3-Stripes brand. Timeless products like the adidas Superstar have an established place in fashion.
It was an emotional moment for all employees, including myself, to celebrate our company's birthday together with Adi Dassler's daughter Siggi and other members of the Dassler family, our creative partner Pharrell Williams, tennis icon Stan Smith, football world champion Philipp Lahm, Olympic champions Laura Dahlmeier, Magdalena Neuner and Kristina Vogel, as well as Run DMC, who had a worldwide hit with `My adidas'.
2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS In terms of business, top-line growth and another strong profitability improvement in 2019 put us in a position to complete our strategic cycle `Creating the New' successfully. Although held back by supply chain shortages, we increased sales to  23.6 billion, reflecting currencyneutral growth of 6% and nominal growth of 8%. Our gross margin climbed 20 basis points to 52%. Our operating margin improved 40 basis points to a level of 11.3%, the highest operating margin in the history of our company. Our net income from continuing operations again grew significantly faster than our top line, up 12% to a record  1.9 billion.

ATTRACTIVE CASH RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS Our strategy `Creating the New' includes a strong commitment to returning cash to you, our shareholders, through both dividends and share buybacks. In 2019, we continued to deliver on this promise. We completed the second tranche of our current multi-year share buyback program, repurchasing 3.2 million shares for a consideration of  815 million. Taking into account the dividend payment of  664 million for the financial year 2018, which was paid out in May 2019, the total amount of cash the company returned to its shareholders in 2019 was again  1.5 billion.
FOCUS ON STRATEGIC GROWTH DRIVERS PAYS OFF Our strategic growth drivers adidas North America, Greater China and E-commerce all contributed over-proportionally to our currency-neutral growth. E-com was our fastestgrowing channel with a 34% increase year-over-year, confirming the strategic importance of building the perfect store for our consumers online with adidas.com and reebok.com. Greater China grew at a double-digit rate for the fifth year in a row, up 15%, as we capitalized on important brand and shopping moments such as Singles' Day and an early Chinese New Year. adidas North America was impacted the most by our supply chain shortages, but still grew 7%. This means we continued to gain market share in the largest sporting goods market in the world.
Our top line was driven by growth in all market segments. Our home market Europe returned to growth with a 3% sales increase. Latin America grew 7%, Emerging Markets 13% and Russia/CIS 8%.
CLEAR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY adidas' commitment to sustainability started way before the topic gained global attention. For 20 years, we have been a change leader in our industry, as evidenced by our inclusion for the 20th time in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, a family of benchmarks evaluating the sustainability performance of the largest 2,500 companies listed in the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index.

ADIDAS

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

In terms of integrating sustainability in our business model, we produced a record more than eleven million pairs of shoes containing plastic waste collected from beaches and coastal regions in 2019, more than double the amount produced the year before. From 2024 onward, we are committed to using only recycled polyester. Our fight to end plastic waste is the best expression of our purpose that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. The increasing use of recycled materials is just one example of our sustainability activities. The spectrum ranges from waste prevention and new types of take-back programs for used products, to climate protection. This will contribute to our ultimate goal of climate neutrality in all our activities as well as our supply chain by 2050.
2020 OUTLOOK 2020 is the last year of our five-year strategy cycle `Creating the New'. We have come a long way since we embarked on this journey at the beginning of 2016. We added almost  7 billion to our top line, drove operating margin up nearly 500 basis points and increased net income by  1.2 billion. Already today, adidas is a much better and stronger company than ever before. But we will not stop here. Like every athlete, we train and work hard to up our game season after season, year after year. For 2020, we are targeting a currency-neutral sales increase of between 6% and 8%. By further leveraging our scalable operating model, net income is expected to once again grow at a double-digit rate to a level of more than  2.1 billion. Operating margin is expected to come in between 11.5% and 11.8%. These figures will enable us to fully achieve our 2020 financial ambition.

IN CLOSING Together with all adidas employees, I am very much looking forward to 2020. It will be an exciting year for our company. We will continue on our international growth track, accelerate our digital transformation and make our product range at adidas and Reebok even more sustainable. Through high-performing athletes, innovative products and inspiring marketing campaigns, adidas will take center-stage at the two major sport events of the year, the UEFA EURO 2020 and the Tokyo Olympics, and other important moments in sport and culture. We will finish our `Creating the New' strategy with excellence before presenting our new strategy beyond 2020 in November. We are operating in an attractive industry and are well positioned for the future. Success is in our own hands.
Thank you for your ongoing support.
Sincerely yours,
KASPER RORSTED CEO

SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
Last year, the company's success story from the foundation in 1949 up until today was highlighted in an impressive manner by a successful 70th anniversary celebration and the completion of the extension of the headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. From a financial point of view, too, we look back on 2019 as another successful year. Thanks to a sharp focus on our consumers' needs as part of the stringent execution of our strategic business plan `Creating the New', the company was once again able to increase sales and achieve strong bottom-line growth in the 2019 financial year. While double-digit growth in the key e-commerce sales channel as well as in our focus market Greater China merit special mention, the company's growth as a whole was broad-based, with top-line increases in all regions, including our home market Europe. Supply chain shortages which slowed the company's growth, mainly in North America in the first half of the year, were quickly and permanently mitigated. In light of this sales momentum as well as the continuing high investments into our brands and the scalability of the business, the company is in an excellent position to successfully conclude the strategy cycle 2015-2020 in the current financial year. We continue to ensure that we share the positive development of the company with our shareholders, as underscored by the total cash return from the dividend payout and share buyback of  1.5 billion in 2019.
SUPERVISION AND ADVICE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE EXECUTIVE BOARD In the year under review, we performed all of our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of Association, the German Corporate Governance Code (`Code') and the Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously, as in previous years. We regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company and diligently and continuously supervised its management activities, assuring ourselves of the legality, expediency and regularity thereof. The Executive Board involved us directly and in a timely and comprehensive manner in all of the company's fundamental decisions.

The Executive Board informed us extensively and regularly through written and oral reports. This information covered all relevant aspects of the company's business strategy, business planning (including finance, investment and personnel planning), the course of business and the company's financial position and profitability. We were also kept up to date on matters relating to accounting processes, the risk situation and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems and compliance as well as all major decisions and business transactions. The Executive Board always explained immediately and in a detailed manner any deviations in business performance from the established plans, and we discussed these matters in depth.
The Executive Board regularly provided us with comprehensive written reports for the preparation of our meetings. We thus always had the opportunity to critically analyze the Executive Board's reports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the Supervisory Board as a whole and to put forward suggestions before passing resolutions after in-depth examination and extensive consultation. At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Executive Board was available to discuss and answer our questions. In the periods between our meetings, the Executive Board also provided us with extensive, timely monthly reports on the current business situation. We critically examined and specifically challenged the information provided to us by the Executive Board.
In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board primarily exercised its duties in plenary sessions. We held eight regular meetings of the entire Supervisory Board, one of which was a constituent meeting and one which took place outside Germany. Moreover, one resolution was passed by way of a circular resolution.
As in previous years, we were able to record a constantly high participation rate in our consultations despite a high number of meetings in the year under review. The overall attendance rate of the members at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was around 96% in the year under review. Members who were unable to participate in the meetings took part in the resolutions by submitting their vote in writing. SEE TABLE 1

The external auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, (KPMG) attended all regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, with the exception of the meeting which took place outside Germany, insofar as no Executive Board matters or internal matters of the Supervisory Board were dealt with. KPMG also attended all meetings of the Audit Committee.

In the periods between meetings, the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conferring on matters such as corporate strategy, business planning and development, the risk situation and risk management as well as compliance. In addition, the Supervisory Board Chairman was informed about events of fundamental importance for the management and for evaluating the situation and development of the company, when necessary also at short notice.
The Supervisory Board also regularly conferred on, in particular, Supervisory Board matters and personnel matters of the Executive Board without the Executive Board.
TOPICS FOR THE ENTIRE SUPERVISORY BOARD Our consultations and examinations focused on the following topics:
SITUATION AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT The development of sales and earnings, the employment situation as well as the financial position of the company and the business development of the company's individual business areas and markets were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board at every Supervisory Board meeting and were discussed regularly. Moreover, we discussed the company's business strategy and the annual and multi-year business planning of the Executive Board. In this context, we were particularly informed on a regular basis about the progress made in mitigating the supply chain shortages in North America. Further topics which were always discussed were the possible impact of global economic developments as well as the development of the individual brands and markets.
The Executive Board outlined the company's situation and retail strategy at the February meeting. We also discussed important potential and pending legal disputes. The Executive Board reported on the financial figures for the 2018 financial year at the balance sheet meeting in March. After in-depth examination of the financial statements, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined Management Report, including the non-financial statement for adidas AG and the Group as at December 31, 2018. The annual financial statements were thus adopted. Prior to the passing of the resolution, the auditor reported on the material results of the audit, including the results of the examination of the content of the non-financial statement commissioned by the Supervisory Board in accordance with § 111 section 2 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz ­ AktG). Furthermore, the Supervisory Board Report to the Annual General Meeting for the 2018 financial year was approved. Finally, we discussed, inter alia, the business development of Reebok and innovation at adidas. At the May meeting, we primarily dealt with

the results for the first quarter of the year under review. Particular topics of the August meeting were the financial results for the second quarter and the first half year. We also discussed the business development in Emerging Markets and dealt in detail with the main sustainability initiatives. At our annual strategy meeting in October, we discussed the details presented by the Executive Board regarding the strategic business plan `Creating the New'. Another focal point of the October meeting was the development of business in Asia-Pacific. Finally, topics of our December meeting were the 2020 Budget and Investment Plan as well as the marketing and sponsorship agreements concluded in the year under review.
TRANSACTIONS REQUIRING SUPERVISORY BOARD APPROVAL In accordance with statutory regulations or the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, certain transactions and measures require the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. We approved the following measures in the period under review:
In March, we approved the resolutions proposed to the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019 (`2019 Annual General Meeting'), including the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings for the 2018 financial year. At the May meeting, we approved the adjusted resolution proposal of the Executive Board on the appropriation of retained earnings. The adjustment was necessary as the number of dividend-entitled shares had decreased since the publication of the invitation to the Annual General Meeting, due to the ongoing share buyback program. Furthermore, we approved Eric Liedtke taking over a supervisory board mandate at Fashion for Good B.V. At our December meeting, after comprehensive consultation, we approved the 2020 Budget and Investment Plan of the Executive Board.
COMPOSITION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD In the year under review, we dealt extensively with personnel matters of the Executive Board.
We appointed Martin Shankland as a new member of the Executive Board, responsible for Global Operations, with effect from March 2019. Martin Shankland succeeded Gil Steyaert. As successor to Eric Liedtke, we appointed Brian Grevy as a member of the Executive Board, responsible for Global Brands, with effect from February 1, 2020. Moreover, we extended the Executive Board mandates of Karen Parkin, responsible for Global Human Resources, and Harm Ohlmeyer, responsible for Finance, for another five years until 2025, respectively.
In this respect and after in-depth examination, we approved the newly concluded Executive Board service contracts with Martin Shankland and Brian Grevy as well as the amended Executive Board contracts of Karen Parkin and Harm Ohlmeyer as part of the extension of their

mandates. We also discussed the long-term succession planning for the Executive Board based on the General Committee's preparations.
EXECUTIVE BOARD COMPENSATION Another focal point of our work was Executive Board compensation. After an in-depth review of the individual performance of the Executive Board members and the achievement of the targets set for the 2018 Performance Bonus and the 2018 tranche for the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018/2020 (`LTIP 2018/2020'), we resolved upon the performance-related compensation to be paid to the Executive Board members for the 2018 Performance Bonus and the 2018 LTIP tranche at our meetings in February. The Supervisory Board also determined the appropriateness of the Executive Board compensation. Furthermore, after comprehensive consultation, we set the criteria and targets decisive for the 2019 Performance Bonus and the 2019 tranche for the LTIP 2018/2020 along with the individual bonus target amounts for each Executive Board member at our meetings in February and March.
Further detailed information on the Executive Board compensation can be found in the Compensation Report. SEE COMPENSATION REPORT, P. 30
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the application and further development of the corporate governance regulations within the company, in particular the implementation of the recommendations of the Code. The General Committee and the entire Supervisory Board proactively discussed in depth the changed requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the Code in regard to corporate governance at their meetings in October and December. Further detailed information on corporate governance within the company can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance and Corporate Governance Report. SEE DECLARATION ON
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT, P. 24
Following an in-depth discussion, the current Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 AktG was resolved upon by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG in December 2019 and was made permanently available on our website. ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE
During our consultations regarding the Declaration of Compliance, we particularly discussed the independence of the members of the Supervisory Board as per the respective independence criteria. In the Supervisory Board's assessment, all Supervisory Board members representing the shareholders were independent within the meaning of section 5.4.2 of the Code in the year under review.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

In the year under review, no conflicts of interest arose in regard to the Executive Board members. There were also no conflicts of interest within the Supervisory Board. It must be pointed out that the company concluded a contract with a company in which one Supervisory Board member in office until the end of the 2019 Annual General meeting is involved. The Supervisory Board had already approved this contract and the business volume stipulated in this contract in December 2018. In the view of the Supervisory Board, there was no conflict of interest. Nevertheless, as in previous years, the Supervisory Board member concerned did not participate in the voting on the respective resolution.
Both the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee reviewed the efficiency of their work in the 2018 financial year. The members of the Supervisory Board assessed the work in the entire Supervisory Board and in the Audit Committee as efficient in both cases and resolved upon individual improvements regarding the organization of the Supervisory Board's work. These improvements were implemented in the year under review. The next efficiency examination of the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee is scheduled for the 2020 financial year in light of, inter alia, the changed composition of the Supervisory Board as a result of the new election of the shareholder and employee representatives in 2019.
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for undertaking any necessary training and further education measures required for their tasks. In the year under review, the company offered the newly elected members of the Supervisory Board an onboarding program relating to the work of the Supervisory Board at adidas AG in order to facilitate the exercise of their mandates. Furthermore, in the context of the Supervisory Board meeting outside Germany, the company enabled members of the Supervisory Board to visit key suppliers in Vietnam.
EFFICIENT COMMITTEE WORK In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner, we have established a total of five standing Supervisory Board committees. SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD, P. 15 The newly elected Supervisory Board resolved at its constituent meeting in May to no longer constitute the Finance and Investment Committee.
The committees prepare resolutions and topics for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board. Within the legally permissible framework and in appropriate cases, we have furthermore delegated the Supervisory Board's authority to pass certain resolutions to individual committees. With the exception of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all the standing committees. Herbert Kauffmann is the Chairman of the Audit Committee.

The respective committee chairmen report to the Supervisory Board on the content and results of the committee meetings on a regular and comprehensive basis.
---- The Steering Committee did not meet in the year under review. ---- The General Committee held six meetings in the year under review.
The main focus was the preparation of the resolutions of the entire Supervisory Board regarding personnel matters of the Executive Board and Executive Board compensation. The General Committee particularly discussed the resignation of Gil Steyaert and Eric Liedtke, the appointment of Martin Shankland and Brian Grevy as well as the extension of the mandates of Karen Parkin and Harm Ohlmeyer. With reference to the Executive Board compensation, the primary focus was on preparation of the resolutions relating to target achievement for the 2018 Performance Bonus and the 2018 LTIP tranche and the targets for the 2019 Performance Bonus and the 2019 LTIP tranche, as well as on the establishment of the appropriateness of the Executive Board compensation. Furthermore, the General Committee dealt intensively with long-term succession planning for the Executive Board as well as with the changed requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the Code in regard to corporate governance. ---- The Audit Committee held five meetings in the year under review. One resolution was passed by way of a circular resolution. The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members in detail. In addition to the supervision of the accounting process, the committee's work also focused on the examination of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2018, including the combined Management Report and the non-financial statement of adidas AG and the Group, as well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following an in-depth review of the audit reports on the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements with the auditor, the committee decided to recommend that the Supervisory Board approve the 2018 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the audit of the non-financial statement, including the selection and commissioning of the external auditor by the Supervisory Board, was prepared. In addition, the Audit Committee resolved to recommend that the Supervisory Board commission KPMG with the examination of the content of the non-financial statement with limited assurance pursuant to § 111 section 2 sentence 4 AktG. Following in-depth discussions, the Audit Committee also made a recommendation to the Supervisory Board regarding the proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2019 for the appointment of the auditor. The Audit Committee declared to the Supervisory Board that the recommendation is free from undue influence by a third party and that no clause of the kind referred to in Article 16 section 6 of the EU Regulation No. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of

April 16, 2014 on specific requirements regarding the statutory audit of public-interest entities has been imposed upon it. A further subject of in-depth discussions was the assignment of the audit mandate to the auditor for the 2019 financial year, the determination of the focus points of the audit, the supervision of the independence and qualification of the auditor as well as the quality of the audit of annual accounts, the determination of the audit fees and ultimately the discussion of the quarterly financial figures and the half year report. The Audit Committee dealt intensively with the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Risk Management System, the Internal Control System and Audit System as well as with the Compliance Management System. Moreover, the committee addressed the findings of Internal Audit and the audit plan. Potential and pending important legal disputes were also discussed. In addition, at every meeting of the Audit Committee, the Chief Compliance Officer gave regular reports on the Compliance Management System and the main compliance cases in the year under review. In the year under review, the Audit Committee also discussed in depth the financing of the existing pension plans for the Executive Board and employees. Finally, the Audit Committee discussed the regulations for related party transactions which were recently added to the German Stock Corporation Act. According to these regulations, if the value of the transaction exceeds a defined threshold, listed stock corporations may only engage in related party transactions with the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board delegate the authorization to approve related party transactions to the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board approved the respective resolution proposal at its October meeting. ---- The Nomination Committee held two meetings in the year under review. It particularly prepared the recommendations of the Supervisory Board regarding the shareholder representative election to the 2019 and 2020 Annual General Meeting. In this respect, taking the statutory requirements into account, the suitability and independence of the candidates were discussed. Furthermore, taking into consideration the competency profile for the members of the Supervisory Board defined by the Supervisory Board, a qualification profile was developed. Based on this, the Nomination Committee dealt with suitable candidates for the mandates to be filled within the Supervisory Board. ---- The Mediation Committee to be established in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz -- MitbestG) did not have to be convened in the year under review.

ELECTION AND COMPOSITION OF THE NEW SUPERVISORY BOARD The terms of office of all members of the Supervisory Board ended upon conclusion of the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board were newly elected at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. In light of the expiry of the one-year term of office of Igor Landau, a new Supervisory Board member will be elected in the context of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. For every new election taking place, the Supervisory Board submits its proposals to the Annual General Meeting. Prior to submitting an election proposal, there is a diligent selection process for suitable candidates. The selection criteria for the candidates are based on a pre-defined qualification profile. These selection criteria are based on the objectives of the Supervisory Board regarding its composition, as defined by the Supervisory Board, and take into account the competency profile as well as statutory provisions and the applicable recommendations of the Code.
With the exception of Igor Landau and Herbert Kauffmann, the Supervisory Board proposed that the new Supervisory Board members be appointed for the period from the end of the 2019 Annual General Meeting to the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board proposed that Igor Landau be appointed until the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. The reappointment of Igor Landau for a term of office of only one year serves the purpose of ensuring a smooth handover of the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board proposed that Herbert Kauffmann be appointed until the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The proposal to appoint Herbert Kauffmann for a term of office of only two years is based on the fact that he will then have served as a Supervisory Board member of adidas AG for twelve years. While the Supervisory Board has no doubts about Herbert Kauffmann's independence, the Supervisory Board is already following the recommendations of the new version of the Code as amended on December 16, 2019. According to the Code, as a rule, a member is no longer considered independent after a twelve-year term of office on the Supervisory Board. As set forth in the new version of the Code, the Audit Committee shall always be chaired by an independent member.
The 2019 Annual General meeting approved all election proposals with a large majority.

The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board were newly elected in March 2019. For the first time, the employee representatives were elected by delegates. In this regard, all adidas AG employees eligible to vote elected delegates, who subsequently elected the Supervisory Board members at the assembly of delegates. The candidates thereby elected,

together with the trade union representatives, form the employee representation on the Supervisory Board since the end of the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
The Chairman and his two Deputies as well as the committee members were elected at the constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board. With regard to the representation of women and men, the Supervisory Board complies with the statutory minimum quota pursuant to § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG. Prior to the resolution on the election proposals in accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 3 AktG, both the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives resolved that the minimum quota of 30% women and 30% men on the Supervisory Board shall be fulfilled separately for the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives.
EXAMINATION OF THE 2019 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KPMG audited the 2019 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with § 315e German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch ­ HGB) in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as they are to be applied in the EU, and issued an unqualified opinion thereon. The auditor also approved without qualification the 2019 annual financial statements of adidas AG, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code, and the combined Management Report of adidas AG and the adidas Group. Furthermore, at the request of the Supervisory Board, KPMG audited the nonfinancial statement. KPMG has been acting as auditor and Group auditor for adidas AG since the 1995 financial year. On the basis of the transitional periods of Article 41 Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, KPMG must not be reappointed after June 17, 2023 and it is mandatory to carry out an external rotation. As the responsible audit partners, auditor Haiko Schmidt has been signing the financial statements since the 2017 financial year and auditor Prof. Dr. Kai Andrejewski since the 2019 financial year. The 2019 Annual General Meeting elected KPMG as auditor and Group auditor upon proposal of the Supervisory Board, corresponding with a recommendation of the Audit Committee. Prior to this, KPMG had confirmed to both the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee that there are no circumstances which could prejudice their independence as auditor or which could cast doubt on KPMG's independence. In this respect, KPMG also declared to which extent non-audit services were rendered for the company in the previous financial year or are contractually agreed upon for the following year. The financial statements, the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor's reports were distributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board members in a timely manner.

We examined the documents in depth, with a particular focus on legality and regularity, in the presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 9, 2020 and at the Supervisory Board's March 10, 2020 financial statements meeting, during which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail. At both meetings, the auditor reported on the material results of the audit, inter alia with regard to the priority topics agreed and the key audit matters and was available for questions and the provision of additional information. The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with respect to the internal control and risk management system relating to the accounting process. We also discussed in depth the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings, which provides for a dividend of  3.85 per dividend-entitled share, and adopted this increase in the dividend to  3.85 compared with the previous year, also taking into consideration the good financial situation and business development in the 2019 financial year as well as the company's positive future prospects.
Based on our own examinations of the annual and consolidated financial statements (including the non-financial statement), we came to the conclusion that there are no objections to be raised. At our financial statements meeting, therefore, following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we approved the audit results and the financial statements including the non-financial statement prepared by the Executive Board. The 2019 annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved.
EXPRESSION OF THANKS On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Supervisory Board who left in the year under review for their commitment for the benefit of the company. Furthermore, I wish to thank the current Executive Board, the departing Executive Board members Gil Steyaert and Eric Liedtke as well as all employees around the world for their great personal dedication and their ongoing commitment. I would also like to express my thanks for the trusting cooperation between the employee and shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board.
For the Supervisory Board

DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT1
Corporate Governance stands for responsible and transparent management and corporate control oriented toward a sustainable increase in value. We are convinced that good corporate governance is an essential foundation for sustainable corporate success and enhances the confidence placed in our company by our shareholders, business partners, employees and the financial markets. The following report includes the Declaration on Corporate Governance and the Corporate Governance Report and is issued by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (`Code') as amended on February 7, 2017, which was published in the Federal Gazette on April 24, 2017 and May 19, 2017 (corrected version).
DECLARATION BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD OF ADIDAS AG ON THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE PURSUANT TO § 161 GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT (AKTIENGESETZ ­ AKTG) The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued their last Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 AktG in February 2019. For the period from the publication of the last Declaration of Compliance, the following Declaration refers to the German Corporate Governance Code (`Code') as amended on February 7, 2017, which was published in the Federal Gazette on April 24, 2017 and May 19, 2017 (corrected version).

The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG declare that the recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code have been and are met with the following deviation:

Maximum number of non-group mandates held by members of the Supervisory Board (section 5.4.5 subsection 1 sentence 2) One member of the Supervisory Board, Ian Gallienne, holds more than three mandates in supervisory bodies of non-group companies which are listed at a stock exchange or have similar requirements. Ian Gallienne is Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL). GBL is a holding company and, in its capacity as an institutional investor represented by, inter alia, its Chief Executive Officer, regularly holds mandates in supervisory bodies of portfolio companies. All companies (apart from adidas AG) in which Ian Gallienne holds mandates in supervisory bodies are portfolio companies or subsidiaries of GBL or are under common control with it and thus belong to the same group of companies. They have to be attributed to his main occupation as Chief Executive Officer of GBL. Therefore, we are of the opinion that, as regards its intent and purpose, the recommendation of section 5.4.5 subsection 1 sentence 2 is not applicable to Ian Gallienne. However, as a precaution, we declare a deviation. Moreover, the Supervisory Board has assured itself that Ian Gallienne has sufficient time to perform his Supervisory Board mandate at adidas AG.

ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE
SUGGESTIONS OF THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE LARGELY FULFILLED In addition to the recommendations, the Code contains a number of suggestions for good and responsible corporate governance, compliance with which is not required to be disclosed separately by law. adidas is compliant with the suggestions of the Code except for the suggestion outlined in section 4.2.3 subsection 2 sentence 9 of the Code according to which early disbursements of multiple-year, variable remuneration components should not be permitted.
DUAL BOARD SYSTEM As a globally operating public listed company with its registered seat in Herzogenaurach, Germany, adidas AG is subject to, inter alia, the provisions of German stock corporation law. A dual board system, which assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and advice and supervision of the Executive Board to the Supervisory Board, is one of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law. These two boards are strictly separated both in terms of members and competencies. In the interest of the company, both Boards cooperate closely.
COMPOSITION AND WORKING METHODS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD The composition of our Executive Board, which consists of six members, reflects the international character of our company. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company, determining the Group's strategic orientation, agreeing this with the Supervisory Board and ensuring its implementation. Further, it defines business

targets, company policy and the organization of the Group. The Executive Board is in charge of preparing the quarterly statements, the company's half year report as well as the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements and the combined Management Report of adidas AG and the Group. Moreover, it prepares a combined non-financial statement for the company and the Group. Additionally, the Executive Board ensures appropriate risk management and risk controlling as well as compliance with statutory regulations and internal guidelines. In this regard, the Executive Board is responsible for implementing an adequate compliance management system which meets the requirements of the company's risk situation. It is bound to the company's interest and obligated to strive for a sustainable increase in company value.
Notwithstanding the Executive Board's overall responsibility, its members are individually responsible for managing their respective business areas in accordance with the Business Allocation Plan for the Executive Board. There are no Executive Board committees. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for lead management and development of the company, including the coordination of the business areas, brands and markets. The members of the Executive Board keep each other informed regularly and comprehensively about all significant developments in their business areas and align on all cross-functional measures. Collaboration within the Executive Board is further governed by the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Business Allocation Plan. These documents specifically stipulate requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the Supervisory Board.
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely for the benefit of the company. The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, extensively and in a timely manner on all matters relevant for the company's strategy,

planning, business development, financial position and compliance as well as on essential business risks. Fundamental questions related to the corporate strategy and its implementation are thoroughly discussed and agreed with the Supervisory Board. When filling leadership positions in the company, the Executive Board takes diversity into account and aims for, in particular, adequate consideration of women.
No member of the Executive Board has accepted more than a total of three supervisory board mandates in non-group listed companies or in supervisory bodies of non-group companies with comparable requirements. SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD, P. 11
COMPOSITION AND WORKING METHODS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD Our Supervisory Board consists of 16 members. It comprises eight shareholder representatives and eight employee representatives in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz ­ MitbestG). SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD, P. 15 The shareholder representatives are elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, and the e mployee representatives by the employees. The most recent regular elections took place in the 2019 financial year. The term of office of all current members of the Supervisory Board commenced at the end of the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019 and will, in principle, expire at the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The term of office of Igor L andau expires at the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting and the term of office of Herbert Kauffmann at the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting.
Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board Due to the Supervisory Board elections in the 2019 financial year, the Supervisory Board confirmed at its meeting in December 2019 the objectives regarding its composition (including the profile of skills and expertise [competency profile] for the full Supervisory Board) which had last been

resolved upon in October 2018, taking into account the recommendations of the Code. These objectives are published on our website. ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/BODIES According to these objectives, the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that qualified supervision of and advice to the Executive Board are ensured. Its members as a whole are expected to have the knowledge, skills and professional experience required to properly perform the tasks of a supervisory board in a capital market-oriented, international company in the sporting goods industry. To this end, it is ensured that the Supervisory Board as a whole possesses the competencies considered essential in view of adidas' activities. This includes, in particular, in-depth knowledge and experience in the sporting goods and sports- and leisurewear industry, in the business of fast-moving consumer-oriented goods and in the areas of technology, digitalization and information technology (including IT security), production, marketing and sales, in particular in the e-commerce and retail sector. Moreover, the Supervisory Board is expected to possess knowledge and experience in the markets relevant for adidas, in particular the Asian and US markets, and in the management of a large international company. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board as a whole must possess knowledge and experience in the areas of business strategy development and implementation, personnel planning and management, accounting and financial reporting, controlling/risk management, governance/compliance as well as corporate social responsibility. At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the areas of accounting or auditing of annual accounts. Additionally, the Supervisory Board members as a whole are expected to be familiar with the sporting goods industry.
More than two thirds of the Supervisory Board members should be independent within the meaning of the Code. Moreover, with regard to diversity, it is the Supervisory Board's aim to take into account origin, diverse professional and

international experience and, in particular, adequate representation of both genders for its composition. Furthermore, an adequate number of the shareholder representatives should have long-standing international experience.
In addition, each Supervisory Board member must ensure that they have sufficient time to properly perform the tasks associated with the mandate. An age limit of, in general, 72 years at the time of election should be taken into account. As a rule, the length of membership in the Supervisory Board should not exceed 15 years or three terms of office.
In the Supervisory Board's assessment, the Supervisory Board as a whole fulfills the objectives stated and the competency profile. Together, the members of the Supervisory Board have the knowledge, skills and professional expertise required to properly perform their duties. All of them are familiar with the sector in which the company operates. As they furthermore have extensive knowledge of various professional fields and many years of international experience, they bring a broad spectrum of expertise and experience to the performance of the Supervisory Board's function. Moreover, with Herbert Kauffmann, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, at least one member of the Supervisory Board has proven expertise in the areas of accounting or auditing of annual accounts. The number of female Supervisory Board members currently amounts to five; thus, the statutory minimum quota regarding the composition, namely at least 30% female and at least 30% male members, is fulfilled. Further information on the fulfillment of the quota stipulated in § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG is contained in this report.
SEE SECTION `COMMITMENT TO THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL PARTICIPATION OF
WOMEN AND MEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS', P. 27 The members of our Supervisory Board do not exercise directorships or similar positions or advisory tasks for key competitors of the company. Further, they do not have business or personal relations with

adidas AG, its Executive Board and Supervisory Board or a controlling shareholder which may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. No members of the Supervisory Board are former Executive Board members. In the Supervisory Board's assessment, all eight shareholder representatives were independent within the meaning of the Code in the year under review. In accordance with the objectives resolved upon regarding its composition, the Supervisory Board deems this to be an appropriate number. The names of the independent shareholder representatives are set out in the overview of all Supervisory Board members in this Annual Report. SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD, P. 15 Assuming that all of the employee representatives also in principle meet the independence criteria as defined by the Code, in the Supervisory Board's assessment, all of its members were independent in the year under review. Regarding the Supervisory Board's composition, the age limit of, in general, 72 years at the time of election as well as the regular length of membership in the Supervisory Board of, in general, 15 years or three terms of office, was taken into account. The reappointment of Igor Landau, who exceeds both the age limit and the regular length of membership, for a term of office of only one year allows for transfer of the Supervisory Board chairmanship to a new Chairman. The orderly handover to a successor is highly important in particular in view of the fact that we are in the final implementation phase of the strategic business plan `Creating the New'. This is furthermore in the interest of the company because the company can benefit from Igor Landau's extensive expertise as he will see the strategic business plan through to its completion in the 2020 financial year, thus ensuring a smooth handover to a new Supervisory Board Chairman. Furthermore, Roland Nosko, a union representative on the employee representative side, belonged to the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years upon his reappointment.

The Supervisory Board's election proposals to the Annual General Meeting are prepared by the Nomination Committee. They take into account the objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition in accordance with section 5.4.1 of the Code resolved upon by the Supervisory Board and are aimed at fulfilling the competency profile developed by the Supervisory Board for the Board as a whole. The Supervisory Board pays attention to a balanced composition to ensure that the required know-how is represented on as broad a scale as possible. Moreover, the Supervisory Board ascertains that each proposed candidate has sufficient time to perform their mandates.
Tasks of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in questions relating to the management of the company. The Executive Board regularly, expeditiously and comprehensively reports on business development and planning as well as on the company's risk situation including compliance and coordinates the strategy of the company and its implementation with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board examines and approves the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined Management Report of adidas AG and the Group, taking into consideration the auditor's reports, and resolves upon the proposal of the Executive Board on the appropriation of retained earnings. Additionally, it resolves upon the Supervisory Board's resolution proposals to be presented to the Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the Supervisory Board examines the combined non-financial statement for the company and the Group. Certain business transactions and measures of the Executive Board with fundamental significance are subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board or by a Supervisory Board committee. The respective details are set out in § 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG. Furthermore, the requirement of prior Supervisory Board approval is stipulated in some resolutions by the Annual General Meeting.

The Supervisory Board is also responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the Executive Board members as well as for the allocation of their areas of responsibility. The respective proposals are prepared by the General Committee. When appointing new Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board aims to select candidates with a wide range of complementary skills to ensure the best possible Executive Board composition for the company, keeping long-term succession planning in mind. Inter alia, experience, industry knowledge as well as professional and personal qualifications play an important role in this regard. In addition, taking into account the international structure of the company, the Supervisory Board considers diversity. This applies, in particular, also with regard to age, gender, internationality and further important personal qualities. Considering all circumstances of the individual case, the company's interest is always key when deciding who to appoint to a specific Executive Board position. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board determines the Executive Board compensation system, examines it regularly and decides on the individual overall compensation of each Executive Board member. Further information on Executive Board compensation is compiled in the Compensation Report. SEE COMPENSATION REPORT, P. 30

competency profile for the full Supervisory Board)

In order to increase the efficiency of its work and to deal with complex topics, the Supervisory Board has formed five permanent expert committees from within its members, which, inter alia, prepare its resolutions and, in certain cases, pass resolutions on its behalf. These committees are the Steering Committee, the General Committee, the Audit Committee, the Mediation Committee in accordance with § 27 section 3 MitbestG and the Nomination Committee. The tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committees are in line with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the Code. The chairmen of the committees report to the entire Supervisory Board on the results of the committee work on a regular basis. Further information on the committees' composition and tasks is available on our website. ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/SUPERVISORY-BOARD-COMMITTEES
Apart from the individual skills expected of the members, the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board and of the Audit Committee also set out the tasks and responsibilities as well as the procedure for meetings and passing resolutions. These Rules of Procedure are available on our website. The Supervisory Board Report provides information on the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the year under review. SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT, P. 18
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for undertaking any necessary training and professional development measures required for their tasks and, in doing so, are supported by adidas AG. The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as opportunities for external training, and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature. In this regard, the Supervisory Board also obtained information about the latest corporate governance developments and dealt extensively with the revised version of the Code.

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee examine the efficiency of their work on a regular basis. The most recent efficiency examination took place in the 2018 financial year.
The compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report. SEE COMPENSATION REPORT, P. 30
COMMITMENT TO THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AND MEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS When filling leadership positions in the company, the Executive Board takes diversity into account and especially aims for appropriate consideration of women. The Supervisory Board is also convinced that an increase in the number of women in leadership positions within the company is necessary to ensure that, in the future, a larger number of suitable female candidates are available for Executive Board positions. The Supervisory Board thus supports the company's initiatives to foster diversity and inclusion and promote women in leadership positions. SEE PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70
Pursuant to the Law on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public Sector, the Supervisory Board determined target figures for the percentage of female representation on the Executive Board, including corresponding deadlines for their achievement, and the Executive Board determined such target figures for the first two management levels, including deadlines for their achievement, for adidas AG.
The target figure for the Executive Board is 1/7 or 14.29%. The deadline for achieving this target figure is June 30, 2022.
The deadline for achieving the target figures for the first and second management levels expired on December 31, 2019. On

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

the first management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 20% at the deadline. The target figure of 24% was thus not achieved. This is attributable to, in particular, unplanned departures from the company in the year under review as well as an increase in the total number of senior executives on this management level. In this respect, it must be noted that adidas AG has only a small number of leadership positions on this management level; therefore, minor changes already result in considerable changes in percentage numbers. On the second management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 28.8% at the deadline. The target figure of 30% was thus not achieved. This target figure was only just missed, mainly because of the reorganization of departments which led to the elimination of a number of leadership positions partly held by women. As at December 31, 2019, female representation in leadership positions amounted to 34% on a global level. The target figure of 32% for the year 2020 has thus already been exceeded. The company will continue to intensify its efforts to remain an attractive employer in the future, with a particular focus on a long-term approach for equal participation in leadership positions.
The Executive Board has once again determined target figures and implementation deadlines for the percentage of female representation on the first and second management levels below the Executive Board. These target figures are as follows:
The target figure for the first management level below the Executive Board is 24.2% and 30% for the second management level below the Executive Board. The implementation period for both targets expires on December 31, 2021.

In accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG, at least 30% of the members of the Supervisory Board have to be female and at least 30% have to be male. Prior to the Supervisory Board election in 2019 and also for the Supervisory Board election in 2020, the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives each resolved in accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 3 AktG that this minimum quota shall be fulfilled separately for the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives. As at December 31, 2019, altogether five of the 16 Supervisory Board mandates of the company were held by women, two on the shareholder representative side and three on the employee representative side. The minimum quota required is thus fulfilled on both sides.
AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are obligated to disclose any conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay. Substantial transactions between the company and members of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board approval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require Supervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the handling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive Board and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest. SEE SUPERVISORY

COMPENSATION REPORT
For adidas, transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board is an essential element of good corporate governance. The Compensation Report is a component of the combined Management Report and outlines the principles of the compensation system for the members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as well as the level and structure of the compensation in accordance with the legal requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (`Code`) as amended on February 7, 2017, which was published in the Federal Gazette on April 24, 2017 and May 19, 2017 (corrected version).
COMPENSATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS
Following preparation by the Supervisory Board's General Committee, the compensation system for the Executive Board and the total compensation of each member of the Executive Board is determined and regularly reviewed by the entire Supervisory Board. The compensation and personnel topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and General Committee in the year under review are described in the Supervisory Board Report. SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT, P. 18

COMPENSATION SYSTEM
PRINCIPLES OF THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM The compensation system is geared toward creating an incentive for successful, sustainable and long-term corporate management and development. The compensation is thus structured with an appropriate balance of non-performancerelated and performance-related components. More than 50% of the performance-related target compensation components are based on mainly future-related, multi-year performance criteria. They are designed in such a way that both positive and negative developments are considered. Moreover, the incentive to achieve the long-term targets decisive for the multi-year performance-related compensation component is higher than the incentive to achieve the targets decisive for being granted the one-year performance-related compensation component. Execution of the corporate strategy is promoted by selecting suitable performance targets for the performance-related compensation. Therefore, at least 80% of the performance-related compensation is directly linked to the short- and long-term sales and profitability targets externally communicated, thus bringing the compensation of the Executive Board members directly in line with the interests of the shareholders. SEE SECTION `VARIABLE PERFORMANCE-RELATED
COMPONENTS', P. 33
When designing the compensation system and determining the Executive Board compensation, the Supervisory Board takes into account the size and global orientation, the economic situation, the success and the outlook of the company. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board considers the common level of compensation in particular by taking into account the compensation level of the DAX 30 companies and the relation between the Executive Board compensation and

that of senior management and employees overall, also in terms of its development over time. Compared with competitors, the compensation should be attractive, offering incentives to attract qualified members for the Executive Board and retain them long-term. In addition, when determining the compensation, the tasks of the respective Executive Board member and their contribution to the company's success are taken into consideration. The performance-related compensation is measured based on the achievement of ambitious, pre-agreed targets; subsequent changes to performance targets or comparison parameters are not permitted. The compensation system aims to appropriately remunerate exceptional performance, while diminishing performance-related compensation when targets are not met. Thus, in the Supervisory Board's opinion, an appropriate level of compensation, which is reviewed regularly by the Supervisory Board and adjusted if required, is ensured.
The compensation system which has been applicable for the members of the Executive Board since the 2018 financial year was adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018. In view of the Act on the Implementation of the Second Shareholders' Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechterichtlinie ­ `ARUG II') and the coming into force of the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code, structural changes to the compensation system for the Executive Board members will become necessary. Furthermore, in late 2020, adidas will present the new long-term strategic business plan applicable from the 2021 financial year and the associated targets. In this context, it is intended to present the revised compensation system to the Annual General Meeting for approval in 2021 in accordance with the provisions of ARUG II. In this way, the new short-term and long-term performance-related compensation components for the Executive Board members can be aligned with the company's new long-term targets applicable from the 2021 financial year.

For the performance criterion `absolute increase in net income from continuing operations' determined in the 2019 financial year, see the section `LTIP 2018/2020: Performance year 2019' on page 37.
The Grant Amount for the respective annual LTIP tranche is payable following approval of the consolidated financial statements for the respective performance year.1

Cap of overall compensation
(maximum compensation)

Fixed compensation

2019 Performance Bonus The Performance Bonus is capped at a maximum of 150% of the individual bonus target amount. If the overall degree of target achievement lies at or below 50%, the Executive Board member is not entitled to the Performance Bonus.

LTIP 2018/2020 If the annual increase in net income is below the threshold value defined in advance ( 140 million), the Executive Board member is not entitled to a Grant Amount for the respective performance year.2
Even if the increase in net income exceeds the threshold value defined in advance ( 280 million) in the respective performance year, the degree of target achievement is capped at a maximum of 150%.

The total annual compensation of the Executive Board members is composed of a fixed compensation component, an annual cash bonus (`Performance Bonus'), a long-term share-based bonus (Long-Term Incentive Plan ­ `LTIP Bonus') as well as pension benefits and other benefits. In case of 100% target achievement, the target direct compensation (total annual compensation without pension benefits and other benefits) is composed of ---- 35% fixed compensation, ---- 25% Performance Bonus and ---- 40% LTIP Bonus. SEE DIAGRAM 2
Overall, the Supervisory Board believes that the compensation system is clear and easy to understand and makes use of transparent performance criteria. Due to the fact that the target direct compensation consists predominantly of variable components which are directly linked to the short- and longterm objectives of the company and due to the share-based long-term compensation of the Executive Board members, the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with the interests of the shareholders.

However, if the increase in net income is higher than  210 million in a performance year, the target for the following performance years remains unaffected.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

FIXED NON-PERFORMANCE-RELATED COMPONENTS Fixed compensation The fixed compensation consists of an annual fixed salary. In principle, it is paid in twelve equal monthly installments and generally remains unchanged during the term of the service contract.
Other benefits Other benefits for the Executive Board members primarily consist of paying for, or providing the monetary value of, noncash benefits such as premiums or contributions to insurance schemes in line with market practice, the provision of a company car or the payment of a car allowance and, if Executive Board members are also subject to taxation abroad, the costs for the tax consultant selected by adidas. The total amount of other benefits is capped at 5% of the total amount of the fixed compensation and a (possible) Performance Bonus granted in the respective financial year (`Benefit Cap'). Moreover, if an Executive Board member has to relocate upon initial appointment to the Executive Board, adidas pays reasonable expenses incurred for international relocations for the Executive Board member and their family; the expenses paid are capped on an individual basis.
Defined contribution pension plans The current members of the Executive Board have defined contribution pension plans. Each year, as part of the pension commitments, the virtual pension account of each Executive Board member is credited with an amount which equals a percentage determined by the Supervisory Board and which is related to the Executive Board member's individual annual

fixed compensation. The appropriateness of the percentage is regularly assessed by the Supervisory Board. When making its decision, the Supervisory Board takes into account the targeted individual pension level ­ also based on the length of service on the Executive Board ­ and the resulting annual and long-term expenses for the company. The percentage most recently determined by the Supervisory Board amounts to 50%. The pension assets on the virtual pension account at the beginning of the respective calendar year yield a fixed interest rate of 3% p.a., however for no longer than until the pension benefits first become due. As a rule, interest is credited as at the close of December 31 in each calendar year, and on the due date in the year in which the pension benefits are first due. Entitlement to the pension benefits becomes vested immediately.1
Entitlements to pension benefits comprise pensions to be received upon reaching the age of 65, or, on application, early retirement pensions to be received upon reaching the age of 62 or invalidity and survivors' benefits.2
On occurrence of the pension-triggering event, the pension benefits generally correspond to the balance of the pension account including accumulated interest on that date. In case of invalidity or death prior to reaching the age of 62, for the minimum coverage, the Executive Board member's virtual pension account will be credited with the outstanding pension contributions for the time until the Executive Board member would have reached the age of 62, but no longer than for 120 months (without interest accrual). The pension benefits due upon death of the Executive Board member are payable to the

widow, the widower or the registered civil partner and the children entitled to pension benefits as joint creditors.
At the option of the Executive Board member or the surviving dependents, the payout of all pension benefits is made either as a one-time payment or in up to ten equal annual installments. If no choice is made by the Executive Board member or by the surviving dependents, the pension benefits are paid out in three equal annual installments. As a rule, in case of a payout in annual installments, the installments are due in January of the respective year.3

1The pension plan for Gil Steyaert, who resigned as a member of the Executive Board in the year under review, deviates from the above: Until the end of his mandate, annual pension contributions were paid for Gil Steyaert into a special account at a financial institute which is subject to access restrictions. The special account and the access restrictions are maintained until occurrence of the pension-triggering event. The rules for this pension plan generally correspond to the rules of the defined contribution pension plans of the current Executive Board members, except that there are no ongoing interest payments and no credited contributions in the case of invalidity or death. The respective annual pension contributions to be determined by the Supervisory Board were therefore increased for Gil Steyaert by an amount determined based on actuarial principles.
2The provisions for Karen Parkin and the departed Executive Board member Eric Liedtke deviate from the above: The pension plans for Karen Parkin and Eric Liedtke do not provide for early retirement pensions upon reaching the age of 62. 3The provisions for Karen Parkin and the departed Executive Board members Eric Liedtke and Gil Steyaert deviate from the above: The pension plans for Karen Parkin and Eric Liedtke stipulate that the pension benefits are paid out in three equal installments payable in January of the three calendar years following the
occurrence of the pension-triggering event. Moreover, under US law, there may be certain waiting periods regarding the payout of the first annual installment. The pension plan for Gil Steyaert stipulates that on occurrence of the pension-triggering event, the access restrictions no longer apply and the amount on the special account at the respective point in time becomes available to him.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

VARIABLE PERFORMANCE-RELATED COMPONENTS Performance Bonus As the annual variable performance-related component, the Performance Bonus serves as compensation for the Executive Board's performance in the past financial year in line with the short-term development of the company. At the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory Board establishes the respective weighted performance criteria. In case of 100% target achievement, the target amount of the Performance Bonus corresponds to 25% of the target direct compensation of the respective Executive Board member.
The amount of the Performance Bonus is determined based on the achievement of, generally, four weighted criteria. Two of these criteria are the same for all Executive Board members and are overall weighted at 60%. These criteria are directly linked to the annual guidance externally communicated and, at the same time, follow directly from the ­ also externally communicated ­ long-term growth targets of adidas. The other two criteria, which are also in line with the company's short- and long-term targets and reflect priorities of the respective Executive Board function also taking into account non-financial aspects, are determined on an individual basis for the respective Executive Board member and are overall weighted at 40%. All criteria are designed in such a way that target achievement may also be zero. When targets are clearly not met, the Performance Bonus may consequently be forfeited entirely. SEE TABLE 3

At the end of the financial year, the precise target achievement of each Executive Board member, which is, in principle, based on a comparison of the predefined target values with the values achieved in the year under review, is assessed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board determines the factor by which the Performance Bonus target amount is multiplied by adding up these degrees of target achievement (`overall degree of target achievement'). The result is the individual amount of the Performance Bonus to be paid (`Performance Bonus Amount'). When determining the degrees of target achievement and thus when determining the Performance Bonus Amount, the Supervisory Board may, at its equitable discretion, take into account extraordinary positive and negative developments which are not related to the performance of the Executive Board.
Even in case of an overall degree of target achievement of more than 150%, the Performance Bonus Amount is capped at a maximum of 150% of the individual Performance Bonus target amount. If the overall degree of target achievement lies at or below 50%, the Executive Board member is not entitled to the Performance Bonus.
If an Executive Board member takes or leaves office during a financial year, the Performance Bonus is generally calculated pro rata temporis based on the overall degree of target achievement determined at the end of the financial year. In certain cases defined in the terms and conditions of the Performance Bonus, entitlement to the payout of a Performance Bonus is generally forfeited.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018/2020 (`LTIP 2018/2020') The LTIP 2018/2020 aims to link the long-term performancerelated compensation of the Executive Board to the company's performance and thus to the interests of the shareholders. Therefore, the LTIP 2018/2020 is share-based. It consists of three annual tranches (2018, 2019 and 2020) and each tranche is assessed based on a period of approximately four and a half years. Each of the three annual LTIP tranches consists of a performance year and a subsequent lock-up period of slightly more than three years. SEE TABLE 4

The Performance Bonus Amount is payable following approval of the consolidated financial statements of the past financial year.

At the beginning of 2018, the Supervisory Board determined for each of the three performance years (2018, 2019 and 2020) the absolute increase in net income from continuing operations compared to the respective previous year as performance criterion. The target values for the annual LTIP tranches follow directly from the externally published longterm net income growth targets of the company. For instance, if net income from continuing operations increased by a total of  630 million (100% target achievement) in the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, net income from continuing operations would amount to  2,060 million in 2020. Compared to 2015 (basis of adidas' corporate strategy), this would correspond to an average increase in net income of 23% per year, which would be within the target corridor of 22% to 24%, as defined by adidas in its current strategic business plan.
SEE TABLE 5

Performance year 2018 (compared to 20171) 2019 (compared to 2018) 2020 (compared to 2019)

Growth target for net income from continuing operations
+  210 million +  210 million +  210 million

1 T he basis for 2017 is net income from continuing operations in the amount of  1,430 million (without the negative tax-related one-time effect in the 2017 financial year).

If the increase in net income from continuing operations is below  210 million in the respective performance year, the target value for 100% target achievement is increased correspondingly for the following performance year, unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise at its equitable discretion. For instance, if net income increased by only  180 million in the past performance year, net income in the following performance year must be increased by  240 million for 100% target achievement. However, if the increase in net income is higher than  210 million in a performance year, the target for the following performance year remains unaffected. So despite a net income increase in 2019 of  263 million (2018:  279 million), reflecting a target achievement of 138% (2018: 149%), net income in the following performance year 2020 must still be increased by  210 million for a target achievement of 100%.

In case of 100% target achievement, the LTIP target amount for each of the LTIP tranches corresponds to 40% of the target direct compensation of the respective Executive Board member.

The precise target achievement is determined on the basis of the approved consolidated financial statements for the respective performance year. In this respect, the Supervisory Board may, at its equitable discretion, take into account extraordinary positive and negative developments which are not related to the performance of the Executive Board. The degree of target achievement by which the annual LTIP target

amount determined for the respective Executive Board member is multiplied is derived from the amount of the actual increase in net income from continuing operations for the respective performance year. SEE TABLE 6

LTIP 2018/2020: Calculation of target achievement

 +  280 million +  210 million +  140 million
< +  140 million

Degree of target achievement
150% 100%
50% 0%

If the actual increase in net income from continuing operations compared to the previous year is between the predefined threshold values, the degree of target achievement is determined based on a sliding scale. If the annual increase in net income is below  140 million, the degree of target achievement is zero. Consequently, the LTIP Bonus for the respective LTIP tranche is forfeited completely. Furthermore, the degree of target achievement is capped at 150%, even if the increase in net income exceeds  280 million.
By multiplying the degree of target achievement thus calculated with the annual LTIP target amount determined for the respective Executive Board member based on 100% target achievement, the Grant Amount is determined, which is paid out to the Executive Board member for the respective annual LTIP tranche following the approval of the consolidated financial statements of adidas for the performance year. The Executive Board members have to invest the full Grant Amount which remains after deducting applicable taxes and social security contributions (`LTIP Payout Amount') into the acquisition of adidas AG shares (`Share Ownership'). The shares purchased are subject to a lock-up period. The lock-up

period ends in the third financial year after the acquisition of the shares upon expiry of the month in which the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG takes place. The Executive Board members may only dispose of the shares after expiry of the lock-up period. SEE DIAGRAM 7
Due to this mechanism, the compensation which the Executive Board members eventually receive from each of the LTIP tranches is directly dependent on the share price performance during the respective lock-up period of slightly more than three years and is thus dependent on the long-term performance of the company. The Executive Board members are entitled to any dividends distributed in connection with these shares during the lock-up period. If an Executive Board member takes or leaves office during a performance year, the Grant Amount for the respective annual LTIP tranche is generally calculated on a pro rata basis. The departed Executive Board member does not participate in the annual LTIP tranches for which the performance year begins after the respective Executive Board member's departure. In certain cases defined in the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2018/2020, any claims in connection with the

LTIP 2018/2020 are generally forfeited and adidas AG shares already purchased, for which the lock-up period has not yet expired, must be transferred to adidas without compensation payments.
Furthermore, to ensure sustainable management and development of the company, the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2018/2020 contain malus and clawback provisions; until expiry of the lock-up period (malus) and beyond (clawback), these provisions allow the Supervisory Board at its equitable discretion, under certain circumstances, to partially or completely reduce the compensation from the LTIP 2018/2020 already paid. Such circumstances are, for instance, material misstatements in the financial reports, serious compliance violations and violations of duty as well as breaches of the company-internal rules of conduct by the Executive Board member which, in any such case, would lead to an unjustified bonus payment in the context of the LTIP 2018/2020. Moreover, in the event of violations of duty by Executive Board members, the respective claims for damages under stock corporation law are applicable.

The compensation system for the Executive Board allows the Supervisory Board, at its equitable discretion and in exceptional cases, to grant a special bonus in case of extraordinary performance by an Executive Board member which is not related to performance criteria that were already decisive for granting the Performance Bonus or the LTIP Bonus. If such special bonus is granted, it is capped at a maximum of 100% of the annual fixed compensation of the financial year for which the special bonus is granted. If a special bonus is granted, the reasons for such granting will be disclosed in the Compensation Report on the financial year concerned.

SHARE OWNERSHIP 40% of the target direct compensation of the Executive Board members is granted based on the long-term performancerelated compensation component LTIP 2018/2020. To promote sustainable development of the company, the Executive Board members are obligated in the context of the LTIP 2018/2020 to invest the full Payout Amount into the acquisition of adidas AG shares. The shares purchased are subject to a lock-up period of slightly more than three years ­ as a result, the number of adidas AG shares directly held by the Executive Board members increases on an annual basis. SEE TABLE 10
COMMITMENTS TO EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS UPON TERMINATION OF TENURE Unless otherwise agreed in the individual case, if the service contract ends upon the Executive Board member reaching the age of 65 or upon non-renewal of the service contract, the Executive Board member is entitled to receive annual fixed compensation on a pro rata basis up to the date on which they leave office as well as a potential prorated Performance Bonus and a potential prorated LTIP Bonus. Further, Executive Board members are subject to a post-contractual competition prohibition of two years. As consideration, for the duration of the competition prohibition, the Executive Board members generally receive a monthly compensation amount totaling 50% of the monthly fixed compensation last received, subject to offsetting (e.g. of income from other use of their work capacity). If the departed Executive Board member receives pension payments from the company, this compensation is offset against any pension benefits owed by the company during the period of the competition prohibition.

Under certain circumstances, the departing Executive Board member also receives a follow-up bonus. As regards the current members of the Executive Board, such a follow-up bonus is agreed with Roland Auschel in the amount of 75% of the Performance Bonus granted to him for the last full financial year. This follow-up bonus is payable in two tranches, twelve and 24 months following the end of the contract.
In case of premature termination of tenure in the absence of good cause, the Executive Board service contracts cap potential severance payments at a maximum of twice the total annual compensation, not exceeding payment claims for the remaining period of the service contract (`Severance Payment Cap'). If the service contract is terminated due to a change of control, a possible severance payment is limited to 150% of the Severance Payment Cap. The Executive Board member does not receive a severance payment if they terminate tenure prematurely at their own request or if there is good cause for the company to terminate the employment relationship. The service contracts concluded with Executive Board members newly appointed with effect from January 1, 2020, generally stipulate that compensation for periods of competition prohibition possibly paid on a monthly basis to departing Executive Board members is offset against any severance payments potentially paid by adidas.
If an Executive Board member dies during their term of office, their spouse or partner receives or, alternatively, any dependent children receive, in addition to pension benefits, the pro rata annual fixed salary for the month of death and the following three months, but no longer than until the agreed end date of the service contract.

SIDELINE ACTIVITIES OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS Executive Board members may only take on sideline activities with or without remuneration, in particular supervisory board mandates in group-external companies, with the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. Group-internal mandates are deemed covered by the contractually agreed Executive Board compensation. The Supervisory Board decides whether or not compensation for group-external mandates is credited to the Executive Board compensation. In accordance with a Supervisory Board resolution, the compensation received by Kasper Rorsted for his Board of Directors mandate at Nestlé S.A. is not credited to his Executive Board compensation.
SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD, P. 11
EXECUTIVE BOARD COMPENSATION 2019
2019 PERFORMANCE BONUS For the 2019 financial year, the Supervisory Board determined ---- currency-neutral sales growth, ---- an increase in the operating margin and ---- two criteria relating to the individual performance of the
Executive Board members as performance criteria.
The targets determined for the Performance Bonus are oriented toward the guidance communicated for the 2019 financial year, namely `currency-neutral sales increase between 5% and 8%' and an `increase in the operating margin to a level between 11.3% and 11.5%'. When determining the degree of target achievement for the criterion `increase in the operating margin', the positive effect of the accounting change pursuant to IFRS 16 in the amount of  24 million was excluded.

1 T he Grant Amount which remains for the respective annual LTIP tranche after deduction of applicable taxes and social security contributions (`LTIP Payout Amount') must be invested in the acquisition of adidas AG shares. These shares are subject to a lock-up period which ends in the third financial year after the acquisition of the shares upon expiry of the month in which the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG takes place. The LTIP Payout Amount is considered earned only after expiry of the lock-up period and only then can the Executive Board members dispose of the shares at their own discretion. By contrast, the amount deducted for income tax and social security contributions is already fully earned at the time of payout following the adoption of the consolidated financial statements by the Supervisory Board.
2 The compensation components outlined above constitute the overall payments to be set out individually in accordance with commercial law both in the 2019 financial year and in the previous year. 3 Due to his departure, Eric Liedtke receives a contractually agreed severance payment in the amount of  5,428,572 in addition to the overall compensation set out. This payment is set out in the Compensation Report in the overall payments to former Executive Board members. 4 Contractually agreed Performance Bonus target amount 2019 and LTIP bonus target amount 2018/2020 (2019 tranche) due to intra-year appointment of Martin Shankland (with effect from March 4, 2019) to the Executive Board. Service costs 2019 stated pro rata temporis. 5 Executive Board compensation stated pro rata temporis due to the intra-year termination of Gil Steyaert's Executive Board mandate. Gil Steyaert's service contract terminated with effect from February 28, 2019. Until that date, Gil Steyaert was paid his full monthly fixed salary. Due to his departure, Gil Steyaert additionally

COMMITMENTS TO EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS UPON TERMINATION OF TENURE Termination of Gil Steyaert's tenure effective February 26, 2019 In connection with the termination of his Executive Board mandate, Gil Steyaert received a severance payment of  3,422,316.4 Furthermore, it was contractually agreed to dispense with the obligation to invest the LTIP Bonus granted to Gil Steyaert for the 2018 financial year into adidas AG shares.
As regards the post-contractual competition prohibition, Gil Steyaert has received monthly compensation in the amount of  28,634 since March 1, 2019, payable for a total period of 24 months. This corresponds to 50% of the last fixed monthly salary. If the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition prohibition and any potential income from other employment in total exceed the monthly fixed salary last received by Gil Steyaert before his departure, any income from other employment will be offset against the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition prohibition. The overall maximum compensation for the post-contractual competition prohibition payable to Gil Steyaert therefore amounts to  687,225.
Termination of Eric Liedtke's tenure effective December 31, 2019 In connection with the termination of his Executive Board mandate at the end of December 31, 2019, Eric Liedtke was granted a severance payment of  5,428,572.
As regards the post-contractual competition prohibition, Eric Liedtke will receive monthly compensation in the amount of  41,667 for a period of 24 months from January 1, 2020. This corresponds to 50% of the last fixed monthly salary. If the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition prohibition and any potential income from other employment in total exceed the monthly fixed salary last received by

Eric Liedtke before his departure, any income from other employment will be offset against the compensation paid for the post-contractual competition prohibition. The overall maximum compensation for the post-contractual competition prohibition payable to Eric Liedtke therefore amounts to  1,000,000.
OVERALL PAYMENTS TO FORMER MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND THEIR SURVIVING DEPENDENTS In the 2019 financial year, overall payments to former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents amounted to  14.567 million (2018:  3.746 million). The increase in the overall payments compared to the previous year is attributable to the severance payments granted to Eric Liedtke and Gil Steyaert due to their departure from the Executive Board in the year under review.
Provisions were created for pension entitlements for former members of the Executive Board who resigned on or before December 31, 2005 and their surviving dependents, amounting to  46.326 million (2018:  43.904 million) in total as at December 31, 2019. There are pension commitments toward six former Executive Board members who resigned after December 31, 2005, which are covered by a pension fund or a pension fund in combination with a reinsured pension trust fund. From this, indirect obligations amounting to  46.216 million (2018:  40.969 million) arise for adidas AG, for which no provisions were created due to financing through the pension fund and pension trust fund.

MISCELLANEOUS The Executive Board members do not receive any additional compensation for mandates within adidas. The Executive Board members have not received any loans or advance payments from adidas AG. Furthermore, no Executive Board member received any payments or promises of payments from third parties with regard to their work at adidas.

4Until the termination of his service contract on February 28, 2019, Gil Steyaert was paid his full monthly fixed compensation.

COMPENSATION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
The compensation system which has been applicable for the members of the Supervisory Board since July 1, 2017 was adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2017. The compensation system is set out in § 18 of the Articles of Association of adidas AG.
COMPENSATION SYSTEM
The compensation of the Supervisory Board members takes into account the responsibility and scope of activities of the Supervisory Board members and consists of two components: fixed compensation and additional compensation for membership in committees. The Supervisory Board members are not granted performance-related compensation. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members receive attendance fees and are reimbursed for expenses they incur.

ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN A COMMITTEE Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members receive additional compensation for membership in certain committees; in this regard, too, compensation is increased if the chairmanship of a committee is assumed. The amount of the respective additional compensation is based on the fixed compensation (`Base Amount') determined for the Supervisory Board members by the Annual General Meeting and depends on the tasks and responsibilities connected with the respective committee membership.

REDUCED COMPENSATION IN CASE OF MEMBERSHIP FOR PART OF FINANCIAL YEAR If a member belongs to the Supervisory Board or a committee for only part of a financial year, the fixed compensation and additional compensation for membership in a committee are reduced accordingly on a pro rata temporis basis.
ATTENDANCE FEE For each personal attendance of meetings requiring personal attendance, the Supervisory Board members are also granted an attendance fee in the amount of  1,000. Members of committees that are formed on an ad hoc basis do not receive an attendance fee. If several meetings take place on one day, the attendance fee is only paid once.
EXPENSES The Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for necessary expenses and travel expenses incurred in connection with their mandates as well as for the VAT payable on their compensation.

COMPENSATION FOR SUPERVISORY BOARD FUNCTION Each member receives fixed compensation which is paid following the end of the respective financial year. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his two deputies receive higher fixed compensation. SEE TABLE 14

Compensation for Supervisory Board function

The compensation paid for a committee chairmanship also covers the membership in such committee. The members of the Steering Committee, the Mediation Committee, the Nomination Committee and committees which are established ad hoc do not receive additional compensation. If a Supervisory Board member is a member of more than one committee, the member only receives compensation for their task in the committee with the highest compensation.

SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATION 2019
FIXED COMPENSATION AND ATTENDANCE FEE The total compensation paid to the Supervisory Board in the 2019 financial year amounted to  2.20 million (2018:  2.20 million). In addition, attendance fees totaling  167,000 (2018:  129,000) were paid. SEE TABLE 16

OUR SHARE
Global stock markets were volatile throughout the year but ended 2019 on a positive note. The DAX-30 and the EURO STOXX 50 both increased by 25% while the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Index was up 37%. The adidas AG share outperformed the broader stock market and ended 2019 with an increase of 59% compared to the prior year. As a result of the strong operational and financial performance in 2019 as well as Management's confidence in the strength of the company's financial position and longterm growth aspirations, we intend to propose a dividend per share of 3.85 at our 2020 Annual General Meeting.

the EURO STOXX 50 increased 25% in 2019. The MSCI World Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Index closed the year with a 37% increase. SEE TABLE 17 Our financial results helped to further build investors' confidence in the successful execution of our strategic business plan `Creating the New' and the company's ability to sustainably grow revenues and improve margins in the years to come. Consequently, the adidas AG share closed the year at 289.80 and thus 59% above the prior year-end level, making it the second best performer in the DAX-30. SEE DIAGRAM 18

LEVEL 1 ADR PERFORMS IN LINE WITH COMMON STOCK Our Level 1 ADR closed 2019 at US$162.80, representing an increase of 56% versus the prior year level (2018: US$104.34). The slightly less pronounced increase of the Level 1 ADR price compared to the ordinary share price was due to the appreciation of the US dollar versus the euro in 2019. The number of Level 1 ADRs outstanding increased to 10.4 million at year-end 2019 compared to 9.0million at the end of 2018. The average daily trading volume decreased to around 43,000 ADRs in 2019 (2018: around 51,400). Further information on our ADR program can be found on our website. ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/ADR

ADIDAS AG SHARE RISES AND OUTPERFORMS BROADER STOCK MARKET IN 2019 In 2019, global stock markets ended a volatile year on a positive note, as greater optimism regarding the US-China trade situation and low unemployment gave capital markets strong impetus. In addition, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve benefited markets further. As a result, the DAX-30 as well as

ADIDAS AG SHARE MEMBER OF IMPORTANT INDICES The a didas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality indices around the world, most importantly the DAX-30, the EURO STOXX 50 Index as well as the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Index, which comprises our major competitors. At December 31, 2019, our weighting in the DAX-30, which is calculated on the basis of free float market capitalization and twelve-month share turnover, improved to 4.99% (2018: 3.94%). Our higher weighting compared to the prior year was due to the increase in market capitalization of adidas AG. Within the DAX-30, we ranked 7 on market capitalization (2018: 9) and 9 on turnover (2018: 11) at yearend 2019. For the 20th consecutive time, adidas was selected to join the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), and was assessed to be among the global 10% best-performing companies in its industry in economic, environmental and social criteria.

DIVIDEND PROPOSAL OF 3.85 PER SHARE

As a result of the strong operational and financial performance

in 2019, the company's robust financial position as well as

Management's confidence in our long-term growth

Dividend proposal

aspirations, the a didas AG Executive

3.85 

and Supervisory Boards will

recommend paying a dividend of

3.85 per dividend-entitled share to

shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on

May 14, 2020. This represents an increase of 15% compared to

the prior year dividend (2018: 3.35). Subject to the meeting's

approval, the dividend will be paid on May 19, 2020. The total

payout of 752million (2018: 664million) reflects a payout

ratio of 39.2% of net income from continuing operations (2018:

38.9%), based on the number of shares outstanding as at the

date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

SEE TABLE 19 This is within the target range of between 30%

and 50% of net income from continuing operations as defined

in our dividend policy.

SECOND TRANCHE OF SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM COMPLETED On March 13, 2018, adidas AG announced the launch of a multiyear share buyback program of up to 3.0billion in total until May 11, 2021. The program is executed by buying back shares via the stock exchange under the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016. The authorization covers the repurchase of up to 10% of the company's share capital on the stock exchange. The vast majority of the share buyback program will be financed through the company's net cash position as well as the expected strong operating cash flow generation in the years ahead. Following the first tranche in 2018, in which the company bought back 5.1 million shares for a total consideration of  1.0 billion, on January 7, 2019 adidas AG announced the commencement of the second tranche of the share buyback program. Between January 7, 2019, and December 18, 2019, the company bought back

3.2 million shares, corresponding to 1.6% of the company's stock capital, for a consideration of  815 million. The average purchase price per share was  252.80. A total of 8.8 million treasury shares have been canceled since the start of the current program, reducing the company's share count and stock capital correspondingly.
STRONG INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR BASE Based on our share register, we estimate that adidas AG currently has more than 90,000 shareholders (2018: 80,000). In our latest ownership analysis conducted in January 2020, we identified almost 100% of our shares outstanding. Institutional

investors represent the largest investor group, holding 89% of shares outstanding (2018: 92%). Private investors and undisclosed holdings account for 9% (2018: 8%). Lastly, adidas AG currently holds 2% of the company's shares as treasury shares (2018: 1%); this increase versus the prior year mainly reflects the shares resulting from our share buyback activities which have not been canceled yet. SEE DIAGRAM 21
In terms of geographical distribution, the North American market currently accounts for 43% of institutional share holdings (2018: 43%), followed by the UK with 21% (2018: 21%). Identified German institutional investors hold 10% of

CORPORATE STRATEGY
Everything we do is rooted in sport. With sport playing an increasingly important role in more and more people's lives, on and off the field of play, we operate in a highly attractive industry. Through our authentic sports brands, we push the boundaries of products, experiences and services to drive brand desire and capitalize on the growth opportunities in sport, as well as in sports-inspired casual wear.
OUR CORE BELIEF: THROUGH SPORT, WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE LIVES The importance of sport, however, goes far beyond that. Sport is central to every culture and society and is core to an individual's health and happiness. Therefore, we believe that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. And we work every day to inspire and enable people to harness the power of sport in their lives.

driving significant improvements in the desirability of our brands and has increased our relevance with consumers around the globe. As a result, we have gained market share in those categories, markets and cities that we have identified as future growth drivers for our company. SEE DIAGRAM 23
STRATEGIC CHOICES Our strategic business plan has a powerful foundation in our unique corporate culture and is built around three strategic choices that support us in intensifying our focus on our consumers and will drive brand desirability: Speed, Cities, and Open Source.
Our strategic business plan: `Creating the New'

Culture We have great talents in our organization who work with passion for sports and our brands. Our people bring our strategy to life and our culture makes the difference in achieving our long-term goals. We are convinced that a culture of Creativity, Collaboration and Confidence (the 3Cs
SEE GLOSSARY) is a key enabler for us to `Create the New'.
Our leaders role-model this behavior. To enhance our leadership structure, we established the Core Leadership Group (CLG). This group of senior leaders, selected from the most critical roles across the company, are responsible for leading the execution of our strategic business plan, with a particular focus on improving cross-functional collaboration
23

OUR MISSION: TO BE THE BEST SPORTS COMPANY IN THE WORLD It is our mission to be the best sports company in the world. Best means that we design, build and sell the best sports products in the world, with the best service and experience, and that we do so in a sustainable way. Best is what our consumers, athletes, teams, partners, media and shareholders will say about us. We are confident that we will see improvements with regard to market share, leadership and profitability once people are saying that we are the best.
STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN: `CREATING THE NEW' `Creating the New' is our strategic business plan until the year 2020. Our ambition to further drive top- and bottom-line growth by significantly increasing brand desirability builds the core of `Creating the New'. The strategic business plan therefore focuses on our brands as they connect and engage with our consumers. This consumer-centric approach is

and decision-making. We continued to sharpen our leadership structure by adding an Extended Leadership Group (ELG), which supports the Core Leadership Group in implementing our strategy. The Leadership Framework unites all leaders in our company through a clear definition of what strong leadership looks like at adidas and commitment to enhance performance and culture. In addition, the Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) was formed in 2018 to develop high potentials who have the ability to take on more complex, demanding and higher-level responsibilities at a global senior management level. In 2019, we launched a Local High Potential Group (LHIPO) who are being developed for more complex roles at a local senior management level. Each leadership group creates a succession pool to the one above it to ensure ongoing internal talent development, as well as being leadership role models across the organization.
We believe that a performance culture is essential to successfully executing our strategy. To further promote a performance culture within our company, we have finalized a new way of developing our people and evaluating their performance. In addition, we have made significant progress in recalibrating our approach to evaluating performance and have evolved the link to performance and rewards through our compensation and benefits. Long-term remuneration for our senior management, for instance, has been simplified and linked to the development of the company's bottom line and our share price in order to further align the interests of our senior leaders with the interests of our shareholders.
As a company, we value diversity and promote inclusivity. Today, our employee base is already very diverse in terms of gender, generation and global representation. We are dedicated to continuously increasing the representation of female leadership across the organization. We have made further progress in this regard and representation of women

globally in management positions across the company increased to 34% in 2019 compared to 29% in 2015. Our GHIPO and LHIPO leadership groups have an almost balanced gender splitto ensure greater female representation for succession into senior roles. Furthermore, we are offering gender intelligence training globally to promote a more inclusive workplace. SEE PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70
Speed Driving brand desirability begins with putting our consumers at the heart of everything we do and serving them in the best possible way. This involves ensuring that consumers always find fresh and desirable products where and when they want them and with an unrivaled brand experience. This, in turn, means being able to anticipate what consumers want and reacting accordingly in a timely manner. Being fast will give us a decisive competitive advantage. The benefits include higher product availability, reduced inventory risk, incremental net sales and higher margins. Speed is therefore a critical and powerful lever for us.
We are using our industry-leading experience to further evolve our entire business model end-to-end, from range planning to product creation, sourcing, supply chain, go-to-market and sales. In 2019, we further developed and sharpened `Speed'. With the revised approaches `fast creation' and `fast replenishment', we are able to increase the share of short lead-time ranges. Together with our customers, we define which of our product ranges qualify for these approaches. Through this, we are enabling our brands to ensure constant freshness in store for our consumers, resulting in higherquality sales and more productive inventory.
Since the launch of the strategic priority Speed, we have steadily expanded its coverage. All categories and markets have now been fully onboarded and started to capitalize on the

benefits of the Speed programs. Over the last years, the net sales share of speed-enabled products has continuously increased to a level of 47% in 2019, which is fully in line with our overall ambition to increase the share of speed-enabled products to at least 50% by 2020.
In addition to focusing on Speed in our existing supply chain and production processes, we also explore new, disruptive business models and technologies to make us faster. Together with Oechsler AG, adidas had opened two Speedfactories
SEE GLOSSARY in 2017 to test new processes for faster production of athletic footwear and to develop new manufacturing technologies with the ultimate goal to transfer them to the company's global supply chain. In 2019, we decided to discontinue production at the two Speedfactories in Ansbach, Germany, and Atlanta, USA, by April 2020, and to deploy the Speedfactory technology at Asian suppliers. The company will continue to develop, improve and test manufacturing processes in the `adiLab' at the adidas production site in Scheinfeld, Germany. SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS, P. 63, SEE
INNOVATION, P. 67
Cities Urbanization continues to be a global megatrend. Most of the global population lives in cities and already today cities account for around 80% of global GDP. Cities are shaping global trends and consumers' perception, perspectives and buying decisions. To be successful in the future, we therefore need to win the consumer in the world's most influential cities. We have identified six global megacities in which we want to over-proportionally invest to grow share of mind, share of market, share of trend: London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo.
We aim to deliver extraordinary experiences to consumers in these cities across all touchpoints by engaging more deeply

with them in communities where they live, places where they work, fields, courts and streets where they play, and doors where they shop. At the same time, we strive to create high synergies between our activation and commercial efforts. This also includes aligning our initiatives with similar activities of key retail partners.
It is our goal to create an end-to-end ecosystem in these cities which connects consumers to relevant products, through bottom-up activation and holistic retail experiences: ---- Activation: Our global key cities offer our brands a unique
platform. Over the year, we conducted individual city-led activations together with some of our most important assets such as Pharrell Williams in London, and James Harden at the `Republic of Sports' event in Shanghai. On top, we continued to deliver day-to-day brand experiences for our communities such as the adidas Runners, Tango League and Versatile Female Athlete to engage with our consumers. ---- Products: We continue to drive a multi-pronged strategy of product introductions, focused across all six cities, including global campaign launches and exclusive collections, for example when we launched Futurecraft Loop in New York City to the world's media. In 2019, we utilized our Speedfactory concept to create shoes with and for consumers in all six key cities, e.g. with e-gaming partner Team Vitality in Paris. SEE INNOVATION, P. 67 ---- Experiences: We are committed to providing premium retail experiences to our consumers with executions that connect, engage and inspire them. 2019 saw the opening of our new four-storied adidas brand flagship store on London's Oxford Street, which was created to be our most digital store ever. With more than 100 digital touchpoints, which are powered by green energy, and immersive fitting rooms, the entire experience is curated for our consumers through innovative digital storytelling tools and interactive experiences, such as the `bring it to me' feature in the adidas app that personalizes the shopping experience.

The 2019 results for specific KPIs (NPS and market share) signal we are well on track to achieve our target to double revenues in our global key cities by the end of 2020 compared to 2015.
Open Source Open Source is a collaboration-based innovation model that aims to build brand advocacy by opening the brands' doors to the consumer and by inviting him or her to co-create the future of sport and sports culture with us. It is about learning and sharing, about starting conversations between the brand, external experts and consumers, and about giving them the chance to have an impact on what we do. We provide access for externals to tools and resources we use to create, thereby acquiring and nurturing creative capital, and explore new territories so as to create unprecedented brand value for the consumer beyond mere transactional businesses.
We have defined three strategic initiatives for Open Source: ---- Athlete collaborations: Through athlete collaborations we
aim to build communities of athletes that help shape the future of their sport together with us. Such collaborations include relationships with the world's best athletes and teams, but they also take place on a local level. To directly engage and interact with a broader consumer community, we have expanded our efforts in digital and physical spaces. For instance, in 2019 our investment in running communities through grassroots activations of `adidas Runners' covered more than 60 cities in 30 countries on all continents. Our adidas Running communities drove the surge for around 2.2 million runners to step up for the Run for the Oceans campaign with many events taking place across the globe. In total, participants logged over twelve million kilometers, tracking their runs on the adidas Running by Runtastic app (and Joyrun app for those based in China). SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55

---- Creative collaborations: Creative collaborations increase our creative capital through new tools, new environments and new perspectives from outside creative thinkers. They are intended to give creativity a platform and provide the right tools for ideas to blossom. The most notable addition to our Creator Network roster was our landmark collaboration with Beyoncé, as a brand ambassador and co-creator. In addition, we launched a partnership with the world's most influential gamer, Ninja, to broaden our reach into the expanding e-gaming world. Furthermore in 2019, we continued our collaborations with Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Yohji Yamamoto, Stella McCartney, Raf Simons and Alexander Wang. SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55
---- Partner collaborations: The strategic initiatives in this area intend to open up our knowledge of sport by working with the best in other fields. By exchanging core competencies, we will create unique value for our brands and ultimately also for our consumers. Our partnership with Parley for the Oceans SEE GLOSSARY serves as a prime example. As a founding member of the organization, our support goes far beyond financial aid to fund beach clean-ups. In 2019, we expanded our efforts through partnerships with start-up incubators such as Fashion for Good, who will help us to accelerate sustainable innovation in the apparel industry, and Station F to create the best digital innovations in sport.
SEE INNOVATION, P. 67, SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78
We remain committed to embedding external creative capital in our processes to extend our possibilities in creating the future of sport. To ensure that we are at the pulse of the consumer journey at key moments and touchpoints in their lives, we want to grow the number of users in our digital ecosystem. We have made significant progress in this regard and are now connected with more than 500 million users through our different platforms and social media channels. With the insights generated through Open Source, we craft better products and services for our consumers, driving brand desire, sales, market share and profitability.

`CREATING THE NEW' ACCELERATION PLAN In March 2017, we introduced a number of initiatives to foster brand momentum and accelerate top- and bottom-line growth:
Portfolio Every entity must contribute to the success of our company, be it a brand, a channel or a market. We constantly revisit the performance and strategic fit of our portfolio. After the completion of the sale of the TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth brands as well as our CCM Hockey business in 2017, we are now operating with a narrowed focus on our core strength areas of athletic footwear and apparel. This will allow us to reduce complexity and pursue our target consumer more aggressively with both the adidas and the Reebok brand. We have continued to execute upon Reebok's turnaround plan `Muscle Up', aimed at accelerating top-line growth, particularly in North America, and improving the brand's overall profitability. After returning to profitability in 2018, Reebok achieved currency-neutral growth of 2% in 2019.
SEE REEBOK BRAND STRATEGY, P. 59
adidas North America North America represents the biggest market in the sporting goods industry with a total share of approximately 40%. At the same time, from a geographical perspective, North America represents the biggest opportunity for the adidas brand, given our relatively small market share here compared to other regions. To improve the adidas brand's overall positioning in the region, we have made North America a strategic priority and started to significantly increase our investments into North America in order to be more relevant and always visible to the consumer. In this context, over the last years, we have increased investments into our organizational set-up, including the further expansion of our US headquarters in Portland, elevated our marketing efforts and upgraded our distribution infrastructure with the opening of a new distribution center in Pennsylvania. We are pleased with the

progress we have been making in recent years, as we have more than doubled our business in North America since the launch of `Creating the New' in 2015. However, we are still not satisfied with our current position, which leaves significant upside for the years to come. Therefore, going forward, we will continue to execute our game plan for North America in order to continue to increase our market share and reach our target of  5 billion in revenues for the adidas brand by 2020.
ONE adidas We continuously strive for operational excellence. ONE adidas encompasses a set of initiatives that will enable our company to work smarter, more efficiently and in a more aligned way. After having successfully operationalized the initiatives under the Brand Leadershippillar SEE GLOSSARY in 2018, we are now focusing on the remaining two pillars ­Operating and Marketing Efficiency. In order to create a more scalable business model, we will therefore focus on those opportunities that enable us to standardize and harmonize current processes and procedures. In this context, 2019 saw the continuation of several initiatives which are aimed at significantly improving our operating efficiency in the years to come. Our disciplined execution has already led to initial positive results in terms of generating incremental profits. We decided to use these benefits to reinvest into the business and continue our investment efforts into our scalable business model. In 2019, we focused on the expansion of Global Business Services, where we continue to work on the standardization and harmonization of processes in areas such as Accounting and HR Services. Furthermore, in the last year we saw the Non-Trade Procurementinitiative SEE GLOSSARY deliver considerable savings as a result of successfully operationalizing the approach. These and other initiatives are designed to enable scalability and operating leverage. They are generating benefits already now and are expected to deliver further positive impact in the future.

Digital The digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way our consumers behave and the way we work. Technology has enabled us to accelerate building direct relationships with our consumer. Improving digital capabilities along the entire value chain enables us not only to interact with the consumer, but also to become faster, better and more efficient in every part of the organization. We continue to make strong progress in multiple digital accelerators. After the initial launch in 2017, we expanded the reach of the adidas app to over 30 countries across all major markets. Our membership program Creators Club SEE GLOSSARY introduced in 2018 as well as the relaunch of the Runtastic app as `adidas Running by Runtastic' and `adidas Training by Runtastic', respectively, emphasize the importance of our investments in customer relationship management to allow a deeper consumer understanding. By providing consumers with a premium, connected and personalized shopping experience, we progress toward our 2020 own e-commerce revenue target of  4 billion. In 2019, our own e-commerce platform was our fastest-growing channel with a currency-neutral revenue increase of 34%.

FINANCIAL AMBITION UNTIL 2020 Creating long-term value for our shareholders drives our overall decision-making process. Therefore, we are focused on rigorously managing those factors under our control, making strategic choices that will drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth and, ultimately, operating cash flow. We are committed to increasing returns to shareholders with above-industry-average share price performance and dividends.
SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, P. 92
Our unique corporate culture and the three strategic choices will continue to be step-changers with regard to brand desirability and brand advocacy. In combination with the initiatives that are part of our acceleration plan, this will enable us to: ---- achieve top-line growth significantly above industry
average: We aim to increase currency-neutral revenues annually between 2015 and 2020 at a rate between 10% and 12% on average (initially, in March 2015: high-singledigit currency-neutral increase). ---- win significant market share across key categories and markets: We have defined key categories within the adidas and Reebok brands that will spur our growth going forward. From a market perspective, we have defined clear roles for each of our markets, depending on macroeconomic trends, the competitive environment and our brand strength in the respective markets. ---- improve our profitability sustainably: We plan to substantially improve the company's profitability, growing our net income from continuing operations by an average of between 22% and 24% per year between 2015 and 2020 (initially, in March 2015: increase of around 15%; updated in March 2017: increase between 20% and 22%).

---- deliver on our commitment to increase shareholder returns: `Creating the New' includes a strong commitment to generating increasing returns for our shareholders. Given our firm confidence in the strength of the company's financial position and future growth ambitions, we target a consistent dividend payout ratio in a range between 30% and 50% of net income from continuing operations. Our dividend policy is complemented by a multi-year share buyback program announced in March 2018. Under the current program, we plan to buy back own shares for up to  3 billion in total until May 2021, of which  1.8 billion was utilized by the end of 2019.

ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY
MISSION: TO BE THE BEST SPORTS BRAND IN THE WORLD The adidas brand has a long history and deep-rooted connection with sport. Its broad and diverse sports portfolio, from major global sports such as football and running, to regional heartbeat sports such as American football and rugby, has enabled the brand to transcend cultures and become one of the most recognized and iconic global brands, on and off the field of play. The adidas brand's mission is to be the best sports brand in the world, by designing, building and selling the best sports products in the world, with the best service and experience, in a sustainable way.
Driven by a relentless pursuit of innovation as well as decades of accumulating sports science expertise, the adidas brand has developed a truly unique and comprehensive sports offering. Spanning footwear, apparel, equipment and services, the brand caters for all, from elite professional athletes and teams to any individual who wants to make sport part of their lives. We help athletes of all levels to make a difference ­ in their game, in their life, in their world. This is anchored in our core belief that, through sport, we have the power to change lives.
CONSUMER OBSESSION: CREATING FOR THE CREATORS The consumer is at the heart of everything the adidas brand does. By constantly developing desirable products and inspiring experiences, the brand strives to build a strong image, trust and loyalty with consumers. Through `Creating the New', the adidas brand has refined its strategic direction, operational processes and incentive systems, to foster a culture of consumer obsession across its entire organization.

---- Operating model: To ensure long-term success, it is important that we continue to challenge ourselves to learn and grow. We must constantly iterate to become faster and stronger. Therefore, the adidas brand's operating model is directed by the guiding principles of Brand Leadership. SEE GLOSSARY The aim of Brand Leadership is to provide an organizational structure which enables a `consumerobsessed' culture that can act with speed, agility and empowerment.
---- Creator archetype: Owing to the rapid evolution of sport and sports culture, the adidas brand targets key consumer groups and influencers to create brand desirability and momentum through a well-defined consumer segmentation strategy. The consumer grid comprises six key quadrants (Male Athlete, Female Athlete, Young Creator, Streetwear Hound, Amplifier, and Value Consumer), which are not mutually exclusive. Within this grid, it is key to win the most influential consumers, defined as the creator archetype. True to the brand's values, these influential consumers define themselves as a work in progress ­ are all doers and makers, first to adopt, focused on what's new and what's next. A large portion of creators live, play and work in the world's most influential and aspirational cities, a key reason for the company's Cities strategic choice.
---- Consumer centricity: Companies that put the consumer's voice as a centerpiece of their decision-making process have higher levels of success in creating brand advocacy. Therefore, we implemented a global Net Promoter Score (NPS) SEE GLOSSARY ecosystem in order to drive brand momentum in a measurable and objective manner. NPS has become an important part of the adidas brand's advocacy program. Through this program, we strive to understand consumers' perception (positive and negative) of the brand and the key drivers which motivate them to recommend the brand to their friends. SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, P. 92

PRODUCT FRANCHISES: CREATE THE MOST DESIRED SYMBOLS OF SPORT IN THE WORLD We are convinced that footwear has the highest influence on brand perception among product categories. Footwear is also the most powerful driver of NPS, which in turn translates directly into consumer purchase intent and our potential to grow market share. The adidas brand is relentlessly focused on innovation and newness in footwear, delivering cuttingedge technologies that help athletes make a difference in their game, life and world. Unparalleled access to athlete data and an archive that is unrivaled in the industry provide deep insights and ample opportunity to add chapters to the brand's rich heritage. At the same time, the brand has a clear strategy to reduce the number of footwear models, putting a stronger focus on key franchises that can really make a difference for the brand. These footwear franchises are managed carefully and long term with the aim of shaping sport and influencing culture. They are built to create trends, rather than follow. Through uncompromised function, iconic design and unique stories, they directly root from and are targeted at the athlete, and have the potential to be iterated and expanded over time. Their lifecycles are tightly managed, to ensure longevity and relevance. In addition, franchises are prioritized throughout the value chain, building on the company's strategic choices of Speed, Cities and Open Source. The adidas brand expects its top footwear franchises to represent at least 30% of the brand's footwear business by 2020. In 2019, this included, amongst others, the adidas UltraBoost 19, Continental 80, Predator, and Nite Jogger. On the apparel side, the brand continued to build out franchises on the success of the Tiro Pant, Z.N.E. Hoodie and, more recently, the MyShelter Jacket and VRCT Jacket.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

WOMEN'S: A NEW DIMENSION TO DRIVE GROWTH Winning the female consumer continues to be a key focus as it offers one of the largest business opportunities for the adidas brand, with the women's category leading the growth in the sportswear industry. In 2019, the adidas brand further invested resources in expanding a cross-functional women's organization and support infrastructure to set direction for creative, ranging, merchandising and marketing as well as to steer cross-category planning. When it comes to winning the female consumer, the brand has focused its initiatives across product, retail, and activation. Highlights from these initiatives include: ---- Product: adidas has been investing in key product
areas that are critical to winning the trust of the female consumer, including bras, tights and running footwear, as well as improving overall apparel fit for the female consumer. In 2019, the adidas brand introduced its first inclusive sizing collection that spans from sizes XXS-4X in partnership with Universal Standard. Additionally, adidas and Stella McCartney created a post-mastectomy sports bra designed to help women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer bring sport and fitness back into their lives. Two adidas by Stella McCartney proof-of-concepts were unveiled as the latest step in adidas' continued long-standing commitment to reducing the industry's environmental impact ­ a 100% recyclable hoodie and a tennis dress created with Microsilk and cellulose blended yarn. ---- Retail: adidas has taken steps toward enhanced merchandising and storytelling across the brand, building off female consumer shopping insights, to enable a seamless shopping experience for her to mix and match product. The brand has also rolled out a bra fitting program in adidas own-retail stores across the globe, covering our key cities and important commercial trade zones, with continued investment planned. In this context, we are

training our retail staff to help customers to find the right product. ---- Activation: One of the cornerstones of the adidas Women's approach continues to be the Creator Network: powered by sport, fueled by culture, and fostered by collaboration. The most notable addition to the Creator Network was the announcement of a landmark collaboration with Beyoncé as a brand ambassador and co-creator. Additionally, the brand expanded the Creator Network in 2019 by adding new athletes and influencers, including Mikaela Shiffrin, Jessamyn Stanley and Nadya Okamoto. The brand also continued the She Breaks Barriers initiative focused on removing barriers to sport for girls and elevating the conversation around equality in sport across genders.
MARKETING INVESTMENTS: MEAN MORE BY DOING LESS adidas is focused on creating inspirational and innovative marketing concepts that drive consumer advocacy and build brand equity. While the brand historically spent almost half of its marketing investments on partnership assets, with the remainder on brand marketing activities such as digital, advertising, point-of-sale and grassroots activations, we will decrease the ratio of marketing investments spent on promotion partnerships. SEE GLOSSARY In addition, the brand will consolidate and focus resources to achieve a great focus and impact on the Creator and the brand's key franchises. This will be achieved by focusing on three priorities: ---- Reason to believe: By harnessing the brand's creator
positioning, the emotion of sport, and the power of sport to change lives, the adidas brand will communicate a reason to believe in the brand, letting the world know what distinguishes adidas from the competition. ---- Reason to buy: The second priority is to harmonize and deliver globally consistent and impactful communication around the brand's key franchises that represent the best of adidas sport, style and innovation. By investing more

money against fewer items, the adidas brand will strive to elevate and maintain the iconic status of its key franchises, giving the consumer clear and compelling reasons to buy our product. ---- Sports communities: This is where loyalty is built and earned. The adidas brand defines sports communities as those places where athletes are fully immersed in their sport with peers and friends. It's the football cage, the run base or the street court. Until 2020, the brand will therefore step up its grassroots and local activation efforts, led by initiatives in the world's most influential cities.
In terms of partnership assets, while reducing the ratio of marketing spend and the number of partnerships, the adidas brand will nonetheless continue to bring its products to the biggest stages in the world through: ---- Events with global reach: such as the FIFA Women's World
Cup, the Rugby World Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and the Boston and Berlin Marathons. ---- High-profile teams: such as the national association football teams of Germany, Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Belgium and Japan, as well as top clubs such as Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, and Flamengo Rio de Janeiro in football, the New Zealand All Blacks in rugby, and American universities such as Miami, Arizona State and Texas A&M. In 2019, the brand celebrated its new partnership with one of the most globally recognized football clubs in the world: Arsenal Football Club. ---- High-profile individuals: such as football stars Lionel Messi, Toni Kroos, Mohamed Salah, Paul Pogba, Paulo Dybala, Son Heung-min, Vivianne Miedema and Wendie Renard, basketball stars James Harden, Candace Parker, Damian Lillard, Liz Cambage and Donovan Mitchell, American football players Aaron Rodgers, Patrick Mahomes and JuJu Smith-Schuster, baseball athletes Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa, as well as tennis stars

Garbiñe Muguruza, Angelique Kerber, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem as well as alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin.
In addition, the adidas brand also has a number of strategic partnerships and creative collaborations in place. The strategic partnership with Kanye West is the most significant one ever created between the adidas brand and a non-athlete, while the collaboration between adidas Originals and Pharrell Williams remains highly influential. Top designers and design studios the brand works with include Yohji Yamamoto, Stella McCartney, Raf Simons and Alexander Wang. In 2019, the adidas brand entered new partnerships with Beyoncé, Ninja, the International Space Station ISS and Prada.
SUSTAINABILITY The adidas brand is committed to sustainability and aspires to create lasting change in our industry through eco-innovation, eco-activation, and by scaling its actions to end plastic waste.
SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78
The brand's innovations aim to reduce the amount of virgin plastic added to the world and clean up the already existing plastic. As such, the adidas brand more than doubled the number of products made with recycled ocean plastic from seven million in 2018 to more than 14 million in 2019. The brand also created fully recyclable products such as the Futurecraft Loop performance footwear and the adidas by Stella McCartney Infinite Hoodie, in line with its ambition to move toward circular business models. SEE INNOVATION, P. 67 The adidas brand has a wide reach, and believes it is essential to drive eco-activation through its employees and with its consumers. The brand's global movement, Run For The Oceans, in its third year doubled in size, with around 2.2 million participants logging over twelve million kilometers for Parley Ocean Schools. In its direct-to-consumer business, the adidas brand installed dedicated spaces for sustainability, which are

best exemplified in its flagship stores and on adidas.com/ sustainability. In addition, the brand launched the Infinite Play program in the UK, to reward adidas Creators Club members for turning in their used adidas gear and helping give it a second life.
We continue to push our industry forward, both as a leader and alongside key partners who help us to become better. May it be as one of the founding signatories of the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action or through our open source partnerships with start-up incubators such as Fashion for Good and Station F. SEE INNOVATION, P. 67, SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78
ROLE OF CATEGORIES The adidas brand has assigned each category a role and ambition until 2020, allowing the brand to exploit short- and medium-term potential, while at the same time incubating long-term opportunities for the brand. There are three overarching roles: `Lead', `Grow', and `Authenticate'.
Lead ---- To lead in the sporting goods industry, we believe it is a
must to lead in the world's most popular sport, football. As such, the adidas brand aspires to be the number one football brand in every market by 2020. This will be driven by focusing on winning the football creator in key cities as well as investing in the brand's football footwear franchises. In 2019, the adidas brand implemented innovations across its football footwear business with the continued focus on the Predator, `X', Nemeziz and Copa franchises. Endorsement by a globally renowned portfolio of player partners and further amplification via a wider portfolio of partners, such as the FIFA Women's World Cup, ensured global reach and exceptional engagement from creators, especially during key consumption periods. In addition, 2019 marked the launch of the Arsenal Football Club partnership. Reinterpreting the brand's shared history

for today's creator, the club represents a key partnership within the key city London approach. ---- The adidas brand also strives for leadership in lifestyle in every market with Originals. Not only is adidas the original sports brand, it also was the first brand to bring sport to the street. Brand credibility and heritage is an important prerequisite to win the discerning streetwear hound consumer. These consumers are looking for substance and craft and are inspired by stories and design.  ---- The brand continued to actively manage the lifecycles of existing classic franchises such as Superstar and Stan Smith while also launching and incubating future icons like Ozweego and Supercourt to create a balanced portfolio with healthy sell-through rates and inventory levels across footwear and apparel. In 2019, the adidas brand continued to pioneer the future of fashion and streetwear culture by partnering with influential brands such as Beyoncé's Ivy Park, as well as Prada and Palace.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Grow ---- The running category has been one of the adidas brand's
biggest growth opportunities across all genders and price points. The brand's goal is to double sales in the category by 2020 compared to the 2015 financial year. The brand has introduced breakthrough innovations in materials such as BOOST, pioneered new manufacturing processes through Speedfactory, and significantly scaled up 3D printing together with its partner Carbon. To spur growth, amongst other things, adidas Running has significantly refined and evolved its franchise strategy for the male and female athlete across price points. The category will also continue to increase its investment in running communities and grassroots activations through the adidas Runners communities in over 100 cities around the world, as well as drive the future of sport through digital experience and the relaunch of the Runtastic app as the `adidas Running by Runtastic' app. It will also keep playing a major part in sustainability through the Run For the Oceans activation and the commitment to recycled polyester programs together with Parley. In 2019, the brand launched Futurecraft Loop, the first fully recyclable running shoe that was made to be remade. ---- The second category where the adidas brand is focused on driving significant market share gains is adidas Core. adidas Core targets a value-minded consumer, offering entry-price-point styles across all categories. To ensure success, the adidas Core formula employs a `fast fashion' business model. This means quick reaction to emerging trends through shorter lead times and excellence in retail execution. ---- The Training category is the adidas brand's largest performance category and is also the apparel engine of the brand. Led by cutting-edge innovation in fabrics and materials, the adidas brand aims to significantly increase its apparel footprint through Training, which provides products for general training purposes as well as for

specific sports, and through Athletics, which is geared to capturing the sports mindset of every athlete off the pitch. Given the high visibility of its products in all markets, this category plays a central role in amplifying the brand.
Authenticate ---- In order to be the best sports brand in the world, the
adidas brand also needs to be true to sports on a local level. As such, the brand will continue to cater to a wide range of sports such as golf, basketball, American football, baseball, rugby, tennis, volleyball, swimming and boxing. To maximize impact and resources, in key markets and cities, the adidas brand will prioritize those sports that are most significant in terms of local culture, participation and national pride.

REEBOK BRAND STRATEGY
MISSION: TO BE THE BEST FITNESS BRAND IN THE WORLD Reebok is an American-inspired global brand with a deep fitness heritage and the mission to be the best fitness brand in the world. To realize this mission, Reebok has gone through a transformation from traditional sports to a focus on the sport of fitness. On this journey, Reebok continues to merge its iconic past with the new technologies that revolutionize both performance and lifestyle products. Reebok is positioned at the intersection of fitness and fashion, meeting the consumer where they are, as the consumer continues to blur boundaries. Reebok established a `Sport' unit in 2018 that started its work in 2019. This Sport category combines product divisions focused on specialized fitness activities and functional innovation with a focus on style innovation for these products. These products are at the forefront of fitness and true to the culture and communities that Reebok consumers train, run, and live in. Reebok's second category, Classics, reinforces the brand's deep roots in fitness and pop culture across multiple iconic silhouettes and trend-right lifestyle products.
ONE VOICE, ONE BRAND TO THE CONSUMER In the fourth quarter of 2019, Reebok unified its brand under one logo and wordmark across both Classics and Sport. The vector and drop-R wordmark each represent Reebok unmistakably, connecting Reebok's rich legacy to its exciting future. The brand exudes pride in its rich brand heritage and the vector logo, introduced nearly 30 years ago. The logo remains the most recognizable and beloved symbol of the Reebok brand and is linked to some of Reebok's most iconic products, marketing and cultural moments. This evolution allows the brand to connect fitness, fashion and pop culture in one powerful Reebok voice across all products.

CONSUMER OBSESSION: THE GAME CHANGERS Reebok's consumer obsession focuses on being distinctive, relevant, and authentic with its focus consumers ­ the Game Changers. For the Game Changers, fitness is the vehicle they use to explore life's edges. The Game Changers don't shy away from the unexpected. They are constantly evolving and looking to try new things ­ across all facets of their world in fitness and in life. They are truly changing the game and seeking to broaden their horizons. Reebok inspires and equips them to do just that.
The female consumer is at the forefront of Reebok's consumer obsession. Rooted in Reebok's heritage, this female-centric approach is reflected in content strategy, product creation, marketing activation and distribution. In 2019 alone, Reebok introduced extended sizing in its apparel as well as its first maternity collection to connect with women.
PRODUCT FRANCHISES: LEVERAGING THE BRAND'S FITNESS DNA Reebok recognizes the importance of building strong apparel and footwear franchises, establishing innovative but repeatable product lines that become annuities for the brand and essential items for the consumer. This is not only crucial for enhancing consumer perception and brand consideration, but for the efficiency of the Reebok brand.
In footwear, Reebok is further growing its iconic models that have authenticated their position in fitness and in their respective communities, such as the Nano in the CrossFit community and the Forever Floatride Energy in running. In 2019, the new Nano 9 was co-created with the CrossFit community. In the running category, Reebok won its fourth consecutive Runner's World award, `Gear of the Year'. 2019 was also an exciting year for the Instapump Fury silhouette, as it celebrated its 25th anniversary with activations throughout the Asia-Pacific region and the release of the Fury

Boost, a collaboration with the adidas brand. In addition, Reebok leverages its unique fitness DNA through iconic styles such as the Classic Leather and the Club C.
In 2019, Reebok set out to integrate footwear and apparel, leveraging the brand DNA, blending fitness and lifestyle looks to create the new uniform of fitness for consumers. In addition to innovative performance products, such as the awardwinning PureMove Bra and the LuxTight 2.0, Reebok expanded the offering, creating apparel to support consumers at all stages of their fitness journey.
Reebok also puts a strong emphasis on innovation. The brand is committed to maintaining a full and innovative product pipeline, bringing new technologies, styles and processes to life. In this context, 2019 saw the launch of Zig, one-of-itskind footwear built with a distinct zig-zag-shaped midsole, which provides maximum energy return to the consumer. At the end of 2019, Reebok announced Forever Floatride Grow ­ the brand's first plant-based performance running shoe and latest example of sustainability innovation. The shoe is made with castor beans, algae, eucalyptus trees and natural rubber and thus builds on Reebok's Cotton + Corn lifestyle collection of footwear. SEE INNOVATION, P. 67

MARKETING INVESTMENTS: SPORT THE UNEXPECTED In the industry, Reebok finds its strength in being a challenger brand. Reebok has always separated from the pack with bold product, personalities and moments. Through the new unified branding, Reebok can reach its consumer with a brand presence that is consistent across the products and the stories it tells. The Reebok brand is focused on connecting with the consumer in an authentic and unique way, creating inspirational marketing capabilities that build brand equity and consumer advocacy, while unleashing powerful brand messages. Reebok has always done things differently, and by combining the Digital and Marketing divisions in 2019, Reebok has been able to create award-winning breakthroughs. ---- Sport the Unexpected campaign: Launched in 2019,
Reebok's `Sport the Unexpected' campaign is one of the most recognized marketing campaigns Reebok has executed in recent years. The campaign celebrates Reebok as a historically known challenger brand, one that has always done the unexpected. Reebok's short film `Storm the Court' showed just how Reebok's truly unexpected and witty nature can connect to consumers by winning 15 awards from Clio, Hatch (including a 2019 Best in Show Hatch Award), and a Cannes Lion. The campaign also featured one of the most high-profile personalities in the rap industry ­ Cardi B. In the short film `Nails', Reebok broke convention and put the star in an everyday-type situation that shifts in an unexpected manner, spotlighting the iconic Reebok Club C in a completely unique way. ---- Winning through digital: In 2019, Reebok sharpened its focus on the storytelling and product experience by completely re-designing reebok.com to resonate better with consumers. The tighter integration of marketing and digital drove some unexpected consumer moments ­ such as being the first brand to drop a new sneaker on Amazon Alexa or launching Reebok Unlocked, a first-of-its-kind membership program on reebok.com. Reebok is focused

on continuing to optimize the digital customer experience, driving commercial results and delivering unexpected stories for the consumer. ---- Authentic and influential fitness and fashion assets: To amplify the brand and increase its authentic connection with the Game Changer consumer, Reebok has partnered with some of the world's most influential validators in the lifestyle and fitness space: fashion partners such as fashion icon Victoria Beckham and up-and-coming designer Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss, artists such as female rapper Cardi B., and rapper and songwriter Future, and athletes such as American football pro bowler J.J. Watt and UFC superstar Conor McGregor. Partnering with powerful women such as Gal Gadot, Gigi Hadid and Nathalie Emmanuel rounds out Reebok's strong roster of brand ambassadors. In addition, to validate its authenticity as the best fitness brand in the world, Reebok continues its partnerships with some of the fastest-growing and most innovative organizations in the fitness world, such as CrossFit, Les Mills, and Midnight Runners. Reebok continues to invest in the Boston Track Club, a professional running club with elite runners. Finally, continuing to build relationships with fitness instructors remains a crucial component of Reebok's goal of connecting with the global fitness community. With over 220,000 fitness instructors currently being part of its global network, Reebok has made major progress toward its goal to be the brand of choice for instructors around the world.

MUSCLE UP: REEBOK TRANSFORMATION STRENGTHENS BRAND FUNDAMENTALS Reebok announced a turnaround plan called `Muscle Up' in 2016 aimed at accelerating Reebok's top-line growth, particularly in North America, and improving the brand's overall profitability. With efficient and effective distribution being key to Reebok's future success in the all-important North American market, the company has significantly reduced its store base in the market. The company has closed nearly 50% of its own stores in the US market ­ both concept stores and factory outlets ­ since the introduction of Muscle Up. In addition, the brand has also streamlined its wholesale business, putting a clear focus on elevating brand equity and driving profitable growth.
In addition to progressing on the brand's turnaround efforts in its home market, Reebok continues to execute on several transformational Muscle Up projects to enhance the profitability of the brand. Initiatives span marketing effectiveness, organizational efficiency and measures to improve product margins. Consequently, Reebok returned to profitability in 2018. In 2019, new initiatives were launched to further accelerate the transformation. They include rebranding and driving clarity with Reebok's consumer on the brand's positioning, shortening go-to-market timelines, strengthening go-to-market readiness, and building new platforms to drive e-commerce growth. In 2020, there will be enhanced focus on reducing complexity, increasing sales efficiency, and digital creation.
Through Muscle Up, Reebok will continue to drive relentless execution and discipline, build organizational capabilities, and accelerate the pace of change in order to drive sustainable profitable growth by the end of 2020.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
TRANSFORMING THE MARKETPLACE Our Global Sales function drives the commercial performance of the company by converting brand desire into profitable and sustainable business growth. It is our ambition to deliver the best shopping experience within the sporting goods industry across all consumer touchpoints. We strive to transform the marketplace by actively shaping and accelerating the growth of our profitable and integrated trade network. Our objective is to establish scalable business solutions in order to deliver premium experiences, thereby meeting and surpassing consumer expectations with an integrated brand offering.
DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ACROSS OUR GLOBAL MARKETS Our sales strategy is crafted by a centralized and integrated marketplace team which supports the flawless execution of our brand strategies and drives operational excellence across the globe. In this context, we continued to execute our strategic business plan, `Creating the New', across our six global markets during 2019. In a changing global landscape, our diverse market portfolio is an important asset in maximizing the business, elevating our competitiveness and achieving our ambitions for 2020.
SEAMLESS CONSUMER JOURNEY ACROSS OUR CHANNELS With more than 2,500 own-retail stores, more than 15,000 mono-branded franchise stores and more than 150,000 wholesale doors, we have an unrivaled network of consumer touchpoints within our industry. In addition, through our own e-commerce channel, our single biggest store available to consumers in over 40 countries, we are leveraging a consistent global framework.

We are also seeing considerable success in leveraging our strong cross-functional partnerships with key wholesale partners, which is critical for ensuring a holistic consumer journey. By seamlessly integrating the channels within our market portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to pursue and succeed in strategies that deliver premium consumer experiences and increase the productivity of our distribution footprint. We replicate this model to capitalize on new consumer opportunities through own-retail destinations (own-retail stores and own e-commerce sites) as well as our wholesale partner doors (wholesale managed spaces online and brick & mortar). This is how we aim to create halo effects across all consumer touchpoints, resulting in further marketplace expansion.
In 2019, we advanced our sales strategy with several initiatives focused, amongst others, on premium consumer experiences, digital, marketplace transformation, cities and trade zones as well as productivity and efficiency of the sales platform.
Premium consumer experiences We aim to be `omni-present' along the consumer journey and strive to capture the full sales potential on the platforms available to our consumers. We also strive to minimize occasions when consumer demand is not met, by offering innovative solutions. Based on these objectives, we continue to focus on the following omni-channel initiatives: ---- `Inventory Check' allows online shoppers to view in-store
product availability. ---- `Click & Collect' allows consumers to order online and
purchase or reserve items for pick-up in a local store. ---- `Ship from Store' allows us to service consumers faster than
before by turning our stores into mini distribution centers. ---- `Buy Online, Return to Store' not only provides consumers
with a convenient way to return product purchases but also offers new buying opportunities.

---- `Partner Program' enables us to expand our online offering to a larger group of consumers by making it available to selected key wholesale partners.
---- `Endless Aisle' provides in-store visitors with access to our full range of products through our e-commerce platform.
---- Our adidas app is an always-on connection to the adidas brand and offers premium shopping experiences.
Digital focus In 2019, we continued our focus on and investments into digital partners. As part of our Partner Program initiative that was launched in 2016, we successfully onboarded partners across Europe, North America, Emerging Markets and AsiaPacific, allowing us to deliver incremental sales growth and learnings that will be leveraged to evolve and further grow the program in the future.
In addition, 2019 saw a further expansion of the adidas app, currently reaching over 30 countries across all major markets, thereby becoming an important new consumer touchpoint in the adidas digital ecosystem. The app is directly linked to the adidas e-commerce store and provides consumers with personal conversations, the chance to buy our most exclusive products, a frictionless checkout, seamless order tracking as well as personalized content and access to our membership program ­ the Creators Club. SEE GLOSSARY The success of the app is significantly enhanced by continued investments in Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which will enable us to develop an even deeper consumer understanding and connection.
Furthermore, we drove forward development and roll-out of our B2B order platform Click to allow for impactful and efficient interaction with our wholesale customers. Click is now live in 41 countries. Latest feature additions include improved orderbook management, Net Promoter Score (NPS) SEE GLOSSARY measurement and digital customer service capabilities such as web chat to digitalize customer touchpoints.

Marketplace transformation Our goal is to leverage and scale the success of our initiatives across our channels to better serve consumers. The key contributor to this approach is controlled space. SEE GLOSSARY Whenever we can actively manage the way our brands and products are presented at the point of sale, the impact on the consumer experience, and ultimately on our operational and financial performance, is significant. We have the power to do so in own retail (including e-commerce) and in wholesale (franchise stores, wholesale managed space online and brick & mortar). By 2020, we aim to generate more than 60% of our revenues through controlled space.
For us, own retail acts as a catalyst to our controlled space ambition. We amplify our success by translating key learnings from own retail to franchise stores and expanding franchising as a business model in existing as well as into new geographies. In 2019, we made significant investments in remodeling our stores and sharpening the top of the pyramid of our store fleet. By doing so, we have strengthened our ownretail presence in key cities and key trade zones. We extended our flagship fleet by opening flagship stores on ChampsÉlysées in Paris and on London's Oxford Street, which is our most digital store with more than 100 digital touchpoints. We expect these flagships to set new standards in terms of product presentation, execution and service that will be replicated across all other channels. We expect e-commerce to continue to be the fastest-growing channel that we operate, with revenues targeted to grow to  4 billion in 2020. In wholesale, we will continue to expand our footprint with a focus on prioritized key accounts, targeting important consumer hotspots and trade zones, especially those that are part of our Cities initiative. Strategic partnerships to operate controlled space remain an important thrust of this expansion. In that regard, we will continue to support our key wholesale partners, ensuring that we have premium space in their new flagship stores.

Cities and trade zones In the last couple of years, we saw continued success in our key cities New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Shanghai and Tokyo. Our collective market share further improved year on year in our key cities during 2019. We are on track to achieve our target to double revenues in our key cities by 2020 compared to the 2015 level. We will continue to focus on trade zones within the cities, specifically on how we deploy product, retail and activation initiatives. Our intention is to create one holistic brand experience for our consumers within these key commercial areas across all shopping channels and platforms.
Productivity and efficiency of sales platform We are committed to further driving productivity improvements across our sales platform through a multi-faceted approach: ---- Premium presentation: Our physical selling spaces are an
important factor in driving Net Promoter Score (NPS) SEE GLOSSARY and full-price sell-through. We further evolved the brand experience through the launch and expansion of premium store concepts such as Stadium SEE GLOSSARY, Originals the Collection SEE GLOSSARY and Neighbourhood
SEE GLOSSARY for the adidas brand as well as FitHub SEE GLOSSARY and Vector Style SEE GLOSSARY for the Reebok brand. Our own-retail concepts are designed for scalability. Consequently, we will continue to roll them out across our store base, which yields benefits across channels. ---- Consumer service excellence: Our Sales Academy program continues to help us to transform the culture and effectiveness of our sales teams. As a result, consumers enjoy significantly elevated service levels which have proven commercially rewarding through higher conversion rates SEE GLOSSARY and net sales. ---- Personalized interaction: Our commitment to deliver a premium shopping experience is reflected online through our digital brand flagship stores, adidas.com and reebok.com, as well as our adidas app. E-commerce and

digital communication are powerful tools for our brands to engage with consumers. ---- Insight-driven decision-making: We continue to invest in our analytical capabilities and technical infrastructure to become faster and more insight-driven in decisionmaking. Leveraging data such as cross-channel product sell-through and consumer purchasing behaviors delivers actionable insights in areas such as assortment planning and product life cycle management. ---- Distribution channel mix: Based on a thorough analysis of the profitability of our distribution channels in each of our markets, in 2019 we continued with our optimization program to shift focus and resources to our most profitable channels. By doing so, we have improved the distribution mix of our company and consequently increased our profitability.
We are confident that our sales strategy will help us realize significant improvements in brand desirability (as measured by our NPS), market share, net sales, and profitability.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS
Global Operations manages the development, production planning, sourcing, and distribution of our company's products. The function strives to increase efficiency throughout the company's supply chain and ensures the highest standards in product quality, availability, and delivery. With the consumer in mind, we deliver competitively priced products in a sustainable manner, when and where they are wanted.
CLEARLY DEFINED PRIORITIES FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS Global Operations delivers upon our company's mission to be the best sports company in the world. First, the function creates the best products by establishing state-of-the-art infrastructure, processes, and systems that enable us to focus on innovative materials and manufacturing capabilities. Second, Global Operations is focused on delivering best services through innovative distribution capabilities by enabling product availability through the omni-channel approach to supply chain agility. Third, Global Operations strives to deliver the best experience to our customers and consumers in a sustainable way. SEE DIAGRAM 24
Best product: Global Operations is driving innovation in new materials, such as recycled polyester, Parley materials derived from ocean plastic, or PFC-free materials, as well as new product constructions, and new ways of manufacturing (e.g. 3D technology, or direct-to-textile digital printing SEE GLOSSARY) that deliver consumer value and enable competitive advantage. By investing in tools that more directly connect design and factory production, Global Operations is changing traditional models of development to deliver constant newness and increased speed-to-market capabilities. The function also plays a critical role in driving operational efficiency to support the company's growth ambition. To mitigate material and labor costs for the company, Global

Operations is continuously reducing complexity through process improvements and consolidation of legacy structures.

Best service: Global Operations strives to develop, produce,

source, and distribute ordered articles on time and in full.

Therefore, a non-financial KPI `On-Time In-Full' (OTIF)

measures on-time delivery of our products to wholesale and

OTIF 2019
79%

franchise customers as well as own-retail stores toward the desired customer date.
SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, P. 92 In 2019, adidas delivered 79% of its adidas

and Reebok brand products on time and in full (2018: 78%),

which is broadly in line with the overall target of 80%. In

Greater China and Russia/CIS, OTIF levels reached again

above 90% of our order quantities.

Best experience: Global Operations contributes to the adidas strategic business plan `Creating the New' to accomplish our mission. The function strengthens brand desire by creating and providing the right product to consumers ­ in the right quality, size, color and style in the right place and at the right time, across the entire range of the company's channels and brands. Global Operations builds capabilities that further improve supply chain efficiencies, while mitigating costs, thereby ensuring a continuously sustainable and competitive supply chain.

STRATEGIC COMPANY PRIORITY `SPEED' `Speed' is a strategic priority for the company. Our ambition is to be the first fast sports company in the sporting goods industry.We are consumer obsessed; thus, we want to respond quicker to consumer demand. We want to make our products available when and where they are wanted across our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels. Our aim is to always be on trend and always in stock. In 2019, we made further progress around our strategic priority with fast creation and fast replenishment, increasing the share of customer-defined short lead-time ranges, which allows fulfillment of an increasingly large share of quarterly business.
Fast creation: We are moving away from predominantly developing products in advance of seasonal merchandising calendars and are getting closer to responding quickly to consumer demands with in-season development and rapid replenishment manufacturing. We aim to ensure creation timelines of eight months or less. Bringing products to market faster allows our customers and direct-to-consumer channel to place orders closer to the actual time of sale, facilitating buying decisions that are based on better market knowledge.
Fast replenishment: To increase `Speed' also on production timelines, in 2019 Global Operations continued to expand its

efforts to enable later ordering and further reduced production lead times. The function succeeded in providing 60 days or less production lead times for the vast majority of our footwear, apparel and hardware products. In addition to shortening our overall production lead times, Global Operations has scaled its fast replenishment capabilities of best-selling articles and established 30-day production lead times for 20% of all articles across our product categories. Through this, we are enabling our brands to ensure constant freshness in store for our consumers, resulting in higherquality sales and more productive inventory. SEE CORPORATE
STRATEGY, P. 50
Speedfactory: Together with Oechsler AG, adidas had opened two Speedfactories SEE GLOSSARY in 2017 to test new processes for faster production of athletic footwear and to develop new manufacturing technologies with the ultimate goal to transfer them to the company's global supply chain. In the future, adidas will focus its resources and capacities even more on the modernization of its other suppliers and the use of 3D technology in footwear production. Production at the two Speedfactories in Ansbach, Germany, and Atlanta, USA, will be discontinued by April 2020. However, the Speedfactory technology will be deployed at Asian suppliers going forward. This will enable adidas to continue to respond to short-term trends in demand while using production capacities more flexibly and economically, and expanding the range of products with short production times faster. The company will continue to develop, improve and test manufacturing processes in the `adiLab' at the adidas production site in Scheinfeld, Germany.
SEE CORPORATE STRATEGY, P. 50, SEE INNOVATION, P. 67

DIGITALIZING THE END-TO-END CREATION-TOSHELF VALUE CHAIN In recent years Global Operations has focused on digitalizing the product creation process, leveraging digital capabilities and technologies across design and development teams. In 2019, we further expanded these efforts toward digitalizing the end-to-end creation-to-shelf value chain. Within a defined scope, the first two seasons of footwear and apparel products have been digitally designed, developed, sourced and sold into key accounts. End-to-end digital creation is a key strategic initiative of the digital pillar of our `Creating the New' Acceleration Plan.
We aim to scale up our new way of working with one of our business units by the end of 2020. With digitally created products we support a more efficient creation process internally enabling a `right first-time' approach. Externally, digital products will become more prominent in the interaction and communication with our partners, allowing us to make faster product iterations and take better decisions earlier in the process. This new way of working will enable a faster time-to-market and create a holistic and immersive digital sell-in experience for our key customers. Our ambition is to continue building the digital infrastructure for the future, gradually rolling out the new capabilities, broadening the involved supply base and working closer with our key customers during the product creation process.

operation working together with Parley for the Oceans ensures a steady and transparent supply chain. In 2019, we added the Philippines to the group of countries where we source ocean plastic to produce yarns. We also continued to expand sourcing from Small Island Developing States by onboarding the Dominican Republic. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78
AUTOMATION TO IMPROVE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY Driving the level of automation in our supply chain remains of overriding importance for Global Operations. In this context, automation technologies such as auto cutting, computerized stitching, robotic adhesive spray system, and auto-packing solutions are important focus areas, as they allow us to reduce our dependency on manual labor while ensuring consistent and highest quality standards. To further improve our production efficiency in all categories, we will continue to increase the level of automation in our supply chain in the years to come.
MAJORITY OF PRODUCTION THROUGH INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING PARTNERS To keep our production costs competitive, we outsource almost 100% of production to independent manufacturing partners. SEE GLOSSARY In 2019, we worked with 138 independent manufacturing partners (2018: 130) that were producing in 336 manufacturing facilities (2018: 289).

FUTURE OF MATERIAL SOURCING Global Operations constantly looks for the next generation of materials by focusing, amongst others, on knitted footwear, direct-to-textile digital printing, and sustainable materials. Building on our partnership with Parley for the Oceans SEE GLOSSARY, in 2019, we continued to roll out Parley Ocean Plastic
SEE GLOSSARY across our key categories. The demand for Parley Ocean Plastic and other sustainable materials continues to increase. Therefore, our dedicated sourcing

The majority (73%) of our independent manufacturing partners are located in Asia (2018: 71%).

OPTIMIZING DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK AND SUPPLY CHAIN ORGANIZATION By creating a higher specialization of our distribution center landscape focused on the specifics of our products across the various channels, Global Operations ensures higher flexibility at each consumer touchpoint. This, in turn, enables a broader range of products to be available at the point of sale, including online orders for pick-up in our own-retail stores. SEE SALES
AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, P. 61
In 2019, Global Operations focused on further optimizing its distribution center network, while at the same time preparing it for future consumer demand. In this context, we mainly focused on our distribution centers in the US. We built a new distribution center in Pennsylvania, and expanded our existing West Coast third-party facility, aimed at supporting our future growth expectations for North America, in particular around the company's e-commerce and own-retail businesses. Our new distribution center in Suzhou and the extension of our distribution center in Rieste have been successfully integrated. Our newly added e-commerce facility in the UK has been created to improve our consumer experience there and prepare us for Brexit scenarios.

INNOVATION
Creating innovative concepts to meet the needs of athletes and consumers is a prerequisite to strengthening our market position in the sporting goods industry and a premise to being the best sports company in the world. We therefore remain highly committed to maintaining a full and innovative concept pipeline, bringing new groundbreaking technologies and processes to life, investing into sustainable enablers and exploring the possibilities of digitalization across our entire value chain. True to the vision of creative collaboration, our innovation approach is widely based on our Open Source mindset.
MEETING THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CONSUMER The modern innovation landscape extends beyond product and increasingly requires innovation teams to consider the development of experiences and services, as well as the provision of greater levels of transparency and direct integration of our consumer through co-creation.
In partnership with our trend and cultural insights teams, foresight and trend analysis are shared on an ongoing basis, documenting shifts in society and culture. This provides the starting point to build concepts of relevance.
The FUTURE team at adidas is tasked to develop a strong portfolio of innovation capabilities such as new materials, production processes and consumer-centric scientific research to provide a platform for meaningful concept development. Projects are incubated within the company and aligned to the broader sourcing, marketing, creative and strategic functions across the organization, ensuring a robust and impactful innovation pipeline.

INNOVATION APPROACH BASED ON OPEN SOURCE MINDSET Our approach to innovation reflects our commitment to the Open Source mindset, where we seek to build value together with athletes and consumers, universities and innovative companies as well as national and international governments and research organizations. In addition to opening up our doors to valuable feedback, we also get inspired by the input from knowledgeable partners: ---- BASF: Together with BASF, we manage and enhance BOOST,
a cushioning technology designed to deliver maximum energy return, responsiveness and comfort to athletes. ---- Carbon: Together with Carbon, a Silicon Valley-based tech company, we are revolutionizing product creation through hardware, software and molecular science, and have enabled mass production of additively manufactured components, coming to life with adidas 4D. ---- Fashion for Good: Together with Fashion for Good, a global cross-brand initiative to make all fashion sustainable, we are accelerating sustainable innovation in the apparel industry through, among other things, mentorship of and collaboration with circular start-ups. ---- Oechsler: Together with Oechsler, an expert in high-tech automated manufacturing of technical components and assemblies, we operated our Speedfactories in Ansbach, Germany, and Atlanta, USA. However, in 2019 we decided to deploy the Speedfactory technology at Asian suppliers. Our collaboration with Oechsler will continue in other manufacturing areas. ---- Parley for the Oceans: Together with Parley for the Oceans, we are developing products partially created from upcycled plastic waste, intercepted before it reaches the ocean from beaches and coastal communities. ---- Platform A at Station F: In January 2019, we launched our global sports accelerator program Platform A. Station F is the biggest start-up campus in the world, based in our key city Paris, France. The accelerator aims to use the

innovative power of the global start-up scene to create the best digital innovations in sport. The first generation of start-ups started the program in January and presented their digital pilots in September 2019. In the meantime, adidas onboarded a second generation that will develop new concepts and identify opportunities in the areas of women empowerment, sustainability, retail and e-commerce.
FIVE PILLARS OF INNOVATION Within our innovation principles, we identified five strategic pillars which enable us to develop the best products and experiences for athletes and consumers, while at the same time drive game-changing innovations in the fields of manufacturing, digital and sustainability.
Athlete innovation Our clear focus is to produce the best and most innovative products for athletes to enable them to perform at their very best. To achieve this, we work closely together with athletes and teams as well as numerous universities and innovative companies, to deliver against the needs of our target consumer.
Manufacturing innovation To simplify manufacturing, enable product innovation and increase speed-to-market capabilities, the company's innovation activities are also focused on new manufacturing technologies. Our goal is to combine state-of-the-art information technology with new manufacturing processes and innovative products. For this reason, we commit ourselves to long-term cooperation with innovative companies and organizations to take a leading role in manufacturing innovation.
Digital and experience innovation The adidas brand was amongst the first in the industry to comprehensively bring data analytics to the athlete. With

decades of continuous investment in sports science, sensor technology and digital communication platforms, adidas has already taken a leading role in terms of changing the sporting goods industry through technology. With the increasing speed of digitalization, this field will remain one of our core areas.
Sustainability innovation Our commitment to manage our business in a responsible way has long been one of the company's principles. To stay at the forefront of sustainable innovation, adidas is pursuing a proactive approach to establish internationally recognized best practices and achieve scalable improvements. As part of our sustainability roadmap, we have set ourselves the target for 2020 to invest in materials, processes and innovative machinery which will allow us to upcycle materials into products and reduce waste. In 2019, we further focused on taking responsibility for the entire product life cycle and established a clear game plan for moving toward a circular business model. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78
Female athlete innovation Our long-term commitment to the female athlete continues to be a focus for the company. To fuel the growth of our women's business, we have taken a holistic approach to understanding the female athlete's performance and non-performance needs throughout her active life. We therefore look at this target group as an integrated part of our business but from a separate and unique angle. With a focus on the female consumer, it is crucial to fully understand the specific product needs of the female athlete to help unlock her full potential. To enable this, we are working to establish a robust network of industry leaders and academic experts with our `Path to Expert' approach, which will help to accelerate the building of insights and foresights that keep us at the forefront of product innovation.

COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIONS We believe developing industry-leading technologies and consumer experiences is only one aspect of being an innovation leader. Equally important is the successful commercialization of those innovative concepts: ---- Parley Ocean Plastic: Products made of Parley Ocean Plastic
SEE GLOSSARY  focus both on the needs of our athletes, by living up to their performance promise, and on the needs of the world, by helping to protect our oceans from marine plastic pollution. We have taken sustainability to the product level and continue to roll it out across our product portfolio. In 2019, we made more than eleven million pairs of shoes containing Parley Ocean Plastic, across various footwear franchises in both Sport Performance and Sport Inspired. In addition, nearly three million pieces of our 2019 apparel offering featured Parley Ocean Plastic, including jerseys for high-profile teams such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus Turin and Manchester United. ---- Futurecraft Loop: Futurecraft Loop is our first 100% recyclable performance shoe made entirely from one material (TPU), using no glue or solvent. The first generation of the shoe was rolled out in April 2019 as part of a global beta program with consumers from across the world's major cities. They were asked to test and return the shoes to start the recycling process. In November 2019, we introduced the second generation of Futurecraft Loop. We will take the learnings from the recycling process to further develop the concept and to prepare for the commercial release in 2021. Futurecraft Loop was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the `Best Inventions 2019'. ---- adidas 4D: The high-performance footwear produced under the adidas 4D concept features midsoles crafted with light and oxygen using Digital Light Synthesis, a unique technology developed by Carbon. The midsole pioneers a digital footwear component creation process that eliminates the necessity of traditional prototyping or molding. With the new technology, adidas brings additive manufacturing

in the sports industry into a new dimension. After having produced more than 100,000 pairs of this high-performance footwear in 2018, we continued to increase volumes in 2019 and intend to further expand production in the future. In the past two years, adidas 4D has gone from a conceptual innovation to a running shoe that has been made available in larger quantities and multiple variations. ---- Creators Club: This new digitally enabled membership program rewards loyal consumers with invitations to exclusive events and access to limited-edition products. In addition, it enhances the e-commerce shopping experience for members through an even faster checkout process and new order-tracking options. The program allows us to deepen the relationship with our consumers and to gain valuable insights into their expectations and needs. Creators Club SEE GLOSSARY launched in the US toward the end of 2018, and is now live in France, Germany, Japan, the UK and Singapore. ---- adidas by Stella McCartney Infinite Hoodie and Biofabric Tennis Dress: With the adidas by Stella McCartney Infinite Hoodie, we presented the first commercially produced 100% recyclable performance garment made of 60% NuCycl lyocell and 40% organic cotton, which are completely recyclable fabrics. We have also already taken the first steps toward exploring solutions to create products that are made with nature, and can, at some point, also return to nature. The adidas by Stella McCartney Biofabric Tennis Dress is a prototype concept made with a cellulose blended yarn and certified Microsilk, a protein-based yarn that is made of completely renewable inputs, which has the ability to fully biodegrade at the end of its life. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78, SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55 ---- Forever Floatride Grow: At the end of 2019, Reebok announced Forever Floatride Grow ­ the brand's first plantbased performance running shoe and latest example of sustainability innovation. The shoe is made with castor beans, algae, eucalyptus trees and natural rubber and

thus builds on Reebok's successful Cotton + Corn lifestyle collection of footwear. ---- Infinite Play: Building on learnings from take-back pilots in Brazil, Canada, and some of our key cities in Europe and the US, adidas is exploring infrastructure for product bring-back and recycling, with partners, governments and regulatory bodies. 2019 saw the launch of `Infinite Play' in the UK to extend the useful life of products by passing them on to new users, thus avoiding waste. The initiative engages consumers in returning used items by rewarding them with gift cards and Creators Club points. ---- AM4 Series: The `adidas made for' (AM4) products were created at the adidas Speedfactory facilities in Ansbach and Atlanta. In 2019, we continued to deliver launches jointly with creators supporting moments that matter for our consumers, e.g. limited editions around the Marvel universe and for Bayern Munich. The concept was included into the adidas offerings to Footlocker and exclusive launches with our Creators Club. Going forward, Speedfactory technologies will be used at two of our suppliers in Asia that will allow for more variations of Speedfactory footwear models in the future.

NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES GENERATE THE MAJORITY OF SALES As in prior years, the majority of sales were generated with products newly introduced in the course of 2019. New products tend to have a higher gross margin compared to products which have been in the market for more than one season.
In 2019, brand adidas and Reebok sales were again driven by the latest product offerings. At brand adidas, products launched during the course of the year accounted for 77% of brand sales (2018: 74%), while only 3% of sales were generated with products introduced three or more years ago (2018: 3%). At Reebok, 67% of footwear sales were generated by products launched in 2019 (2018: 67%), while 11% of footwear product sales relate to products introduced three or more years ago (2018: 11%).

R&D EXPENSES DECREASE 1%

PEOPLE AND CULTURE
At adidas, we believe that our people are the key to the company's success. Their performance, well-being and knowledge have a significant impact on brand desire, consumer satisfaction and, ultimately, our financial performance. Through the delivery of our People Strategy, we focus our efforts on four fundamentals: the attraction and retention of the right talents, role model leadership, diversity and inclusion, as well as the creation of a unique corporate culture.
PEOPLE STRATEGY ENABLES A CULTURE FOR DELIVERING `CREATING THE NEW'
As an integral part of our corporate strategy `Creating the New', the People Strategy is a testament to thinking that our strategic business plan can only be executed if we speak to our people on all levels and win both their hearts and minds. The People Strategy consists of four pillars that serve as a

basis for creating the culture and environment for our people in order to successfully support `Creating the New'. SEE DIAGRAM 34 These four pillars also serve as a tool for prioritization, sense-checking and measuring our HR actions and initiatives. The People Strategy is implemented through a portfolio of projects which will directly deliver into each of the four pillars. In 2019, we made good progress in all of these pillars.
ATTRACTION AND RETENTION OF TALENTS Our `employer of choice' status continues to garner
worldwide recognition and helps us to attract, retain and engage industry-leading talent to sustain the company's success and growth. In 2019, adidas locations around the world leveraged our employer value proposition for attraction, retention and engagement strategies. Amongst professionals, this work contributed to several top rankings worldwide, including the Glassdoor `Best places to work' awarded for 2019, the LinkedIn `Top companies to work for' as well as

various Universum `World's most attractive employers' rankings among business and IT students worldwide. adidas offices across Europe, Asia and the Emerging Markets qualified for the certification by Top Employer Institute for their efforts to provide an exceptional work environment for our people. Among others, the certification recognized the company's Learning and Development framework, which encourages different kinds of learning and the career management model.
We offer a range of programs at entry level to ensure future employees can have the best possible start, choose between a wide variety of learning opportunities, build on their strengths and improve their professional skills: ---- Apprenticeship and Dual Study Program: The adidas
Apprenticeship Program offers young pupils who want to join our company directly out of school the opportunity to gain business experience in a two- to three-year rotation program. It includes vocational training in retail, shoe technology, IT or other areas. In cooperation with various universities, the Dual Study Program for young school graduates offers theoretical and practical experience at adidas in fields such as digital commerce, finance or IT including at least one three- to six-month international rotation. At the end of 2019, we employed 50 apprentices in Germany (2018: 55) and 49 Dual Study Program students (2018: 45). ---- Global Trainee Program: The Functional, Digital and Design Trainee Program is an 18- to 24-month program providing graduates with an international background and excellent educational credentials the opportunity to start a functional career within adidas. The program comprises assignments in various functional and cross-functional departments. At least one of these assignments takes place abroad. At year-end 2019, we employed 67 participants in our Global Trainee Program (2018: 61).

---- Internships: Our global internship program offers students three to six months of work experience within adidas. In line with our ambition to optimize the experience for interns, we enhanced the overall recruiting process and added interactive collaborative exercises such as hackathons to the program in order to further enrich the cross-company experience. Consequently, we offered fewer but more focused internships in 2019, employing 216 interns in Germany (2018: 447).
ROLE MODEL LEADERSHIP The quality of current and future talent and leadership is key
to our success. We want to inspire and nurture role model leadership. With specifically designed talent management tools, we identify talents at all levels of our company who have the potential to become future leaders or key players within the organization. In order to prepare them for more complex future roles, they have tailored individual development plans and participate in targeted development programs. In 2019, we made further progress with this People Strategy pillar.
Leadership and development groups We now have four active groups of selected leaders and talents within the company: ---- The Core Leadership Group (CLG) is the most senior group,
made up of around 20 members from our senior leadership population. Members of this group jointly represent critical positions and roles across our company worldwide. This group partners with the Executive Board in leading the execution of the `Creating the New' strategy, accelerating its delivery across functions, as well as developing and inspiring the next generation of leaders. The CLG also serves as the succession pool for the Executive Board. ---- The Extended Leadership Group (ELG) has around 120 members. The ELG collaborates across markets and functions to lead the execution of the strategic initiatives that form the `Creating the New' portfolio and drives

continuous improvement and consistency across the organization. The ELG also mentors and sponsors the Global High Potential Group and serves as a succession pool for the CLG. ---- The Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) is composed of around 50 members and was formed in 2018 with a balanced gender split. It enables us to identify and develop high potentials who have the ability to take on more complex, demanding and higher-level responsibilities at a global senior management level. In 2019, the first GHIPO generation finished their 18-month development experience, with nearly three quarters having made positive career movements through either a promotion to the next level (more than 50%) or through lateral, cross-cultural or cross-functional moves. In 2019, we also launched the second generation of GHIPO with around 40 members and a balanced gender split, and have seen more than 40% already moving into new roles at the end of the year. ---- The Local High Potential Group (LHIPO) was formed in 2019 and enables us to identify and develop high potentials who have the ability to take on more complex, demanding and higher-level responsibilities at a local senior management level in our regions. The program is designed to build peer relationships and to give participants crossfunctional and cross-cultural exposure, amongst others through immersion in a different country and function. The diverse group consists of around 130 leaders of 32 different nationalities with an almost balanced gender split.
Together with the Executive Board, we hold two physicalpresence CLG and ELG events per year to ensure these groups interact and align on the execution of `Creating the New' as well as our People Strategy. The GHIPO group meets up to three times per year for an on-site learning experience in our key markets and the LHIPO group meets regionally once per year. Throughout the year, all groups remain in touch via

virtual experiences, meetings, calls and cross-cultural immersions. SEE CORPORATE STRATEGY, P. 50
Leadership Framework and leadership development experiences To drive clarity and accountability, leaders at adidas were engaged to further activate our global Leadership Framework
SEE GLOSSARY in 2019. The Leadership Framework is based on the three company behaviors creativity, collaboration and confidence (the `3Cs' SEE GLOSSARY) and articulates the particular behaviors that are expected of leaders at adidas. The framework was developed jointly with employees worldwide who provided feedback on what great leadership within adidas looks like to them. It provides a global and universal language that is inclusive, reduces the need for local interpretations, and outlines concrete behaviors that serve as a measure of leadership effectiveness. It is built into the way we hire and promote as well as rate performance. The framework was first activated and cascaded to employees globally through the CLG and ELG groups.
We offer a portfolio of leadership development programs for corporate office employees for various grades and levels: ---- Executive Development Experience: We are partnering
with Harvard Business School in delivering a tailored learning experience for our most senior population. In 2019, the CLG and ELG attended the in-residence Executive Development Experience at Harvard Business School. ---- Director Development Experience (DDE): In 2019, we introduced the Director Development Experience which is based on the Leadership Framework at its core and allows a customizable learning experience for our middle management level employees. DDE is currently offered in 16 of our locations and we will continue to expand the offer. Since its launch, almost all places offered were taken up. ---- Manager Development Experience (MDE): The Manager Development Experience supports the leadership skills and abilities of our lower management level employees.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

like the DDE, MDE is designed to provide a customizable learning experience that uses the Leadership Framework as its foundation and drives the development of personal and team mastery. We currently offer MDE at almost 40 locations worldwide and also recorded for this program that almost all offered places were taken up. ---- Talent Carousel: Our internal career development program Talent Carousel has entered its fifth and final year, with the third generation graduating in 2019. The program encouraged employees from all over the world to apply to take a cross-functional and international career step by starting a new role in a new location. The learnings from Talent Carousel helped design and launch LHIPO and now enable us to scale the experience toward a larger audience.
Succession management Our succession management approach aims to ensure stability and certainty in business continuity through the development of strong internal pipelines for our critical leadership positions. We achieve this through a globally consistent succession process that identifies these important leadership positions within the organization, and matches identified top talent as successors for these roles. Furthermore, we ensure that succession planning translates into realizable development plans to prepare successors for their next steps. The leadership groups we have established serve as succession pools for the highest levels of our organization.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION We believe it is crucial for the success of our company to
have a diverse workforce comprised of individuals with different ideas, strengths, interests and backgrounds. We see a great benefit in the diversity of our employees, as this helps us to better fulfill the wishes and multi-faceted demands of our consumers around the world and provides a higherperforming workplace. We strive to create an environment where all our employees are heard and appreciated ­ regardless of gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, world view, different abilities, age, sexual orientation or identity.
As part of our global diversity approach, we proactively pursue a portfolio of internal and external activities that welcome diversity and champion inclusion. Throughout the company we continue to support and grow our Employee Resource Groups (ERG) ­ these are specific networks that give employees from various walks of life a voice, including networks for women, LGBTQ+, experienced generations, and North American people of color. Our global women's network in Germany counts almost 900 active participants, supported by 14 mentoring circles to foster the professional development of junior colleagues. In North America, we doubled the number of ERGs to ensure they represent the diversity of our employees and our consumer base. In 2019, we focused on education about different cultures and heritages by, among others, celebrating Black History Month, Lunar New Year, International Women's Day, Pride, Hispanic Heritage Month and Diwali internally across North America. In Europe, we activated on key moments in our main offices to raise awareness on the topics of female leadership, the LGBTQ+ community, and mental health. Globally, we aimed to ensure that our leadership development programs are a fair representation of employees in terms of gender, race, and nations.

To inspire action outside of our company, we are active members in both `Charta der Vielfalt' (`Diversity Charter') and the Diversity and Inclusion in Asia Network (DIAN), that allow us to promote communication and the sharing of best practices and insights.
Diversity and inclusion training Our gender intelligence training follows a holistic concept for the topic of diversity and inclusion. It upskills our employees on the importance of diversity and on the value of inclusion. By the end of 2019, a total of more than 4,300 employees across all markets participated in this training and were challenged to re-visit and think critically about their thoughts and beliefs around diversity, stereotyping, bias in the workplace, inclusion and belonging. In Europe, senior leadership teams started to participate in 2019 and will seek to further roll out the training within their areas of expertise. The extended roll-out of the gender intelligence training is a result of both the commitment of our leadership teams to creating an inclusive and diverse workplace as well as our effort to increase the number of internal trainers. In addition, we created a virtual version of the training to also reach employees in retail, distribution centers and remote locations, that was piloted in North America in 2019 and will be extended to all other regions in 2020.
Mixed leadership teams We believe in mixed leadership teams as a competitive advantage and driver of success. A prerequisite for increasing the number of women at the highest levels of management is the general promotion of women within the company worldwide at all levels of management. We have various initiatives in place, e.g. with members of the Executive Board agreeing to mentor female talents as well as an equal gender split in our Global and Local High Potential programs to guarantee that our succession pipeline is balanced.

CULTURE It is our goal to develop a culture that cherishes creativity,
collaboration and confidence as well as high performance, the behaviors we deem crucial to the successful delivery of our corporate strategy. In fact, our culture and people serve as the foundation and a key enabler of the `Creating the New' strategy.

Activating our Core Belief Responding to an increasing desire of employees, consumers and partners to become directly involved in activating our core belief `through sport, we have the power to change lives', and their asking for ways they can make a difference, we focus our activation efforts on three pillars: `She Breaks Barriers', which is aimed at getting girls to join and stay in sport, `One Starting Line', which is aimed at increasing inclusivity for all in sport and sports culture, and `End Plastic Waste, which is aimed at protecting the world's oceans for future generations.
SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55 To maximize impact, we leverage

brand moments to raise awareness for these topics and create opportunities for engagement. In 2019, these included opportunities for our employees to volunteer their time and expertise, and we collaborated with our athlete ambassadors at moments such as the Women's World Cup, the Super Bowl, as well as key cultural moments such as Earth Day, International Day of the Girl, Black History Month and Pride.
For the Women's World Cup, partnering with the NGO Equal Playing Field, adidas organized multiple football camps around the world and brought together over 3,500 women and girls from all across the globe to play football, share skills and make connections at the Festival of Football in Lyon, France. In partnership with Amazon, we sponsored Girls on the Run races with a distance of five kilometers and enabled 600 girls to have access who would otherwise not have been able to participate. Additional money raised will equip coaches to make program adaptations to better serve and include girls with disabilities. We also launched @3stripelive, which was the first-ever livestreamed high school girls' soccer and volleyball games on Twitter with over 14.5 million livestream views. This was done in partnership with the US Soccer Foundation and United for Girls, with the objective to double the number of girls who have access to soccer. Working with Up2Us Sports, we developed the digital coaching curriculum `Keep Girls in Sport' to educate coaches on the specific training needs of young girls, aiming at removing the potential barriers they face. In Germany, adidas partnered with the network Impact Hub to host a series of initiatives to enable the next generation of female athletes, creators and leaders. Twelve venture teams were given access to peer networking, adidas mentors and business clinics on business strategy, finance and digital marketing with adidas experts over a period of three months. Three selected ventures can earn a monetary grant to scale their ideas further.

Work-life integration We aim to harmonize the commercial interests of the company with the professional, private and family needs of our employees. Our Work-Life Integration initiatives and programs include the provision of flexible working times and place, people development and leadership competence related to work-life integration, as well as family-oriented services: ---- Childcare: In addition to providing flexible working
opportunities such as teleworking and sabbaticals, we cater for a family-friendly environment and infrastructure. At our headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, we extended the number of parent-child offices from two to four, and expanded our childcare facility `World of Kids'. It now provides space for 270 children in two buildings. In 2019, we also introduced an ad-hoc childcare service to support parents in emergency situations or during transition phases and short-term assignments. At various locations across the globe, adidas offers a variety of holiday camps for children, with more than 450 participants benefiting in 2019. Other global locations also offer various forms of benefits and support services to ensure that our employees are able to access and secure quality childcare. With the ongoing expansion of our infrastructure and childcare offering, we as a company emphasize our commitment to a family-friendly environment to integrate work and private life ­ and enable balanced careers. ---- Parental leave: For parental leave and re-entry, programs are in place to provide employees with advice early on and options for their return to work, also taking into consideration flexible working hours and work locations. In Germany, we guarantee our employees on parental leave their positions, which are only filled temporarily. In the US, in addition to regular parental leave for new parents (up to 10 weeks at home, 70% of their salary), adidas offers an extra two weeks' paid parental leave for parents. Furthermore, adidas' special parental bonding leave provides parents with the possibility to stay home

for up to six months within the first twelve months after the child's birth or placement. While unpaid, it offers parents the opportunity to stay home longer and take care of their new arrival and new life together. Latin America has made significant amendments to improve work-life integration across the market. This includes an extended parental leave approach where mothers will be provided 24 paid weeks in total to spend with their children, and fathers/partners will be provided 20 paid days in total. On top, mothers are allowed to work fewer hours one month before and after their maternity leave period. ---- Flexible work: Continuing in Germany in 2019, every employee with an adidas AG contract whose working tasks can be carried out independently of campus facilities, campus equipment or personal interaction on-site is eligible to work 20% of their total working time off-campus. This policy and agreement is based on our belief that results can be achieved in the same quality and quantity, regardless of people's location. Positive feedback motivated us to roll out the approach globally. Our North America market implemented the concept in 2018, Latin America and partly Europe followed in 2019, to be continued in 2020. ---- Expansion of workplaces: In line with the efforts to centralize all local employees at the headquarters campus `World of Sports' in Herzogenaurach, in 2019 we opened a new main office building called `Arena'. It has capacity for around 2,000 employees and applies an activitybased working concept in which employees no longer have assigned desks and instead choose from a variety of rooms and spaces, dependent on their needs. To make work-life balance as easy as possible for our employees on campus, we offer, in addition to two childcare facilities, other services such as dry-cleaning, grocery delivery and the possibility to receive private deliveries. In Asia, we moved our new Asia-Pacific and Greater China Head Office to the IFC tower in downtown Shanghai offering easy access to commercial facilities. It combines a comfortable and

green working environment with an agile and convenient working experience, including a staff canteen, gym, showrooms as well as collaborative open areas. Lastly, we are also centralizing most of our workforce in Portland in one location. The ongoing expansion of adidas enables capacity for 2,800 employees with the build-out of two office buildings that include parking garages, an expansion of the on-site employee restaurant, and further extended employee services. With this expansion, we are also rolling out the activity-based working concept already in place at most of our local headquarter locations worldwide.
Health management We support our employees by aiming to provide the best possible conditions to ensure that they feel good and stay healthy. Our holistic approach includes people's physical, mental and social well-being, and focuses on four pillars: mindset, nutrition, movement and medical services. In 2019, for example, we pursued global activations around World Mental Health Day in October, including information campaigns, prominent speakers who shared their personal story, an open dialogue with senior leaders as well as exercises for stress relief. We also saw great progress in providing employees access to sports facilities. Employees in Herzogenaurach, Portland, Boston, Moscow, Gurgaon and Manchester, and at other locations across the globe, have access to a corporate gym. In 2019, construction work started to extend the gym at our German headquarters, and with its completion in 2020 it will offer significantly more space and training opportunities for more than 3,000 members as well as integrate physiotherapy with extended offerings. Lockers and showers in office buildings allow people to run or cycle to work. In 2019, adidas UK received Britain's Healthiest Company Award in the category medium-sized company.

Learning We believe a continuous focus on learning and development of our employees is a key enabler of driving a high-performance culture. To support this, we offer employees access to a wide range of in-person and digital opportunities. Our Learning Management System is now globally available to almost half of all employees, 75% of whom have accessed available training and development offers to support their current performance and future career development. In 2019, compared to 2018, we saw a more than 20% increase in the number of employees who participated in in-person learning activities. Within our online platform, we provide two digital offerings to all corporate employees: LinkedIn Learning and Leadership Library, a service which curates and summarizes industry articles, media and university courses based on company or learner needs. These offerings continue to provide employees access to content across subjects in business, creative and technology areas. In 2019, an average of more than 1,900 content pieces were consumed monthly within the Leadership Library, while the number of employees registering for LinkedIn Learning accounts more than doubled.
In 2019, we expanded our global core learning programs to ensure we continue to support strategic business initiatives, build capabilities connected to our 3Cs and support development of future cross-functional organizational capabilities. Input into the program offer is managed through a business needs assessment supported by our HR organization.
Performance management #MYBEST is the global performance development approach in adidas and is a key enabler of a high-performance culture. The four elements encourage regular high-quality conversations between the employee and the line manager, provide a framework for regular upward and peer feedback exchange, and ensure goals are set and reviewed quarterly. Formal performance evaluation takes place twice a year1,

1 Employees in Germany continue to have four evaluations based on the current company agreement.

development being in the focus of every monthly `Touch Base' conversation. The voice of employees is critical in the evolution of #MYBEST. The global #MYBEST survey is run on an annual basis and is a key source of information when making decisions regarding improvements. In 2019, we made several improvements, including the simplification of quality and actionable peer and upward feedback, the reduction of performance evaluations from 4 to 21 to bring more simplicity and efficiency into the process as well as the clarification of various levels of performances, providing further clarity to all employees to identify their area of strength and development. The definitions also ensure that employee performance is evaluated consistently across the organization.
Wages, benefits and incentives We are committed to rewarding our employees with compensation, benefit and incentive programs that are competitive in the marketplace and are aligned with our performance culture. Remuneration throughout the company comprises fixed and variable monetary compensation, nonmonetary rewards as well as other intangible benefits. The cornerstone of our rewards program is our Global Salary Management System which is used as a basis for establishing and evaluating the value of employees' positions and salaries in a market-driven and performance-oriented way.
The various variable compensation and benefits components we offer our employees include: -- Bonus program ­ Short Term Incentive (STI) program -- Profit participation program ­ `Champions Bonus' (Germany) -- Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan for senior management -- 401-K Retirement Plan (USA) and adidas Pension Plan
(Germany) -- adidas Stock Purchase Plan

We are continuously improving our remuneration approach and are therefore investing in a number of projects and initiatives to increase the significance of our remuneration programs, as well as to ensure we are investing in the right people at the right level. One of the improvements we made was an overhaul of our benefits offer in Germany and the US throughout the last three years, which is designed to minimize salary differences and, more importantly, inequity of employees on the same positions and grades. It is based on a higher level of detail for external market data and addresses internal pay gaps ­ also helping to ensure that we pay fairly at the same level for female and male employees. Furthermore, we developed a monitoring approach to identify potential pay gaps and work continuously to improve and close these gaps on a country-by-country basis. To further enhance our efforts and transparency on this topic we support initiatives such as `Lean In' and will also in 2020 put a strong emphasis on continuously closing potential gaps. The latest internal report regarding the Equal Pay Gap shows an overall balanced picture on pay between female and male employees, based on a weighted average calculation between the salary grade levels.
In addition, we further improved transparency and governance for senior management remuneration, and created higher transparency about remuneration as well as internal and external positioning of compensation and benefits packages. The aim was to ensure objective decision-making for management remuneration, and to continue standardizing our pay structures. We rolled out a global Long-Term Incentive Plan for senior management. This program provides Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), linked to our earnings per share (EPS) targets and to our share price performance. It closely links the goals of our senior management with those of our shareholders ­ sustainable success and long-term growth ­ and fosters a company ownership mentality. In 2019, we were able to complete the roll-out of the LTI Plan to the director level globally. SEE NOTE 28, P. 176

Our subsidiaries also grant a variety of benefits to employees, depending upon locally defined practices and country-specific regulations and norms.
Stock Purchase Plan Participation in the Stock Purchase Plan is provided to employees in Germany, the US, the Netherlands and Greater China (China mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong), offering almost half of our employees globally (excluding retail) the possibility to participate. On average, around 5,000 employees participated in the program in 2019 (2018: 4,800).
MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF OUR PEOPLE STRATEGY
Our HR function measures the success and the effectiveness of the company's efforts with regard to its people initiatives through a set of chosen KPIs. We use two people KPIs: employee experience as an internal measure and employer rankings as an external measure.
Employee engagement We have set ourselves the goal of becoming the best sports company in the world by becoming a truly consumer-centric organization and putting our people at the heart of everything we do. When it comes to measuring whether we are living up to these ambitions, our consumers and people are the best data sources. We are convinced that our employees' feedback will play a crucial role in our pursuit of creating a desirable employee experience and continuing to attract and retain top talent. We can only tell if we are successful by asking our people and hence empower them to share their feedback on a regular basis. In support of this thinking, we launched `People Pulse' ­ our approach and system platform for measuring the level of employee satisfaction with the experience adidas provides as an employer ­ for all office employees with an email account.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

People Pulse allows for the measurement of employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, P. 92 The calculation logic of the eNPS score is identical with brand NPS: Based on the main question `On a scale of 0­10, how likely are you to recommend adidas as a place to work?', the total share of detractors (responses below 7) is deducted from the total share of promoters (responses scoring 9 and 10), producing the eNPS score. This approach as well as a focus on collecting open-comment feedback from employees on a regular basis allowed the reduction of the questionnaire to a short pulse check of seven questions maximum, with the eNPS question at the center.
The People Pulse cadence is made up of two components: ---- The eNPS question, which is asked in every survey to allow
for tracking of the results over time. ---- Changing focus topics which are directly derived from the
company's strategic agenda as well as the Leadership Framework and the 3Cs.
In 2019, we saw the quarterly People Pulse continue to be leveraged as an important feedback channel from corporate employees to the company. In March, we reached similar levels to the all-time high response rate of the previous year, with 67% of employees responding. On average, our eNPS remained stable in 2019 compared to the previous year. Reports with detailed results and scores were provided to the Executive Board and leaders down to Board ­4 level. Employees have access to the overall company results via our global intranet. Result recipients continued to review, cascade and openly discuss the results and drive action on identified areas of improvement.

We not only leverage People Pulse for general feedback on the employee experience at adidas, but also as a tool to gather employee insights regarding important elements of our strategy, such as consumer obsession.
HR FOUNDATIONS FOR OUR PEOPLE STRATEGY In 2019, we continued to roll out a new HR cloud-based
system platform that aims to further enhance the HR system landscape by driving standardization, digitization and automation of currently potentially time-consuming processes across all HR areas. We are convinced that this will allow the HR function to pro-actively manage the workforce, improve the employee experience, and enable the entire organization to make more data-driven decisions.
After successful consolidation of our HR Shared Services in 2019 into a cross-functional global business service, Global Business Services (GBS), operation centers are currently set up in Porto, Dalian and Portland. All employee queries related to topics of an administrative nature, such as compensation, benefits, time management and HR systems, are centrally channeled and managed through GBS. As a result, our HR Partners are enabled to fully focus on their core business, supporting line managers and employees on strategic topics such as career counseling, people management and coaching.

SUSTAINABILITY
Being a sustainable business is about striking the balance between shareholder expectations and the needs and concerns of our employees and consumers, the workers in our supply chain and the environment. We believe that acting as a responsible company will contribute to lasting economic success.
OUR APPROACH
Our commitment to sustainable practices rests on the company's mission: To be the best sports company in the world. Best means that we design, build and sell the best sports products in the world, with the best service and experience and in a sustainable way. We have a clear roadmap for 2020 and beyond, which is a direct outcome of our strategic business plan `Creating the New'. We believe that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. But sport needs a space to exist. These spaces are increasingly endangered due to man-made issues, including human rights violations, pollution, growing energy consumption and waste. Our holistic approach to sustainability responds to the challenges that endanger the spaces of sport and simultaneously our planet and people. Building on existing programs, it tackles these subjects that are most material to our business and our stakeholders, and translates our overall sustainability efforts into tangible goals for 2020 and beyond that have a direct impact on the world of sport we operate in.  ADIDAS-GROUP.
COM/SUSTAINABILITY
MATERIAL TOPICS We seek to ensure that we address the topics that are most salient to our business, our stakeholders as well as the challenges ahead. To identify these topics, we openly engage with our stakeholders and consider their views and opinions

in decisions that shape our day-to-day-operations. In addition, we regularly conduct formal materiality exercises to confirm the selection of our material topics. We use insights gained from past assessments, categorize potential new topics and seek to validate these through in-depth discussions with experts across the entire business. Ultimately, we want to better understand the importance a topic has for our business performance and stakeholders but also gain more visibility about the impact we have on these topics. As a result of this ongoing exercise, employee diversity has emerged as an addition to this list of topics. SEE NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT, P. 90 We also make use of external frameworks to help support the selection of material topics. One of these frameworks is the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which represent a global call for action to promote prosperity for all while protecting the planet. Although our current roadmap and underlying targets were implemented prior to the adoption of the SDGs, we see a clear correlation between the SDGs and our own commitment to sustainable development. Consequently, we have been able to link prioritized SDGs with both the environmental priorities related to the selection of materials, manufacturing, use and disposal of our products, and the needs and concerns of people in the adidas value chain.
CORRELATION BETWEEN UN SDGS AND OUR SUSTAINABILITY ROADMAP

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE AND TRANSPARENCY Engaging openly with stakeholders and establishing ways to increase transparency and disclosure has long been central to our approach. Our stakeholders are those people or organizations who affect or are affected by our operations, including our employees, consumers, suppliers and their workers, customers, investors, media, governments and NGOs. The adidas Stakeholder Relations Guideline specifies key principles for the development of stakeholder relations and details the different forms of stakeholder engagement. Through active participation in, for example, the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) working group, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), the Leather Working Group (LWG) and the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) Working Group, we work closely with leading companies from a variety of sectors to develop sustainable business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a global level. This is also supported by our active membership in organizations such as the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC), the Fair Labor Association (FLA), the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety and the German government-led Partnership on Sustainable Textiles (`Textilbündnis') as well as our assistance for the newly established RMG Sustainable Council (RSC). In addition, we build awareness, capacity and knowledge of laws and rights among factory management and workers by partnering with leading providers such as the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Better Factories program in Cambodia. As an active participant in the Bali Process Government and Business Forum we have formally endorsed our commitment to the `Acknowledge, Act, Advance' recommendations, that outline actions to advance long-term efforts to improve supply chain transparency, the treatment of workers, and ethical recruitment.

In this spirit of collaboration, we also established a Hackathon series together with our partner Zalando back in 2018. Motivated by the ambition to better understand stakeholders' expectations about supply chain transparency and find solutions using digital technologies, we support start-ups with our expertise so they can develop ideas and test their potential for scalability. In 2019 alone, we held three events supporting more than 30 ventures.
We believe transparent communication to our stakeholders is critical. For that reason, we regularly disclose important sustainability updates about our work throughout the year on our corporate channels including our corporate website. A key element is the publication of our global supplier factory lists. The lists are updated twice a year and complemented by lists of the factories that manufacture products for major sports events such as the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games. In addition, we disclose the names of factories of suppliers who process materials for our primary suppliers or subcontractors, where the majority of wet processes SEE GLOSSARY are carried out.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE A robust governance structure ensures timely and direct execution of programs that drive achievement of our voluntarily set goals for 2020 and beyond. The Head of Sustainability is responsible for the development, coordination and execution of our sustainability strategy and reports to the member of the Executive Board responsible for Global Operations. He will also lead the sustainability Sponsor Board that is composed of senior representatives from Global Operations (GOPS), Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA), Global Brands, and other relevant functions across the company. The Sponsor Board ensures cross-functional alignment, transparent end-to-end management and execution

of agreed sustainability goals within their functions. This includes the review and sign-off of policies as required.
EXTERNAL RECOGNITION adidas continuously receives positive recognition from international institutions, rating agencies, NGOs and socially responsible investment analysts for its sustainability initiatives. In 2019, the company was again represented in a variety of high-profile sustainability indices and subject to comprehensive corporate sustainability assessments. SEE
OUR SHARE, P. 46
For the 20th consecutive time, adidas was selected to join the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) in 2019, and was assessed to be among the global top 10% best-performing companies in its industry in economic, environmental and social criteria. In the annual assessment of the Carbon Disclosure Project, adidas was again awarded with a B score for its Climate Change approach (2018: B), and improved to a B score for its approach to water management (2018: B-). The company managed to improve its rating considerably in the annual Green Supply Chain Corporate Information Transparency Index (CITI), advancing from tenth to second place in 2019 in the textile industry. adidas further maintained its leadership position in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) evaluation in 2019, coming in first overall across all industries assessed, and was placed in the Leader category in the first Children's Rights Benchmark conducted by the Global Child Forum in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group.  ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/RECOGNITION

OUR PROGRESS
Following its ambition to be transparent toward stakeholders, for years, adidas has regularly reported about its sustainability performance by measuring and disclosing the progress made toward its targets. The following presents the list of material topics within our programs and details the progress made and challenges faced in 2019.
PRODUCT SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY Product safety is an imperative. As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products that may result in injury to consumers or impair our image. To mitigate this risk, we have company-wide product safety policies in place that ensure we consistently apply physical and chemical product safety and conformity standards. ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/
PRODUCT-SAFETY
One of these policies is the Restricted Substances Policy (`A01' Policy) that we pioneered in 1998. It covers the strictest applicable local requirements and includes best-practice standards as recommended by consumer organizations. The policy is updated and published internally and externally at least once a year based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with scientific organizations, and it is mandatory for all business partners. To ensure successful application of the policy across the business, we have established a Product Safety and Compliance workspace that serves as a platform for all employees involved in product creation by providing them with the necessary information and guidance to develop, produce and distribute products according to international regulations and best-practice standards. Both our own quality laboratories and external institutes are used to constantly monitor material samples for compliance with our requirements. Materials that do not meet our standards and specifications are rejected. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we did not record any product recalls in 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Over the last years, we have substantially contributed to the AFIRM Restricted Substances List that harmonizes Restricted Substances Lists across the industry. In 2019, the list was further developed to include a corresponding test matrix that will help to establish the list as the globally accepted standard in our industry. We also continued our participation in several major public stakeholder consultation processes initiated by the European Commission (e.g. European Chemicals Agency) and US state legislative initiatives to inform governmental entities on implications and opportunities of drafted legislation. 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS Managing the environmental impacts at our own sites and
along the value chain is a key focus of our work. We have developed an approach to address water efficiency and quality and are committed to steadily increasing the use of more sustainable materials in our production, products and stores while driving toward circular business solutions. We are committed to reducing our absolute energy consumption and CO2 emissions, transitioning to clean energy and looking into energy-harvesting opportunities.
Based on results from a pilot assessment of our environmental impacts along our value chain, we recently focused our attention on creating an internal tool to calculate our organizational footprint along the entire value chain and simulate reduction options on a more regular basis, using as much primary data as possible and breaking down results. We aim to use the results of this impact valuation tool for steering business decisions, tracking performance over the years and further driving integration of sustainability into the business.
Measuring and optimally managing our environmental footprint in our own operations and across our supply chain is only one way to respond to climate change. In addition, we are proactively addressing the impacts of climate change by

supporting global initiatives that aim to drive change for our industry. adidas reiterated its commitment to mitigating Reduction of CO2 climate change by signing the Fashion Pact emissions by 2030 presented at the G7 Summit in 2019. In the
30% prior year, the company signed the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action and committed to reducing emissions in its supply chain by 30% by 2030 (baseline 2017), thus paving the way for climate neutrality by 2050. SEE TABLE 39 Back in 2015, adidas joined the UN Climate Neutral Now initiative and committed to the continued estimation and reduction of its emissions.
Own operations Back in 2008, adidas introduced a program called `Green Company' to drive continuous improvement and savings in water, waste and energy at its own sites globally. The program covers administrative offices, production facilities and distribution centers, equaling more than 90% of our global

employee base (excluding own retail) in 2019. In 2015, we presented targets to be achieved by 2020, including targets for carbon emissions reduction that were calculated considering a science-based methodology and context-based targets for water reduction.
One essential driver to achieve these targets is the implementation of environmental standards at our highestconsuming locations. adidas has successfully applied an Integrated Management System (IMS) which helps us to gain certification for key locations for their environmental management (ISO 14001), energy management (ISO 50001), as well as health and safety management (ISO 45001). Building on a group-wide IMS policy, adidas aims to further expand these certifications to key sites every year, through both external and internal audits. By the end of 2019, 37 sites globally held ISO 14001 certification, and 30 locations were recognized with ISO 45001 certification. After implementing IMS across key corporate locations in Europe, North America,

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Asia-Pacific and Latin America, we will focus on Russia/CIS and the Emerging Markets in 2020.
In 2019, we achieved an accumulated reduction of more than half of all emissions (52%) compared to 2015 in combined carbon net emissions. SEE TABLE 40 Alongside energy efficiency initiatives, carbon offsetting for key locations and the implementation of a company-wide energy monitoring system, we equipped facilities with photovoltaic panels, including our biggest distribution center in Rieste and the new corporate office building at our German headquarters. This resulted in the production of green electricity that accounts for around 5% of the electricity usage of the distribution center, and for around 13% of the electricity usage of our German headquarters. Overall, we will continue to drive renewable energy projects at key sites over the next years. It is our ambition to continuously add more of our own retail stores to the scope of Green Company. We closely collaborated with our facilities to continue to drive water efficiency initiatives and raise employee awareness for the importance of their contribution. As a result, we achieved accumulated water savings of 37% per employee between 2008 and 2019.
SEE TABLE 40
The progress toward all Green Company targets is tracked through an environmental data reporting system and is disclosed in detail in our annual Green Company Report that will be available on our corporate website as of April 2020.
ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/ENVIRONMENTAL-APPROACH
Supply chain As almost all of our production is outsourced, a significant part of our environmental impact occurs, at different intensities, throughout the supply chain. Therefore, for adidas, sourcing is not only about ensuring high product quality and timely delivery, it also means working with our suppliers to ensure they are able to continuously reduce their

environmental footprint. We do so by providing them with policies and best-practice guidance for environmental management, by offering training sessions tailored to their needs, and by measuring their progress toward clear reduction targets for energy, water and waste that we expect them to achieve by 2020.
In 2019, adidas strengthened its environmental supply chain program through ongoing efforts to advance suppliers' capacity for managing resource efficiency. After the release of the Environmental Good Practice Guideline and Toolkit in 2018, we updated and issued our Environmental Guidelines in 2019 for all strategic suppliers, along with an efficiency calculator so they can better understand their environmental impacts. We continued to support the Energy and Water Investment Plan and, by the end of 2019, we had mobilized more than 40 strategic suppliers located in five of our main sourcing locations (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan) who successfully identified more than 400 saving opportunities that will be implemented with projected annual savings estimated at 350 million MJ of energy and four million m3 of water.
We also support our suppliers to gradually increase the generation and use of renewable energy in our supply chain

and help connect our suppliers with experienced solar companies so they can jointly work toward the development and implementation of projects. As of 2019, more than 20% of our strategic suppliers are already also adopting renewable energy, including rooftop solar photovoltaic and biomass. As an example, two of our major suppliers in Vietnam initiated rooftop solar projects with the potential for huge estimated savings of almost one million kg CO2e annually.
We co-hosted a supplier training event with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and VITAS (Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association) for more than 180 participants, among them suppliers, in Vietnam. The aim was to upskill suppliers on the commitment to reduce our carbon footprint by 30% by 2030 in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN FCCC), how it relates to supplier production facilities, clean energy opportunities in Vietnam, incentives and financing options. As a result of our collective efforts, suppliers have already met most of the efficiency targets across all categories (footwear, apparel, and accessories and gear) ahead of time.
SEE TABLE 41 A tool called `E-KPI' helps us to measure suppliers' environmental compliance overall and assess their performance and progress toward the 2020 targets. We will

continue to support suppliers to identify resource efficiency measures and roll-out in our supply chain.
An additional way we try to minimize our suppliers' environmental impacts at their manufacturing plants is by helping them establish sound environmental management systems. The majority of our footwear sourcing volume, 98% (2018: 98%), is produced in factories which are certified in accordance with the International Environmental Standards ISO 14001 and/or the Workplace Health and Safety Management Standards OHSAS 18001.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are typically found in solvents used in our manufacturing process, can ­ in high concentration ­ cause breathing difficulties and other health problems for production workers. By applying innovative as well as environmentally sound bonding and priming technologies while following the adidas guidelines on the use of chemicals, our athletic footwear suppliers have been able to significantly reduce the use of VOCs, from above 100 grams per pair in 1999 to around 11 grams in 2019. The share of VOC emissions has now remained stable at a very low level for the past three years.
Chemical management The management of chemicals in multi-tiered supply chains is a complex challenge and requires many actors contributing to the achievement of effective and sustainable solutions. For years, adidas has been running leadership programs in chemical management within its area of direct influence. In consultation with external stakeholders including chemical experts, environmental organizations and industry federations, adidas has defined an end-to-end-approach spanning the management of chemical input, monitoring supplier progress and reporting supplier data publicly to controlling the finished end product.ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/
CHEMICAL-FOOTPRINT

We further improved our chemical input management, recording 81% of auxiliaries and 91% of dyestuffs from our strategic apparel suppliers as bluesign-approved in 2019. We also continued to be 99% free of poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFCs) in our products for the fall/winter 2020 season. We contributed to the latest update of the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and made it part of the welcome kits with guidelines for our suppliers. As we believe that strengthening the monitoring approach in our supply chain will further contribute to the elimination of hazardous chemicals from the production process, we also contributed to the latest update of the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, an international wastewater standard for our industry. Using these guidelines, our strategic suppliers accounting for more than 80% of the wet processes have tested and publicly reported their wastewater test results twice a year since 2018. According to the latest results, the majority of our facilities meet the local legislation or the requirements of the wastewater treatment plant.
Transportation We regularly track the environmental impact related to the transport of our goods. Compared to the previous year, performance remained relatively stable. The vast majority takes place via sea freight. In 2019, we recorded a slight increase in air freight due to the mitigation of the supply chain shortages.  SEE DIAGRAM 42

SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES We are committed to steadily increasing the use of more sustainable materials in our production, products and stores. We push toward sustainable innovation and continue to drive toward closed-loop recycling systems.
Synthetic fibers are widely used in our industry due to their unique performance properties such as elasticity, light weight, and high durability. We are aware that products made out of synthetic fibers can cause negative environmental impact during their use phase and acknowledge microfiber pollution as a complex challenge for our industry ­ one we are proactively addressing. We have established a crossfunctional working group and closely collaborate with our suppliers and research institutes to raise awareness for the issue and drive joint solutions toward a global testing

Sustainable cotton

adidas has steadily increased the sourcing of cotton according

to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) throughout the last years

and already managed to source 100% sustainable cotton SEE

GLOSSARY by the end of 2018. Also in 2019, we continued to

source all cotton globally as sustainable cotton. The BCI aims

Sustainable cotton sourced to reduce the use of pesticides,

100%

promotes efficient water use, crop rotation and fair working conditions, and strives to transform cotton

production worldwide by developing Better Cotton as a

sustainable mainstream commodity.

Recycled polyester

Using more recycled polyester is yet another way we seek to

improve our environmental footprint while still making high-

performance products for the athlete. Polyester is the most

single-used material in adidas products and, by 2024, we aim

Share of recycled polyester
50%

to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all products where a solution exists. We set clear internal milestones for product creation teams and have seen great progress throughout the last

seasons. In 2019, 50% of all polyester used for our apparel

and footwear ranges was already recycled polyester. Moreover,

almost two thirds of the polyester used for our apparel range

for the spring/summer season 2020 was recycled polyester.

Parley Ocean Plastic

Since 2015, adidas has partnered up with Parley for the Oceans

SEE GLOSSARY, and uses Parley Ocean Plastic SEE GLOSSARY as

an eco-innovative replacement for virgin plastic. We continued

to roll out Parley Ocean Plastic across key categories and

Shoes containing Parley Ocean Plastic
11> m

were able to exceed our target for 2019, with more than eleven million pairs of shoes and almost three million pieces of apparel made containing Parley Ocean Plastic. To facilitate the growing demand

for Parley Ocean Plastic and other sustainable materials, we

have built a dedicated sourcing operation with the aim to

ensure a steady and transparent supply chain. We expanded

our sourcing countries for ocean plastic and developed a code

of conduct specific to the collection and processing of plastic

that is now applied by our partners. In 2019, our focus was to

further expand the audit scope to lower tiers of the plastic

supply chain. In addition, we used our expertise to upskill

Parley for the Oceans to optimize their own policies and

procedures. SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55, SEE GLOBAL

SUSTAINABILITY-INNOVATION

Waste and packaging We are committed to reducing our plastic footprint globally and are proud of the success we have seen in recent years, such as the phase-out of plastic bags in our own retail stores globally in 2016 and the elimination of single-use plastics across the majority of adidas locations worldwide as of 2018. Where the use of plastics ­ for example in transport packaging ­ is still unavoidable, adidas is relying on counterbalancing measures and promoting sustainable alternatives. For example, in 2018, the company supported the global innovation platform Fashion for Good with a donation of  1.5 million which also enables us to explore innovative recycling processes for polybags as well as the development of infrastructure for used polybags. In addition, the company aims to reduce virgin

plastic, with the goal to transition to the use of 100% recycled LDPE polybags SEE GLOSSARY by 2021.
Circular business solutions adidas takes responsibility for the entire life cycle of a product and follows a clear game plan for moving toward a circular business model. Throughout 2019, we successfully showcased proof-of-concept products against circular and regenerative loops by presenting our first fully recyclable and biodegradable products. Futurecraft Loop is our first 100% recyclable performance shoe made entirely from one material (TPU), using no glue or solvent. Other prototype concepts include the adidas by Stella McCartney Infinite Hoodie and the adidas by Stella McCartney Biofabric Tennis Dress. In addition, adidas is exploring infrastructure for product bring-back and recycling, with partners and governmental bodies.

END-OF-LIFE
APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS adidas recognizes its responsibility to respect human rights
and the importance of managing the appropriate due diligence to fulfill this obligation as a business. We do this by striving to operate responsibly along the entire value chain, by safeguarding the rights of our own employees and those of the workers who manufacture our products through our Workplace Standards, and by applying our influence to affect change wherever human rights issues are linked to our business activities. Since its inception in 1997, our human and labor rights program for our supply chain has been built on the back of intense stakeholder outreach and engagement, seeking to understand and define the most salient issues to address as a company.
Throughout 2019, we engaged with a broad spectrum of human and labor rights advocacy groups, working collaboratively with the FLA and calling on the Cambodian

government to address ongoing human rights topics, which ultimately triggered a review of the EU's trade preferences for the country. Together with other stakeholders, we have maintained a seat on FIFA's Independent Advisor Board on Human Rights, providing input and recommendations to FIFA on the hosting of the 2022 Qatar World Cup. We undertook investigations to address allegations of forced labor in the cotton supply chain in Xinjiang in Northwest China and have been working diligently, in partnership with other brands and the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), to strengthen BCI's performance standard for forced labor. Finally, we have continued to support UNICEF in its effort to develop a practical tool for integrating child rights into a responsible sourcing framework and published our own approach to incorporating children's rights across our business operations.
ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/HUMAN-RIGHTS
As part of its human rights efforts, back in 2016, adidas developed a modern slavery outreach program that particularly looks beyond strategic suppliers at a Tier 1 level to gain greater transparency in its supply chain. A set of policies, including a Modern Slavery Policy, a Responsible Recruitment Policy and a Responsible Sourcing and Purchasing Policy, drive our practices in this area. In 2019, we continued to address modern slavery risks at those suppliers that fall outside of our mainstream auditing activities and added Tier 2 suppliers in the United Kingdom, a country previously deemed low risk, to our audit coverage. We further supported multi-stakeholder initiatives aimed at uncovering potential threats in raw material sourcing, e.g. in cotton sourcing in Turkey or rubber sourcing in Vietnam. adidas has become a signatory to the American Apparel Footwear Association and FLA pledge on responsible recruitment and is testing current practices in high-risk migrant corridors, working closely with suppliers in receiving countries and

recruitment agencies in sending countries. In 2019, adidas communicated its zero recruitment fee directive to all business partners globally. Lastly, our due-diligence efforts have expanded to include risk assessment training programs for our licensees.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN Core to the human rights approach of adidas is its commitment to ensuring fair labor practices, fair compensation and safe working conditions in factories throughout its global supply chain. Our active efforts are guided by the adidas Workplace Standards, our supply chain code of conduct. The standards form a contractual obligation under the manufacturing agreements adidas signs with its main business partners to ensure workers' health and safety and environmentally sound factory operations by following International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations (UN) conventions relating to human rights and employment practices, as well as the model code of conduct of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI). Specific reference to the code provisions of the ILO conventions is provided in the adidas Guidelines on Employment Standards. The Sourcing and Social & Environmental Affairs (SEA) senior management reviews and approves all policies and implementation processes of the labor rights program.
adidas regularly rates factories on their ability to provide fair, healthy and environmentally sound workplace conditions by means of conducting announced and unannounced audits through adidas personnel or an approved external auditor. We use a KPI rating system for social compliance (C-KPI) and attach scores between 1 and 5, with one being the worst and five being the best. According to the results, our sourcing and SEA teams jointly decide the course of action, ranging from the definition of training needs or other improvements at the

factories to enforcement mechanisms such as sending warning letters or even termination of contracts.
Any cases of non-compliance identified during audits are given a certain time frame for remediation. Potential new factories are assessed in a similar way and orders can only be placed if approval by the SEA team has been granted. adidas operates several grievance channels allowing workers or third parties to submit complaints about violations of the Workplace Standards or human rights generally. All complaints are reviewed and investigated, and the outcome is reported on our corporate website. Factory conditions are also inspected by independent auditors through our participation in the Fair Labor Association, which we joined as a founding member in 1999, demonstrating our commitment to independent and unannounced factory inspections and external verification of our programs.
At the end of 2019, adidas worked with 631 independent factories1 (2018: 684) that manufacture products for our company in 52 countries (2018: 51). The decrease is due to our overall ambition to further consolidate our supply chain (mostly in Japan in 2019). Our intention is to work with fewer factories and provide them with more orders. 69% of our suppliers' factories are located in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of licensees we worked with remained relatively stable compared to 2018, with 62 licensees that manufactured products in 372 factories across 38 countries.
Onboarding In 2019, we conducted initial assessments (IA), the first approval stage for new entry into our supply chain, in 189 factories (2018: 221), a decrease of 14% compared to 2018, mainly due to our decision to grow in existing factories rather than onboarding new ones. 49 factories (2018: 55 factories)

1 Independent supplier facilities refer to individual Tier 1 facilities (factories) of our manufacturing partners (suppliers) that adidas has a manufacturing agreement with, and their Tier 1 subcontractor facilities, excluding own factories and licensee facilities. Facilities that work with our licensees are reported separately. Some of these facilities may produce both for adidas directly and for licensees.

were either rejected directly after the initial assessment identified zero-tolerance issues, or were `rejected with a second visit' due to identification of one or more threshold issues, which means they were rejected but given the chance to remediate the non-compliance issues within a specific timeframe. SEE TABLE 43 The vast majority (84%) of all initial assessments were undertaken in Asia (2018: 90%), with China accounting for 38% of these assessments (2018: 41%).

Factory visits and training sessions During 2019, 426 factory visits (2018: 546) were undertaken. This represents a decrease of 22%, due in part to a reduction in the intake of new factories into the supply chain, which led to a decline in the number of fundamental or introductory training sessions. There was also a reduction in the number of advisory visits to individual factories, with a preference given to group learning through adidas hosted workshops. In total, we conducted 123 training sessions and workshops for suppliers, licensees, workers and adidas employees (2018: 143), reaching a total of 1,697 people (2018: 1,282). SEE

Overall, at the end of 2019, the `first-time rejection rate' of 34% of all new factories visited was slightly higher than in the previous year (2018: 30%), as was the `final rejection rate', which increased to 4% in 2019. The latter was due to the rigor applied to the initial assessments. The remediation of factory issues is beneficial for workers as it raises the bar in terms of better and timelier pay, improved benefits, reduced hours, and the legal protection of formal employment contracts, and it results in significant improvements in basic health and safety within the workplace. Suppliers who have threshold issues are normally given three months to remediate those issues before being re-audited for final acceptance.

Worker empowerment In parallel to our existing grievance systems such as anonymous local language-based worker hotlines, we implemented additional digital tools that enable workers to ask questions and raise concerns directly with their employers. Following the successful piloting of an `SMS Worker Hotline' back in 2012, we have progressively improved the operational grievance mechanisms at our factories into an application-based `Workers Voice' platform that was available and used at 98% of our strategic factories across eleven countries by the end of 2019. SEE TABLE 45 The top three types of complaints in 2019 were related to the categories of benefits, general facilities and communication. Responses received through this platform are carefully tracked and help us understand the main challenges and worker rights issues in the factories, ultimately allowing us to monitor how the factory management teams find solutions and communicate back to their workers.

Complementing the various grievance channels, we measure the level of worker satisfaction through annual in-factory surveys. The survey results are shared with auditors and the factory management and offer insights into worker concerns, as well as potential areas for workplace improvement. Throughout 2019, we expanded this exercise, completing follow-up surveys but also adding newly onboarded factories

to the scope. Upon completing the survey, factories are required to develop improvement plans for the top three issues and then track progress regularly. Since the start of these surveys in 2016, we have engaged and secured feedback from around 35,000 workers. In 2019, more than 8,500 workers in more than 50 factories across twelve countries participated in these surveys.
Alongside factory-led training, adidas has also offered tailored training for supervisors since 2016. Up until the end of 2019, more than 2,200 supervisors completed such training. In 2019 alone, more than 1,300 supervisors in almost 70 factories across six countries participated. Throughout 2019, we expanded the activities to also strengthen the ability of female supervisors to pass on their knowledge to their peers in dedicated sessions. We initiated a Women Supervisor Forum, a platform for female supervisors to upgrade their knowledge, learn best practices, get exposure to inspiring guest speakers and also gain support, information and guidance on a range of topics to improve their ability as a female supervisor. This forum has been established in Indonesia and Vietnam and will be rolled out to the remainder of countries in scope from 2020 onward. As part of our wider efforts to empower female workers in our supply chain, we initiated a Women's Empowerment Program in Pakistan to train women on how to secure better career opportunities in the workplace. Since its start in 2015, the program has benefited more than 420 on-job women and women workers who were laid off from jobs in the football manufacturing sector. Results were very positive, showing that the program helped redundant women to succeed in getting new jobs, and it supported women on the job to secure on-job promotions by improving their professional performance.

Monitoring We audit our suppliers regularly against our Workplace Standards. In 2019, a total of 1,191 social compliance audits and environmental assessments (2018: 1,207) were conducted. This included 234 test assessments according to the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines (2018: 233) as part of our environmental assessments. SEE TABLE 46 As in 2018, 102 self-governance audits and collaboration audits were conducted in 2019. When a factory reaches a compliance maturity level of 4C and above, we empower the supplier to conduct their own self-governance audits and develop appropriate remediation plans, which we periodically review. Collaboration audits are conducted in partnership with other brands, or as part of joint remediation exercises. The number of audits in factories manufacturing goods for licensees decreased slightly from 323 in 2018 to 317 in 2019, in line with the overall reduction in the number of licensee factories.
The number of audits using in-house technical staff decreased to 299 (2018: 354), while audits conducted by third-party monitors commissioned by suppliers and adidas business entities increased to 658 at the end of 2019 (2018: 620). The decline in internal audits shows the increased focus on additional advisory consultancy and empowerment projects that go beyond our regular audit routine. ---- Audit coverage: A total of 49% (2018: 47%) of all direct
and licensee facilities were audited in 2019. `High-risk' locations2 in Asia, which is the major sourcing region of adidas, again received extensive monitoring in 2019 with an audit coverage that was close to 75% (2018: 65%). As a general principle, factories located in high-risk countries are 100% covered in our auditing scope, which means they receive audits annually or every two years while low-risk countries (i.e. with strong government enforcement and

inspectorate systems) are considered out of scope for our audit coverage. ---- Audit results: In 2019, 68% of our strategic factories achieved a rating of 4C or better, compared to 37% in all direct factories, indicating that strategic factories have achieved much more advanced compliance levels. While this is yet again significant progress compared to 2018, it still falls short of our 2020 target to reach 4C or above in 80% of our strategic suppliers. For the first time, 12% of our strategic factories achieved a 5C rating, indicating that they have mature social compliance systems and practices in place. SEE DIAGRAM 47 Of our strategic licensee factories, 86% successfully embedded governance systems, supply chain management, purchasing practices and product safety compliance requirements into their business practices. 14% achieved a `Sustainability Leadership' level, signaling that, in addition to achieving high scores in other sections, they also scored above 80% in the sustainability section of the Report Card, which measures the existence of policies and implementation, stakeholder engagement, public reporting and communication. SEE TABLE 48
Our audits help us rate our suppliers according to their social and environmental compliance performance with a C-KPI and E-KPI rating tool, respectively. An evaluation of E-KPI is contained in the description of the environmental performance of our supply chain.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Shortcomings identified in active factories Our suppliers' factories are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues. While threshold issues are serious but correctable non-compliances that can be addressed in a specified timeframe through remedial action, zero-tolerance issues ­ such as forced labor, child labor practices and critical life-threatening health, safety and environment conditions ­ immediately trigger a warning and potential disqualification of a supplier. We report these non-compliance findings that were identified through performance audits, collaboration audits and self-governance assessments in 2019. We follow up on all cases of non-compliance and seek to remediate them within a given timeframe. As can be seen below, the identified issues in 2019 remained largely the same as those in 2018. ---- Shortcomings in the area of labor: Besides identifying
non-compliances with our Workplace Standards, the adidas compliance team focuses on the use and effectiveness of the factories' HR management systems and identifies any gaps in policies and procedures related to specific risk areas, such as forced labor, child labor, freedom of association or discrimination. As a result, the percentages shown indicate the systemic shortcomings of active factories, rather than the confirmed presence of a specific case of non-compliance. SEE DIAGRAM 49 ---- Shortcomings in the area of health and safety: Fire, electrical and machine safety are critical areas for existing factories and together accounted for 33% of the non-compliances identified in 2019. The way chemicals were stored and used, including the presence of banned chemicals, accounted for 11% of non-compliance findings reported. A further 7% of the findings related to management systems, policies and procedures, and specifically a lack of compliance with our Workplace

Independent FLA audits In 2019, the FLA deprioritized factory assessments and remediation verification under its Sustainable Compliance Initiative (SCI), in favor of other impact areas, including fair wage compensation and factory training3. Consequently, adidas received only one SCI verification, compared to three in 2018.

3 In 2019, FLA focused on: (1) improving its work toward the progressive realization of fair compensation, including a new online fair compensation dashboard to provide affiliates with the ability to compare wages and measure progress in wage increases over time; (2) improving the accreditation process by further aligning the FLA's program with international standards; (3) affiliates' disclosure practices; (4) developing responsible licensing principles; (5) responsible recruitment and forced labor trainings and the development of a forced labor toolkit; (6) audit coverage and capacity-building activities in partnership with brands and governments.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Enforcement Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered when we find ongoing serious noncompliance issues that need to be addressed by our suppliers' factories. We work closely with our suppliers to help them improve their performance. However, where we face situations of severe or repeated non-compliance, we do terminate business relationships with factories. ---- Warning letters: In 2019, we had a total of 41 active warning
letters (2018: 39) across 14 countries. The largest number of warning letters continues to be issued in Asia. Compared to the previous year, the overall number of active first warning letters decreased slightly; the total number of second warnings increased from one in 2018 to six in 2019. Factories that receive second warning letters are only one step away from being notified of possible termination of the manufacturing agreement and receive focused monitoring by the SEA team. The number of third warning letters issued to business partners (which result in factory terminations) remained stable in 2019 (2018: 1). SEE TABLE 51It is difficult to generalize about the grounds for a warning letter as it may be issued for a single unresolved non-conformance or for multiple breaches of our standards. The range of issues that resulted in warning letters in 2019 due to non-compliance regarding fire safety practices, receipt of wages, social and medical insurance, hazardous chemicals management, overtime, deductions, transparency or safety controls in high-risk areas remained the same compared to the previous year. ---- Terminations: In 2019, we terminated agreements with two suppliers for compliance reasons (2018: 1). In one case there was inadequate progress in remediating serious migrant labor issues and in the other the supplier refused to grant the SEA team access to audit the factory.

SEE TABLE 52While terminations happen at our existing factories, we pre-screen all new factories and if our initial assessments uncover zero-tolerance or threshold issues factories are rejected.

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
We are committed to increasing shareholder value. We strive to create value by converting sales and operating profit growth into strong operating cash flow, while at the same time managing our asset base proactively. Our company's planning and controlling system is therefore designed to provide a variety of tools to assess our current performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to best utilize commercial and organizational opportunities in the interest of our shareholders.
INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO DRIVE SHAREHOLDER VALUE In order to drive and steer creation of shareholder value, the company's Management focuses on a set of major financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Sales and operating profit growth, paired with a focus on management of operating working capital, are the main contributors to operating cash flow improvements. At the same time, value-enhancing capital expenditure benefits future operating profit and cash flow development. In addition, the development of the company's net income position, as well as earnings per share (EPS), is of high importance as it directly drives returns in the interest of our shareholders. SEE DIAGRAM 53 Our strong focus on shareholder value creation is reflected in the fact that our Management's variable compensation is closely linked to the company's growth in sales, profitability and net income. SEE
COMPENSATION REPORT, P. 30
OPERATING MARGIN AS MAJOR KPI FOR OPERATIONAL PROGRESS Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of net sales) is one of our company's major KPIs to drive and improve our operational performance. It highlights the quality

of our top line and operational efficiency. The primary drivers to enhance operating margin are as follows: ---- Sales and gross margin development: Management
focuses on identifying and exploiting growth opportunities that not only provide for future top-line improvements, but also have potential to increase our gross margin. Major levers for enhancing our sales and gross margin include: ---- Planning pricing and clearance activities according to
market realities. ---- Optimizing our product mix. ---- Improving the quality of distribution, with a particular
focus on e-commerce and controlled space. SEE GLOSSARY ---- Operating expense control: Management puts high
emphasis on tightly controlling operating expenses to leverage sales growth through to the bottom line. This requires a particular focus on ensuring flexibility in the company's cost base. Marketing expenditure SEE GLOSSARY is one of our largest operating expenses and at the same time one of the most important mechanisms for driving brand desirability and top-line growth sustainably. Therefore, we are committed to improving the efficiency

of our marketing investments. This includes concentrating our communication efforts on key global brand initiatives and focusing our promotion spend on well-selected partnerships with top events, leagues, clubs, federations, athletes and artists. We also aim to increase operational efficiency by tightly managing operating overhead expenses.
SEE GLOSSARY In this respect, we regularly review our operational structure ­ harmonizing business processes, standardizing systems, eliminating redundancies and leveraging the scale of our organization.
TIGHT OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our business, the efficiency of the balance sheet depends to a large degree on our operating working capital management. Operating working capital comprises accounts receivable plus inventories minus accounts payable. SEE STATEMENT OF

In this context, our key metric is average operating working capital as a percentage of net sales. Monitoring the development of this metric facilitates the measurement of our progress in improving the efficiency of our business cycle.
We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market demand and ensure fast replenishment. Inventory aging is controlled carefully to reduce inventory obsolescence and to minimize clearance activities. As a result, Inventory Days Lasting (IDL) is monitored and assessed regularly as it measures the average number of days goods remain in inventory before being sold, highlighting the efficiency of capital locked up in products. To optimize capital tied up in accounts receivable, we strive to improve collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) and improve the aging of accounts receivable. Likewise, we strive to optimize payment terms with our suppliers to best manage our accounts payable.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE FUTURE RETURNS Improving the effectiveness of capital expenditure is another major lever to maximize our operating cash flow. We control capital expenditure with a top-down, bottom-up approach. In a first step, Management defines focus areas within the framework of our strategic business plan `Creating the New' and an overall investment budget based on investment requests from various functions within the organization. Then, in a second step, our operating segments align their initiatives within the scope of assigned priorities and available budget. We evaluate potential return on planned investments utilizing the net present value method. Risk is accounted for, adding a risk premium to the cost of capital and thus reducing our estimated future earnings streams where appropriate. By means of scenario planning, the sensitivity of investment returns is tested against changes in initial assumptions. For large investment projects, timelines and deviations versus

budget are monitored on a monthly basis throughout the course of the project. In addition to optimizing return on investments, we evaluate larger projects upon completion and document learnings for future capital expenditure decisions.
FOCUS ON NET INCOME IN THE INTEREST OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS Beyond our ambition to maximize operating cash flow, we are committed to a continuous improvement in the company's bottom line. We are convinced that, by doing so, we place an even stronger focus on the interests of our shareholders. Consequently, Management closely monitors the development of both net income and earnings per share (EPS) and executes against these two KPIs. SEE DIAGRAM 53 Our strong focus on driving sustainable expansion to the company's bottom line is also reflected in the fact that, as part of the LongTerm Incentive Plan 2019/2020, the variable compensation for our Management is directly linked to the company's net income growth.
NON-FINANCIAL KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS In addition to the major financial KPIs to assess the performance and operational success of our company, as outlined above, we have identified a set of non-financial KPIs that help us track our progress in areas that are critical for our long-term success but are not directly reflected in the financial statements. These non-financial KPIs are assessed on a regular basis and managed by the respective business functions. Non-financial KPIs which we are closely monitoring include, amongst others, Net Promoter Score (NPS) SEE GLOSSARY, market share, backlogs and sell-through data as well as our customer delivery performance (On-Time In-Full), employee engagement and a set of KPIs in the area of our sustainability performance.

Net Promoter Score (NPS): Maintaining and enhancing brand desirability through the creation of strong brand identities is crucial for sustaining and driving profitable growth. Therefore, mainly on a market and category level, we invest in primary qualitative and quantitative research such as trend scouting and consumer surveys to determine brand loyalty and brand strength. Measures that are tracked include brand awareness, likeability and purchase intent.
Furthermore, within the framework of `Creating the New', we implemented an NPS system, which strengthens our capabilities to more carefully review brand advocacy as NPS tells us how likely it is that consumers will recommend our brands. NPS is a key pillar in transforming our company into a consumer-centric organization. It represents a holistic and transparent measure of brand performance and has been successfully applied in other industries and organizations.
Our efforts around NPS (both our own NPS as well as the NPS of our major competitors) are driven by an independent agency and monitored by our internal global consumer insights teams on a regular basis. In addition, NPS is measured across many of our own-retail stores as well as our own e-commerce platform. We firmly believe that advocacy will create sustained growth for our brands, underpinned by the fact that brand advocates on average buy more than nonadvocates. In addition, a large part of our consumers rely on referrals by friends or family when making purchase decisions.
Market share: To measure the operational performance of our brands relative to our major competitors, we continuously collect, on a market and category level, market share data. The findings provide detailed insights for our senior management team regarding in which markets and categories we have been able to gain market share relative to our peers, enabling us to leverage those insights across the organization.

SEE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES,
AND OUTLOOK, P. 130 In addition, the results help us to define clear roles and responsibilities for each of our markets and categories within our long-term strategic aspirations, based on their overall positioning within the sporting goods industry.
Backlogs and sell-through data: To manage demand planning and better anticipate our future performance, backlogs comprising orders received up to nine months in advance of the actual sale are monitored closely. However, due to the growing share of own retail (including our own e-commerce channel) in our business mix, fluctuating order patterns among our customers as well as an increasing part of our business being realized under significantly shortened lead times, orders received from our retail partners are less indicative of anticipated revenues for adidas compared to the past. Therefore, qualitative feedback from our retail partners on the sell-through success of our products at the point of sale as well as such data received from our own-retail activities is becoming increasingly important.
On-Time In-Full (OTIF): OTIF measures the company's delivery performance toward customers and our own-retail stores. Managed by our Global Operations function, OTIF assesses to what degree customers received what they ordered and if they received it on time. SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS, P. 63 It helps us to investigate improvement potential in the area of order book management and logistics processes. It therefore also helps us to improve our delivery performance, which is a major aspect when it comes to customer satisfaction. The OTIF assessment covers both the adidas and Reebok brands in most of our key markets.
Employee engagement: To measure the level of engage ment and motivation of our employees, adidas carries out employee engagement surveys. These surveys aim to provide key insights into how well we, as an employer, are doing in

engaging our employees. They thus enable us to develop the right focus and future people strategies across our organization, helping us to create a world-class employee experience and continue to attract and retain top talent. In 2019, we continued to fine-tune our approach and system platform for measuring the level of employee engagement that was implemented in 2017.  SEE PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70
Sustainability performance: We have a strong commitment to enhance the social and environmental performance of our company. By doing so, we firmly believe we will not only improve the company's overall reputation, but also increase its economic value. We therefore follow a comprehensive roadmap with clear targets and regularly track our progress toward these targets. SEEMANAGEMENTASSESSMENTOFPERFORMANCE, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTLOOK, P. 130 A major focus lies on measuring the environmental footprint of our own sites globally as well as monitoring and rating our supplier factories with regard to social and environmental compliance with our Workplace Standards. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78 We have a strong track record in sustainability disclosure, providing regular updates about our sustainability performance in this Annual Report as well as on our corporate website. 
ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/SUSTAINABILITY-REPORTS
STRUCTURED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM We have developed an extensive performance measurement system, which utilizes a variety of tools to measure the company's performance. Key performance indicators as well as other important financial metrics are regularly monitored and compared against initial targets as well as rolling forecasts on a monthly basis. When negative deviations exist between actual and target numbers, we perform a detailed analysis to identify and address the cause. If necessary, action plans are implemented to optimize the development of our operating performance. To assess current sales and

profitability development, Management continuously analyzes the performance of our operating segments. We also benchmark our financial results with those of our major competitors on a regular basis.
Taking into account year-to-date performance as well as opportunities and risks, the company's expected full year financial performance is assessed on a monthly basis. In this respect, also backlogs and sell-through data as well as feedback from customers and own-retail stores are assessed as available. Finally, as a further early indicator for future performance, the results of any relevant recent market and consumer research are assessed as available.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
In 2019, adidas recorded strong operational and financial improvements. Revenues increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting high-single-digit growth at the adidas brand and a low-single-digit sales increase at Reebok. All major market segments recorded currency-neutral sales increases. The gross margin increased 0.2percentage points to 52.0%. Other operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down 0.2 percentage points to 41.6%, predominantly driven by lower marketing expenditure as a percentage of sales. The company's operating margin increased 0.4percentage points to 11.3%, reflecting both the gross margin increase and the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Net income from continuing operations increased 12% to 1.918 billion, including the negative impact from the first-time application of IFRS 16. This translates into basic EPS from continuing operations of 9.70, representing an increase of 15% versus the prior year period.

cushioned subdued productivity growth. Furthermore, growth in both commodity exporters and importers decelerated last year. Across the globe, risks of re-escalating geopolitical tensions, in particular around trade and tariffs, remain.
ROBUST GROWTH IN THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY CONTINUES The global sporting goods industry continued to grow at robust rates in 2019. China outgrew the global industry again, while North America posted robust growth rates. Europe maintained its moderate pace of expansion. Most other markets also grew, driven by continued global trends such as increasing penetration of sportswear (`athleisure' SEE GLOSSARY), increasing sports participation rates and rising awareness for health and wellness. Moreover, the evolution of
Regional GDP development1,2 in %

digital offerings such as social fitness or membership programs with seamless personal experiences remained a predominant theme. Sustainability stayed in focus, as consumers showed increasing interest in sustainable companies and products. The e-commerce channel saw further expansion amid growing investments into consumer insights generation and brand building. From a category perspective, athletic footwear continued to be a significant growth driver for the industry in 2019, as various casual and running styles remained in high demand. Growth in athletic apparel remained robust, as consumers continued to purchase sports-inspired fashion. For the sporting goods industry, too, risks of re-escalating geopolitical tensions, in particular around trade and tariffs, remain.

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN 20191 The global economy slowed down in 2019, with global gross domestic product (GDP) growing at 2.4%. Despite recent deescalation, an overall increase in the level of tariffs and heightened policy uncertainty weakened both international trade and investment. Global manufacturing activity moderated, while monetary policy accommodation increased. Developed economies grew 1.6% in 2019, supported by robust labor markets and some remaining fiscal stimuli. Nevertheless, trade tensions and associated policy uncertainty such as the Brexit negotiations remained a political overhang and a drag on economic activity.

GROSS MARGIN IMPROVES 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS In 2019, gross profit increased 8% to 12.293billion from 11.363billion in 2018, representing a gross margin increase of 0.2 percentage points to 52.0% (2018: 51.8%). SEE DIAGRAM 60 Higher air freight costs to mitigate the supply chain shortages and a less favorable pricing mix were more than offset by positive effects from lower sourcing costs, positive currency developments as well as a better product and channel mix.

expenses. In 2019, other operating expenses were up 7% to 9.843billion (2018: 9.172billion). SEE NOTE 32, P. 196As a percentage of sales, other operating expenses decreased 0.2percentage points to 41.6% from 41.9% in 2018. SEE DIAGRAM 61 Marketing and point-of-sale expenses amounted to 3.042billion in 2019 compared to 3.001billion in the prior year, representing an increase of 1% compared to the 2018 level. As a percentage of sales, marketing and point-of-sale expenses decreased 0.8 percentage points to 12.9% (2018: 13.7%). SEE DIAGRAM 62 Distribution and selling expenses increased 12% to 4.997billion in 2019 from 4.450billion in the prior year, driven by overproportionate growth in the direct-to-consumer channel. As a percentage of sales, distribution and selling expenses increased 0.8 percentage points to 21.1% from 20.3% in 2018. General and administration expenses were up 5% to 1.652billion (2018:  1.576 billion), as the positive effects of overheads cost control were more than offset by continued investments into the scalability of the company's business model. As a percentage of sales, general and administration expenses decreased 0.2 percentage points to 7.0% (2018: 7.2%).

COST OF SALES INCREASES IN LINE WITH NET SALES Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for expenses associated with producing and delivering our products. In addition, own-production expenses are also included in the cost of sales. However, these expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales. In 2019, cost of sales was 11.347billion, representing an increaseof8%comparedtotheprioryearlevelof 10.552 billion. This development mainly reflects the growth of our business.

ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING INCOME INCREASE In 2019, royalty and commission income increased 19% to 154million (2018: 129million). Other operating income was up 17% to 56million from 48million in 2018.

NET FINANCIAL RESULT DECREASES Financial income increased 11% to 64 million in 2019 (2018: 57million), while financial expenses were up 253% to 166million compared to 47million in 2018. This development was mainly due to higher interest expenses related to the first-time application of IFRS 16. As a result, the company recorded a net financial result of negative 102million, compared to positive  10 million in 2018. SEE DIAGRAM 66, SEE

The total number of shares outstanding decreased by 3,201,958 shares to 195,969,387 at the end of 2019. This development was a result of shares repurchased as part of the company's share buyback program.

GAINS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AMOUNT TO  59 MILLION In 2019, adidas incurred gains from discontinued operations of  59 million, net of tax, mainly related to the remeasurement of outstanding earn-out components in connection with the divestiture of the TaylorMade business in 2017 (2018: losses of  5 million).
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS INCREASES 16% TO 1.976BILLION The company's net income attributable to shareholders, which in addition to net income from continuing operations includes the gains from discontinued operations, grew 16% to 1.976billion (2018: 1.702billion). As a result, basic EPS from continuing and discontinued operations increased 19% to 10.00 versus 8.44 in 2018.

Cash and cash equivalents were down 16% to 2.220billion at the end of December 2019 from 2.629billion in the prior year, as net cash generated from operating activities was more than offset by net cash used in investing and financing activities. Currency effects had a negative impact on cash and cash equivalents in an amount of  30 million. Inventories increased 19% to 4.085billion at the end of December 2019 from 3.445billion in 2018.

Total non-current assets increased 68% to 9.746billion at the end of December 2019 from 5.799billion in 2018, mainly related to the first-time application of IFRS 16. Fixed assets increased 69% to 8.100billion at the end of December 2019 versus 4.798billion in 2018. The application of IFRS 16 led to the recognition of right-of-use assets in the amount of 2.931 billion at the end of December 2019 (including already existing IAS 17 leases from the prior year in the amount of 82 million). Furthermore, additions of  711 million, primarily related to own-retail activities were only partly offset by depreciation and amortization, impairment losses/ reversal of impairment losses of 522 million. Other noncurrent financial assets increased 76% to 450million from 256million at the end of 2018. SEE NOTE 16, P. 164 This development was mainly due to an increase in derivatives used to fully hedge the economic exposure related to the equity-neutral convertible bond. Deferred tax assets were up 68% to 1.093billion from 651million in 2018, due to an increase in the tax base of non-current assets during 2019.
LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Total current liabilities increased 28% to 8.754billion at the end of December 2019 from 6.834billion in 2018. Shortterm borrowings declined 35% to 43million at the end of December 2019 (2018: 66million), mainly reflecting a decrease in bank loans. Accounts payable were up 18% to 2.703 billion at the end of December 2019 versus 2.300billion in 2018, mainly reflecting improved payment terms with the company's vendors. SEE TABLE 72On a currency-neutral basis, accounts payable increased 17%. Current lease liabilities amounted to  733 million at the end of December 2019, due to the first-time application of IFRS 16. Other current financial liabilities were up 26% to 235million from 186million in 2018, mainly as a result of an increase in the fair value of financial instruments.

Shareholders' equity increased 7% to 6.796billion at the end of December 2019 versus 6.377billion in 2018, mainly driven by the net income generated during the year. This development was partly offset by the repurchase of adidas AG shares for a consideration of 815million, the dividend of 664million paid to shareholders for the 2018 financial year, and a decrease in hedging reserves of  147 million. The equity ratio decreased to 32.9% compared to 40.8% in the prior year, as the increase in shareholders' equity was more than offset by the balance sheet extension due to the first-time application of IFRS 16.

Controlled space initiatives, which comprise investments in new or remodeled own-retail and franchise stores as well as in shop-in-shop presentations of our brands and products in our customers' stores, accounted for 47% of total capital expenditure (2018: 32%). Expenditure for IT and logistics represented 13% and 6%, respectively (2018: 13% and 12%, respectively). In addition, expenditure for administration accounted for 7% (2018: 7%).

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS In 2019, net cash generated from operating activities increased to 2.819billion (2018: 2.686billion). SEE TABLE `FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS', P. 4 Net cash generated from continuing operating activities rose to 2.828 billion (2018: 2.706billion). This increase was driven by higher income before taxes and lower income taxes paid, and the different treatment of operating leases related to the first-time application of IFRS 16, partly offset by higher operating working capital requirements.
There was a change in the presentation of interest paid in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the financial year. Due to the first-time application of IFRS 16, adidas has applied the option to show the interest paid within the net cash used in financing activities instead of the net cash generated from operating activities and, to enhance comparability, figures for the prior year were also adjusted.
Net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in continuing investing activities increased to 925million each (2018: 636million). The majority of continuing investing activities in 2019 was related to expenditure for property, plant and equipment, such as investments in controlled space initiatives, and IT systems as well as the further development of our major corporate facilities in Herzogenaurach, Portland and Shanghai. Net cash used in financing activities and net cash used in continuing financing activities grew to 2.273billion each (2018: 991million each). This development was mainly due to the repurchase of adidas AG shares, the dividend paid to shareholders as well as repayments of lease liabilities and interest payments for lease liabilities related to the first-time application of IFRS 16.
Under IFRS 16, payments for operating leases formerly disclosed under IAS 17 are no longer recognized on a straightline basis and also not reported as cash flow from operating activities. Instead, repayments and interest payments for the

lease liabilities are recognized in the cash flow from financing activities. This resulted in a decline in cash flows from financing activities in the amount of  692 million and an improvement in cash flows from operating activities in the amount of  684 million. SEE NOTE 39, P. 204
Exchange rate effects negatively impacted the company's cash position by 30million (2018:  29 million). As a result of all these developments, cash and cash equivalents decreased by 410million to 2.220billion at the end of December 2019 compared to 2.629billion at the end of December 2018. SEE
DIAGRAM 79

Net cash at December 31, 2019 amounted to 873million, compared to net cash of 959million in 2018, representing a decline of 86million compared to the prior year. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was more than offset by the utilization of cash for the purchase of fixed assets, the repurchase of adidasAG shares as well as the dividend paid to shareholders. SEE TREASURY, P. 104 The company's ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA amounted to ­0.2 at the end of December 2019 (2018: ­0.3). SEE DIAGRAM 78

Minimum future payments for other contracts were 318million at December 31, 2019, compared to 2.984billion at the end of December 2018, representing a decrease of 89%.

TREASURY
CORPORATE FINANCING POLICY In order to be able to meet the company's payment commitments at all times, the major goal of our financing policy is to ensure sufficient liquidity reserves, while at the same time minimizing our financial expenses. The operating activities of our segments and the resulting cash inflows represent the company's main source of liquidity. Liquidity is planned on a rolling quarterly basis under a multi-year financial and liquidity plan. This comprises all consolidated companies. Our in-house bank concept takes advantage of any surplus funds of individual companies to cover the financial requirements of others, thus reducing external financing needs and optimizing our net interest expenses. Furthermore, by settling intercompany transactions via intercompany financial accounts, we are able to reduce external bank account transactions and thus bank charges.
TREASURY POLICY AND RESPONSIBILITIES Our Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issues, including banking policy and approval of bank relationships, financing arrangements and liquidity/asset management, currency, interest, commodity and equity risk management as well as the management of intercompany cash flows. Responsibilities are arranged in a three-tiered approach: ---- The Treasury Committee consists of members of the
Executive Board and other senior executives who decide on the Treasury Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related topics. Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior approval of the Treasury Committee. ---- The Treasury department is responsible for specific centralized treasury transactions and for the global implementation of our Treasury Policy. ---- On a subsidiary level, where applicable and economically reasonable, local managing directors and finance directors

are responsible for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries. Controlling functions on a corporate level ensure that the transactions of the individual business units are in compliance with our Treasury Policy.
CENTRALIZED TREASURY FUNCTION In accordance with our Treasury Policy, all worldwide credit lines are directly or indirectly managed by the Treasury department. Portions of those lines are allocated to our subsidiaries and sometimes backed by adidasAG guarantees. As a result of this centralized liquidity management, the company is well positioned to allocate resources efficiently throughout the organization. The company's debt is generally unsecured and may include standard covenants, which are reviewed on a quarterly basis. We maintain good relations with numerous partner banks, thereby avoiding a high dependency on any single financial institution. Banking partners of the company and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB+ long-term investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating by another leading rating agency. SEE NOTE02, P. 143 We authorize our companies to work with banks with a lower rating only in very exceptional cases. To ensure optimal allocation of the company's liquid financial resources, subsidiaries transfer excess cash to our headquarters in all instances where it is legally and economically feasible. In this regard, the standardization and consolidation of our global cash management and payment processes, including automated domestic and cross-border cash pools SEE GLOSSARY, is a key priority for our centrally managed Treasury department. Effective management of our currency exposure and interest rate risks are additional goals and responsibilities of the department.

STANDARD COVENANTS In the case of our committed credit facilities, we have entered into various legal covenants. These legal covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens, cross-default provisions and change of control. However, our financial arrangements do not contain any financial covenants. If we failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver, borrowings would become due and payable immediately. As at December 31, 2019, we were in full compliance with all our covenants. We are fully confident we will continue to be compliant with these covenants going forward. We believe that cash generated from operating activities, together with access to internal and external sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital needs.
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY The company's financial flexibility is ensured by the availability of credit facilities, consisting of committed and uncommitted bilateral credit lines at different banks with a remaining time to maturity of up to eight years. In addition, we have an unused multi-currency commercial paper program in the amount of 2.0billion available (2018: 2.0billion). At the end of 2019, committed and uncommitted bilateral credit lines amounted to 2.105billion (2018: 2.215billion), of which 1.940billion was unutilized (2018:  2.008billion). Committed and uncommitted credit lines represent approximately 46% and 54% of total short-term bilateral credit lines, respectively (2018: 45% and 55%, respectively). We monitor the ongoing need for available credit lines based on the current level of debt as well as future financing requirements. SEE DIAGRAM 80,

OUTSTANDING BONDS The company has two outstanding eurobonds, both issued in 2014, and one outstanding equity-neutral convertible bond, which was issued in 2018. The seven-year eurobond of 600million matures on October 8, 2021 and has a coupon of 1.25%. The twelve-year eurobond of 400million matures on October 8, 2026 and has a coupon of 2.25%. The equity-neutral convertible bond of  500 million was issued on September 5, 2018, with a coupon of 0.05% and is due on September 12, 2023. SEE OUR SHARE, P. 46, SEE NOTE 18, P. 164, SEE TABLE 83

GROSS BORROWINGS DECREASE The company's gross borrowings, the vast majority of which are denominated in euro, are composed of bank borrowings as well as the outstanding eurobonds and the equity-neutral convertible bond.

INTEREST RATE DECREASES The weighted average interest rate on the company's gross borrowings decreased to 1.5% in 2019 (2018: 2.1%). SEE DIAGRAM 87This development was mainly due to the 500million equity-neutral convertible bond with a coupon of 0.05% and a reduction of interest rates of short-term borrowings. Fixed-rate financing represented 99% of total gross borrowings at the end of 2019 (2018: 97%). Variablerate financing accounted for 1% of total gross borrowings at the end of the year (2018: 3%).

EFFECTIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT A KEY PRIORITY As a globally operating company, adidas is exposed to currency risks. Therefore, effective currency management is a key focus of our Treasury department, with the aim of reducing the impact of currency fluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cash flows. In this regard, hedging US dollars is a central part of our program. This is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing, which is largely denominated in US dollars. SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS, P. 63 In 2019, our Treasury department managed a net deficit of around US $ 7.1billion related to operational activities (2018: US $ 6.0billion). Thereof, around US $ 4.7billion was against the euro (2018: US $ 3.8billion). As governed by our Treasury Policy, we have established a hedging system on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-month horizon. We had largely covered our anticipated hedging needs for 2020 as at year-end 2019. At the same time, we have already started hedging our exposure for 2021. The use or combination of different hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, currency options and swaps, protects us against unfavorable currency movements. SEE NOTE 30, P. 180

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ADIDAS AG
adidasAG is the parent company of the adidas Group. It includes operating business functions, primarily for the German market, as well as corporate headquarter functions such as Marketing, IT, Treasury, Taxes, Legal and Finance. adidas AG also administers the company's shareholdings.

PREPARATION OF ACCOUNTS Unlike the consolidated financial statements, which are in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as at December 31, 2019, the following financial statements of adidasAG have been prepared in accordance with the rules set out in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch ­ HGB).

retail activities.

In addition to its own trading activities, the results of adidasAG are significantly influenced by its holding function for the company as a whole. This is reflected primarily in currency effects, transfer of costs for services provided, interest result and income from investments in related companies.
The opportunities and risks as well as the future development of adidasAG largely reflect those of the company as a whole.
SEE OUTLOOK, P. 117, SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT, P. 120
The asset and capital structure of adidasAG is significantly impacted by its holding and financing function for the company. For example, 44% of total assets as at December 31, 2019 related to financial assets (2018: 46%), which primarily consist of shares in affiliated companies. Intercompany accounts, through which transactions between affiliated companies are settled, represent another 32% of total assets (2018: 26%) and 42% of total equity and liabilities as at December 31, 2019 (2018: 45%).

NET SALES INCREASE 8% Sales of adidasAG comprise external revenues generated by adidas Germany with products of the adidas and Reebok brands as well as revenues from foreign subsidiaries. Revenues of adidas AG also include royalty and commission income, mainly from affiliated companies, revenues from central distribution, and other revenues. In 2019, adidasAG net sales grew 8% to  4.444 billion compared to  4.128 billion in the prior year. This growth was mainly due to higher royalty and commission income and an increase in revenues from adidas Germany. SEE TABLE 88, SEE TABLE 89
OTHER OPERATING INCOME UP 14% In 2019, other operating income of adidas AG increased 14% to  590 million (2018:  516 million). This development was primarily due to positive currency effects.
OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASE 2% In 2019, other operating expenses for adidas AG rose 2% to 2.337 billion (2018:  2.282 billion). SEE TABLE 88 This was largely attributable to higher currency losses as well as an increase in IT and maintenance costs, partly offset by a decrease in expenses for advertising and promotion and allowances for doubtful accounts.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION UP 22% Depreciation and amortization for adidas AG rose 22% to  120 million in 2019 (2018:  98 million), mainly as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of software and buildings.

OPERATING RESULT INCREASES In 2019, adidas AG generated an operating profit of  170 million due to higher sales (2018: operating loss of  5 million). SEE TABLE 88
FINANCIAL RESULT IMPROVES The financial result of adidasAG improved 26% to 1.938billion in 2019 (2018:  1.542 billion). The increase was attributable to higher income from dividends, partly offset by lower profit transfers from affiliated companies under profit and loss transfer agreements.
NET INCOME INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY Net income, after taxes of 161million (2018: 113million), amounted to 1.947billion in 2019 and was thus 37% above the prior year level (2018: 1.424billion). SEE TABLE 88

TOTAL ASSETS ABOVE PRIOR YEAR At the end of December 2019, total assets grew 6% to  10.070 billion compared to  9.496 billion in the prior year. This development was mainly a result of increases in receivables and other assets as well as financial assets, partly offset by the decline in cash and cash equivalents as well as securities.

CASH INFLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS adidasAG generated a positive cash flow from operating activities of 1.473billion (2018:  1.696 billion). The change versus the prior year was a result of the increase in net income, partly offset by higher receivables from affiliated companies. Net cash outflow from investment activities was 233million (2018:  270 million). This was primarily attributable to capital expenditure for tangible fixed assets in an amount of 167million and capital expenditure for financial assets in an amount of 66million. Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of 1.478billion (2018:  889 million). The net cash outflow from financing activities mainly relates to the repurchase of adidas AG shares in the amount of  815 million (for which  410 million was utilized from 2019 net income) and the dividend payment in an amount of 664million. As a result of all these developments, cash and cash equivalents of adidas AG decreased to 636million at the end of December 2019 compared to 874million at the end of the prior year.
adidasAG has bilateral credit lines of 1.3billion. In addition, the company has a multi-currency commercial paper program in an amount of 2.0billion. SEE TREASURY, P. 104
adidasAG is able to meet its financial commitments at all times.

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO § 315A SECTION 1 AND § 289A SECTION 1 OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE AND EXPLANATORY REPORT
COMPOSITION OF SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to 200,416,186 (as at December 31, 2019) and is divided into the same number of registered no-par-value shares with a notional pro rata amount in the nominal capital of 1 each (`shares'). The nominal capital and the number of shares did not change in the 2019 financial year. The shares are fully paid in. Any claim on the part of the shareholders to the issuance of individual share certificates is generally excluded pursuant to § 4 section 9 of the Articles of Association unless such issuance is required in accordance with the regulations applicable at a stock exchange where the shares are admitted. Pursuant to § 67 section 2 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz ­ AktG), in relation to adidas AG, only a person who is registered as such in the share register shall be deemed a shareholder. Each share grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting and determines the shareholders' share in the company's profit. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' individual rights and obligations follow from the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular from §§ 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 AktG. As at December 31, 2019, adidas AG held 4,446,799 treasury shares, which do not confer any rights to the company in accordance with §71b AktG. SEE NOTE 27, P. 171
In the USA, adidas AG has issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). ADRs are deposit certificates of non-US shares that are traded instead of the original shares on US stock exchanges. Two ADRs equal one adidas AG share.
SEE OUR SHARE, P. 46

RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS OR TRANSFER OF SHARES We are not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or other agreements restricting voting rights or the transfer of shares. Based on the Code of Conduct and internal guidelines of adidas AG and based on Article 19 section11 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation), however, particular trade prohibitions do exist for Executive Board members with regard to the purchase and sale of adidas AG shares, in connection with the (time of) publication of half-year or year-end financial reports.
In addition, restrictions of voting rights may exist pursuant to, inter alia, §136 AktG or for treasury shares pursuant to §71b AktG as well as due to capital market regulations, in particular pursuant to §§33 et seq. German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ­ WpHG).
The shares that were issued in the context of the Stock Purchase Plan to employees of adidas AG and employees of subsidiaries participating in the Stock Purchase Plan are not subject to any lock-up periods, unless such a waiting period is stipulated in locally applicable regulations. Employees who hold the shares which they purchased themselves (investment shares) for at least one year will subsequently receive one share for every six investment shares without having to pay for such share (so-called matching share) if they are still adidas employees at that point in time. If employees transfer, pledge or hypothecate investment shares in any way during the one-year vesting period, the right to receive matching shares ceases.

SHAREHOLDINGS IN SHARE CAPITAL EXCEEDING 10% OF VOTING RIGHTS We have not been notified of, and are not aware of, any direct or indirect shareholdings in the share capital of adidas AG reaching or exceeding 10% of the voting rights.
SHARES WITH SPECIAL RIGHTS There are no shares bearing special rights. In particular, there are no shares with rights conferring powers of control.
VOTING RIGHT CONTROL IF EMPLOYEES HAVE A SHARE IN THE CAPITAL Like all other shareholders, employees who hold adidas AG shares exercise their control rights directly in accordance with statutory provisions and the Articles of Association. The shares which employees acquire in the context of the Stock Purchase Plan are held in trust centrally by a service provider on behalf of the participating employees. As long as the shares are held in trust, the trustee shall take reasonable measures to enable participating employees to directly or indirectly exercise their voting rights in respect of the shares held in trust.
EXECUTIVE BOARD APPOINTMENT AND DISMISSAL Pursuant to §6 of the Articles of Association and §84 AktG, the Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the exact number of members of the Executive Board, for their appointment and dismissal as well as for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The adidas AG Executive Board, which, as a basic principle, comprises at least two members, currently consists of the CEO and five further members. Executive Board members may be appointed for a maximum period of five years. Such appointments may be renewed and the terms of office may be extended, provided that no term exceeds five years. SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD, P. 11

The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Executive Board or CEO if there is good cause, such as gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual General Meeting.
As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the German CoDetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz ­ MitbestG), the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal require a majority of at least two thirds of the Supervisory Board members (§31 MitbestG). If such a majority is not established in the first vote by the Supervisory Board, the Mediation Committee has to present a proposal which, however, does not exclude other proposals. The appointment or dismissal is then made in a second vote with a simple majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board members. Should the required majority not be established in this case either, a third vote, again requiring a simple majority, must be held in which the Chairman of the Supervisory Board has two votes.
If the Executive Board does not have the required number of members, the competent court must, in urgent cases, make the necessary appointment upon application (§85 section1 AktG).
AMENDMENTS TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION Pursuant to §§ 119 section 1 number 5,179 section1 sentence1 AktG, the Articles of Association of adidas AG can, in principle, only be amended by a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting. Pursuant to §21 section3 of the Articles of Association in conjunction with §179 section2 sentence2 AktG, the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves upon amendments to the Articles of Association with a simple majority of the votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal capital represented when passing the resolution. If mandatory legal provisions stipulate a larger majority of voting rights or capital, this is applicable. When it comes to amendments solely relating to the

wording, the Supervisory Board is authorized to make these modifications in accordance with §179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in conjunction with §10 section 1 sentence2 of the Articles of Association.
AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD The authorizations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§76 et seq. AktG in conjunction with §§7 and 8 of the Articles of Association. The Executive Board is responsible, in particular, for managing the company and represents the company judicially and extra-judicially.
AUTHORIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD TO ISSUE SHARES The authorization of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated by §4 of the Articles of Association and by statutory provisions:
Authorized Capital ---- Until June 14, 2021, the Executive Board is authorized to
increase the nominal capital, subject to Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than 4,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2016). Any repurchased treasury shares of the company which are used by the company for employee stock purchase plans during the term of this authorization shall be attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. Shareholders' subscription rights shall be excluded. The new shares may only be issued to (current and former) employees of the company and its affiliated companies as well as to (current and former) members of management bodies of the company's affiliated companies (`eligible persons').

---- Until June 7, 2022, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than 50,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2017/I). The Executive Board may, subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription rights.
---- Until June 7, 2022, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than 20,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2017/III). The Executive Board may, subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription rights. Additionally, the Executive Board may, subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude shareholders' subscription rights when issuing the new shares at a price not significantly below the stock market price of the company's shares already quoted on the stock exchange at the point in time when the issue price is ultimately determined, which should be as close as possible to the placement of the shares; this exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated with the listing of the company's shares on a foreign stock exchange. The authorization to exclude subscription rights pursuant to the previous sentence may, however, only be used to the extent that the pro rata amount of the new shares in the nominal capital together with the pro rata amount in the nominal capital of other shares which have been issued by adidasAG since May11, 2017, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to or in accordance with §186 section 3 sentence 4AktG on the basis of an authorized capital or following a repurchase, or for which subscription or conversion rights or subscription or conversion obligations have been granted since May11, 2017, through the issuance of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, with subscription rights excluded pursuant to §186 section 3 sentence 4AktG, does

not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing on the date of the entry of this authorization into the commercial register or ­ if this amount is lower ­ as at the respective date on which the resolution on utilization of the authorization is adopted. The overall volume of the shares issued based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights ­ together with shares issued against contributions in kind with the exclusion of subscription rights from the Authorized Capital 2017/II ­ must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the date of the respective issuance. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from subscription rights. ---- Until June 13, 2024, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in kind once or several times by no more than 16,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2019). The Executive Board may, subject to Supervisory Board approval, exclude shareholders' subscription rights. The overall volume of the shares issued with the exclusion of subscription rights based on this authorization must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the point in time when this authorization becomes effective or, in case this amount is lower, at the date of the respective issuance. The nominal capital which is attributed to the shares to be issued to service option or conversion rights or option or conversion obligations from bonds, debt securities or participation rights to the extent that they are issued during the term of the authorization until the date of the respective exercise of this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights, or which is attributed to shares which are issued or sold during the term of the authorization until the date of the respective exercise of this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights, has to be included in the aforementioned limit of 10%. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from subscription rights. The Authorized Capital 2019 must not

be used to issue shares within the scope of compensation or participation programs for Executive Board members or employees or for members of the management bodies or employees of subsidiaries. SEE NOTE 27, P. 171
Contingent Capital The nominal capital of the company is conditionally increased by up to 12,500,000 (Contingent Capital 2018). The Contingent Capital serves the purpose of granting holders or creditors of bonds that were issued based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018 subscription or conversion rights relating to no more than a total of 12,500,000 shares in compliance with the corresponding conditions of the bonds. Based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018, the Executive Board is authorized to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds in an aggregate nominal value of up to 2,500,000,000 with or without a limited term against contributions in cash once or several times until May 8, 2023, and to guarantee bonds issued by subordinated Group companies. The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights for residual amounts and to exclude shareholders' subscription rights insofar as this is necessary for granting subscription rights to which holders or creditors of previously issued bonds are entitled. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude shareholders' subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical market value of these bonds and the number of shares to be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital. Treasury shares which are or will be sold with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with § 71 section 1 no. 8 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. Shares which are or will be issued, subject to the

exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to §186 section3 sentence4AktG or pursuant to §203 section1 in conjunction with §186 section3 sentence4AktG between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds in the context of a cash capital increase shall also be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. Finally, shares for which there are option or conversion rights or obligations or a right to delivery of shares of the company in favor of the company due to bonds with warrants or convertible bonds issued by the company or its subordinated Group companies, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with §221 section4 sentence2 in conjunction with §186 section3 sentence4AktG during the term of this authorization based on other authorizations shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. Notwithstanding the Supervisory Board's right to determine further approval requirements, the Executive Board requires the Supervisory Board's approval for the issuance of bonds with warrants and/ or convertible bonds based on this authorization of the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018 with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights.
The Executive Board has so far not utilized the authorization to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018.
AUTHORIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD TO REPURCHASE SHARES The authorizations of the Executive Board to repurchase adidas AG shares arise from §§71 et seq. AktG and, as at the balance sheet date, from the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016.
Until May 11, 2021, the Executive Board is authorized to repurchase adidas AG shares in an amount totaling up to 10% of the nominal capital at the date of the resolution (or, as the case may be, a lower amount of nominal capital at the date of

utilization of the authorization) for any lawful purpose and within the legal framework. The authorization may be used by the company but also by its subordinated Group companies or by third parties on account of the company or its subordinated Group companies or third parties assigned by the company or one of its subordinated Group companies.
The repurchase can be carried out via the stock exchange, through a public invitation to submit sale offers, through a public repurchase offer, or through granting tender rights to shareholders. The authorization furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case.
The purposes for which treasury shares repurchased based on this authorization may be used are set out in the resolution on Item 9 of the Agenda for the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016. The shares may in particular be used as follows:
---- T hey may be sold on the stock exchange or through a public offer to all shareholders in relation to their shareholding quota; in case of an offer to all shareholders, subscription rights for residual amounts are excluded. The shares may also be sold differently, provided the shares are sold in exchange for a cash payment and at a price that, at the time of the sale, is not significantly below the stock market price of the company's shares with the same features; the prorated amount of the nominal capital which is attributable to the aggregate number of shares sold under this authorization may not exceed 10% of the nominal capital. The prorated amount of the nominal capital attributable to new shares issued between May 12, 2016 and the sale of the shares based on an authorized capital with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights pursuant to § 203 section 1 in conjunction with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG shall be attributed to the limit of 10%. Likewise, the prorated amount of the nominal capital

that is attributable to shares which may be issued due to bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds which are linked to subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the company's right to delivery of shares, provided these bonds are issued on the basis of authorizations pursuant to §§ 221 section 4, 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between May 12, 2016 and the sale of the shares, shall also be attributed to the limit of 10%. ---- They may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or indirect acquisition of companies, parts of companies, participations in companies or other economic assets or within the scope of company mergers. ---- T hey may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition of industrial property rights or intangible property rights or for the acquisition of licenses relating to such rights, also through subordinated Group companies. ---- They may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the company's right to delivery of shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by the company or its subordinated Group companies. ---- In connection with employee stock purchase plans, up to 4,000,000 shares may be issued in favor of (current and former) employees of the company and its affiliated companies as well as in favor of (current and former) management bodies of the company's affiliated companies. The number of shares the company issues to eligible persons by partially utilizing the Authorized Capital 2016 shall be attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. ---- T hey may be canceled without such cancelation requiring an additional resolution of the Annual General Meeting.
Furthermore, the shares may be promised or assigned to members of the Executive Board as compensation by way of a

stock bonus subject to the provision that resale by the Executive Board members shall only be permitted following a retention period of at least three years from the date of assignment. Responsibility in this case lies with the Supervisory Board.
In case of utilization of shares for the aforementioned purposes, except for the cancelation of shares, shareholders' subscription rights are excluded.
The Supervisory Board may determine that transactions based on this authorization may only be carried out subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees.
In the 2018 and 2019 financial years, the Executive Board partly utilized the authorization to repurchase adidas AG shares in the context of the share buyback program 2018- 2021. In a first tranche (total period from March 22, 2018 up to and including December 4, 2018) of this share buyback program, adidas AG bought back 5,089,879 adidas AG shares via the stock exchange. In a second tranche (total period from January 7, 2019 up to and including December 18, 2019), adidas AG bought back 3,223,214 adidas AG shares via the stock exchange in the year under review. SEE NOTE 27, P. 171

In the scope of the authorization resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016, the Executive Board is furthermore authorized to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives which are arranged with a credit institution or financial services institution in close conformity with market conditions. adidas AG may acquire call options issued for physical delivery and/or sell put options or use a combination of call and put options or other equity derivatives if the option conditions ensure that the shares delivered for these equity derivatives were purchased in compliance with the principle of equal treatment. All share purchases using the aforementioned equity derivatives are limited to a maximum value of 5% of the nominal capital existing at the date on which the resolution was adopted by the Annual General Meeting (or, as the case may be, a lower amount of nominal capital at the date of utilization of the authorization). The term of the options may not exceed 18 months and must furthermore be chosen in such a way that the shares are acquired upon the exercise of the options no later than May 11, 2021. The authorization furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case.
For excluding subscription rights, the use and cancelation of shares purchased using equity derivatives, the general provisions adopted by the Annual General Meeting (set out above) are applicable accordingly.

CHANGE OF CONTROL/COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS Substantial agreements entered into by adidas AG containing a change-of-control clause relate to the material financing agreements. In the case of a change of control, these agreements, in accordance with common practice, entitle the creditor to termination and early calling-in of any outstanding amounts.
No compensation agreements exist between adidas AG and members of the Executive Board or employees relating to the event of a takeover bid.

adidas has divided its operating activities into the following operating segments: Europe, North America adidas, North America Reebok, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America, Emerging Markets, adidas Golf, Runtastic and Other centrally managed businesses. While the operating segments Europe, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America and Emerging Markets are reported separately, North America adidas and North America Reebok are combined to the reportable segment North America. Each reportable segment comprises all wholesale, retail and e-commerce business activities relating to the distribution and sale of products of the adidas and Reebok brands to retail customers and end consumers. The remaining operating segments are aggregated under Other Businesses due to their only subordinate materiality.

Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 0.7 percentage points to 28.4% (2018: 27.7%). As a result of the increase in gross margin, which more than offset the negative effect of higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, operating margin was up 3.2 percentage points to 23.2% (2018: 20.0%).

As the lower gross margin was more than offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales, operating margin was up 0.4 percentage points to 28.2% (2018: 27.8%). Operating profit in Emerging Markets increased 15% to 367million versus 318 million in 2018. SEE TABLE 96

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

OUTLOOK
In 2020, we expect growth of the global economy and consumer spending to reaccelerate only slightly in light of various uncertainties, yet still to provide a supportive backdrop for robust expansion of the sporting goods industry. Through our extensive pipeline of innovative products, powerful brand-building activities and tight control of both our inventory levels and our cost base, we project significant revenue growth and strong bottom-line improvements in 2020. We forecast sales to increase at a rate between 6% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin is projected to decline slightly compared to the prior year level of 52.0%, which is expected to be more than compensated by operating leverage. Consequently, operating margin is expected to increase between 0.2 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to a level between 11.5% and 11.8%. As a result, net income from continuing operations is forecast to increase between 10% and 13% to a level between 2.100billion and 2.160billion. The company's outlook for 2020 does not reflect any impact from the coronavirus outbreak and is subject to change depending on further developments in this regard.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current view with respect to the future development of our company. The outlook is based on estimates that we have made on the basis of all the information available to us at the time of completion of this Annual Report. In addition, such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties which are beyond the control of the company. SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT, P. 120 In case the underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or described risks or opportunities materialize, actual results and developments may materially deviate (negatively or

positively) from those expressed by such statements. adidas does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Management Report beyond statutory disclosure obligations.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH TO STABILIZE IN 20201 Global GDP growth is projected to reaccelerate slightly to 2.5% in 2020. Amid recent de-escalation of trade tensions, investment and trade are forecast to gradually improve, while monetary policy is expected to stay accommodative. Nevertheless, moderating activity in major economies and financial market turbulences remain existing downside risks. In addition, differences between the pace of growth in developed and developing economies affect the global GDP projection. Developing economies are forecast to see an increase of growth at 4.1%, underlined by continued monetary policy support and a stabilization of oil and other commodity prices. In contrast, growth in developed economies is projected to slow to 1.4%, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and limited room for additional monetary policy accommodation. On a global level, additional downside risks include an escalation of trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts as well as a lasting outbreak of the coronavirus. Associated uncertainty might dampen consumer confidence, trade and growth.
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY EXPANSION TO CONTINUE IN 2020 In the absence of any major macroeconomic shocks, we expect the global sporting goods industry to grow at a midsingle-digit rate in 2020. Industry growth will continue to be driven by North America and Asia-Pacific, the biggest markets by size globally. Most other markets also look set to continue their expansion at robust rates, contributing to a growing industry. Growth in developing economies is predicted to be

further supported by a growing middle class and progressing urbanization. In developed economies, robust labor markets should fuel resilient consumption and support consumer spending on sporting goods. Globally, demand for athletic performance products should be continuously supported by increasing sports participation rates and rising awareness for health and wellness. In addition, demand for athletic casual and activewear products is expected to be further driven by increasing sportswear penetration rates, as sports-inspired apparel and footwear (`athleisure' SEE GLOSSARY) keeps evolving as a structural component of the broader fashion landscape. Sustainability is expected to further gain in importance, as consumers show increasing demand for sustainable companies and products. Collaborations between sportswear brands and non-athlete influencers will remain an industry growth driver. Within the supply chain, increased efficiency in manufacturing and speed-to-market capabilities should further benefit sales growth and inventory levels, as consumers' demands can be met faster and more precisely. On the distribution side, the significant expansion of the e-commerce channel is set to continue amid further investments into consumer insights generation and the creation of premium shopping experiences. Last but not least, major sporting events such as the UEFA EURO 2020 and the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo will support industry growth. For the sporting goods sector too, risks related to escalating trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts as well as the coronavirus outbreak remain.
OUTLOOK FOR 2020 SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN CHINA The company's outlook for 2020 as outlined in this report is subject to change depending on the further developments related to the coronavirus outbreak. In the first three weeks of 2020, our business in Greater China ­ which represents around two-thirds of our Asia-Pacific revenues and has a

slightly higher profitability level than the segment's average ­ performed strongly. However, since then we have been experiencing a material negative impact on our operations in China. We have a dedicated task force team in place to assess the situation, develop mitigation actions and ensure the personal safety as well as financial security of our employees and their families, which is the company's number one priority. Since the start of the crisis, we have been working closely with the Chinese authorities to take measures to contain the epidemic and show our solidarity with the people directly affected. As a result of a significant number of store closures ­ both own- and partner-operated ­ and a pronounced traffic reduction within the remaining store fleet, business activity in Greater China has been around 85% below the prior year level since Chinese New Year on January 25,

with a corresponding revenue and bottom-line impact. In addition, the company's supply chain in China has been facing disruptions. adidas' global sourcing activities, however, have not been materially impacted so far, as production in the country is predominantly for the local market. Similarly, while we have seen some traffic declines in other markets ­ predominantly Japan and South Korea ­ we have not yet observed any major business impact outside of Greater China.
As the situation keeps evolving, the magnitude of the overall impact on our business in 2020 cannot be quantified reliably at this point in time. Accordingly, the company's outlook for 2020 as follows and outlined in this report does not reflect any impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES TO INCREASE BETWEEN 6% AND 8% IN 2020 We expect sales to increase at a rate between 6% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis in 2020. SEE TABLE 97Despite continued uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook, the company's sales development will be favorably impacted by rising consumer spending, increasing penetration of sportswear (`athleisure') and growing health awareness in most geographical areas. In addition, the further expansion and improvement of our controlled space initiatives, in particular through our own e-commerce channel, is expected to contribute to sales growth.
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL REVENUES TO INCREASE IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS In 2020, we expect currency-neutral revenues to again increase in all market segments. While currency-neutral sales are projected to grow at a low-double-digit rate in North America and Russia/CIS, currency-neutral revenues in AsiaPacific and Emerging Markets are expected to grow at a highsingle-digit rate. Sales in Europe and Latin America are forecast to improve at a mid-single-digit rate in currencyneutral terms. SEE TABLE 97
GROSS MARGIN EXPECTED TO DECLINE SLIGHTLY In 2020, the gross margin is forecast to decline slightly compared to the prior year level of 52.0%. SEE TABLE 97 The gross margin development will be significantly burdened by the adverse impact from unfavorable currency developments as well as negative effects from higher sourcing costs. These headwinds will largely be compensated by a better channel mix as well as normalized use of air freight after last year's supply chain shortages were successfully mitigated.

OPERATING MARGIN TO EXPAND TO A LEVEL BETWEEN 11.5% AND 11.8% In 2020, the operating margin is projected to increase between 0.2 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to a level between 11.5% and 11.8%. The anticipated slight decline in gross margin is expected to be more than offset by leverage on other operating expenses. This, together with the continued top-line growth, is expected to drive a double-digit-rate improvement of the bottom line. Net income from continuing operations is projected to increase to a level between 2.100billion and 2.160billion, reflecting an increase of between 10% and 13% compared to the prior year level of 1.918 billion.

MANAGEMENT TO PROPOSE DIVIDEND OF 3.85 As a result of the strong operational and financial performance in 2019, our robust financial position as well as Management's confidence in our short- and long-term growth aspirations, the adidasAG Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend paying a dividend of 3.85 per dividend-entitled share for 2019 (2018: 3.35) to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 14, 2020. The total payout of 752million (2018: 664million) reflects a payout ratio of 39.2% of net income from continuing operations (2018: 38.9%), based on the number of shares outstanding as at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This is within the target range of between 30% and 50% of net income from continuing operations as defined in our dividend policy.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TO INCREASE TO AROUND 800MILLION In 2020, capital expenditure is expected to increase to around 800million (2019: 711million). Investments will mainly focus on controlled space initiatives of the adidas and Reebok brands in both physical retail and e-commerce, the company's IT and logistics infrastructure as well as the further development of state-of-the-art corporate facilities in Herzogenaurach and Portland.

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
In order to remain competitive and ensure sustainable success, adidas consciously takes risks and continuously explores and develops opportunities. Our risk and opportunity management principles and system provide the framework for our company to conduct business in a wellcontrolled environment.
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES We define risk as the potential occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to achieve the company's business objectives or financial goals. Opportunity is defined as the potential occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that can positively impact the company's ability to achieve its business objectives or financial goals.
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The Executive Board has overall responsibility for establishing an effective risk and opportunity management system that ensures comprehensive and consistent management of all material risks and opportunities. SEE DIAGRAM 98 The Risk Management department governs, operates and develops the company's risk and opportunity management system and is the owner of the centrally managed risk and opportunity management process on behalf of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system. These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. Working independently of all other functions of the organizations, the Internal Audit department provides objective assurance to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the

company's risk and opportunity management system on a regular basis. In addition, the Internal Audit department includes an assessment of the effectiveness of risk manage ment processes and compliance with the company's Risk Management Policy as part of its regular auditing activities with selected adidas subsidiaries or functions each year.
Our risk and opportunity management system is based on frameworks for enterprise risk management and internal controls developed and published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Additionally, we have adapted our risk and opportunity management system to more appropriately reflect the structure as well as the culture of the company. This system focuses on the identification, evaluation, handling, monitoring and systematic reporting of risks and opportunities. The key objective of the risk and opportunity management system is to support business success and protect the company as a going concern through an opportunity-focused but risk-aware decision-making framework.

outlines the principles, processes, tools, risk areas, key responsibilities, reporting requirements and communication timelines within our company.
Risk and opportunity management is a company-wide activity which utilizes key insights from the members of the Executive Board as well as from global and local business units and functions.
Our risk and opportunity management process comprises the following steps: ---- Risk and opportunity identification: adidas continuously
monitors the macroeconomic environment and developments in the sporting goods industry, as well as internal processes, to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible. Our company-wide network of Risk Owners (at least all leaders reporting directly to the Executive Board, including the Managing Directors of our markets) ensures an effective bottom-up identification of risks and opportunities. Risk Management has defined 25 categories to assist Risk Owners in identifying risks and opportunities. The Risk Owners use various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups and product styles which show most potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes. However, our risk and opportunity identification process is not only limited to external risk factors or opportunities; it also includes an internal perspective that

considers company culture, processes, projects, human resources and compliance aspects. ---- Risk and opportunity evaluation: We assess identified risks and opportunities individually according to a systematic evaluation methodology, which allows adequate prioritization as well as allocation of resources. Risk and opportunity evaluation is also part of the Risk Owners' responsibility. The Risk Management department supports and guides the Risk Owners in the evaluation process. According to our methodology, risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two dimensions: the potential impact and the likelihood that this impact materializes. Based on this evaluation, we classify risks and opportunities into three categories: minor, moderate and major.
The potential impact is evaluated using five categories: marginal, low, medium, high and significant. These categories represent financial or equivalent non-financial measurements. The financial measurements are based on the potential effect on the company's net income. Non-financial measurements used are the degree of media exposure affecting the company's reputation, brand image and employer value proposition, the degree of damage to people's health and safety, and the degree of legal and judicial consequences at the corporate and personal level. Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or opportunity may materialize with the specific impact. The likelihood of individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale divided into five categories: below 15%, 15%­30%, 30%­50%, 50%­85% and above 85%.
SEE DIAGRAM 99
When evaluating risks and opportunities, we also consider the earliest time period when the company's target achievement may be impacted, in order to provide a broad perspective and ensure early identification and mitigation. Short-term risks and opportunities may affect

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

We consider both gross and net risks in our risk assessments. While the gross risk reflects the inherent risk before any mitigating action, the net risk reflects the residual risk after all mitigating action. On the one hand, this approach allows for a good understanding of the impact of mitigating action taken; on the other hand, it provides the basis for scenario analysis. Our assessment of risks presented in this report only reflects the net risk perspective. We measure the actual financial impact of the most relevant risks that materialized against the original assessment on a yearly basis. In this way, we ensure continuous monitoring of the accuracy of risk evaluations across the company, which enables us to continuously improve evaluation methodology based on our findings.
In assessing the potential effect from opportunities, each opportunity is appraised with respect to viability, commerciality and potential risks. This approach is applied to longer-term strategic prospects but also to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at the corporate level as well as at the market and brand level. In contrast to the risk evaluation, only the net perspective exists for assessing opportunities. ---- Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated in accordance with the company's risk and opportunity management principles as described in the Risk Management Policy. Risk Owners are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate risk-mitigating action and exploiting opportunities within their area of responsibility. In addition, the Risk Owners need to determine a general risk-handling strategy for the identified risks, which is either risk avoidance, risk reduction with the objective to minimize impact and/or likelihood, risk transfer to a third party or risk acceptance. The decision on the implementation of the respective risk-handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the effectiveness of any planned mitigating action if applicable.

The Risk Management department works closely with the Risk Owners to monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating action and assess the viability of already implemented mitigating action. In 2019, we introduced a formalized risk acceptance process linked to the risk classification. Depending on the risk class determined by the risk and opportunity evaluation, the authority to make decisions to accept risks resides with the Executive Board, the Risk Owners and operational management. The decision to accept material risks without taking additional mitigating action can only be made by the entire Executive Board. ---- Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our risk and opportunity management system aims to increase the transparency of risks and opportunities. As both risks and opportunities are subject to constant change, Risk Owners not only monitor developments but also the adequacy and effectiveness of the current risk-handling strategy on an ongoing basis.
Regular risk reporting takes place half-yearly and consists of a five-step reporting stream that is supported and facilitated by a globally used company-wide IT solution:
1. R isk Owners are required to report to Risk Management risks and opportunities that have a possible net impact of  1 million and above, regardless of the likelihood of materializing.
2. Risk Management consolidates and aggregates the reported risks and opportunities and provides a consolidated report based on the Risk Owners' input to each member of the Executive Board concerning his or her individual area of responsibility. Each report specifically highlights substantial individual risks and opportunities. Each member of the Executive Board reviews the reported risks and opportunities of his or

her individual area of responsibility, adding his or her own assessment of risks and opportunities if necessary.
3. Risk Management provides a consolidated report to all members of the Executive Board that includes both the assessment of each member of the Executive Board and the major risks and opportunities reported by Risk Owners. The Executive Board reviews the report, jointly agrees on a final company assessment of risks and opportunities and decides if Risk Owners are required to take further action.
4. Based on the Executive Board's decision, Risk Management creates the final risk and opportunity report that is also shared with the Core Leadership Group (CLG). SEE PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70
5. T he Executive Board in collaboration with Risk Manage ment presents the final risk and opportunity assessment results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Material changes in previously reported risks and opportunities and/or newly identified risks and opportunities that are classified as moderate or major as well as any issues identified which, due to their material nature, require immediate reporting, are also reported outside the regular half-yearly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis to the Risk Management department and the Executive Board.
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ADIDAS FAIR PLAY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK)
We consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative. The Executive Board sets the tone right from the top ­ every employee is required to act ethically and in compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations while executing

the company's business. Violations must be avoided under all circumstances. However, we realize that it will never be possible to exclude compliance violations with absolute certainty.
The adidas Fair Play Compliance Framework is overseen by the company's Chief Compliance Officer. We see compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain. Our central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance Officers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the central Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.
The company's Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. It refers to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and is designed to: ---- support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable
growth through good corporate governance; ---- reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage
caused by non-compliant conduct; ---- protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the
company and its brands through compliant conduct; and ---- preserve diversity by fighting harassment and
discrimination.
The adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct stipulates guidelines for behavior in everyday work, which all employees are obliged to comply with. It is applicable globally and for all business areas, accessible on our website and on our intranet. In 2019, we revised the Code of Conduct to ensure it remains up-todate and reflects our business environment.ADIDAS-GROUP.
COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT

The Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect and respond. ---- Prevention: The foundation of our CMS is the adoption
and implementation of our Fair Play Code of Conduct, the Compliance Policy, and the Privacy Policy. adidas issues targeted compliance-related communication by management and the Compliance department and provides mandatory training to all employees globally during onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. In 2019, more than 3,500 employees completed online compliance training. Furthermore, we conducted targeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management and newly promoted or hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the compliance `tone from the top', as well as the `tone from the middle'. We closely monitor the completion rates for these training measures and continuously update our web-based training. ---- Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures to ensure timely detection of potential infringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report

compliance concerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers or Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR manager or the Works Council. Employees can also report externally via an independent, confidential reporting hotline and website, and can choose to do so anonymously through the Fair Play hotline. The hotline is available at all times worldwide. ---- Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief Compliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional Compliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and report potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2019, we recorded 514 potential compliance violations (2018: 410). SEE DIAGRAM 100, SEE DIAGRAM 101 Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are used to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance violations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of employment contracts.

The company's Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports to the Executive Board on the further development of the compliance program and on major compliance cases. In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. In 2019, the Chief Compliance Officer attended five meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further development of the compliance program, major compliance cases and other relevant compliance topics.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM RELATING TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS PURSUANT TO § 315 SECTION 4 GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HANDELSGESETZBUCH ­ HGB) The internal control and risk management system relating to the consolidated financial reporting process of the company represents a process embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It aims to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the company's external financial reporting by ensuring company-wide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual). We regard the internal control and risk management system as a process based on the principle of segregation of duties, encompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning, Reporting and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of financial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a first step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit and control risks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process which might result in the consolidated financial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the effectiveness of ICoFR, the Policies and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit department regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the external auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected

internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR. However, due to the limitations of ICoFR, even with appropriate and functional systems absolute certainty about the effectiveness of ICoFR cannot be guaranteed.
All adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the company-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory changes and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all adidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees' scope of discretion with regard to recognition and valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within the company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the four-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the accounting process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director confirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting department semi-annually.
The accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services. Virtually all of the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide standardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company, the local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS. At the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas companies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated validations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and

adherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial data as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of independent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a nonroutine basis. After ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins, running automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those relating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-based, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by systematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas companies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances. Unless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material deviations.

to the competitive and retail environment and risks related to consumer demand and product offering are considered material. Our presentation of risks in this year's Annual Report differs from the 2018 Annual Report as we changed risk categories and therefore consolidated individual risks based on these updated categories. Changes in risk assessments are shown on a comparable basis. The risks overview table illustrates the assessment of all risks described below. SEE TABLE 102
Risks related to the competitive and retail environment Changes in the competitive landscape and the retail environment could impact the company's success, in particular in the medium to long term. Strategic alliances amongst competitors and/or retailers, the increase in retailers' own private label businesses and intense competition for consumers, production capacity and promotion partnerships between well-established industry peers and new market entrants pose a substantial risk to adidas. This could lead to harmful competitive behavior, such

as sustained periods of discounting in the marketplace or intense bidding for promotion partnerships. Failure to recognize and respond to consolidation in the retail industry could lead to increased dependency on particular retail partners, reduced bargaining power and, consequently, margin erosion. Sustained pricing pressure in key markets could threaten the company's financial performance and the competitiveness of our brands. Aggressive competitive practices could also drive increases in marketing costs and market share losses, thus hurting the company's profitability and market position. The inability to adjust our distribution strategy in a timely manner to a changing retail industry, which is experiencing increasing substitution of physical retail stores by digital commerce platforms as well as increasing connectivity between physical and digital retail, could result in sales and profit shortfalls. A decline in the attractiveness of particular shopping locations such as shopping malls could lead to sales shortfalls in our customers' and our own stores, higher inventory in the marketplace, increased clearance activity and margin pressure.

All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization concepts, approval concepts and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular basis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is minimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of change processes and regular data backups.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

To mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor and analyze information on our competitors and markets in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes. This enables us to proactively adjust our marketing and sales activities (e.g. product launches, selective pricing adjustments) when needed. We also continuously and closely monitor numerous indicators (e.g. order placement, sell-through rates at the point of sale, average selling prices, discounts, store traffic) that help us identify changes in the retail environment and quickly take appropriate action such as closing or remodeling own stores. We constantly adjust our segmentation strategies to ensure that the right product is sold at the right point of sale to the right consumer at an appropriate price. Continuous investment in research and development ensures that we remain innovative and distinct from competitors. SEE INNOVATION, P. 67 We also pursue a strategy of entering into longterm agreements with key promotion partners such as Real Madrid or James Harden, as well as adding new partners to refresh and diversify our portfolio, e.g. Mikaela Shiffrin or Boca Juniors. In addition, our product and communication initiatives are designed to increase brand desire, drive market share growth and strengthen our brands' market position.
Risks related to consumer demand and product offering Our success largely depends on our ability to continuously create new, innovative footwear and apparel products. Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpected, particularly when it comes to the more fashion-related part of our business. Therefore, we face a risk of short-term revenue loss in cases where we are unable to anticipate consumer demand or respond quickly to changes. In addition, creating and offering products that do not resonate with consumers and our retail partners is a critical risk to the success of our brands, especially considering our strategy to focus on key product franchises. SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55 In the short term, we consider this risk most relevant in our key markets

Asia-Pacific and North America. Even more critical in the long term, however, are the risks of continuously overlooking new consumer trends, failing to introduce new product innovation and failing to continuously generate consumer excitement with our product offering and marketing activities.
To mitigate these risks, identifying and responding to shifts in consumer demand as early as possible is a key responsibility of our brand and sales organizations and, in particular, of the respective Risk Owners. Therefore, we utilize extensive primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and opportunity identification process. By putting the consumer at the center of our decision-making we intend to create higher brand advocacy. As part of our adidas brand advocacy program, we continuously monitor the Net Promoter Score (NPS) SEE GLOSSARY and strive to understand consumers' perception. SEE ADIDAS BRAND STRATEGY, P. 55 We continuously expand our consumer analytics efforts to read and quickly react to changes in demand or trend shifts. In addition, direct touchpoints with consumers via our own digital channels and direct communication with consumers on social media platforms strengthen our understanding of consumer preferences and behavior and, as a result, help us to reduce our vulnerability to changes in demand. Through continuous monitoring of sell-through data and disciplined product lifecycle management, in particular for our major product franchises, we are able to better detect demand patterns and prevent overexposure. Our Speed programs also help us mitigate the risk as they enable us to be faster in case of demand shifts. By leveraging our promotion partnerships for launches of key product franchises and by carefully orchestrating launch events across markets and channels, we intend to maintain brand desire and consumer demand at a constantly high level. Open Source also helps us utilize external insights and capabilities in product creation and to drive consumer demand, brand desire, market share and profitability. SEE CORPORATE STRATEGY, P. 50

Macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory and currency risks Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on consumer spending and consumer confidence. Economic downturns, financial market turbulence, currency exchange rate fluctuations and sociopolitical factors such as military conflicts, changes of government, civil unrest, pandemics, nationalization or expropriation, in particular in regions where adidas is strongly represented, therefore could negatively impact the company's business activities and top- and bottomline performance. Currency risks, for example, are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the company, in particular the mismatch of the currencies required for sourcing our products versus the denominations of our sales. Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of noneuro-denominated results into the company's functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on our company's financial performance. SEE NOTE 30, P. 180 In addition, substantial changes in the regulatory environment (e.g. trade restrictions, economic and political sanctions, regulations concerning product compliance, environmental regulations) could lead to potential sales shortfalls or cost increases.
To mitigate these macroeconomic, sociopolitical and regulatory risks, adidas strives to balance sales across key regions and also between developed and emerging markets. We continuously monitor the macroeconomic, political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, so that we are able to quickly adjust our business activities accordingly upon any change in conditions. Potential adjustments may be a reallocation of manufacturing of our products to alternative countries, a reallocation of investments to alternative, more attractive markets, changes in product prices, closure of own-retail stores, more conservative product purchasing, tight working capital management and an increased focus on cost control. To mitigate the risk related to fluctuations in currency

exchange rates, we utilize a centralized currency risk management system and hedge currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance. In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-months horizon. SEE TREASURY, P. 104 By building on our leading position within the sporting goods industry, we actively engage in supporting policymakers and regulators in their efforts to liberalize global trade and curtail trade barriers and also in order to proactively adapt to significant changes in the regulatory environment
IT and cyber security risks Theft, leakage, corruption or unavailability of critical information (e.g. consumer data, employee data, product data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties or the inability to perform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order management, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support and financial reporting, are all dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures or cyber security threats to our infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.
To mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service continuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security program. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity management and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have also secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents.

Risks related to tax and customs regulations Numerous laws and regulations regarding customs and taxes as well as changes in such laws and regulations affect the company's business practices worldwide. Non-compliance with regulations concerning product imports (including calculation of customs values), intercompany transactions or income taxes could lead to substantial financial penalties and additional costs as well as negative media coverage and therefore reputational damage, for example in case of understatements or underpayments of corporate income taxes or customs duties. Changes in regulations regarding customs and taxes may also have a substantial impact on the company's sourcing costs or income taxes. Therefore, we also create provisions in accordance with the relevant accounting regulations to account for potential disputes with customs or tax authorities. The increase in the potential impact of risks relating to tax and customs regulations in 2019 reflects the increasingly aggressive positions being taken by customs and tax authorities in audits.
To proactively manage such risks, we constantly seek expert advice from specialized law and tax advisory firms. We closely monitor changes in legislation in order to properly adopt regulatory requirements regarding customs and taxes. In addition, our internal legal, customs and tax departments advise our operational management teams to ensure appropriate and compliant business practices. Furthermore, we work closely with customs authorities and governments worldwide to make sure we adhere to customs and import regulations and obtain the required clearance of products to fulfill sales demand.
Compliance risks As a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with such laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause significant reputational damage. For example, noncompliance with laws and regulations concerning data

protection and privacy, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to comply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause significant reputational damage and result in a loss of consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our employees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This includes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices, bribery, corruption, discrimination and harassment at the workplace.
Our Fair Play Compliance Framework helps us to prevent, detect and adequately respond to these risks. Our Global Policy Manual provides a framework for basic work procedures and processes and our Fair Play Code of Conduct stipulates that every employee and our business partners shall act ethically in compliance with the laws and regulations of the legal systems where they conduct company business. In addition, our regional compliance managers and local compliance officers guide and advise our operating managers regarding fraud and corruption topics. Furthermore, we utilize controls such as segregation of duties in IT systems and data analytics technology to prevent or detect fraudulent activities. We are also working with external partners and law firms to ensure we are informed about legal requirements across the globe, and we take appropriate action to ensure compliance. To mitigate the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, we have developed a global privacy management framework that introduces the company's privacy principles and provides guidance for the use and deletion of personal information. This framework applies to all adidas businesses worldwide and also sets our expectations of third-party business partners for managing personal information for or on behalf of adidas. Our global privacy officer and the global privacy department are establishing both the framework and

monitoring capabilities to track and report its implementation. In addition, they are continuously providing further implementation guidance and training.
Risks related to organizational structure and change Operating in a dynamic and fast-moving competitive environment, the company needs to cope with constantly changing requirements in respect of the workforce (e.g. adaptability, learning, skillsets, mobility, diversity) and workplace (e.g. flexibility and space management). Improper planning and inadequate or untimely execution of reorganization and transformation initiatives may reduce employee engagement, cause business disruption and inefficiencies, and negatively affect business performance. Frequent organizational changes could cause fatigue among the workforce and lead to reduced efficiency and productivity. A complex organizational structure and unclear roles and responsibilities can lead to delayed or sub-optimal decisionmaking, as well as inefficient and ineffective processes.
We mitigate these risks through continuous, open and transparent communication with our employees. Our Executive Board members as well as the senior management team across the company regularly update employees on organizational changes and openly explain the reasons for change. To adequately manage change and to ensure clarity about roles and responsibilities throughout the organization, we also utilize internal and external experts in project management, change management and communication, who actively educate and engage the workforce to embrace and support new organizational structures and processes. To increase flexibility and adaptability in the workforce and workplace and thereby reduce risks related to organizational change, we implement various mitigating measures such as strategic workforce planning, tailored on-the-job learning programs and development plans for our employees. Through People Pulse we continuously monitor employee satisfaction

and identify potential challenges related to organizational structure and change, which allows us to take appropriate action as early as possible. SEE PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70
ILLUSTRATION OF OPPORTUNITIES
In this report, we illustrate opportunities considered most relevant in 2020 and beyond. According to our assessment methodology, macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory and currency opportunities as well as opportunities related to sustainability are considered material. Our presentation of opportunities in this year's Annual Report differs slightly from the 2018 Annual Report as we changed risk and opportunity categories and therefore consolidated individual opportunities based on these updated categories. Changes in risk assessment are shown on a comparable basis. The assessment is illustrated in the opportunities overview table.
SEE TABLE 103
Macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory and currency opportunities Legislative and regulatory changes such as the elimination of trade barriers due to free trade agreements (e.g. between the European Union and Vietnam) can create cost savings or

potentially open up new channels of distribution and, as a result, positively impact profitability. Changes in local tax or customs regulations (e.g. reduction of tax rates on private incomes, reduction of import duties) could lead to increased consumer spending and consequently positively affect our sales or result in additional cost savings. Favorable exchange rate developments can potentially have a positive impact on the company's financial results. Translation effects from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our company's functional currency, the euro, might also positively impact our company's financial performance. SEE TREASURY,
P. 104
Opportunities related to sustainability We believe that a continued focus on sustainability represents an opportunity for the company, in particular in the medium to long term. While we have already been very successful with our sustainability efforts, we see further upside potential leveraging our leadership position. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78   Consumers are increasingly looking for products composed of more sustainable materials and manufactured in an innovative and yet socially and environmentally responsible way.

and product creation activities, for example in the Outdoor category, we may generate additional sales growth and drive profitability improvements.
Opportunities related to distribution strategy The sporting goods retail environment is changing constantly. We therefore continue to adapt our distribution strategy and have made controlled space SEE GLOSSARY initiatives a priority. This includes the further expansion of our own e-commerce activities, the optimization of our network of wholesale partners with a clear focus on partners that provide consumers with the best shopping experience and customer service, retail space management with key accounts (online and brick & mortar), as well as the introduction and roll-out of new own-retail store formats. Successful results from these initiatives could enable us to accelerate top- and bottom-line growth. SEE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, P. 61
Opportunities related to tax regulations The potential release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, for example in the US, could result in an increase of deferred tax assets and positively impact income tax expense. In addition, changes in local tax regulations may offer the company the option to realize benefits that could result in a reduction of tax expenses and higher net income.

Opportunities related to data analytics Data and analytics play a crucial role in enabling fact-based decision-making. Therefore, we have a dedicated Data & Analytics team to drive business decision-making by leveraging the power of data. The continuous enhancement of our existing capabilities to build and scale insights-driven use cases and the use of the latest technology could bring value to our business operations across the entire company. As a result, we see the opportunity to become faster and more efficient in our operations. We may increase visibility and understanding of consumer preferences, increase full-price sales, reduce discounts and optimize order book management, inventory management and purchasing. This could result in improved financial performance.
Opportunities related to process optimization Continued optimization of key business processes and strict cost control are vital to achieving high profitability and return on invested capital. We are confident that there is still a substantial opportunity to improve process efficiency and effectiveness and further streamline cost structures throughout our company. Consequently, we will continue to focus on driving the standardization and harmonization of processes, as reflected by the company's `ONE adidas' initiative. SEE CORPORATE STRATEGY, P. 50

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTLOOK
ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE VERSUS TARGETS We communicate our financial targets on an annual basis. We also provide updates throughout the year as appropriate. In 2019, the company delivered a strong operational and financial performance. Sales development was favorably impacted by rising consumer spending on sporting goods, supported by global trends such as increasing penetration of sportswear (`athleisure'), increasing health awareness and rising sports participation rates. SEE ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, P. 95 The continued brand momentum, supported by innovative product launches and inspiring marketing campaigns, as well as the successful execution of the company's strategic business plan `Creating the New' drove robust sales growth and strong profitability improvements. We maintained our full-year outlook throughout the year and delivered top- and bottom-line results within the respective guidance ranges.
SEE TABLE 104
In 2019, revenues increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, in line with our guidance of 5%-8% growth. This development was driven by increases across all market segments including Europe, which returned to growth in the second half of the year. Our direct-to-consumer business grew at a double-digit rate, with e-commerce recording another year of exceptional growth. Supply chain shortages, which we had experienced following a strong increase in demand for mid-priced apparel, weighed on our top-line growth, particularly in the first half of the year. Consequently, revenues grew 4% on a currencyneutral basis in the first six months of 2019 before accelerating

in the second half of the year as our mitigating actions showed the planned effect and we resolved the issue. The gross margin ended the year at 52.0%, as expected, reflecting an increase of 0.2 percentage points. Lower sourcing costs, positive currency developments as well as a better product and channel mix more than offset higher air freight costs to mitigate supply chain shortages and a less favorable pricing mix. The operating margin also developed as anticipated. At the beginning of the year we guided for an increase to 11.3%11.5% and achieved a level of 11.3%. On top of the gross margin increase, lower other operating expenses as a percentage of sales supported this development. Net income from continuing operations increased 12% to 1.918billion, including the negative impact from the first-time application of IFRS 16, and as such reached the upper end of our guidance of 8%-12% growth. SEE INCOME STATEMENT, P. 96

In 2019, average operating working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year at a level of 18.1%, which reflects a yearover-year improvement of 0.9 percentage points. Our guidance for operating working capital was for a slight increase. The better-than-expected development mainly reflects an increase in payables, which is a direct result of improved payment terms with our vendors. Capital expenditure amounted to 711million in 2019, compared to our guidance of up to 900 million. Investments were mainly focused on controlled space initiatives of the adidas and Reebok brands, aimed at further strengthening our own-retail activities in our own stores and e-commerce, franchise store presence and shop-in-shop presentations. Other areas of investment included logistics infrastructure and IT systems as well as the further development of our major corporate facilities in Herzogenaurach, Portland and Shanghai.

Beyond our financial performance, we also actively monitor non-financial KPIs. SEE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, P. 92
In 2019, our Net Promoter Score (NPS) stayed on high levels, reflecting the strength of our brands. Also from a market share perspective, we continue to be very encouraged by our strong performance in key categories and key markets, as defined in the company's strategic business plan. In our two strategic growth markets, North America and Greater China, we once again saw market share gains. Our diligence and discipline in sustainability matters continues to yield strong recognition for our company. In 2019, adidas was again represented in a variety of high-profile sustainability indices. For the 20th consecutive time, we were selected to join the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), the world's first global sustainability index family tracking the performance of the leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide. adidas was assessed to be among the global top 10% bestperforming companies in its industry in economic, environmental and social criteria, and received industry-best scores in criteria including Brand Management, Environmental Policy & Management Systems, Operational Eco-Efficiency and Social Reporting. SEE SUSTAINABILITY, P. 78 As we are convinced that our employees' feedback plays a crucial role in our pursuit of creating a desirable work environment, we continued to leverage insights that we gain from `People Pulse', our global approach and system platform for quarterly measurement of the level of employee satisfaction. In 2019, People Pulse saw again high response rates. On average, our employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) remained stable in 2019 compared to the previous year. People Pulse results are not only leveraged for general feedback on the employee experience at adidas, but also as a tool to gather employee insights regarding important elements of our strategy. SEE
PEOPLE AND CULTURE, P. 70

Finally, we continue to enjoy an overall strong level of on-time in-full (OTIF) deliveries to our customers and own-retail stores. In 2019, OTIF remained stable compared to the prior year level. SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS, P. 63
ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Our Risk Management team aggregates all risks and opportunities reported by Risk Owners and Executive Board members through the half-yearly risk and opportunity assessment process. Results from this process are analyzed and reported to the Executive Board accordingly. In addition, the Executive Board discusses and assesses risks and opportunities on a regular basis. SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT, P. 120 Taking into account the potential financial impact as well as the likelihood of the risks explained in this report materializing, and considering the strong balance sheet as well as the current business outlook, we do not foresee any material jeopardy to the viability of the company as a going concern. This assessment is also supported by the historical response to our financing demands. adidas therefore has not sought an official rating by any of the leading rating agencies. We remain confident that our earnings strength forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides the resources necessary to pursue the opportunities available to the company. Compared to the prior year, our assessment of certain risks has changed in terms of likelihood of occurrence and/or potential financial impact. The changes in risks and opportunities balance out, leaving the overall adidas risk profile largely unchanged compared to the prior year.

ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL OUTLOOK In March 2015, adidas unveiled `Creating the New', our 2020 strategic business plan, which defines strategic priorities and objectives for the period up to 2020. The strategy is designed to drive brand desirability which, in turn, is expected to spur top- and bottom-line growth.
In March 2017, `Creating the New' was updated with complementary initiatives in order to grow the top and bottom line even faster than initially projected. Consequently, we had increased our financial targets for 2020. We project currencyneutral revenues to increase at a rate of 10% to 12% on average per year until 2020 compared to the 2015 results. Net income from continuing operations is expected to grow at a higher rate than the top line. While in March 2017 we projected net income from continuing operations to expand by 20% to 22% on average per year during the five-year period, we once again upgraded our long-term profitability target in March 2018 following the strong operational and financial performance in 2017. As a result, we expect net income from continuing operations to grow by 22% to 24% on average per year in the period between 2015 and 2020. SEE CORPORATE
STRATEGY, P. 50
Our successes since initiating `Creating the New', as measured by financial as well as non-financial KPIs, are a direct consequence of our relentless execution and focus on this strategy. Throughout 2020, the whole organization will stay focused on successfully completing our current strategic business plan, before we announce details on the next strategic cycle in November 2020.
Against the background of rising consumer spending, increasing penetration of sportswear (`athleisure') and growing health awareness in most geographical areas, we project further significant top-line improvements in 2020. The revenue increase is to be driven by our extensive pipeline of

new product launches paired with brand-building activities. In addition, the further expansion and improvement of our controlled space initiatives, in particular through our own e-commerce channel, is expected to contribute to the sales growth. Last but not least, major sporting events such as the UEFA EURO 2020 and the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo will support this positive development. In combination with tight control of both our inventory levels and our cost base, we expect to generate strong profitability improvements also in 2020. Supported by further operating margin expansion, our bottom line is again expected to increase at a double-digit rate in 2020. SEE OUTLOOK, P. 117
We believe our outlook for 2020 realistically describes the underlying development of the company. However, the outlook for 2020 as outlined in this report is subject to change depending on the further developments related to the coronavirus outbreak. Our business in Greater China performed strongly in the first three weeks of 2020. However, since then we have been experiencing a material negative impact on our operations in China. As the situation keeps evolving, the magnitude of the overall impact on our business in 2020 cannot be quantified reliably at this point in time. Accordingly, the company's outlook for 2020 as outlined in this report does not reflect any impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
SEE OUTLOOK, P. 117
In addition, ongoing uncertainties regarding the economic outlook and consumer sentiment in both developed and emerging economies as well as persisting high levels of currency volatility represent risks to the achievement of our stated financial goals and aspirations. SEE ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, P. 95 No other material event between the end of 2019 and the publication of this report has altered our view.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

NOTES
adidasAG is a listed German stock corporation and parent of the adidas Group located at Adi-Dassler-Str.1, 91074 Herzogenaurach, Germany, and is entered into the commercial register at the Local Court of Fürth (HRB 3868). adidasAG and its subsidiaries (collectively `adidas', `the Group' or `the company') design, develop, produce and market a broad range of athletic and sports lifestyle products.
01 » GENERAL The consolidated financial statements of adidasAG as at December31,2019 comprise adidasAG and its subsidiaries and are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as to be applied in the European Union (EU) as at December31,2019, and the additional requirements pursuant to § 315e section 1 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch ­ HGB).
The following new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards and interpretations are effective for financial years beginning on January1,2019 and have been applied for the first time to these consolidated financial statements: ---- IFRS16 Leases (EU effective date: January1, 2019): The
new standard replaces the guidance in IAS17 `Leases' and the respective interpretations IFRIC4 `Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease', SIC-15 `Operating Leases ­ Incentives' and SIC-27 `Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease'. For lessees, IFRS16 eliminates the required classification of leases into operating and finance leases in accordance with IAS17, replacing it with a single accounting model requiring lessees to recognize a rightof-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for leases with a lease term of more than twelve months. In contrast, IFRS16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting

requirements in IAS17. The new standard had a significant impact on the company's consolidated statement of financial position upon initial application. adidas has a significant number of rental arrangements and leases worldwide which were classified as leases under IAS 17 ­ mainly pertaining to more than 2,500 rented own-retail stores as well as rented offices and warehouses. adidas applied IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019 and transitioned to IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach with no adjustments to the 2018 comparative financial information, using practical expedients as described below. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the implementation of IFRS 16 are therefore recognized in the opening statement of financial position on January 1, 2019. adidas elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date, adidas relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 `Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease'. Therefore, the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019. The company collected real estate lease contracts in its global real estate lease management system, which captures the relevant information from real estate lease contracts. Additionally, adidas implemented a technical system to ensure the administration of data from non-real estate lease contracts and a lease engine to guarantee IFRS 16-compliant accounting valuations and measurements. Amounts paid for software licensing and leases are not within the scope of IFRS 16 and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38. At initial application of IFRS 16, adidas elected to use the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:

---- the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than twelve months as at January 1, 2019, as short-term leases;
---- the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset as at January 1, 2019;
---- the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease; and
---- no adjustments at January 1, 2019, for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
Until December 31, 2018, adidas as a lessee classified leases as operating leases or finance leases under IAS 17. The vast majority of the company's lease contracts were classified as operating lease contracts and the respective rent expense was expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At transition, for leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17, lease liabilities were recognized and measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of adidas as at January 1, 2019. Right-of-use assets were initially measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments recognized at December 31, 2018, for that specific lease. For leases previously classified as finance leases, adidas recognized the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability according to IAS 17 at December 31, 2018, as the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability according to IFRS 16 at January 1, 2019. Under IFRS 16, lease expenses are presented by straight-line depreciation charges on the right-of-use assets and interest expenses due to the compounding of the lease liabilities in accordance with the effective interest method. Fixed payments on operating leases which were expensed under IAS 17 are eliminated under IFRS 16. These changes resulted in a negative impact on the company's net income from continuing operations in the amount of  54 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Due to the presentation of lease payments as financing activities under IFRS 16, the cash flows from operating activities increased while the cash flows from financing activities declined accordingly. This resulted in a decline in cash flows from financing activities in the amount of  692 million and an improvement in cash flows from operating activities in the amount of  684 million. No adjustments result from the first-time application of IFRS 16 in retained earnings. Further information about current accounting methods under IFRS 16 and the impact of IFRS 16 initial application at adidas is provided in these Notes. SEE NOTES 02, 12 AND 21 IFRS9 Amendment ­ Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (EU effective date: January1,2019): The amendment offers additional guidance on how to classify prepayable financial assets according to IFRS9 and it clarifies the accounting for financial liabilities following a modification. adidas does not have any financial assets with prepayment features. Additionally, the company did not modify financial liabilities. Therefore, this amendment did not have any impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. ---- IAS 19 Amendment ­ Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (EU effective date: January 1, 2019): The amendment makes it mandatory to determine the current service cost and net interest for the period using the assumptions used for remeasurement when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs. This amendment did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- IAS 28 Amendment ­ Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (EU effective date: January 1, 2019): The amendment clarifies that IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments' ­ including the impairment requirements ­ should be applied to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture forming part of a net investment but for which the equity method is not applied. adidas does not

have long-term interests in an associate or joint venture forming part of a net investment but for which the equity method is not applied, and which was not already accounted for according to IFRS 9. Therefore, the amendment did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- IFRIC23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (EU effective date: January1,2019): This new interpretation applies to income taxes within the scope of IAS 12 `Income Taxes' and clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. In the case of uncertainty regarding the determination of taxable profit/tax loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates under IAS 12, this interpretation must be applied. This interpretation has no impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- Improvements to IFRS (2015­2017) ­ Amendments to IFRS3, IFRS11, IAS12 and IAS23 (EU effective date: January1, 2019): These improvements include amendments to IFRS 3 which clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business that was previously a joint operation the entity must remeasure its previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify that an entity does not remeasure previously held interests in a business when it assumes joint control of a joint operation. The amendments to IFRS 3 and IFRS 11 did not have an impact as the aforementioned transactions did not take place during the year ending December 31, 2019. The amendments to IAS 12 clarify that the income tax effects resulting from dividend payments should be presented in the same manner as the income from which the dividends are derived. In other words, the income tax consequences from dividends should be shown in profit or loss unless the dividend relates to income which is recorded in equity or other comprehensive income. These amendments did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments to IAS 23 specify that when a qualifying asset has become ready for its intended sale or use, any outstanding borrowed amount is

no longer used in the calculation of the capitalization rate for the specific qualifying asset, but instead used in the general capitalization rate for borrowings. adidas currently capitalizes the borrowing costs for one qualifying asset. The amendments to IAS 23 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
New standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and interpretations are usually not applied by adidas before the EU effective date.
New standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU which are effective for financial years beginning after January 1, 2019, and which have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements are: ---- IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39 Amendments ­ Interest Rate
Benchmark Reform (EU effective date: January 1, 2020): The amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements, so that entities would apply those hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows from the hedging instrument are based will not be altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments apply for all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. During the last financial year adidas did not conclude or possess any hedge instruments which were affected by the changes. Therefore, this amendment is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- IAS 1 and IAS 8 Amendment ­ Definition of Material (EU effective date: January1,2020): The amendment clarifies the definition of `material'. and aligns the definition used in the Conceptual Framework with the accounting standards

themselves. This amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- General Amendments ­ References to the Conceptual Framework (EU effective date: January 1, 2020): The amendments update references to the Conceptual Framework in individual standards. This amendment is not expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. The following new standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB. These are not yet endorsed by the EU and hence have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: ---- IFRS3 Amendment ­ Definition of a Business (IASB effective date: January1,2020): The amendment adds additional guidance in order to help entities determine whether they have acquired a business or a group of assets. This amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- IFRS17 ­ Insurance Contracts (IASB effective date: January1, 2021): The new standard regulates the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain insurance contracts that influence the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Insurance contracts which the entity issues, reinsurance contracts the entity holds, and investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued by the entity are all within the scope of the standard. IFRS17 replaces IFRS4 `Insurance Contracts', which is currently not applied by the company. Therefore, the standard is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. ---- IAS 1 Amendment ­ Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (IASB effective date: January 1, 2022): The amendment clarifies the classification of current and non-current liabilities when presenting amounts in the statement of

financial position. This amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have in principle been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of certain items in the statement of financial position such as financial instruments, derivative financial instruments and plan assets, which are measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro () and, unless otherwise stated, all values are presented in millions of euro (inmillions). Due to rounding principles, numbers presented may not exactly sum up to totals provided. This can lead to individual amounts rounded to zero.
02 » SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidation, accounting and valuation principles described below.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidasAG and all its direct and indirect subsidiaries, which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles. An entity is considered a subsidiary if it is controlled by adidasAG. Control exists when adidas is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The number of consolidated subsidiaries developed as follows in 2019 and 2018, respectively:

Number of consolidated subsidiaries

The subsidiaries are held either directly by adidasAG or indirectly via the two holding companies adidas Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH in Germany or adidas International B.V. in the Netherlands.
A schedule of the shareholdings of adidasAG is shown in Attachment I to the consolidated financial statements. SEE SHAREHOLDINGS, P. 208 This schedule comprises information about the name, domicile, currency and equity of all consolidated subsidiaries as well as the respective share held in the capital of these subsidiaries. Furthermore, the schedule of the shareholdings of adidasAG is published on the electronic platform of the German Federal Gazette.
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation, all acquired assets and liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value at the acquisition date. A debit difference between the acquisition cost and the proportionate fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill. A credit difference is recorded in the income statement after a reassessment of the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities has been performed. In cases where not all of the shares in the investment in a subsidiary are acquired, a non-controlling interest measured

The financial effects of intercompany transactions as well as any unrealized gains and losses arising from intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Principles of measurement The table includes an overview of selected subsequent measurement principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Financial assets are classified and measured according to IFRS9. All purchases and sales of financial assets, with the exception of trade receivables, are recognized on the trade date and initially measured at fair value. At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price. Subsequently, a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument), fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instrument) or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: a financial asset which is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (business model `Hold to collect') and the financial asset's contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A debt security is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: financial asset which is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (business model `Hold to collect and sell') and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In principle, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. At initial recognition, an entity may make an irrevocable election to

Financial assets are only reclassified when the business model for managing financial assets is changed, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets is as follows:

All financial assets which are not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Subsequent measurement principle

Fair value through profit or loss

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.

Amortized cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.

Fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument)

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, accumulated gains and losses are reclassified to profit or loss.

Fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instrument)

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

Currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate valid at the transaction date to the foreign currency amount.
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries, monetary items denominated in non-functional currencies of the subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in the income statement.
Assets and liabilities of the company's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated using closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date into the presentation currency, the euro, which is also the functional currency of adidasAG. For practical reasons, revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates. All cumulative differences from the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate item within shareholders' equity without affecting the income statement.

A summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as follows:

Hyperinflation To reflect changes in purchasing power at the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income at subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies are restated in terms of a measuring unit current at the balance sheet date.
SEE NOTE 35 These are indexed using a general price index in accordance with IAS29 `Financial Reporting in Hyper inflationary Economies'. However, no restatement is required for monetary assets and liabilities carried at amounts current at the end of the balance sheet date (such as net realizable value or fair value as well as for monetary items), because they represent money held, to be received or to be paid.
Gains and losses from hyperinflation are included in the financial result.
Non-monetary assets that have been restated following the guidance in IAS29 are still subject to impairment assessment in accordance with the guidance in the relevant IFRSs.

Discontinued operations A component of the company's business whose operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the company is classified as a discontinued operation if the component either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and: ---- represents a separate major line of business or geographic
area of operations, ---- is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographic area of operations, or ---- is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows are restated and presented as if the operation had been classified as such from the start of the comparative year.
Derivative financial instruments adidas uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency options, forward exchange contracts, stock price options as well as forward stock transactions and currency swaps, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and stock price risks. In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the company does not enter into transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value, and subsequently also measured at their fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gains or losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, adidas designates derivatives as either a hedge of a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. In applying cash flow hedge accounting only the spot element of foreign exchange deals and the

ADIDAS

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

intrinsic value of currency options are designated (spot-tospot designation).
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or net investments that are effective as defined in IFRS9 are recognized in equity.
adidas applies the `cost of hedging' approach for dedicated cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the time value component of options, as well as the forward element in forward contracts are recognized separately in equity. When the effectiveness is not 100%, the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value is recognized in the income statement. Accumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing are recognized in equity with the exception of the cross-currency basis spread.
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the company's risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IFRS9.
adidas documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions at transaction inception. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific firm commitments and forecast transactions. adidas also assesses the effectiveness and possible ineffectiveness of its hedged derivatives by using generally accepted methods of effectiveness testing, such as the `hypothetical derivative

method' or the `dollar offset method'. The economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is qualitative and quantitative ascertainable and adidas judges the effectiveness of the hedging relationship with the hypothetical derivative method. The main sources of expected ineffectiveness are due to changes in the credit risk and in the timing of the hedged transactions.
The fair values of currency options, forward exchange contracts and forward stock transactions are determined on the basis of market conditions on the reporting date. The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally accepted models. The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by additional factors, such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. The company determines fair values taking the counterparty risk into consideration.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition such as commercial papers and investments in money market funds.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Part of cash equivalents includes investments in money market funds. Classification and measurement under IFRS9 are performed based on the company's business model for managing these financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Investments in money market funds contain cash flows other than those of principal and interest on principal. As a result, those investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Short-term financial assets Investments in money market funds which do not fulfill the criteria of cash equivalents are shown under short-term financial assets. These are classified at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated income statement as they occur.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognized at the transaction price, which represents the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Subsequently, these are measured at amortized cost.
Other financial assets Other financial assets are classified and measured under IFRS9 based on the company's business model for managing these assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Those other financial assets that give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and are assigned to the business model `Hold to collect' are measured at amortized cost. adidas mainly has security deposits and receivables from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces which fall under this category.
Other financial assets which are neither within the business model `Hold to collect' nor `Hold to collect and sell' are measured at fair value through profit or loss. This category mainly includes secured promissory notes and earn-out components.
Long-term financial assets Long-term financial assets are distinguished between debt and equity instruments and classified according to IFRS 9 as follows:

ADIDAS

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Debt instruments are measured depending on the company's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual cash flows. Only financial assets that are held within the business model `Hold to collect' with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows which represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on a specific date are measured at amortized cost. adidas classifies certain loans within this category. All other financial assets which do not fulfill one of these criteria are measured at fair value ­ either at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt). adidas has no long-term financial assets in the category fair value through comprehensive income (debt instrument) and shows loans which do not fulfill the contractual cash flow characteristics in the category fair value through profit or loss.
Generally, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
adidas has designated certain investments as equity securities as at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity), because these investments represent investments that the company intends to hold for long-term strategic purposes. The designation of certain equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is based on a strategic Management decision.
Inventories Finished goods and merchandise are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Costs are determined using a standard valuation method, the `average cost method'. Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials, direct labor and the

components of the manufacturing overheads which can be reasonably attributed to finished goods. The allocation of overheads is based on the planned average utilization. The net realizable value allowances are computed consistently throughout the company based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand.
Assets/liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale Assets/liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale are primarily non-current assets and liabilities expected to be realized principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. These are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated on a straightline basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at amortized cost. This comprises all costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is recognized for those assets, with the exception of land and construction in progress, over the estimated useful life utilizing the `straight-line method' and taking into account any potential residual value, except where the `declining-balance method' is more appropriate in light of the actual utilization pattern. Parts of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item are depreciated separately.

Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment

Land Buildings and leasehold improvements Furniture and fixtures Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment

Years indefinite
20­50 3­5
2­10

Expenditure for repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated separately, if the recognition criteria are met.
Impairment losses on non-financial assets If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g. property, plant and equipment and intangible assets including goodwill) might be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined. This is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal (net disposal price) and value in use. Non-financial items measured at the recoverable amount primarily relate to impaired property, plant and equipment being measured based on value in use or on fair value taking unobservable inputs (e.g. profit or cash flow planning) into account. The fair value is measured at Level3 according to IFRS13 `Fair Value Measurement'.
An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses or reported in goodwill impairment losses if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for

internal management purposes. If there is an impairment loss for a group of cash-generating units, first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the group of cash-generating units is reduced. Subsequently, provided that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the other non-current assets of the group of cash-generating units are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the group of cash-generating units. In allocating an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an individual asset is not reduced below its fair value. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cash-generating unit and groups of cash-generating units.
The impairment test for trademarks with indefinite useful lives is performed on the relevant level of cash-generating units.
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (in particular trademarks) and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually on September30 for impairment.
An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible. With respect to all other impaired assets, an impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed affecting the income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortization) if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Impairment losses on financial assets Impairment losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument) are recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments'. The standard requires that not only

historical data, but also future expectations and projections are taken into consideration when accounting for impairment losses (`expected credit loss' model).
adidas consistently applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all accounts receivable. In order to calculate a collective loss allowance, all accounts receivable sharing similar credit risk characteristics are allocated into several portfolios based on geographical regions and macroeconomic indicators. Historical payment and aging patterns for accounts receivable are analyzed individually for each of the portfolios to determine the probability of default which is further adjusted by forwardlooking factors derived primarily from the Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads of the countries where adidas runs its operations. The adjusted probability of default is then applied in combination with a loss given default and exposure at default as a percentage rate to calculate the expected credit loss for each portfolio and aging bucket. The percentage rates are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they reflect latest data on credit risk. In case objective evidence of credit impairment is observed for accounts receivable from a specific customer, a detailed analysis of the credit risk is performed and an appropriate individual loss allowance is recognized for this customer. Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when it is expected that the debtor will not fulfill its credit obligations toward adidas.
Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to a general impairment approach under IFRS9. adidas applies the low credit risk exemption for the majority of such instruments due to the low credit risk for these investments, which is based upon the investment grade of their counterparties (defined by the company as equivalent of BBB+ or higher). A significant increase of credit risk is assumed for cash and cash equivalents when the instruments are more than 30 days past due. adidas monitors the credit

risk associated with cash and cash equivalents taking into consideration the economic environment, external credit ratings and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions and using established exposure limits. Expected credit loss of cash and cash equivalents is calculated based on the probability of default and recovery rates derived from CDS spreads or external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cash and cash equivalents are considered to be in default when they are more than 90 days past due.
Other financial assets within the scope of IFRS9 impairment analysis include mainly security deposits as well as accounts receivable regarding credit card companies and electronic marketplaces.
Objective evidence that credit impairment of financial assets has occurred includes, for instance, significant financial difficulty of the debtor/issuer, indications of their potential bankruptcy, the deterioration of the market for their products and general macroeconomic problems. The gross carrying amount of financial assets is written off when adidas, based on a case-by-case assessment, assumes that their recovery is no longer possible.
Impairment losses on accounts receivable are presented in the line item `Impairment losses (net) on accounts receivable and contract assets' while impairment losses on all other financial assets are shown in the line item `Financial expenses' in the consolidated income statement.
Leases adidas assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease according to IFRS 16 `Leases' at the inception of the contract. IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset if the lessee has the right

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset (e.g. by having the exclusive right to use the asset throughout that period) and the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use.
In its role as a lessee, adidas leases various types of assets, particularly buildings (retail stores, offices, warehouses, etc.), land, technical equipment and machinery (warehouse equipment, production machines, etc.), motor vehicles, computer hardware as well as furniture and fixtures. Lease contracts are typically negotiated for fixed periods of up to 99 years but may include extension or termination options. Lease terms are negotiated individually and may contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
adidas makes use of the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e. value of the underlying asset, when new, is  5,000 or less) and short-term leases (shorter than twelve months and the agreement does not include a purchase option). The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Real estate and automobile leases are excluded from the classification as low-value assets.
Furthermore, adidas exercises the option for lessees to combine lease payments with payments for non-lease components in the calculation of the lease liability and rightof-use asset for all lease asset classes except for real estate.
adidas recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. At the commencement date, adidas initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. This includes fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments based on an index or a

rate, amounts expected to be payable by adidas under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if adidas is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, adidas uses its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, adidas uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, adjusted to reflect the country-specific risk, the contract currency-specific risk and the lease term.
After the commencement date, lease payments are split into redemption payments and interest payments. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest cost on the lease liability using the effective interest rate and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured provided any reassessments/ lease modifications occur (including changes in the assessment of whether an extension or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised).
At the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and an estimate of costs to be incurred by adidas in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. In principle, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a

straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset, whichever is shorter.
adidas applies judgement in determining the lease term for lease contracts including extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised has an impact on the lease term and therefore may significantly affect the measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, respectively.
In rare cases, adidas acts as a lessor when the company signs sub-leasing contracts for real estate properties with third parties. These contracts are not material to the company's consolidated financial statements.
adidas does not own any investment property.
Goodwill Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. This results when the purchase cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets received, liabilities and contingent liabilities are treated as assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the respective reporting entity, and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the initial consolidation.
Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity.
Intangible assets (except goodwill) Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (in particular trademarks) are recognized at purchase cost and are subject to an impairment test at least on an annual basis (`impairmentonly' approach).

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are valued at amortized cost. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, taking into account any potential residual value.
Expenditure during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets is capitalized as incurred if it fulfills the recognition criteria under IAS38 `Intangible Assets'.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Research and development Research costs are expensed in full as incurred. Development costs for internally generated intangible assets are also expensed as incurred if they do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS38 `Intangible Assets', paragraph57.
Borrowings and other liabilities Borrowings (e.g. eurobonds) and other liabilities are recognized at fair value using the `effective interest method', net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, long-term borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the `effective interest method'. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the term of the borrowing.

Compound financial instruments (e.g. convertible bonds) are divided into a liability component shown under borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights. The equity component is included in the capital reserve. The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the interest and principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights, applying risk-adjusted interest rates. The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the `effective interest method'. The equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component and is reported within equity. There is no subsequent measurement of the equity component. At initial recognition, directly attributable transaction costs are assigned to the equity and liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective carrying amounts.
Provisions and accrued liabilities Provisions are recognized where a present obligation (legal or constructive) to third parties has been incurred as a result of a past event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow of resources, and where the timing or amount is uncertain. Non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is material.
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not been paid, invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees. Here, however, the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not uncertain.
Pensions and similar obligations Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the company's obligations for defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their

service during the current and prior periods. These benefit accruals are discounted to calculate their present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net liability. The discount rate is set on the basis of yields of high-quality fixed-rate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a deep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency. Otherwise, government bond yields are used as a reference. Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the `projected unit credit method' in accordance with IAS19 `Employee Benefits'. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of adidas. Additionally, contingent liabilities may be present obligations that arise from past events but which are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed and explained in the Notes.  SEE NOTE 40
Treasury shares When adidas AG shares are repurchased and recognized as treasury shares, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognized as a deduction from equity. The nominal value of 1 per treasury share is debited to share capital. Any premium or discount to the nominal value is shown as an adjustment to the capital reserve. If treasury shares are sold or re-issued, the nominal value of the shares will be credited to share capital and the amount exceeding the nominal value will be added to the capital reserve.

ADIDAS

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Contract assets and contract liabilities Contract assets and liabilities are recognized in connection with revenues arising from the licensing-out of the right to use the adidas and Reebok brands to third parties. Contract assets represent the company's right to consideration in exchange for rights that adidas has transferred to a third party and contract liabilities represent the company's obligation to transfer rights to a third party for which adidas has already received consideration from the third party. The subsequent measurement of contract assets follows the impairment-only approach for financial assets within the scope of IFRS9. Contract liabilities are measured at the expected settlement amount.
Revenue Revenue derived from the sale of goods is recognized when adidas has satisfied the respective performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer. The goods are transferred at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods. The timing of the transfer of control depends on the individual terms of the sales agreement (terms of delivery).
The amount of recognizable revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, early payment discounts and rebates.
Under certain conditions and in accordance with contractual agreements, the company's customers have the right to return products and to either exchange them for similar or other products or to return the products against the issuance of a credit note. Amounts for estimated returns related to revenues are accrued based on past experience of average return rates and average actual return periods by means of a refund liability. The return assets are measured at the former carrying amount of the inventories/products, less any handling costs and any potential impairment.

Provided that the customers meet certain predefined conditions, adidas grants its customers different types of globally aligned performance-based rebates. Examples are rebates for customers' sales growth for adidas products, and loyalty as well as sell-out support, e.g. through retail space/ franchise store management. As soon as it is assumed that the customer fulfills the requirem ents for being granted the rebate, this amount is accrued by means of an accrued liability for marketing and sales. Customer incentives which were not contractually agreed upon as well as promises that were implied by adidas' customary business practice and did not bear the characteristics of a discount are accounted for as marketing and point-of-sale expenses.
Customer incentives and options as well as any obligation for adidas to pay for the delivery of goods to the customer do not create separate performance obligations under IFRS15 and are separated from revenue.
In addition, adidas generates revenue from the licensing-out of the right to use the adidas and Reebok brands to third parties. The resulting sales-based royalty and commission income is recognized based on the contract terms on an accrual basis. Contracts with guaranteed minimum income result in contract assets and contract liabilities depending on the timing of yearly payments received from customers. The performance obligation related to these contract assets and liabilities is satisfied over the life of the contract, whereby payments are recorded as arranged in the contract with the customer.
Advertising and promotional expenditure Advance payments for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses within other current and non-current assets until the services are received, and upon receipt expensed in full. Significant costs for media campaigns are expensed on a straight-line basis over the duration of the media campaign.

Promotional expenses including one-time up-front payments for promotion contracts are principally expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement.
Interest Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred using the `effective interest method' with the exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. This interest is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset.
Government grants adidas receives performance-based government grants in the form of subsidies, subventions or premiums from local, national or international government authorities such as those of the Free State of Bavaria, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union.
Performance-based government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and that the company satisfies the conditions attached.
Performance-based grants are reported in the consolidated income statement as a deduction from the related expenses.
Income taxes Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the countries in which adidas operates.
adidas computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of its assets and liabilities as well as for tax loss carry-forwards. As it is not permitted to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial recognition of goodwill, adidas does not compute any deferred taxes thereon.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the entity concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit.
Income tax is recognized in the income statement except unless it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.
When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, adidas recognizes and measures current or deferred tax assets or liabilities applying the requirements of IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. On a case-by-case basis, adidas determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
Where it is not considered probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, adidas reflects the effects of the uncertainty by using one of the following methods, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty: ---- the single most likely amount ---- the expected value based on the sum of the probability-
weighted amounts.
In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profits (tax losses), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, adidas assumes that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and will have full knowledge of all relevant information when making those examinations.

Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model. SEE NOTE 28 That cost is recognized in personnel expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the fair value of awards at the grant date, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. If the estimate is changed, even a credit in the income statement for the period can be possible as it reflects the movement in cumulative expenses from the beginning to the end of that period.
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met.
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are generally measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.

For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with all changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.
Change of presentation There was a change in the presentation of interest paid in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the financial year. Due to the first-time application of IFRS 16, adidas has applied the option to show the interest paid within the net cash used in financing activities instead of the net cash generated from operating activities and, to enhance comparability, the prior year was also adjusted.
Estimation uncertainties and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Although such estimates are based on the best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the respective Notes, which include in particular goodwill SEE NOTE 13, trademarks
SEE NOTE 14, other provisions SEE NOTE 20, pensions SEE NOTE 25, derivatives SEE NOTE 30, income taxes SEE NOTE 36, as well as litigation and other legal risks SEE NOTE 40.

03 » DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The results of the Rockport, TaylorMade and CCM Hockey operations that were sold in previous periods are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement.
The net result of discontinued operations presented in the consolidated income statement for the year ending December31,2019 mainly relates to a fair value adjustment of the earn-out component as well as actual earn-out received related to the sale of the TaylorMade business. The increase in fair value is attributable to adjusted future EBITDA-value estimates. In 2019, adidas received a cash consideration of US $ 25 million. In addition, the promissory note, which was part of the initial purchase price, increased by US $ 25 million. The fair value of the earn-out component at December  31, 2019 amounts to US $ 50 million (2018: US $ 24 million).
Gains from discontinued operations for the year ending December 31, 2019 in an amount of  59 million (2018: losses of  5 million) are entirely attributable to the shareholders of adidas AG. The tax benefit in respect of discontinued operations is  4 million (2018:  4 million).

04 » FIRST-TIME CONSOLIDATION/DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Effective as of December 2019, an amendment to the contractual arrangements existing between Agron, Inc. and adidas entered into force granting adidas the power to approve key financial and operational targets as well as the organizational structure of Agron, Inc. adidas has the right to, and is exposed to, the returns from its contractual business relations with Agron, Inc., which are dependent on the level of its net sales and overall profitability. As a result of the extended power, adidas has the ability to directly influence the amount of these variable returns and consequently obtained control over Agron, Inc. Therefore, a fair value of its assets and liabilities was consolidated for the first time into the company's consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019. In addition, starting from January 1, 2020, income and expenses of Agron, Inc. will be included in the company's consolidated income statement. As adidas holds no equity interests of Agron, Inc., both net assets as well as income and expenses are attributable entirely to the noncontrolling interest. adidas has not transferred any consideration to the owners of Agron, Inc. in relation to the amendment of the contractual arrangements. The effect of the first-time consolidation was reflected entirely within the equity and neither goodwill nor a gain from a bargain purchase has been recognized.

The following assets and liabilities of Agron, Inc. were recognized at the date of first-time consolidation in the company's consolidated statement of financial position based on the preliminary fair value calculation:

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Financial statements of Agron, Inc. as at December 31, 2019 (adidas reporting date) were not available by the time the consolidated financial statements of adidas were prepared. Therefore, financial statements of Agron, Inc. as at November 30, 2019 were used instead. Those statements were adjusted for the effects of significant transactions that occurred between November 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019.
The following valuation methods for the recognized assets were applied: ---- Inventories: The fair value of inventory was measured using
the cost approach. Realized margins were added to the book values to calculate the selling price. Marketing and logistic costs were then deducted from the selling price. ---- Other intangible assets: The fair value of the license agreement between Agron, Inc. and adidas America, Inc. was determined by discounting future profits after taxes until the end of the contract term on December 31, 2024.
For the year ending December 31, 2019 no net sales as well as no income and expenses of Agron, Inc. were included in the company's consolidated income statement. If the firsttime consolidation had occurred on January 1, 2019, the company's total net sales would have been  24,055 million while net income attributable to shareholders would have remained unchanged at  1,976 million for the year ending December 31, 2019.

As at April 15, 2019 (closing date), the company formally completed the divestiture of its Global Merchandising, S.L. subsidiary. The final purchase price amounted to  3 million in total, received in cash. All contractually agreed closing net assets were transferred by adidas at the closing date. In 2019, a resulting loss from this transaction in an amount of  4 million was accounted for as other operating expenses.
The following assets and liabilities were derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position as a result of the completed divestiture of Global Merchandising, S.L.:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
05 » CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits.
Short-term deposits are only shown as cash and cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.The credit risk of cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost is insignificant due to their short-term maturity, counterparties' investment grade credit ratings and established exposure limits. Therefore, adidas does not recognize any credit impairment losses for these financial assets.
Further information about cash and cash equivalents is presented in these Notes. SEE NOTE 30
06 » SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS Short-term financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated income statement as they occur. The majority of short-term financial assets are marketable securities which are mainly investments in money market funds.

As a general principle, it is regularly assessed whether there are any indications that property, plant and equipment might be impaired. Irrespective of the existence of such indications, furniture and fixtures in own-retail stores are tested annually for impairment whereby the recoverable amount is calculated using the `discounted cash flow method' as part of determining the profitability of the respective own-retail stores.

12 » RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS As a result of the first-time application of IFRS16, the company recognized right-of-use assets in an amount of 2.9billion in relation to leases previously classified as operating leases. The following table presents a reconciliation of the carrying amount of right-of-use assets:

Impairment losses recognized in the presented periods mainly relate to the company's own-retail activities, for which contrary to expectations there will be an insufficient flow of future economic benefits.

groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. The recoverable amount of a group of cashgenerating units is determined based on its value in use. Estimating the value in use requires adidas to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the groups of cash-generating units and also to choose a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for the respective group of cash-generating units. The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the specific equity and country risk of the respective group of cash-generating units.

The majority of goodwill, which primarily relates to the acquisition of the Reebok business in 2006, is denominated in US dollars. A currency translation effect of positive 12million and positive 25million was recorded for the years ending December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
adidas determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis. The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the

This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a six-year period in total. The planning is based on long-term expectations of the company and reflects in total for the groups of cash-generating units an average annual low-single- to low-double-digit sales increase with varying forecast growth prospects for the different groups of cash-generating units. Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to expand, primarily driven by an improvement in the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The planning for capital expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience. The planning for future tax payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the individual groups of cash-generating units. Cash flows beyond this six-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 1.7% (2018: 1.7%). According to the company's expectations, these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business sector in which the respective group of cashgenerating units operates.

The groups of cash-generating units are defined as the regional markets which are responsible for the joint distribution of the adidas and Reebok brands as well as the other operating segments adidas Golf and Runtastic. The regional markets are Europe, North America adidas, North America Reebok, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America, and Emerging Markets. The number of groups of cash-generating units amounted to a total of nine at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the course of the annual impairment test, adidas assessed whether goodwill impairment was required. In this context, there was no need for goodwill impairment for the years ending December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The impairment test for the Reebok trademark is performed based on Reebok cash-generating units in the individual markets. This requires an estimate of the recoverable amount of the Reebok groups of cash-generating units to which the Reebok brand as a corporate asset is allocated based on planned revenues of the respective Reebok markets. The recoverable amount of the respective Reebok markets was determined on the basis of value in use based on the present value of the expected future cash flows.

regional Reebok markets are Europe, North America, A siaPacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America and Emerging Markets. The number of cash-generating Reebok business units amounted to a total of six at the end of 2019 (2018: six). 
This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a six-year period in total. The planning is based on long-term expectations of the company and reflects in total for the Reebok markets an average annual mid-to-high-single-digit sales increase with varying forecast growth prospects for the different Reebok markets. Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to expand, primarily driven by an improvement in the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The planning of capital expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience. The planning for future tax payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the individual Reebok markets. Cash flows beyond the detailed planning period of the respective Reebok markets are extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 1.7% (2018: 1.7%). According to the company's expectations, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business sector in the individual markets in which Reebok operates.
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average market weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for each Reebok market. The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the specific equity and country risk of the relevant Reebok markets. The respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections of the respective cash-generating Reebok business units range from 6.6% to 9.9% (2018: 7.2% to 10.2%).

A change in the discount rate by approximately 0.3 percentage points or a reduction of planned free cash inflows by approximately 5% would not result in any impairment requirement. However, future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments and reversals of impairment losses of the Reebok trademark.
As part of the impairment tests, the Reebok and the Five Ten trademarks are allocated on a pro rata basis to the groups of cash-generating units. Thereof, the major shares relate to Europe ( 325 million), Asia-Pacific ( 222 million), Emerging Markets ( 101 million), North America Reebok ( 98 million) and Russia/CIS ( 97 million). All other trademarks are part of the respective groups of cash-generating units.

15 » LONG-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS Long-term financial assets primarily include an 8.33% invest ment in FC Bayern München AG (2018: 8.33%) of 84million (2018: 83million). This investment is classified as fair value through profit or loss and recorded at fair value. This equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market. Therefore, existing contractual arrangements are used in order to calculate the fair value as at December31, 2019.
Other equity investments include minority shareholdings. These shares are unlisted and do not have any active market price. There is currently no intention to sell these shares. Other minority shareholdings include positive fair value adjustments in an amount of 12million in 2019 (2018: negative 8million).
The line item `Other investments' comprises investments which are mainly invested in insurance products, which are measured at fair value, and securities for long-term variable compensation components. Other investments include positive fair value adjustments in an amount of 2million in 2019 (2018: positive 2million).

Defined contribution pension plans The total expense for defined contribution plans amounted to 74 million in 2019 (2018: 74million).
Defined benefit pension plans Given the company's diverse structure, different defined benefit pension plans exist, comprising a variety of postemployment benefit arrangements. The company's major defined benefit pension plans relate to adidasAG and its subsidiaries in the UK and South Korea. The defined benefit pension plans generally provide payments in case of death, disability or retirement to former employees and their survivors. The obligations arising from defined benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

In Germany, adidasAG grants its employees contributionbased and final salary defined benefit pension schemes, which provide employees with entitlements in the event of retirement, disability and death. German pension plans operate under the legal framework of the German Company Pensions Act (`Betriebsrentengesetz') and under general German labor legislation. From 2020 onwards, active existing employees and new entrants are entitled to benefits in accordance with the general company agreement `Core Benefits: adidas company pension plan'. This is a pension plan with a basic employer contribution, possible salary sacrifice and additional matching contribution. Thus, the contributions to this pension plan are partly paid by the employee and partly paid by the employer. The contributions are transferred into benefit components. The benefits are paid out in the form of a pension, a lump sum or installments. The pension plans in Germany are financed using book reserves, a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) and a pension fund (`Pensionsfonds') in combination with a reinsured provident fund (`Unterstützungskasse') for certain former members of the Executive Board of adidasAG. Further details about the pension entitlements of members of the Executive Board of adidasAG are provided in this Annual Report. SEE
COMPENSATION REPORT, P. 30
The final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The benefits are mainly paid out in the form of pensions. The scheme operates under UK trust law as well as under the jurisdiction of the UK Pensions Regulator and therefore is subject to a minimum funding requirement. The Trustee Board is responsible for setting the scheme's funding objective, agreeing the contributions with the company and determining the investment strategy of the scheme.

In South Korea, adidas grants a final pay pension plan to certain employees. This plan is closed to new entrants. The benefits are paid out in the form of a lump sum. The pension plan operates under the Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act (ERSA). This regulation requires a minimum funding amounting to 90% of the present value of the vested benefit obligation. The annual contribution includes at least the minimum amount in order to meet the funding requirements.

The Group's pension plans are subject to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, salary and pension increase rates, and risks from changes in longevity. A lower discount rate results in a higher defined benefit obligation and/or in higher contributions to the pension funds. Lower than expected performance of the plan assets could lead to an increase in required contributions or to a decline of the funded status.
The tables analyze the defined benefit plans, plan assets, present values of the defined benefit pension plans, expenses recognized in the consolidated income statement, actuarial assumptions and further information.

ADIDAS

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans is based upon statistical and actuarial valuations. In particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial variables (such as the discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee turnover). The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual circumstances and could lead to different cash flows.

Remeasurements, such as gains or losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions for defined benefit pension plans during the financial year or a return on the plan assets exceeding the interest income, are immediately recognized outside the income statement as a change in other reserves in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Of the total pension expenses recorded in the consolidated income statement, an amount of 25million (2018: 24million) relates to employees of adidasAG and 4million (2018: 4million) relates to employees in SouthKorea. The pension expense is mainly recorded within other operating expenses. The production-related part of the pension expenses is recognized within cost of sales.

The weighted average actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to determine the defined benefit liability at that date and the pension expense for the upcoming financial year.
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are based on statistical information available in the various countries. In Germany, the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables are used. In the UK, assumptions are based on the S2PA base table with modified improvement of the life expectancy mortality tables. In SouthKorea, the KIDI 2019 tables from the Korea Insurance Development Institute are used.
As in the previous year, the calculation of the pension liabilities in Germany is based on a discount rate determined using the `Mercer Yield Curve (MYC)' approach.

Since many pension plans are closed to future accrual, the salary trend plays a minor role in determining pension obligations. Due to the fact that about half of the benefits of the German pension plans are paid as lump sums or installment payments, the pension increase rate and the mortality assumption have significantly less impact than the discount rate when calculating the pension obligations.

Approximately 96% (2018: 95%) of the total plan assets are allocated to plan assets in the three major countries: Germany (2019: 78%, 2018: 73%), UK (2019: 13%, 2018: 16%) and South Korea (2019: 5%, 2018: 6%).
Part of the plan assets in Germany is held by a trustee under a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) for the purpose of funding the pension obligations of adidasAG and insolvency insurance with regard to part of the pension obligations of adidasAG. The trustee is the registered association adidas Pension Trust e.V. The investment committee of the adidas Pension Trust determines the investment strategy with the goal to match the pension liabilities as far as possible and to generate a sustainable return. In 2019, an amount of 105million in cash was transferred to the trustee. The plan assets in the registered association are mainly invested in real estate, cash and cash equivalents, equity index funds and hybrid bonds. Another part of the plan assets in Germany is invested in insurance contracts via a pension fund and a provident fund. For this portion, an insurance entity is responsible for the determination and the implementation of the investment strategy.

In the UK, the plan assets are held under trust within the pension fund. The investment strategy is aligned with the structure of the pension obligations in these countries. In the rest of the world, the plan assets consist predominantly of insurance contracts.
The expected payments for the 2020 financial year amount to 25million. Thereof, 12million relates to benefits directly paid to pensioners by the subsidiaries and 13million to employer contributions paid into the plan assets. In 2019, the actual return on plan assets (including interest income) was 28million (2018: loss of 6million).

27 » SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY The nominal capital of adidas AG has remained unchanged since December 31, 2018. As at the balance sheet date, it amounted to a total of  200,416,186divided into 200,416,186 registered no-par-value shares and was fully paid in.
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting from the commencement of the year in which it was issued. Treasury shares held directly or indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in accordance with §71b German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz ­ AktG). As at the balance sheet date, adidas AG held 4,446,799 treasury shares, corresponding to a notional amount of  4,449,799 in the nominal capital and consequently to 2.22% of the nominal capital.
Authorized Capital The Executive Board of adidasAG did not utilize the existing amount of authorized capital of up to 90million in the 2019 financial year.
The following overview of the existing authorized capital does not include the Authorized Capital 2017/II canceled by the

Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019, which had also not been utilized up to and including May 9, 2019.
The authorized capital of adidasAG, which is set out in § 4 sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Articles of Association as at the balance sheet date, entitles the Executive Board, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to increase the nominal capital
based on the authorization granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2017 until June7, 2022 ---- by issuing new shares against contributions in cash
once or several times by no more than 50million and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2017/I);
based on the authorization granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 9, 2019 until June 13, 2024 ---- by issuing new shares against contributions in kind once
or several times by no more than 16million and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2019);
the overall volume of the shares issued based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the point in time when this authorization becomes effective or, in case this amount is lower, at the date of the respective issuance. The nominal capital which is attributed to the shares to be issued to service option or conversion rights or option or conversion obligations from bonds, debt securities or participation rights to the extent that they are issued during the term of the authorization up to the date of the respective exercise of this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights, or which is attributed to shares which are issued or sold during the term of the authorization up to the date of the respective exercise

of this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights, has to be included in the aforementioned limit of 10%. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from subscription rights. The Authorized Capital 2019 must not be used to issue shares within the scope of compensation or participation programs for Executive Board members or employees or for members of the management bodies or employees of subsidiaries;
based on the authorization granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2017 until June7, 2022 ---- by issuing new shares against contributions in cash
once or several times by no more than 20million and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription rights and to exclude shareholders' subscription rights when issuing the new shares at a value not essentially below the stock market price of the adidasAG shares already listed on the stock exchange at the point in time when the issue price is ultimately determined, which should be as close as possible to the placement of the shares; this exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated with the listing of the adidasAG shares on a foreign stock exchange (Authorized Capital 2017/III). The authorization to exclude subscription rights pursuant to the previous sentence may, however, only be used to the extent that the pro rata amount of the new shares in the nominal capital together with the pro rata amount in the nominal capital of other shares which have been issued by adidasAG since May11, 2017, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to or in accordance with §186 section 3 sentence 4AktG on the basis of an authorized capital or following a repurchase, or for which subscription or conversion rights or subscription or conversion obligations have been granted since May11, 2017, through the issuance of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, with subscription rights

the overall volume of the shares issued based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights ­ together with shares issued against contributions in kind with the exclusion of subscription rights from the Authorized Capital 2017/II (§ 4 section 3 of the Articles of Association) ­ must not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing at the date of the respective issuance. This deduction clause shall not apply if residual amounts of shares are excluded from subscription rights;

in cash once or several times by no more than 4million and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to determine the further content of the rights embodied in the shares and the terms and conditions of the share issuance (Authorized Capital 2016). Shareholders' subscription rights shall be excluded. Any repurchased treasury shares of adidasAG which are used by adidasAG for employee stock purchase plans during the term of this authorization shall be attributed to the maximum number of 4,000,000 shares. The new shares may only be issued to (current and former) employees of adidasAG and its affiliated companies as well as to (current and former) members of management bodies of adidasAG's affiliated companies.

Contingent Capital The following overview of the Contingent Capital is based on § 4 section 6 of the Articles of Association of adidas AG as well as on the underlying resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 9, 2018. It does not include the Contingent Capital 2010 canceled by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2019, which had not been utilized up to and including May 9, 2019. Additional contingent capital does not exist.
Contingent Capital 2018 The nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to 12.5million divided into not more than 12,500,000 registered no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital 2018). The contingent capital increase serves the issuance of registered no-parvalue shares when exercising option or conversion rights or fulfilling the respective option and/or conversion obligations or when exercising the company's right to choose to partially or in total deliver registered no-par-value shares of the company instead of paying the due amount to the holders or creditors of bonds issued by the company or a subordinated Group company up to May8,2023 on the basis of the authorization resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May9,2018. The new shares will be issued at the respective option or conversion price to be established in accordance with the aforementioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase will be implemented only to the extent that holders or creditors of option or conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise the option or conversion obligations based on bonds issued by the company or a subordinated Group company, pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board granted by the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2018 (Agenda Item 8), up to May 8, 2023 and guaranteed by the company, exercise their option or conversion rights or, if they are obligated to exercise the option or conversion obligations, fulfill their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the bond, or to the extent that the company exercises its rights to

choose to deliver adidas AG shares for the total amount or a part amount instead of payment of the amount due and insofar as no cash settlement, treasury shares or shares of another public listed company are used to service these rights. The new shares will carry dividend rights from the commencement of the financial year in which the shares are issued. The Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to stipulate any additional details concerning the implementation of the contingent capital increase.
The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights for residual amounts and to exclude shareholders' subscription rights insofar as this is necessary for granting subscription rights to which holders or creditors of previously issued bonds are entitled. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude shareholders' subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical market value of these bonds and the number of shares to be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital. Treasury shares which are or will be sold with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with §71 section1 no.8 in conjunction with §186 section3 sentence4AktG between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds are attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. Shares which are or will be issued, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to §186 section3 sentence4AktG or pursuant to §203 section1 in conjunction with §186 section3 sentence4AktG, between the starting date of the term of this authorization and the issuance of the respective bonds in the context of a cash capital increase are also attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%.

under  815 million shown in the table and the cash outflow from the repurchase of adidas AG shares in the amount of  809 million shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity as well as the consolidated statement of cash flows results from reimbursements of incidental purchasing cost.

In the period up until the balance sheet date, the Executive Board of adidasAG did not issue any bonds based on the authorization granted on May9,2018 and consequently did not issue any shares from the Contingent Capital 2018.
Repurchase of adidas AG shares and use of treasury shares The Annual General Meeting on May12,2016 granted the Executive Board an authorization to repurchase adidas AG shares up to an amount totaling 10% of the nominal capital until May11,2021. The authorization may be used by adidasAG but also by its subordinated Group companies or by third parties on account of adidasAG or its subordinated Group companies or third parties assigned by adidasAG or one of its subordinated Group companies.
Based on the above-mentioned authorization, the Executive Board of adidasAG commenced a share buyback program on March22,2018. Under the authorization granted, adidas AG repurchased a total of 5,089,879 shares for a total price of  999,885,165 (excluding incidental purchasing costs), i.e. for an average price of  196.45 per share, in a first tranche between March 22, 2018 and December 4, 2018 inclusive. This corresponded to a notional amount of  5,089,879 in the nominal capital which was reduced from  209,216,186 to 200,416,186 with legal effect from October 22, 2018 and consequently to 2.54% of the nominal capital. On January 7, 2019, the share buyback program was resumed in the form of a second tranche. More information on the adidas AG shares repurchased in the 2019 financial year is set out in the table `Repurchase of adidas AG shares in the 2019 financial year'.

The details on the percentage of shareholdings and voting rights may no longer be up to date.
Capital management The company's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
adidas seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The company further aims to maintain net debt below two times EBITDA over the long term.

Financial leverage amounts to negative 12.8% (2018: negative 15.0%) and is defined as the ratio between net borrowings (short- and long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term financial assets) in an amount of negative  873 million (2018: negative  959 million) and shareholders' equity in an amount of 6.796billion (2018: 6.377 billion). EBITDA amounted to 3.845 billion for the financial year ending December 31, 2019 (2018: 2.882billion). The ratio between net borrowings and EBITDA amounted to ­0.2 for the 2019 financial year (2018: ­0.3).

Reserves Reserves within shareholders' equity are as follows: ---- Capital reserve: primarily comprises the paid premium
for the issuance of share capital as well as the equity component of the issued convertible bond. ---- Cumulative currency translation differences: comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. ---- Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedges (intrinsic value for options and spot component for forward contracts) related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the total return swap. ---- Cost of hedging reserve ­ options: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of options (time value and premium). ---- Cost of hedging reserve ­ forward contracts: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of forward contracts (forward component). ---- Other reserves: comprises the remeasurements of defined benefit plans consisting of the cumulative net change of actuarial gains or losses relating to the defined benefit obligations, the return on plan assets (excluding interest income) and the asset ceiling effect, the remeasurement of the fair value of the equity investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, expenses recognized for share option plans, effects from the acquisition of non-controlling interests, as well as reserves required by law. ---- Retained earnings: comprises both amounts which are required by the Articles of Association and voluntary amounts that have been set aside by adidas. The reserve includes the unappropriated accumulated profits less

dividends paid and consideration paid for the repurchase of adidas AG shares exceeding the nominal value. In addition, the item includes the effects of the employee stock purchase plan and the transition effects of the implementation of new IFRS.
The capital reserve includes restricted capital in an amount of  4 million (2018:  4 million). Furthermore, other reserves include additional restricted capital in an amount of 69million (2018: 52million).
Distributable profits and dividends Profits distributable to shareholders are determined by reference to the retained earnings of adidasAG and calculated under German Commercial Law.
Based on the resolution of the 2019 Annual General Meeting, the dividend for 2018 was 3.35 per share (total amount: 664 million). The Executive Board of adidasAG will propose to use retained earnings of adidasAG in an amount of 828million as reported in the 2019 financial statements of adidasAG for a dividend payment of 3.85 per share and to carry forward the subsequent remaining amount.
As at February 25, 2020, 195,433,799 dividend-entitled shares exist, resulting in a dividend payment of  752 million.

28 » SHARE-BASED PAYMENT Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees In 2016, adidas announced the introduction of an open-ended employee stock purchase plan (the `plan'). The plan is operated on a quarterly basis, with each calendar quarter referred to as an `investment quarter'.
The plan enables employees to purchase adidasAG shares with a 15% discount (`investment shares') and to benefit from free matching shares. Currently, eligible employees of adidasAG and seventeen other subsidiaries can participate in the plan. Up to two weeks before the start of an investment quarter each eligible employee can enroll for the plan. The company accepts enrolment requests on the first day of the relevant investment quarter. This is the grant date for the investment and matching shares. The fair value at the vesting date is equivalent to the fair value of the granted equity instruments at this date. The employees invest an amount up to 10% of their gross base salary per quarter in the plan. A few days after the end of the investment quarter the shares are purchased on the market at fair market value and transferred to the employees. Thereby the amount invested during the quarter plus the top-up from adidas is used. These shares can be sold at any time by the employee. If the shares are held for a period of one year after the last day of an investment quarter, employees will receive one-time free matching shares (one matching share for every six adidasAG shares acquired). This plan currently constitutes an equity-settled share-based payment for both elements. For the component of the matching shares relating to the specific period of service an appropriate discount is taken into account. The effects are presented in the following table:

Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties In 2016, adidas entered into a promotion and advertising contract which includes a share-based payment transaction with third parties. The contract has a duration of five years and will end in 2021.

The first part of the agreement grants a transfer of basic shares over five years which correspond to a value of US $ 5million each year. Based on the contractual terms, the third transfer in 2019 equated to 21,256 shares. The shares from the fifth tranche of repurchased shares with an average price of  198.91 per share were used as a consideration.
SEE NOTE 27
As at January1, 2019 (grant date), an amount of US$5million was recognized as expenses for basic shares over the vesting period of twelve months.
The second part of the agreement grants bonus shares of US$5 million if certain conditions are fulfilled. This option can be granted twice. As at December31, 2019, it was likely that the bonus shares will be issued. Therefore, expenses recognized for bonus shares amounting to 2million were accrued in 2019 (2018:  5 million).
Cash-settled share-based payment transactions with employees In 2017, adidas implemented a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan, which is a share-based remuneration scheme with cash settlement. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) are granted on the condition that the beneficiary is employed for three or four years by adidasAG or one of its subsidiaries in a position where he or she is not under notice during that period. This minimum period of employment pertains to the calendar year in which the RSUs are granted and the three subsequent calendar years.
The total value of the cash remuneration payable to senior management is recalculated on each reporting date and on the settlement date, based on the fair value of the RSUs, and recognized through an appropriate increase in the provision as personnel expenses that are spread over the period of service of the beneficiary. Furthermore, social security contributions are considered in the calculation of the fair

value, if appropriate for the respective country regulations and the seniority of the participants. All changes to the subsequent measurement of this provision are reported under personnel expenses.
Once a year, one tranche with a three-year term and another with a four-year term are issued. The number of RSUs granted depends on the seniority of the beneficiaries. In addition, for the four-year plan, the number of RSUs also depends on the achievement of a target figure which is based on the growth of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.
The value of one RSU is the average price of the adidasAG share as quoted for the first 20 stock exchange trading days in January of the respective financial year. The effects are presented in the following table:

The fair value is based on the closing price of the adidas AG share on December 31, 2019, adjusted for future dividend payments.
In 2019, this resulted in an expense of 170million (2018:  53 million). The corresponding provision amounted to 254million (2018:  84 million).

29 » NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS This line item within equity comprises the non-controlling interests in subsidiaries which are not directly or indirectly attributable to adidasAG.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial assets, accounts receivable and payable as well as other current financial receivables and payables, their respective fair values equal their carrying amount.
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities and adjusted by a company-specific credit risk premium.

Fair values of long-term financial assets are based on quoted market prices in an active market or are calculated as present values of expected future cash flows.
adidas designated certain investments as equity securities as at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity), because the company intends to hold those investments for the long term in order to gain insights into innovative production technologies and trends. The designation of certain equity instruments as at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is based on a strategic Management decision.

In accordance with IFRS13, the following tables show the valuation methods used in measuring Level1, Level2 and Level3 fair values, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.
During the course of 2019, significant unobservable inputs did not significantly change and there were no reclassifications between levels.

Financial instruments Level 1 measured at fair value

Type Convertible bond Eurobond

Valuation method The fair value is based on the market price of the convertible bond as at December 31, 2019. The fair value is based on the market price of the Eurobond as at December 31, 2019.

Significant unobservable inputs Not applicable Not applicable

Category Amortized cost Amortized cost

Financial instruments Level 2 measured at fair value

Type Cash equivalents and short-term financial assets (money market funds) Long-term financial assets (investment securities) Forward exchange contracts
Currency options
Share option (cash settled)
Total return swap (for own shares)

Valuation method The discounted cash flow method is applied, which considers the present value of expected payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Due to their short-term maturities, it is assumed that their respective fair value is equal to the notional amount. The fair value is based on the market price of the assets as at December 31, 2019.
In 2019, adidas applied the par method (forward NPV) for all currency pairs to calculate the fair value, implying actively traded forward curves. adidas applies the Garman-Kohlhagen model, which is an extended version of the Black-Scholes model.
adidas applies the Black-Scholes model.
The fair value is based on the market price of the adidas AG share as at December 31, 2019, minus accrued interest.

This equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market. Existing contractual arrangements (based on the externally observable dividend policy of FC Bayern München AG) are used in order to calculate the fair value as at December 31, 2019. These dividends are recognized in other financial income.
The valuation follows an option price model based on the Monte Carlo method to simulate future EBITDA values. The derived earn-out payments are discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The fair value adjustment is recognized in discontinued operations.
The discounted cash flow method is applied, which considers the present value of expected payments discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Fair value adjustments regarding TaylorMade and CCM promissory notes are recognized in discontinued operations. Fair value adjustments regarding the Mitchell & Ness promissory note are recognized in financial result.
The significant inputs (financing rounds) used to measure fair value include one or more events where objective evidence of any changes was identified, considering expectations regarding future business development. The fair value adjustment is recognized in other financial result.
The option to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income upon implementation of IFRS 9 has been exercised. The significant inputs (financing rounds) used to measure fair value include one or more events where objective evidence of any changes was identified, considering expectations regarding future business development. The fair value adjustment is recognized in other reserves.
The discounted cash flow method is applied, which considers the present value of expected payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The fair value adjustment refers to accretion and is recognized in interest result.

FINANCIAL RISKS Currency risks Currency risks for adidas are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the company. The vast majority of the transactional risk arises from product sourcing in US dollars, while sales are typically denominated in the functional currency of the respective companies. The currencies in which these transactions are mainly denominated are US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
As governed by the company's Treasury Policy, adidas has established a hedging system on a rolling basis up to 24months in advance, under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-month horizon.
adidas uses a combination of different hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, currency options and swaps, to protect itself against unfavorable currency movements. These contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of noneuro-denominated results into the company's functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on the company's financial performance.
Further information about the accounting and hedge accounting treatment is included in these Notes. SEE NOTE 02

Exposures are presented in the following table:

The exposure from firm commitments and forecast transactions was calculated on a one-year basis.
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, the company has calculated the impact on net income and shareholders' equity based on changes in the most important currency exchange rates. The calculated impacts mainly result from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. The analysis does not include effects that arise from the translation of the company's foreign entities' financial statements into the company's reporting currency, the euro. The sensitivity analysis is based

on the net balance sheet exposure, including intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Moreover, all outstanding currency derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates to determine the effects on net income and equity. The analysis was performed on the same basis for both 2019 and 2018.
Based on this analysis, a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar at December 31, 2019 would have led to a 6 million increase in net income.

---- The underlying forecast cash flow exposure (which the hedge instrument mainly relates to) is not required to be revalued in this analysis.
---- Operational issues, such as potential discounts for key accounts, which have high transparency regarding the impacts of currency on our sourcing activities (due to their own private label sourcing efforts), are also excluded from this analysis.
---- The credit risk is not considered as part of this analysis.
The company also largely hedges balance sheet risks. Due to its strong global position, adidas is able to partly minimize the currency risk by utilizing natural hedges. The company's gross US dollar cash flow exposure calculated for 2020 was around 6.8billion at year-end 2019, which was hedged using forward exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.

The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges would have decreased shareholders' equity by  328 million. A 10% weaker euro at December 31, 2019 would have led to a  8 million decrease in net income. Shareholders' equity would have increased by 465million. The impacts of fluctuations of the euro against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi on net income and shareholders' equity are also included in accordance with IFRS requirements.

However, many other financial and operational variables that could potentially reduce the effect of currency fluctuations are excluded from the analysis. For instance: ---- Interest rates, commodity prices and all other exchange
rates are assumed constant. ---- Exchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead
of the more relevant sales-weighted average figure, which the company utilizes internally to better reflect both the seasonality of its business and intra-year currency fluctuations.

Credit risks A credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.adidas is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain financing activities. Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, from other third-party contractual financial obligations such as other financial assets, short-term bank deposits and derivative financial instruments. Without taking into account any collateral or other credit enhancements, the carrying amount of financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

At the end of 2019, there was no relevant concentration of credit risk by type of customer or geography. The company's credit risk exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics. Under the company's credit policy, new customers are analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for each customer. Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are monitored on an ongoing basis. Customers that fail to meet the company's minimum creditworthiness are, in general, allowed to purchase products only on a prepayment basis.
Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses as well as, on a selective basis, credit insurance, the sale of accounts receivable without recourse, and bank guarantees. Further quantitative information on the extent to which credit enhancements mitigate the credit risk of accounts receivable is included in these Notes.  SEE NOTE 07
At the end of 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
The Treasury department arranges currency, commodity interest rate and equity hedges and invests cash with major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world. adidas subsidiaries are authorized to work with banks rated BBB+ or higher. Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorized to work with banks rated lower than BBB+. SEE TREASURY, P. 104 To limit risk in these cases, restrictions are clearly stipulated, such as maximum cash deposit levels. In addition, the credit default swap premiums of the company's partner banks are monitored on a monthly basis. In the event that the defined threshold is exceeded, credit balances are shifted to banks compliant with the limit.

adidas furthermore believes that the risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of the investment business of the company with more than 20 globally operating banks. At December 31, 2019, no bank accounted for more than 10% of the investments of adidas. Including subsidiaries' short-term deposits in local banks, the average concentration was 2%. This leads to a maximum exposure of 118million in the event of default of any single bank. The investment exposure was further diversified by investing into AAA-rated money market funds.
In addition, in 2019, adidas held derivatives of foreign exchange with a positive fair market value in the amount of 137million. The maximum exposure to any single bank resulting from these assets amounted to 66 million and the average concentration was 9%.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the following table includes further information about set-off possibilities of derivative financial assets and liabilities. The majority of agreements between financial institutions and adidas include a mutual right to set off. However, these agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position, because the right to set off is enforceable only in the event of counterparty defaults.

The carrying amounts of recognized derivative financial instruments, which are subject to the mentioned agreements, are also presented in the following table:

Interest rate risks Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments for variable-interest liabilities. As adidas does not have material variable-interest liabilities, even a significant increase in interest rates should have only slight adverse effects on the company's profitability, liquidity and financial position.
To reduce interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility, a core tenet of the company's financial strategy is to continue to use surplus cash flow from operations to reduce gross borrowings. Beyond that, adidas may consider adequate hedging strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to mitigate interest rate risks. SEE TREASURY, P. 104

Financing and liquidity risks Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available to meet maturing liabilities with regard to timing, volume and currency structure. In addition, the company faces the risk of having to accept unfavorable financing terms due to liquidity restraints. The Treasury department uses an efficient cash management system to manage liquidity risk. At December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents together with marketable securities amounted to 2.511billion (2018: 2.635billion). Moreover, the company maintains 2.105billion (2018:  2.215 billion) in bilateral credit lines,

SEE TREASURY, P. 104
Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position are presented in the table.
This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as cash outflows from cash-settled derivatives with negative market values. Financial liabilities that may be

Share price risks Share price risks arise due to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration scheme with cash settlement, and the equity-neutral convertible bond with cash settlement. In order to mitigate share price risks, it is company strategy to use swaps and options to hedge against share price fluctuations. Swaps are used to hedge the LongTerm Incentive Plan and are classified as cash flow hedges. The embedded cash option in the convertible bond is fully offset with a call option to mitigate the cash settlement.
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, adidas has calculated the impact on net income based on changes in the company's share price. A 10% increase in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price at December 31, 2019 would have led to a  79.5 million increase in net income whereas a 10% decrease in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price at December 31, 2019 would only have led to a 45.7million increase in net income.

35 » HYPERINFLATION Due to the rapid devaluation of the Argentinian peso, Argentina is considered as hyperinflationary and as a result the application of IAS 29 was adopted for the first time in the third quarter of 2018. The financial statements of 2018 for those subsidiaries that have the Argentinian peso as a functional currency had been restated for the change in the general purchasing power retrospectively since January 1, 2018. The financial statements are based on a historical cost approach. The prior year figures are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at December 31, 2018.
For translation into the presentation currency (euro), all amounts were translated at the closing rate at December 31, 2019. The net assets in the subsidiary's local financial statements were adjusted for changes in the price level.

Deferred tax assets for which the realization of the related tax benefits is not probable decreased from 554million to 488million for the year ending December31,2019. These amounts mainly relate to tax losses carried forward and unused foreign tax credits of the US tax group, which begin to expire in 2028. The remaining unrecognized deferred tax assets relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where the realization of the related tax benefit is not considered probable.
adidas does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings, the amount of which cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the company were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit is probable. For the (43) assessment of probability, in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the foreseeable future, 1 appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into 8 consideration.
(6)
410 Deferred tax assets on liabilities and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities on non-current assets increased significantly in 2019 due to the initial application of IFRS 16. Deferred tax assets on non-current assets increased significantly due to an increase in the tax base of non-current assets relating to an internal reorganization.

The convertible bond issued in March 2012 was fully converted in 2018, therefore it is not necessary to include potential dilutive shares arising from the convertible bond in the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
38 » SEGMENTAL INFORMATION adidas operates predominantly in one industry segment ­ the design, distribution and marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle products.
As at December 31, 2019, following the company's internal management reporting by markets and in accordance with the definition of IFRS 8 `Operating Segments', ten operating segments were identified: Europe, North America adidas, NorthAmerica Reebok, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America, Emerging Markets, adidas Golf, Runtastic and Other centrally managed businesses.
Due to the completed divestiture, income and expenses of the former TaylorMade operating segment are reported as discontinued operations in 2018. SEE NOTE 03

Runtastic operates in the digital health and fitness space. The company provides a comprehensive ecosystem for tracking and managing health and fitness data.
Other centrally managed businesses primarily includes the business activities of the Y-3 label.
Certain centralized corporate functions do not meet the definition of IFRS8 for an operating segment. This includes, in particular, functions such as Global Brands and Global Sales (central brand and distribution management for the adidas and Reebok brands), central treasury, global sourcing as well as other headquarter functions. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the reconciliations.
The chief operating decision maker for adidas has been defined as the entire Executive Board of adidasAG.

reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditure for tangible and intangible assets are part of the segmental reporting, even though segmental assets do not contain tangible and intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization as well as impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses not directly attributable to a segment or a group of segments are presented under line items `HQ' and `Consolidation' in the reconciliations.
Segmental liabilities only contain accounts payable from operating activities as there are no other liability items reported regularly to the chief operating decision maker.
Interest income and interest expenses as well as income taxes are not allocated to the reportable segments and are not reported separately to the chief operating decision maker.

The operating segments North America adidas and North America Reebok have been aggregated to segment North America.
According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for reportable segments, the operating segments Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, Russia/CIS, Latin America and Emerging Markets are reported separately. The remaining operating segments are aggregated under Other Businesses due to their only subordinate materiality.
Each market comprises all wholesale, retail and e-commerce business activities relating to the distribution and sale of products of the adidas and Reebok brands to retail customers and end consumers.
adidas Golf comprises the distribution and sale of adidas Golf branded products.

Net sales represents revenue from contracts with customers. There are no intersegment sales between the reportable segments. Accounting and valuation policies applied for reporting segmental information are the same as those used for adidas. SEE NOTE 02
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item `Segmental operating profit'. This is defined as gross profit minus other operating expenses plus royalty and commission income and other operating income attributable to the segment or group of segments, however without considering headquarter costs and central expenditure for marketing.
Segmental assets include accounts receivable as well as inventories. Only these items are reported to the chief operating decision maker on a regular basis. Depreciation, amortization, impairment losses (except for goodwill) and

39 » ADDITIONAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION In 2019, the increase in cash generated from operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, a decrease in income taxes paid and the different treatment for operating leases which was partly offset by a decrease in operating working capital requirements.
Under IFRS 16, payments for operating leases formerly disclosed under IAS 17, are no longer recognized on a straightline basis and also not reported as cash flow from operating activities. Instead, repayments and interest payments for the lease liabilities will be recognized in the cash flow from financing activities. This results in a decline in cash flows from financing activities in the amount of  692 million and an improvement in cash flows from operating activities in the amount of  684 million.

In 2019, the following changes in financial liabilities impacted the net cash used in financing activities:

There was a change in the presentation of interest paid in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the financial year. Due to the first-time application of IFRS 16, the option to show the interest paid within the net cash used in financing activities was chosen, instead of net cash generated from operating activities. To enhance comparability, the prior year was also adjusted.

Litigation and other legal risks The company is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the normal course of business, mainly in connection with distribution agreements as well as intellectual property rights. The risks regarding these lawsuits are covered by provisions when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. SEE NOTE 20 In the opinion of Management, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims will not materially affect the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group.
The company is in dispute with the local revenue authorities in South Africa (SARS) with regard to the customs value of imported products. In June 2018, SARS issued a ruling claiming a customs payment including interest and penalties for the years 2007 to 2013 in an amount of ZAR 1.871 million

( 119 million). adidas has applied for a suspension of the payment demand and in 2019 instituted legal action against the decision before the High Court in South Africa. In case the court rules in favor of SARS, adidas will appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court of South Africa. Based on external legal opinions, Management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the claim made by SARS will eventually not result in an outflow of resources. Therefore, a provision was not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position.
In connection with the financial irregularities at Reebok India Company in 2012, various legal uncertainties were identified. The respective remaining risks cannot be assessed conclusively. However, based on legal opinions and internal assessments, Management assumes that the effects will not have any material influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company.
In October 2018, a former employee of the company's US subsidiary was convicted of wire fraud in connection with unauthorized payments to certain college basketball players or their families during the former employee's time at the US subsidiary. The company's US subsidiary, with the full support of the company, has cooperated and continues to cooperate with the prosecutors, including by conducting an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel. While Management currently believes that the actions of its former employee will not have any material influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company, actual results may ultimately differ from the current Management assessment. Any additional statements about these matters by the company could compromise the company's position in these proceedings and hence further information is not disclosed.

REPRODUCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
Based on the results of our audit, we have issued the following unqualified audit opinion:
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To adidasAG, Herzogenaurach
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT
OPINIONS We have audited the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter "adidas" or the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the combined management report ("group management report") of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, for the financial year from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the group management report specified in the "Other Information" section of our auditor's report.

The group management report contains cross-references that are not required by law and which are marked as unaudited. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the cross-references and the information to which the cross-references refer.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
---- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2019, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, and
---- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those components of the management report specified in the "Other Information" section of the auditor's report. The management report contains crossreferences, marked as not audited, that are not provided for by law. Our opinion does not cover these cross-references and the information to which the cross-reference refer.
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

BASIS FOR THE OPINIONS We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and EU Audit Regulation No. 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as "EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE REEBOK BRAND
For the accounting policies used and the disclosures on the judgments applied by management and sources of estimation uncertainties please refer to Note 2 and for the disclosures on the measurement of the Reebok brand please refer to Note 14 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK The Reebok brand was recognized as of December 31, 2019, in the amount of EUR 842 million.
The Reebok brand is to be tested for impairment at least once a year. To this end, the brand is allocated as a "corporate asset" pursuant to IAS 36 to the cash-generating Reebok business units at the level of the markets and the value in use of these cash-generating units is compared with the carrying amount of these units. The valuation model used to determine the value in use is complex; the result of this valuation is heavily dependent on the estimate of future net cash flows (taking into account future revenue growth, profit margins, exchange rates and long-term growth rates) and the discount factor used, and is thus subject to considerable uncertainty.
There is the risk for the financial statements that any existing impairment of the Reebok brand as of the reporting date was not identified or that a required reversal of an impairment loss on the brand was not carried out.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH With the involvement of our valuation experts, we assessed the appropriateness of the key assumptions and calculation methods of the Company, among other things. For this purpose, we discussed the expected business and earnings development at the level of the cash-generating Reebok business units to which the brand as corporate asset is allocated and the assumed long-term growth rates with those responsible for planning. We also reconciled this information

with other internally available forecasts, e.g. the financial forecast for the following 6 years. Furthermore, we evaluated the consistency of the growth rates used in the financial forecast using external market assessments.
We also confirmed the accuracy of the Company's previous forecasts by comparing the budgets of previous financial years with actual results and by analyzing deviations. Since even small changes to the discount rate can have a significant impact on the results of impairment testing, we compared the assumptions and parameters underlying the discount rate, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta coefficient, with our own assumptions and publicly available data.
To ensure the computational accuracy of the valuation model used, we verified the Company's calculations on the basis of selected risk-based elements.
In order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the impact of potential changes in the discount rate, earnings performance and long-term growth rate on the value in use (sensitivity analysis) by calculating alternative scenarios and comparing these with the values stated by the Company.
OUR OBSERVATIONS The calculation method used for impairment testing of the Reebok brand is appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be applied. The assumptions and parameters used by management are balanced overall.
FIRST-TIME APPLICATION OF "IFRS 16 LEASES"
For the accounting policies used and the disclosures on the judgments applied by management and sources of estimation uncertainties please refer to Note 2 and for the disclosures on the accounting of leases please refer to Notes 1, 12, 21 and 39 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK As of December 31, 2019, right-of-use assets of EUR 2,931 million and lease liabilities of EUR 3,132 million are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG. Lease liabilities or right-of-use assets account for 15.2% or 14.2% of total equity and the accounting treatment of the rights of use or lease liabilities therefore has a material impact on the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Company.
The first-time application of "IFRS 16 Leases" had a material effect on the opening balance sheet figures for the financial year and how they were updated as of the reporting date. adidas AG applies the modified retrospective method for the new standard without adjustment of comparative figures.
The determination of the lease term, the amount of the lease payments and the incremental borrowing rate used as the discount rate may require judgment and be based on estimates. Furthermore, determining the first-time application effect of IFRS 16 and the updated lease liabilities and right-of-use assets in accordance with the standard requires the recording of extensive data from the lease agreements.
There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recorded in full in the consolidated statement of financial position. There is also the risk that the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not been appropriately measured.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH In an initial step, we gained an understanding of the process used by adidas Group to implement the new IFRS 16 accounting standard. We then analyzed the functional design and the accounting instructions underlying the implementation in terms of compliance with IFRS 16.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

We assessed the appropriateness and setup of the controls established by adidas Group to ensure the full and correct determination of the data to measure the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets from leases. Where IT processing systems were used to determine and collect relevant data, we tested the effectiveness of the rules and procedures of the underlying accounting-related IT system, with the involvement of our IT experts.
For some lease agreements selected as a representative sample and some selected based on risk criteria, we assessed whether the relevant data was correctly and fully determined. To the extent that accounting judgments were made for determining the lease term, we examined whether ­ in light of the business model of adidas, prevailing market conditions and risks in the industry ­ the underlying assumptions are comprehensible and consistent with other assumptions made in the financial statements.
With the involvement of our valuation experts, we compared the assumptions and parameters underlying the incremental borrowing rates with our own assumptions and publicly available data. We also assessed the calculation model for the interest rate in terms of appropriateness.
For the lease agreements in the sample detailed above, we verified the computational accuracy of the values of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets determined by the IT system SAP RE-FX of adidas AG.

OUR OBSERVATIONS adidas has established appropriate procedures to record leases for the purposes of IFRS 16. The assumptions and parameters used to measure the lease liabilities and right-ofuse assets are appropriate overall.
OTHER INFORMATION Management or the supervisory board is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following not audited parts of the management report: ---- the integrated combined non-financial statement which is
marked as unaudited, ---- and the corporate governance statement with the corporate
governance report.
The other information comprises furthermore the remaining parts of the annual report.
The other information does not comprise the audited financial statement and the management report information audited for content and our auditor's report.
Our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information ---- is materially inconsistent with the group management
report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or ---- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

In accordance with our engagement letter, we conducted a separate assurance engagement of the consolidated nonfinancial statement. Please refer to our assurance report dated February 27, 2020, for information on the nature, scope and findings of this assurance engagement.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal

requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material

misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: ---- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. ---- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. ---- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Executive Board and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board and related disclosures. ---- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report

or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. ---- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB. ---- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. ---- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides. ---- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Executive Board in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Executive Board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR REGARDING THE COMBINED NONFINANCIAL STATEMENT 1
To the Supervisory Board of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach
We have performed an independent limited assurance engagement on the Combined Non-Financial Statement of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, (further the "Company" or "adidas") and the adidas Group according to §§ 315b, 315c German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with §§ 289b to 289e HGB (further the "Report") for the year from January 1 to December 31, 2019.
As described in the section "Working conditions in our supply chain" in the Report, 1,191 social compliance and environmental audits at suppliers were performed by inhouse technical staff as well as external third-party monitors commissioned by adidas business entities and licensees. The reasonableness and accuracy of the conclusions from the performed audit work were not part of our limited assurance engagement.
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY The management board of adidas is responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with §§ 315b, 315c HGB in conjunction with §§ 289b to 289e HGB.
This responsibility of the management board includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for

individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Report in a way that is free of ­ intended or unintended ­ material misstatements.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE ON THE PART OF THE AUDITING FIRM We are independent from the Company in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set out in legal provisions and professional pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit firm applies the legal provisions and professional pronouncements for quality assurance, in particular the professional code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschafts prüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW QS 1).
PRACTITIONER'S RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed of the Report within a limited assurance engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information" published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Report for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2019, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315b, 315c HGB in conjunction with §§ 289b to 289e HGB.

1 Our engagement applied to the German version of the Annual Report 2019. This text is a translation of the Limited Assurance Report issued in German, whereby the German text is authoritative.

We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor's own judgement.
Within the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures: ---- Inquiries of personnel on group level who are responsible
for the materiality analysis to get an understanding of the process for identifying material topics and respective report boundaries for adidas ---- A risk assessment, including media research, of relevant information about the sustainability performance of adidas in the reporting period ---- Evaluation of the design and implementation of systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of disclosures on environmental, employee and social matters, human rights, corruption and bribery, including data consolidation ---- Inquiries of personnel on group level who are responsible for determining disclosures on concepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, the conducting of internal controls and consolidation of the disclosures ---- Evaluation of selected internal and external documents ---- Analytical evaluation of data and trends of quantitative disclosures which are reported by all sites on group level ---- Assessment of local data collection and reporting processes and reliability of reported data via a sampling survey in Herzogenaurach (Germany) and a video conference with the distribution center Moscow (Russia) ---- Evaluation of data collection and reporting processes and reliability of reported E-KPI and C-KPI data via a sampling survey for the two most relevant suppliers (by production volume, tier 1) conducted via video conferences with the sites in Vietnam and Indonesia

CONCLUSION Based on the procedures performed and the evidence received to obtain assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Report of adidas for the business year from January 1 to December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315b, 315c HGB in conjunction with §§ 289b to 289e HGB.

LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK The Leadership Framework is based on the three company behaviors creativity, collaboration, confidence (the `3Cs') and articulates the particular behaviors that are expected of leaders at adidas. The framework was developed jointly with employees worldwide who provided feedback on what great leadership within adidas looks like to them. It provides a global and universal language that is inclusive, reduces the need for local interpretations and outlines concrete behaviors that serve as a measure of leadership effectiveness. It is built into the way we hire and promote as well as rate performance.
/M
MARKETING EXPENDITURE Expenditure that relates to point-of-sale and marketing investments. While point-of-sale investments include expenses for advertising and promotion initiatives at the point of sale as well as store fittings and furniture, marketing investments relate to sponsorship contracts with teams and individual athletes as well as to advertising, events and other communication activities. Marketing overhead expenses are not included in marketing expenditure.

At the end of 2019, adidas started to deploy its Speedfactory technologies to produce athletic footwear at two of its suppliers in Asia. Production at the Ansbach and Atlanta Speedfactories will be discontinued by April 2020. This will enable adidas to continue to respond to short-term trends in demand while using production capacities more flexibly and economically and expanding the range of products with short production times faster.
