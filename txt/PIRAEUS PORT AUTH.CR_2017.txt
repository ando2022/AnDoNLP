The Port of Piraeus (Piraeus Port) is the largest port in Greece, spanning a coastline more than twenty-four kilometres in length and expanding over an aggregate area exceeding five million square meters. The geographic location of the Piraeus Port makes it a vital transportation, trade and supply, tourism and communication hub connecting the Greek islands with the mainland, as well as being an international centre of marine tourism and the commercial passage of cargos.

The Port of Piraeus is situated at the intersection of sea routes linking the Mediterranean with Northern Europe and due to its geographic position (south of the 38th parallel) enables major liner ships to access it without significant deviation from the Far East trade routes. It hosts a complex and unique variety of port activities, including: Cruise activity, Coastal (ferry/passenger) activity(it is the largest passenger port in Europe), all types of cargos handling activity, ship repair activities, as well as free zone (a control type I customs free zone) operating under applicable tax and customs legislation in the area currently designated pursuant to Decisions D18/7.8.2013 (Government Gazette B' 2038/22.8.2013) and D18/9.9.2013 (Government Gazette B' 2330/17.9.2013) of the Minister of Finance (Piraeus Free Zone).

D. Past performance, comments on Financial Statements and tangible / intangible assets
D1.Past performance The growth rate of the Greek economy is expected for the year 20171, in real terms, slightly below 1.5%. 2017 is therefore, for the first time after 9 years, a year of development. Naturally, one reason that allows this development is that the economy starts from a very low base, either in the past two years of stagnation, or in the accumulated recession since the onset of the crisis. In a positive direction, the particularly favorable external environment contributes decisively, where local geographic conditions have boosted incoming tourism but also more widely, as high growth rates are recorded in Europe and internationally, the cost of money is particularly low, as relatively low is energy . However, the positive growth rate is welcome, but it is also worrying that they are low, given the favorable economic environment, where the growth rate for the current year is about half that initially targeted by economic policy through the budget and the adjustment program.
Comment on Financial Statements for the year ended 2017 Statement of comprehensive income i. Revenues The total revenues for the year amounted to  111.5 million increased by 7.7% or  8.0 million (December 31, 2016:  103.5 million). This increase, after taking into account one-month strike of the employees and workers which took place in the prior year, is due to the significant increase in revenue of container terminal of  7.0 million or 53.1% as well as an increase to concession agreement of Pier II & III by 8.4% or approximately  3.4 million (after taking into account the offsetting, by approximately  3.4 million, of the electricity expense for Pier II with the relevant revenue which was invoiced to the related party PCT, by January 1, 2017 and onwards) . On the contrary, a decrease of 11.5% or by approximately  1.5 million, occurred in the revenues of the cruise sector.
ii.Other income Other income for the year amounted to  6.7 million increased by 31.4% or 1.6 million (December 31, 2016:  5.1 million). The change is mainly due to the increase in the income from the reverse of unused provisions of  1.9 (Note 25). On the contrary, a decrease by approximately  0.7 million, occurred in the various operating income, mainly from the decrease of subsidies and decrease of one-off income invoiced in the current year but refers to prior year.
iii. Expenses The key operating costs are the staff costs and in 2017 significantly increased to  57.8 million from  49.3 million in 2016.The significant increase is due mainly to the Company's obligation to pay the Easter Bonus, Vacation Allowance and Christmas Bonus, due to its privatization as of August 10, 2016. Also, PPA S.A. management has decided during the current year to grant voluntary retirement incentives to those employees who have been entitled to a pension with any provisions and according to specific conditions set by the management. Until December 31, 2017, 68 employees and 7 workers received the retirement incentives amounted to  1.7 million (note 25) and a provision amounted to  0.8 million was made for another 35 who announced their intention to use the incentive in 2018. Finally, one month's strike by employees and workers took place from May to June 2016.

For other expenses, they averaged approximately last year's figures, with "Utilities" showing the greatest decrease, since they amounted to  12.7 million compared to  15.5 million of 2016.The change is mainly due to the reduction of electricity cost and water supply of the production process (note 24) which was offset by the increase in the concession agreement fee to the Greek State due to a change on its calculation following the implementation of Law 4404 / 8.7.2016 compared with 2016. Also a decrease was made in "Various Expenses" which amounted to  4.0 million compared to 4.8 million in 2016. The change is mainly due to the reduction of the cost of port cleaning because of a new modified contract that was signed.
The consumption of material showned a significant increase of 88.9% and amounted to  1.7 million in the 2017 compared to  0.9 million in 2016.
Depreciation expenses showned a decrease, amounted to  13.5 million (December 31, 2016:  14.0 million).
Finally, a significant decrease was noted in the provision for bad debts, where an additional provision of  3.5 million for the current period was made, in contrast to the amount of  6.1 million that was made in the year 2016.
iv. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year amounted to  2.2 million, compared to the year 2016 ( 5.1 million), showing a significant decrease of  2.9 million. The decrease is mainly due to the compensation paid during the previous year to a municipality (for municipal fees, municipal tax plus additional surcharges) of approximately  3.8 million. On the contrary, an increase to third parties compensation by approximately  0.8 million, occurred in the current year.
Statement of financial position
i. Total Assets Total assets at December 31, 2017 amounted to  363.9 million, increased by 0.9% or  3.2 million (December 31, 2016:  360.7 million). The increase in total assets is mainly due to the following: the increase of the net book value of property, plant and equipment by the amount of  3.5 million (due to the significant additions amounted to  17.8 million decreased by current year depreciation) as well as the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash by  2.8 million. This increase was partly offset, mainly by the decrease of  3.9 million in deferred tax asset mainly due to the reassessment and impairment of  3.7 deferred tax asset on provisions for bad debts (Note 8). oreover, trade and other receivables showned a slight decrease by  0.2 million although a significant decrease by  5.4 million and  1.9 million occurred to the net amount of trade receivables and other receivables respectivelly , which partly offset by the significant increase to advances to suppliers by  7.2 million (Note 10) due to a payment in advance to a related party for the purchase of a floating dock (Note 31).

ii. Total Liabilities Total liabilities at December 31, 2017 amounted to  178.0 million shown a decrease of  5.2 million (31.12.2016:  183.2 million). The change in total liabilities is mainly due to the changes in the following sub-headings, namely: the reduction of long term borrowings by  6.0 million due to the repayment of four installments, the decrease of provisions by  2.1 mainly due for the reversal of provision for legal claims by third parties (Note 15), the decrease of the deferred income (concession agreement) by  1.3 million, as well as the reduction of the government grants by  0.9 million. These decreases were mainly offset by the net increase of accrued and other short-term liabilities of  3.5 million compared to December 31, 2016 which is mainly due to the increase in customer's payments in advance by  1.5 million , an increase of  1.1 million in concession agreement payment as well as the provision recorded for employee's voluntary retirement incentives by  0.8 million (Note 20). In addition an increase of  1.2 million in income tax payable, was reported in relation to the year 2016.

In addition to the above mandatory investments, PPA S.A. plans additional investments concerning: - Development of a logistics center in the former ODDY area , - Construction of two car park buildings, in the G2 region - Construction of a Cruise Passenger Terminal
2. Principal risks
A. Monitoring the supply chain with reference to the main suppliers and their cooperation rules.
Supply Chain There are no suppliers, the interruption of which would jeopardize the operation of the Company in the event of a temporary failure of supplies provision through suppliers.
B. Future prospects and how these are affected by the existing regulatory framework. ARTICLE 105 OF THE NEWLY ENACTED LAW 4504/2017 (Government Gazette Issue A 184/29 Nov. 2017) OF THE MINISTRY OF SHIPPING, AMENDING IN PRACTICE THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT ("HRCA") BETWEEN PPA S.A. AND THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC
Whereas according to the HRCA the Company has the right to either provide ships' waste management services itself or grant the right to one provider through open tender, application of Article 105 ("Provision of port reception, waste management and cargo residues services") of the above Law requires that the Company signs a contract with more than one entities expressing interest to provide the service, provided such entities are registered in the Ministry of Environment. This may lead to reductions in revenue from the above services and increase environmental risk for the Company, due to lack of knowledge of (i) the financial agreements between ships and service providers, and (ii) the technical adequacy of such service providers.
C. Other risks that are related to the activity or sector that the company is operating.
- Risk of loss of assets The Company takes all necessary measures to minimize the risk and possible losses of assets due to natural disasters or similar related causes. - Property insurance PPA S.A. has insured all its assets in accordance with the provisions of Article 17.1 of the CA with the Greek State for the following cases of damages: Fire, lightning, explosion, storm damage, aircraft crashes and named perils or Property All Risks, based on new replacement cost of asset. - Business Interruption in case of loss of income after a disaster. The income loss has been insured due to disaster-related closing of the business facility or due to the rebuilding process after a disaster, i.e. storm, earthquake, flood and strikes riots & terrorist risks. -Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) analysis According to the requirements of the provisions of Art. 17 and Annex 17.1 of the CA, the company, is in the process of preparing the Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) analysis.

The relevant tender procedure has been published on the PPA website on 28 December 2017 at the following link http://www.olp.gr/el/contests-declarations/itemlist/category/87-promithion.
The MPL analysis includes as a minimum the following elements: 1. Estimation of Maximum Probable Property Loss and loss of income for normal risks, excluding natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.). 2. Estimation of Maximum Probable Property Damage and Loss of Revenues in Disastrous Risks, and in particular in the event of an earthquake. 3. Risk Accountability Quotient that will analyze and quantify the probable scenarios of liability losses, including environmental liability, to identify the worst case scenarios for the worst case scenario.
- Business Risks Associated with the Company's business activities A detailed report on the main risks associated with the sector in which the Company operates is set out in Chapter D of the Non-Financial Report, which follows (Risk Policy and Risk Management / Major Business Risks and Uncertainties)
- Financial Instruments
Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying sheets of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position.
The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets. Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
As at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

- covered by collective labor agreements 961 employees (93.3%), while the remaining 69 employees work either by command (12 lawyers) or on individual contracts (Company Executives, Managers, Deputy Managers, Assistant Managers).
- 143 were women and 887 men (13.88% rate and 86.12% respectively). In addition, there was 1 employee under labor contract of private law for a fixed period and 5 under project contract basis. The gender difference in the Company's staffing is mainly attributable to the labor intensive characteristics of the main work items of PPA S.A., which showed an interest in recruitment almost exclusively by men, despite the fact that in the relevant declarations for the recruitment of personnel of these specialties (dock workers, lifting equipment operators, heavy-duty drivers) there were no gender exclusion criteria. Of the 130 employees assigned in responsibility positions on various tiers of the company's hierarchy (manager, deputy manager, assistant manager, head of sector, superintendent supervisor), 93 (71.54%) were men with and 37 (28.46%) women among which around 42.22% of manager, deputy manager, assistant manager positions are covered by women.

A) Description of the PPA S.A. Business Model.

In addition to the Report of the Board of Directors entitled "Analysis of the development & performance of the company's activities and position" and the brief description of the business model that has taken place, the following are stated:

The Piraeus Port Authority S.A. (PPA) PPA is the legal entity entrusted with the administration and operation of the Port of Piraeus. It was established as a legal entity of public law by virtue of Law 4748/1930, which was restated by Compulsory Law 1559/1950 and ratified by Law 1630/1951, each as subsequently amended and supplemented. In 1999 PPA was transformed into a stock corporation (société anonyme).

Pursuant to the enabling provisions contained in the thirty-fifth article of Law 2932/2001 (Government Gazette A' 145/27.7.2001), the Hellenic Republic and PPA entered into a concession agreement on 13 February 2002 (2002 HRCA). In the 2002 HRCA, the Hellenic Republic granted PPA the exclusive right of use and exploitation of the land, buildings and infrastructure comprising the Port of Piraeus, for an initial term of forty years, and subject to further terms and conditions. Certain amendments to the 2002 Agreement, including the extension of the concession's term by ten years, were authorised on behalf of the Hellenic Republic by virtue of a joint ministerial decision on 19 November 2008 (Government Gazette B' 2372/21.11.2008). These amendments were agreed upon in an addendum to the 2002 Agreement executed between the Hellenic Republic and PPA on 18 November 2008 (the 2008 HRCA). The 2002 Agreement, as amended by the 2008 Addendum (together the Old Concession Agreement), was subsequently ratified by virtue of the first and third article of Law 3654/2008 (Government Gazette A' 57/03.04.2008).

In April 2016, following an open international public tender process, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), under its capacity as the major shareholder of PPA, and COSCO HK Ltd entered into a Shares Purchase Agreement (hereinafter: SPA) for the acquisition of the majority participation of 51% in the share capital of PPA. In August 2016, after the satisfaction of certain conditions

Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A. Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
precedent, the SPA was affected by the execution of the transaction and the transfer of PPA's majority shares from HRADF to COSCO HK Ltd and PPA S.A. ceased to be a state-owned company and since that day it is a private-owned company.
In the framework of the Privatisation Process and as envisaged and permitted by the Old Concession Agreement (including, without limitation, article 15.1(iii) thereof), the Hellenic Republic and PPA engaged in negotiations, resulting in the finalisation and conclusion of a new amendment of the Old Concession Agreement, which was finally signed by the parties on 29/06/2016 and ratified by law 4404/2016 (Government Gazette A' 126/08.07.2016).
The objective of the Company is to perform its obligations, conduct its activities and exercise its faculties under or in respect of the concession agreement between the Company and the Hellenic Republic dated 13 February 2002 regarding the use and exploitation of certain areas and assets within the Port of Piraeus, as amended and in force (the "Concession Agreement"), in accordance with the law.
For the purpose of attaining its object under paragraph 1 above, the Company may, by way of an illustrative but no means exhaustive list, conduct and engage in the following activities: (a) use all rights assigned to the Company pursuant to the CA and maintain, utilize and exploit all concession assets in accordance with the Concession Agreement; (b) provide services and facilities to vessels, cargo and passengers, including ship berthing and cargo and passenger handling to and from the port; (c) install, organize and exploit all kinds of port infrastructure; (d) undertake any activities related to the port and all other commercial activities associated with or reasonably incidental to the operation of the port of Piraeus; (e) engage third parties to provide any kind of port services; (f) award contracts for works; (g) engage in such further activities as are prudent or customary for the proper conduct of its business and operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement; and (h) engage in any and all activities, transactions or operations of a type that are conducted by commercial corporations generally.
Evolution of Business Activities
Cruise Activity In the cruise sector, Piraeus has managed to maintain its leading position in Greece and minimise traffic losses despite the negative circumstances of the eastern Mediterranean due to exogenous factors (instability in Turkey, the war in Syria and negative publicity due to refugee flows). Characteristically is noted that in 2017, cruise passengers in Greece declined by 11% and cruise ship arrivals by 21%. In Piraeus, in 2017, passenger traffic amounted to 1,055,559 compared to 1,094,135 in 2016, recording a marginal decrease of 3.5%. A 5.7% decrease in homeport passenger was recorded with 332,611 in 2017 compared to 352,663 in 2016. Cruise ship calls amounted to 576, down 7.8% versus 2016 (625). It is noted that in 2014 there was corresponding passenger traffic with 2017 (1,055,556) with 606 ship calls, which
Page 31  118
NNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 31
Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

(amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
confirms the increase in the average size of the cruise ships calling Piraeus and the Management's strategic choice to invest in new infrastructure capable of accepting ships over 300m.
Coastal traffic Total coastal passenger traffic in 2017 recorded an increase of 2.5% to 15,555,123 passengers compared to 15,178,279 in 2016. This increase came from the improved traffic volumes for the Aegean and the Saronic islands (5.6% and 7.2% respectively), while the Salamis ferry service and the "economically unsustainable routes" recorded a total decrease of 95,447 passengers. A similar picture is presented in the traffic of vehicles, with an increase in traffic by 2.3% (2,648,725 in 2017 compared to 2,589,908 in 2016). A reduction is recorded in the traffic of "economically unsustainable routes" (29.5%) and a marginal decrease in the Saronic ferry service (0.01%), which is countered by a significant increase (8.9%) of traffic to the Aegean and Saronic islands (2.2% ) with a total of 850,558 vehicles in 2017 compared to 789,267 in the previous year.
Car Terminals For the third consecutive year, the car terminals of finished merchandised vehicles recorded an increase in a rising trend. Total traffic in 2017 amounted to 431,157 vehicles compared to 361,912 in 2016, recording a double-digit growth rate (19.1%). The increase in traffic was supported by the increase of vehicles for the domestic market by 10.3% (99,325 against 90,079 in 2016). However, the introduction of vehicles is far behind the 2009 traffic, before the financial crisis, when more than 173,000 vehicles were handled, indicating the positive prospects of the terminal. The increase in transhipment was significant growing by 22.1% to 331,832 against 271,833 units in 2016 as a result of the recovery of some of the developing markets in North Africa served by Piraeus and the increase in exports of vehicles from Japan and Korea.
Container Terminal Pier I in 2017 handled 453,264 TEU compared to 265,716 TEU in 2016, achieving an increase of 70.6%. The volume of domestic cargo also increased for the second consecutive year from 61,980 TEU in 2016 to 76,188 TEU in 2017, achieving an increase of 22.9%. The impressive increase in traffic was fueled by the general increase in traffic flows, the attraction of two additional mother ships and the stable working conditions that allowed the terminal to operate smoothly. Ship Repair Activity The ship repair sector recorded a small increase (3.9%), with 244 ships in 2017 undertaking repairs at the dry docks and ship-repair areas of the PPA compared with 235 in 2016. The development of ship repair activities depends on a large number of exogenous factors, primarily though is significantly limited by the infrastructure capacity. In this context, PPA has purchased and expects the delivery of a new floating dock with a capacity of 80,000 tonnes and a lifting capacity of 22,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2018. International Conditions ­ Prospects PPA acts as an international trade gate for the country as well as a transhipment centre for goods primarily for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions. The Company's activities depend on

the country's economic conditions, the course of international trade and the geopolitical conditions of the immediate geographical environment.
China's geopolitical initiative for efficient sea routes between ports in various countries and China within the framework of the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road program creates significant positive prospects2. This program is the maritime component of the Belt and Road Initiative, and Piraeus can benefit from the role of port entry into the EU and from increased connections with other ports.
Cruise Activity Worldwide, based on CLIA data3, the cruise market in 2017 is expected to reach 25.8 million passengers versus 24.7 million in 2016. In particular, the European cruise market in 2016 reached around 6.7 million passengers are sourced from passengers in Germany, UK, Italy, France and Spain, which account for about 86% of cruise demand. While the markets in Germany and UK increased by 11.3% and 5.6% respectively in 2016, the markets of Italy and France recorded a decrease of 7% and 6% respectively, mainly as a result of restrictive economic policies.
Beyond the general market context, the cruise in the eastern Mediterranean was negatively affected by political instability in Turkey. Despite the temporary benefit of cruise diversion from Istanbul to Piraeus due to the political events that took place in July 2016, long-term volatility in the neighbouring country will negatively affect the number of ships and cruise services offered in the wider region. This, coupled with the negative publicity from refugee flows, the war in Syria and the redirection of cruises from Israel and Egypt, creates an adverse juncture for 2018 as regards the number of passenger routes and volumes. In the longer term, the fact that China became the second largest cruise source market in 2016, surpassing Germany and UK creates positive prospects for Piraeus. The launch of a direct air link between Athens and Beijing and the fact that the port is managed by a Chinese state subsidiary, COSCO SHIPPING, creates positive prospects for increasing homeport passengers Piraeus.
Coastal Traffic Coastal shipping is mainly influenced by the economic situation in the country that affects the
movement of passengers and cargo to and from the islands and to a lesser extent by the volume of tourists. Passenger traffic to and from the islands is affected also by the intensity of competition between low-cost airlines and ships. For the period 2018-2021, an average economic growth rate of 2.4%4 is forecasted that will help maintain passenger and cargo flows for the islands. The arrivals of tourists for 2017 are estimated at 28.5 million and are expected to reach 30 million in 2018, with a positive effect on the port traffic. On the other hand, the privatisation of island airports, in the long run, could increase direct charter flights to the islands thus reducing tourists visiting the islands through Piraeus. The upward trend in oil prices after the low prices recorded in November 2016 could reduce the competitiveness of

the ship over the aeroplane and hence the volumes of traffic to the islands. Based on the above in the medium term, the change in passenger traffic is projected to be marginal.
Car Terminals The maritime seaborne trade of finished merchandise vehicles, excluding trans-European transport, following a 1% reduction in 2016, rose by around 5% in 20175. In the two years 2016-2017, the supply of ships was higher than demand, which led to a reduction in freight rates. Given that this market is relatively concentrated on a few carriers, there was pressure on freight rates that also led to a pressure on port operators to contain port charges.
Despite the adverse market conditions, Piraeus has benefited from the partial recovery of the North African markets, the increase in exports from Japan and Korea (3% and 4% respectively) and operating problems observed in critical competitive ports in the eastern Mediterranean. The overall improvement in the economic climate at the international level is expected to help maintain the positive outlook for the transhipment cargo.
The steady recovery of imports for the domestic market is showing an upward trend as vehicle registrations in 2017 recorded an increase of 20.8% following an increase of 11% in 20166. The positive outlook for the national economy for 2018 creates good prospects for further domestic demand growth.
In the medium term, PPA plans significant investments to increase its capacity and capitalise on the positive economic environment in the eastern Mediterranean. It plans the construction of two five-storey parking spaces to increase capacity with dedicated space for High and Heavy vehicles, electronic management systems and a free zone status.
Container Terminal According to the most recent data, seaborne container trade in TEU is expected to increase by 5.2% in 2017, compared with an increase of 3.8% in 20167. The increase in transported volumes was mainly driven by the increase in the primary routes from Asia and Europe to North America as well as by increased traffic within Asia. The Asia-Europe route directly related to Piraeus increased by 5% in 2017, compared to a 2% in 2016 and this had a positive effect on the volumes handled at Piraeus terminals. The qualitative features of the terminal such as large natural drafts, 24-hour single tariff operation, tidefree access, good weather conditions and the competitive bunker market help to attract routes from all three shipping alliances. This underlines the significant prospects of the terminal that are enhanced by the improved operation under the new management. In addition to improving flows, the critical factor contributing to the increase in traffic in Piraeus in the medium term is the take-over by COSCO SHIPPING combined with the expansion of Ocean Alliance, which has the most extensive East-West network and will positively assist the attraction of new services.

Ship Repair Activity Traditionally, Piraeus has significant shipbuilding activity and know-how. The lack of infrastructure renewal and the loss of competitiveness to neighboring countries make the industry failure in to maintain a leading role in the region. As a result, most of the ship repair activity took place in countries such as Turkey and Bulgaria, which appear to offer lower costs but do not offer better know-how. On several occasions, based on their know-how and expertise, companies from Piraeus SRZ undertook ship repairs in other countries. The purchase and utilization of the new drydock by PPA, which will be operational within the first four months of 2018, combined with the upgrading of other infrastructure at the SRZ will positively increase the ship repair works. At the same time, the creation of cooperative structures between PPA and the companies at the SRZ to jointly undertake ship repair works will contribute to improving competitiveness and will offer the opportunity for competitive offers at international level. In this context, the mediumterm outlook for Piraeus SRZ is considered to be particularly positive considering the political instability in the directly competitive market of Turkey.
B) Policies and Due Diligence.
b.1. Policies and Due Diligence for environmental issues
 Implementation of Contingency Plans
PPA S.A. implements Emergency Terrestrial & Marine Pollution Contingency Plans, approved by the competent Hellenic Ministry, for dealing with oil pollution incidents and other harmful substances in the port area. Emergency situations are fully covered by the aforementioned contingency plans. During the years 2016 and 2017 19 pollution incidents took place per year in the area of competence of PPA. PPA S.A. responded successfully to oil spill pollution call-outs, all of which were minor and efficiently managed.
 Regulating Issues of Shipwrecks' Lifting / Raising, removal of dangerous and harmful vessels
According to Articles 2, 3 and 5 of Law 2881/2001 "Regulation of wreck raising issues and other provisions", they must be lifted and removed (by the owner of the shipwreck or ship) out of port, in a whole or in parts, or, if required from the circumstances, shifted or destroyed or in any way eliminated, in accordance with the applicable provisions, in order to eliminate any risk and prevent any adverse consequence from the existence of the shipwreck, which constitutes a risk to navigation in the area of port's responsibility, obstructs the mooring, the anchoring, the berthing, the use of docks and generally the port's operation, or harms or threatens to harm the environment:
- shipwrecks within the meaning of Article 2 of Law 2881/2001 because they are semi-sinked and may cause damage to the rest of the vessels docked in the particular sea area, they disturb the proper operation of the port, - dangerous and harmful ships in a port within the meaning of Article 3 of Law 2881/2001, because their overall situation implies a sinking possibility,

- constitute harmful ships due to immobility in a port within the meaning of Article 5 of Law 2881/2001 that remain stationary and idle without maintenance and diligence in the port area.
In the context of the above Law, an Advisory Committee was established by PPA, on issues of lifting, removing or eliminating shipwrecks or ships. This committee, which is chaired by a PPA executive, is composed by representatives of the Piraeus Port Police Authority (A, B, C and D Port Departments), representative of the Attica Region, representative of the Piraeus Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representatives of the Local Authorities (Municipality of Piraeus, Municipality of Perama, Municipality of Keratsini-Drapetsona and Municipality of Salamina).
he Committee's work is to issue an opinion on the matters of lifting or elimination of shipwrecks or ships located in the port area of PPA S.A.
b.2. Policies and Due Diligence for safety issues
At high-risk areas (Container Terminal and Perama Ship Rrepair Zone) the organization provides two ambulances with trained rescue personnel (two rescuers per vehicle) that are available 24/7, to cover emergencies that may occur in the above mentioned areas
b.3. Due Diligence Policies for Regulatory Issues
To comply with the requirements of the CA dated 24 June 2016 concluded between the Hellenic Republic and Piraeus Port Authority S.A. regarding the Use and Exploitation of Certain Areas and Assets within the Piraeus Port, by decision of the Company Management was established Monitoring Committee of the above concession. The task of this Committee, in which nine (9) staff members of PPA S.A. and two (2) external legal counselors participate, is to monitor, control and coordinate each responsible PPA S.A. Department actions, relating to the implementation and compliance with the terms of the June 24th of 2016 CA, within the designated timelines. The CA Monitoring Committee regularly submits progress reports to the Management of the Company for any issue related to the CA follow up.
C) Outcome of those Policies.
c.1. Outcome of Policies for environmental protection issues
 Incident of sinking of the ship Agia Zoni II Concerning the incident of sinking of the ship Agia Zoni II, which caused extensive oil spill pollution in Saronikos sea area, it is mentioned that the incident happened outside but in the vicinity of the area of competence of PPA. The Contingency Plan of PPA was activated (continuous inspections, floating dams, direct response to pollution detected at the port entrance) immediately (from the first day of the sink) and prevented the spread of the pollution in the sea area of PPA. The quantities of waste collected at PPA's area were about 5.8 m3.

 Regulating Issues of Shipwrecks' Lifting / Raising, removal of dangerous and harmful vessels As a result of the above paragraph b.1 of the described policy for shipwrecks' lifting and hazardous and harmful ships' removal, the Advisory Committee on 11-07-2017, 03-10-2017, 14-12-2017 and 27-12-2017 meetings and after taking into account:
(a) the provided general information material, (b) the Committee members' knowledge, (c) the ships' current situation, (d) the official documents, (e) the provisions of the previously mentioned laws
unanimously gave the following opinion: 1) The following ships:
C/F "ALKYON", C/F "TARTY", constitute shipwrecks within the meaning of Article 2 of Law 2881/2001 because they are semi-sinked and may cause damage to the rest of the vessels docked in the particular sea area, they disturb the proper operation of the port and their overall situation creates a risk in shipping and harms or threatens to harm the environment.
2) The following ships: P/S-C/F "EUROPEAN EXPRESS", T/S "AGIA ZONI I", T/S "TZET XV", P/S "VENOUS", T/B "ARTEMIS V", W/T "PIRAEUS III", W/T "BANI", F/C "THISEAS", T/S "OKOVIA", T/S "MARAKI", P/S-C/F "SAMSOEGRAPHICEN III", T/B "ARTEMIS III", C/S "ANATOLY CHURINOV "F/S "AGIOS NIKOLAOS", T/S "SOTIRIA", T/S "AL PETROIL", BRG "ALKIONI", BRG "ALIKI", C/S "ELENI", P/S-C/F "MAKEDONIA", constitute dangerous and harmful ships in a port within the meaning of Article 3 of Law 2881/2001, because their overall situation implies a sinking possibility, a risk to shipping and affects or threatens to affect the environment.
3) The following ships: C/S"GRAND OSCAR", C/S "OCEAN GLORY", T/S"PYTHEAS" P/S-C/F "ELLI T", P/S-C/F "IONIAN SKY" , constitute harmful ships due to immobility in a port within the meaning of Article 5 of Law 2881/2001 because they remain stationary and idle without maintenance and diligence in the port area, preventing the safe activation and stay of other operating vessels.
In total, the Advisory Committee designated 27 items (mentioned above), for lifting, removal or elimination of shipwrecks, or characterized as shipwrecks or dangerous and damaging vessels, located in the area of PPA's responsibility. For those items the competent organizational unit has already started the relevant procedures which, in the initial stage, include a written invitation to the shipowners to take the necessary action to eliminate any risk and to prevent any adverse consequence of the shipwreck existence, by setting a reasonable time limit for lifting, removing or eliminating/ dismantling the ship.

Invitations for removal have already been sent for nineteen (19) cases of vessels classified as hazardous and harmful and two of them (T/S "OKOVIA" and T/S "SOTIRIA") have already been removed from the port area of PPA.
Additionally, in the framework of the aforementioned procedure: - it was successfully completed (after a relevant bidding tendering process in March 2017) the removal
from the Piraeus Port Zone of the shipwreck "PANAGIA TINOY". With the removal of the wreck from the Central Port area beyond the obvious reduction of environmental pollution risks of the marine area, was also achieved enhancing safety of navigation, releasing of operating coastal shipping vessels berthing positions, aesthetic upgrading of the port image
- it has already received publicity by uploading on the PPA S.A. website (29-11-2017) and through relevant press releases the approval of an open bidding tender for the divestment and removal outside the port area of PPA responsibility, of the designated as dangerous and harmful vessels "Tanker DIMITRA" (ex BL1), and "F/B EUROPEAN EXPRESS".
c.2. Outcome of Policies for Safety Issues
The results of the policies on working safety (24-hour availability of two ambulances in the container terminal and Ship Repair areas) are analyzed in a next chapter of the Non-Financial Report entitled "Employee Issues - Safety working conditions
c.3. Outcome of Due Diligence Policies for Regulatory Issues
The established Monitoring Committee of the CA of 24 June 2016 of the Hellenic Republic and PPA S.A. met thirteen (13) times in the year 2017, controlling in any case the obligations arising for the Company under the above contract and submitted duly completed, within the predetermined date the Compliance Certificate (and its supplementary documents) of 2017, as defined in Article 14.1 (c) of the Concession Agreement.
D) Principal Risks and their Management
Major Business Risks and Uncertainties
Wider Economic Environment Maintaining the stable economic environment in the country is directly related to import and export volumes and, by extension, to the import-export volumes that offer the highest average revenue to the Company. For 2018, the economic and political prospects of the country, as recorded by European and international economic organisations, create a firm belief in stability and the improvement of the economic climate. Regardless of the positive outlook, the company's strategy is based on strengthening and expanding transhipment volumes that are not directly dependent on domestic economic conditions to mitigate any negative impact from a possible negative change in the domestic economic climate.
Economic instability The geopolitical and economic instability in the countries of North Africa, the Asian Mediterranean and the Black Sea have a negative effect on the transhipment volumes in Piraeus. Economies in the Eastern

Mediterranean markets showed mixed signs, despite some markets rebounding. To mitigate risk, the Company has undertaken a program to develop a rail link with Central Europe and is in the process of seeking customers to expand its port hinterland to the north, thus reducing dependence on maritime markets to the south and south-east.
ew forms of energy The 2020 deadline for the use of low-sulfur fuel (0.5%) puts pressure on shipping companies to choose the most appropriate solution through scrubbers or the use of natural gas. Already in the cruise sector, there are orders for 16 ships of seven cruise lines using natural gas. At the same time, container carriers also have ships with dual fuel capabilities. One of the competitive advantages of Piraeus is the extensive and financially competitive shipping fuel supply market. In this context, the Company, in cooperation with the gas sales and distribution companies of Greece, participates in a European funded project aiming at the study and implementation of competent solutions and infrastructures so that ships in the port can be supplied with natural gas. In this way, the Company aims to maintain its competitive advantage as well as to comply with the regulatory requirements of the European Directives.
Non-expanded clientele (Container terminal) In the container sector, the most significant risk comes from the high dependence on a single customer (95% of traffic volume). To mitigate risk, the Company has adopted a customer-centric approach while at the same time implements an aggressive policy to attract new customers. Already, two new 2M mother ships call at Pier I and the company is in talks with perceived positive outcome within the year to attract services from all three alliances.
Geopolitical conditions In the cruise sector, the most significant risk derives from exogenous factors of geopolitical nature. The Company, in order to mitigate the impact, aggressively promotes Piraeus to the Chinese market in which it has privileged access due to its parent company, while at the same time informing the internal market about the best ways to attract tourist volume from China.
No domestic car industry In the car terminals, the greatest risk comes from the total lack of a domestic automobile industry that puts Piraeus at a disadvantage over other terminals in terms of the variable transhipment flows. To mitigate the risk, the company aims to expand services to vehicles with a PDI station within a strategic alliance. In addition, it aims to extend the hinterland by train to the Balkan and Central European countries where automotive factories are located.
E) Financial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators.
A detailed presentation of a mixture of general and sectoral indicators took place in the module Business Model - Evolution of Business Activities with a distinct reference to traffic data of each Company's business (Cruise, Ferry, Car Transmission Station, Container Handling Station, Shipbuilding).

F.1) Environmental Matters.

PPA S.A. recognizes that the resources consumption must be used in an efficient way across the port sector. Port of Piraeus' nature and size favors a high amount of daily energy consumed (e.g. ship-to-shore cranes, terminals lighting, reefer containers, administration buildings, workshops). PPA raises awareness on the subject by promoting initiatives and behaviors to improve the balance of the demand and supply of energy and to reduce energy consumption. In this scope, PPA's first photovoltaic station generating energy using solar panels has been put into operation in July 2016, generating up to 430 kWp. The photovoltaic Station is linked up to the Public Power Corporation electricity grid. PPA S.A. has recognized the need to reduce resource consumption and particularly to save energy while continuing to provide a safe and secure working environment. Electricity and oil usage has been identified in various energy efficiency reviews as an area for potential reduction. Indicative energy saving measures implemented by PPA S.A. are:
 Staff environmental awareness  Purchasing of electrical equipment with > A energy class and certification  Appropriate maintenance of the cooling and heating infrastructures  Replacement of incandescent lamps with energy saving ones  Improvement of buildings' energy efficiency

As shown by the above data on waste, there are not significant differences for 2017 and 2016. There is, however, a slight improvement in waste management for 2017. Thus, in 2017, the quantity of hazardous waste produced at PPA has slightly decreased, which is an environmental progress. Also, in 2017, the quantities of packaging waste (blue bins) that were recycled had a small increase.

It should be noted that the quantities of alternative management waste produced in 2017 are lower than in 2016, which is attributed to the following factors:
-No need for used tires delivery. Has to be note that during the year there was production of used tires but in limited quantities and the further management will take place when will be generated adequate quantities f tires.
- For the waste of Electrical and Electronic Alternative Equipment, is implemented a management system that is including temporary storage in container. After the filling of the container follows the delivery for further management, in the year 2017 there was need for further management, except for the category of lighting equipment waste.
-The used batteries were of limited production, with the consequent reduced quantities for further management.

3. Results of noise measurements
The following table presents the locations and results of the noise measurements for the years 2016 and 2017. It is noted that the locations of the measurements are at the boundary of the ownership of PPA S.A. and are usually affected by road traffic outside the port. It is noticed that the noise level remains constant without significant variations per position in the last four semesters. It is also noted that in the yard of the 1st EPAL of Perama (position 05) PPA S.A. has placed sound panels. Measurements prove that the sound panels ensure the noise protection of the school [the noise is reduced by 10-15 dB (A)].

5. Complaint Management Two complaints about noise nuisance in year 2016 and 1 complaint about noise nuisance in the year 2017, focused on the adjacent Container Terminal area. Regarding the complaints submitted by residents of the area neighboring to the Container Stations, they were thoroughly investigated by PPA S.A.. In relation with the complaints submitted targeted night measurements were carried out in similar operating conditions with those that were described, which confirmed the results of the main monitoring program and in particular, the following results were obtained:
a) The measurements' results are directly influenced by the traffic of the Dimokratias Avenue, which is very close to the houses, while in particular during the night hours the operation of the port (loading, stowage, Straddle Carriers' movement etc. b) becomes audibly perceived to the houses in a lower degree comparatively to the neighboring street.

7. Calculation of GHG emissions (in CO2 equivalents)
The type that is used for the calculation of GHG emissions is based on the resource consumption quantity per activity multiplied with the relative emission factor and converted to the CO2 equivalents. The determination of the key categories for the Greek inventory system is based on the application of the Tier 1 methodology described in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance, adopting the categorization of sources that is presented in table 7.1 of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance.

Tier 1 methodology for the identification of key categories assesses the impacts of various source categories on the level and the trend of the emissions inventory. Key categories are those which, when summed together in descending order of magnitude, add up to over 95% of total emissions (level assessment) or the trend of the inventory in absolute terms.

The main key categories that have been taken in place are: -Indirect emission of electricity consumption
-Emissions from transport (goods and personnel mobility)
-Port activities emissions under normal conditions

Indirect emissions
Electricity consumption Electricity production in Greece relies mostly on the use of fossil fuels (approximately 92% of electricity production in 2007). Specifically, 63% of electricity is produced by solid fuels (lignite using steam coal and/or BKB as additives), while the share of liquid fuels and natural gas is 14% and 22% respectively. The rest of electricity production derives from hydropower and wind energy. The allocation of energy consumption by technology was made on the basis of Public Power Corporation reports on the installed capacity and the characteristics of electricity production plants. Therefore: It is noted that emissions energy consumption for off-road transportation is not considered in the scope of this report.
For the determination of CO2 emissions for electricity consumption of Piraeus Port, the method that is used is based on real data for electricity consumption.
The emission factor for electricity is determined according to the Public Power Corporation reports, as follows:
Emission factor= 850 g CO2 /KWh Emission Factors for conversion of CO2 to CO2 equivalent: CO2= 54,760 kt CO2 eq-Factor 1 (reference) CH4= 0.71 kt CO2 eq ­Factor 0.000013 N2O=0.58 kt CO2 eq-Factor 0.000011
The total annual electricity consumption for year 2017 is: 49,031,716 KWh

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Shareholders of "Piraeus Port Authority S.A."
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of "Piraeus Port Authority S.A." (Company) which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2017, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing which have been transposed into Greek Law (GG/B'/2848/23.10.2012). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the entity's financial statements, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies and procedures used and the reasonableness of estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Independence
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the financial statements in Greece and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services that we have provided to the Company are in accordance with the applicable law and that we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.

We focused on this key audit area due to the magnitude of this DTA, as well as the significant level of judgement exercised by management for the accounting estimate and the outcome of the actions taken in order to gain the tax benefit from the write off of these receivables in the future.

 We reviewed the analysis of the balances and the supporting documentation for the actions taken by management for selected cases in order to understand if these actions were relevant based on the legal framework under which the company operated at the time the action was taken.
 We reviewed the notice letter submitted by management to the relevant tax authorities where they state their intention to utilize the tax benefit (use the DTA) at the time they will write off the long outstanding receivables.

Based on the work performed, we considered that management's rationale for the recognition of the DTA on the long outstanding receivables was supported by the applicable tax legislation at the time the provision was built. Nevertheless, the company will determine any future actions based on the response from the tax authorities.

Contingent liabilities and provisions arising from litigation
The Company faces a number of threatened and actual legal proceedings (see Note 30 Commitments and contingent liabilities par. A and Note 15 Provisions). The level of provisioning and / or the level of disclosure required involves a high level of judgement resulting in provisions and contingent liabilities being considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit approach included the following key procedures:
 We obtained the analysis of provisions established and we compared them to lists provided by the legal department with no exceptions.
 Where relevant we obtained external legal confirmations directly requested by us.
 We discussed a selection of open cases and their possible outcome with company's legal department and/or external lawyers.

Based on evidence obtained we determined the level of provisioning at December 31,2017 to be appropriate (Note 15 ).We also consider that disclosures in Note 30 are deemed to be sufficient.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
(a) Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (E.U.). These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost and going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements according to the IFRS requires estimates and assumptions to be made by the management, influencing the assets and liabilities amounts, the disclosure of potential receivable and liabilities as at the financial statements date, as well as the revenue and expenditure amounts, during the financial period. Actual results may differ from these estimations. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the accounting policies which have been adopted. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2(c).
Management continuously assesses the situation and the possible future impacts in order to ensure that all necessary actions and initiatives are undertaken to minimize possible consequences for the Company's activities. Management cannot accurately forecast the possible developments in the Greek economy; however, based on its assessment, Management has reached the conclusion that no additional impairment provisions of the financial and non-financial assets of the Company are required on December 31, 2017.
Certain line items of the previous year's financial statements were reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.
(b) Approval of Financial Statements
The Board of Directors of the Company approved the financial statements for the year ended at December 31, 2017, on February 13, 2018. The abovementioned financial statements are subject to the final approval of the Annual General Assembly of the Shareholders.
(c) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
The Company makes estimates and judgments in order to select the most appropriate accounting principles taking into consideration the future outcome of events and transactions. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and judgments that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
(i) Allowance for doubtful accounts receivables and legal cases : Management periodically reassess the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and legal cases in conjunction with its credit policy and taking into consideration reports from its legal department, which are prepared following the processing of historical data and recent developments of the cases it is handling. The Company monitors these trade debtors' balances and makes provisions for doubtful debts on an individual basis if its recovery is considered unlikely. As a measure of recovery failure the Company is using the ageing of balance, the insolvency of the trade debtor, ability to exercise coercive measures and its objective difficulty. The maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of guarantees and credit guarantees coincide with the trade receivable book value.

Page 76  118

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A. Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
The probability of negative outcome, as well as possible payment amounts for their settlement is estimated for the formation of the provision at issue cases
(ii) Provision for income taxes: According to IAS 12, income tax provisions are based on estimations as to the taxes that shall be paid to the tax authorities and includes the current income tax for each fiscal year, the provision for additional taxes which may arise from future tax audits and the recognition of future tax benefits. The final clearance of income taxes may be different from the relevant amounts which are included in these financial statements.
(iii) Deferred tax assets on provisions of bad debts: Deferred tax assets are recognized for provisions of bad debts to the extent that it is probable that, based on tax law, the Company has the right to proceed with the tax deduction of the related provision. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the particular actions that have been taken (seizure, auction, filling of relevant lists to the tax authorities etc.) in order to record a provision for bad debts.
(iv) Depreciation rates: The Company's assets are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives. These useful lives are periodically reassessed to determine whether the original period continues to be appropriate. The actual lives of these assets can vary depending on a variety of factors such as technological innovation and maintenance programs. (v) Impairment of property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and chooses a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Company's management having assessed the segment report (Note 22) has identified indications of impairment for Pier I and has used discounted cash flows to calculate the value in use. Based on these calculations the present value of Pier I group of assets exceeds significantly the relevant book value.
(vi) Contingent liabilities: The existence of contingent liabilities requires from management to make assumptions and estimates continuously related to the possibility that future events may or may not occur as well as the effects that those events may have on the activities of the Company.
(vii) Provision for staff leaving indemnities:The cost for staff leaving indemnities is determined based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation requires management to make assumptions about future salary increases, discount rates, mortality rates, etc. Management, at each reporting date when the provision is re-examined, tries to give its best estimate regarding the above mentioned parameters.

3. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company applies the following accounting policies for the preparation of the accompanying financial statements:
(a) Tangible Assets: Buildings, technical projects and other building installations are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible impairment provision. The privately owned land, machinery and other equipment, acquired before PPA's conversion into an S.A., 1.6.1999, were valued at deemed cost, arising by the Evaluation Committee of article 9 C.L. 2190/1920, while those acquired afterwards are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible value impairment provision.
Acquisition cost of a building installation or equipment consists of purchase price include import duties, plus non-refundable purchase taxes as well as any cost required for the asset to become operational. Repairs and maintenance are posted to the financial period in which they were incurred. Significant additions and improvements made at a later stage are capitalized in the relevant asset cost.
Fixed assets constructed by the Company are posted to the self-construction cost which includes subcontractors' fees, materials and technicians' payroll costs involved in the construction (including relevant employer contributions) as well as part of general administration expenses.
Assets under construction include fixed assets under construction and are stated at their cost. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the fixed assets are complete and operational.
(b) Depreciation: Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis according to the following useful lives per fixed asset category:

Fixed Asset Categories Buildings, technical & port projects Machinery & other equipment Motor Vehicles Floating transportation means Furniture, fixture & fittings

Useful Life (years) 25-40 10-30 5-12 20-35 5-10

The residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method of the Company's assets are examined annually and they are adjusted if necessary.
(c) Impairment of non-current financial assets: Property, plant & equipment and intangible fixed assets must be evaluated for possible impairment loss, when there are indications that the asset's book value is over its recoverable amount. When an asset's book value is over its recoverable amount, the respective impairment loss is posted to the period financial results. An asset's recoverable value is the greater amount between the fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified separately (cash generating units). Impairment losses recognized in prior periods in non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date for any reversal.

(d) Investment property: Investment property that includes land and buildings is held by the Company for long-term rental yields and not for own use. Investment property is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment. When the carrying amounts of the investment property exceed their recoverable amounts, the difference (impairment) is charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income. Land is not depreciated. The depreciation of buildings is calculated using the straight line method over the buildings' useful life which is 30 years. Transfers are made to investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner occupation.
(e) Fixed Asset Subsidies: Subsidies are considered as deferred revenue and are recognized as income at the same depreciation rate as the relevant subsidized fixed assets are depreciated. This income is deducted from the depreciation in the period financial results.
(f) Intangible Assets: Intangible assets include software purchase cost and any expenditure for software development. Software depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis and its useful life of 3-4 years.
(g) Borrowing Cost: The Company has adopted the basic accounting policy suggested by IAS 23, where the borrowing cost recognized as expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
(h) Financial Instruments: Financial assets and liabilities, stated in the statement of financial position, includes cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, borrowings and accrued and other current liabilities. The Company does not use financial instrument derivatives neither for balancing the risk nor for profit purposes. Financial instruments appear as receivable, liabilities or equity based on the contents of the relevant contracts. Interest, dividends, profit and loss resulting from financial instruments, considered as receivable or liabilities are respectively posted as expenditure or income. Dividend distribution to shareholders is posted directly to Equity.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position only when the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends either to settle such asset and liability on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
(i) Cash on hand and in banks: The Company considers as cash (apart from cash on hand) time deposits and liquid investments maturing in three months from the acquisition date.
(j) Receivable: Trade receivables are initially recognized at their fair value which is equal to the transaction amount. Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost, less an allowance for any probable uncollectible amounts. If the recovery of claims is expected to take place within 12 months from year-end they are included in current assets, otherwise they are recorded in non-current assets.

(k) Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost: The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a "loss event") and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Company may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument's fair value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
(l) Provisions: Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a borrowing cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date, and if it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, they are reversed. Provisions are used only for expenditures for which they were originally recognized. No provisions are recognized for future operating losses. Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognized.

(m) Income Tax (Current and Deferred): Current and deferred income tax assessment is based on the relevant amounts of the financial statements, according to tax Laws effective in Greece. Current income tax concerns tax on the Company taxable profits, adjusted according to Greek tax Law and calculated using the current tax rate. Deferred tax is assessed using the liability method in all temporary tax differences on the balance- sheet date between the tax base and the accounting value of assets and liabilities. The expected tax consequences from the temporary tax differences are assessed and stated either as deferred tax liabilities or as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are posted to the financial statements for all allowable temporary differences and tax losses carried forward as far as it is likely to set off these allowable temporary differences against available taxable profits.
The accounting value of deferred tax assets is revised at each balance- sheet date and it is reduced up to the point that it is not likely to have enough taxable profits, where part or all of the deferred tax assets may be set off against. Current income tax receivable and liabilities for current and previous financial years are valued at the amount expected to be paid to Tax Authorities (or be refunded by them), using the tax rates (and tax Laws) in force up to the balance- sheet date.
(n) Revenue Recognition: All sales income categories are posted to the financial period they concern, while accrued and not invoiced services income is also accounted for at the balancesheet date. Income is accounted for only if it is possible that financial benefits related to the transaction will inflow to the Company. Rental income is accounted for on a regular basis during the rental period, according to the rental agreement. Interest is accounted for on the accrual basis (taking into account the actual investment return).
(o) Inventories: Materials and spare parts related to the Company mechanical equipment maintenance are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value and their cost is determined on the weighted average cost basis. Net realizable value is estimated based on the current selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. Materials are posted to inventories on purchase and recognized as expenditure on consumption.
(p) Leases: Leases that actually convey to the Company all dangers and benefits relevant to the leased asset are classified as financial leases. Leased fixed assets are capitalized at the beginning of the lease at their fair value or at present value of total minimum finance lease payments, if the latter is lower. Financial lease payments are allocated between financial expenditure and financial liabilities reduction in order to achieve a fixed interest rate for the remaining liability balance. Financial expenditure is debited directly in the period financial results. Capitalized leased fixed assets are depreciated according to their expected useful life.
When the lessor retains all risk and rewards of fixed asset, then these leases are classified as operational leases. Operational lease payments are recognized as expenditure in the Income Statement on a regular basis during the lease.
(q) Defined benefit plan: The provision for staff termination indemnities recorded in the statement of financial position for the defined benefit plan is the present value of the liability for the defined benefit in addition to changes occurring from any other actuarial profit or loss and the past service cost. The discount rate is considered as the yield, at the balance sheet date, of high quality European corporate bonds which have a maturity which approaches the time period of the Company's liability.

The liability for this plan is determined using the projected unit credit method from an independent valuer and includes the present value of accrued services during the year, the interest on future liabilities, the prior service cost and the actuarial gains or losses.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets, are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to the actuarial differences reserve through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not classified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of:
· The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and · The date that the Company recognizes restructuring-related costs
According to the collective PPA S.A. employee agreement (article 9 CA/2000 and article 5 CA/2004) the Company must pay retirement allowances to permanent C.L.L.C. employees equal to the total of seven month regular salary. To employees working under employment contract the Company pays either retirement allowance according to previous regulations or indemnity according to Law 2112/20 as these are revised and effective today according to each employee's previous employment period. Workers are compensated in accordance with the provisions of L. 2112/1920, as these are applied also to employees, and cannot exceed the limit set by L. 173/67 for the broader public sector, as well as the provisions of cases 2 & 3 of subparagraph IA.12 of L. 4093/2012. All of the above, either retirement allowances or indemnities paid, could not exceed the amount of  15,000 which was revised for employees to  30,000. With the provisions of L. 3833/2010 and L. 3845/2010 the amount of  30,000 decreased to  28,531.50.
(r) National Insurance Programs: The obligation for main or supplementary pension provision is covered by the main National Insurance Department (IKA- Social Insurance Institute) which concerns private sector and provides retirement, medical and pharmaceutical services. Each employee is obliged to contribute part of his salary to the National Insurance Department, while part of the total contribution is paid by the Company. On employee retirement the National Insurance Department is responsible for their pension payments. Therefore, the Company has no legal or presumed obligation for future payments according to this program.
The employees of PPA are entitled upon retirement an allowance from the Unified Fund for Supplementary Benefits and Lump-sum Benefits (P) according to the statutory provisions of the Fund and the Law N. 2084/92.
For the two welfare sectors, dockworkers and employees of PPA , the granted amount is currently determined on the basis of the provisions of article 35 of Law N.4387 / 12-05-2016 (FEK), considering the average of the total remuneration ­ without accounting holiday bonuses - on which were calculated social insurance contributions for welfare for the five-year period 2009-2013 and with the employee's work year experience until 31/12/2013. To this amount is added the total of insurance contributions for welfare from 01/01/2014 and afterwards. Every employee is required to contribute a part of his monthly salary to the fund, while part of the total contribution is covered by the Company. This fund is a legal public company and is responsible for paying the above benefits to employees. Consequently, the Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future benefits under this plan.

(s) Earnings per Share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the financial period net profit, corresponding to ordinary shareholders, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued. The accompanying financial statements did not include any profit decreasing bonds or other stock, convertible to shares. Consequently, diluted earnings per share were not calculated.
(t) Interest- Bearing Loans: All loans are initially accounted for at the cost that is the actual loan value less the expenditure related to the loan issue. Afterwards, interest- bearing loans are valued at net book cost on the actual interest rate basis. Net book cost is calculated considering the loan issue expenditure and the difference between the initial and final loan amount. Profits and losses are accounted for a net profit or loss when liabilities are written off or impaired and by depreciation procedure.
(u) Dividends: Dividends are accounted for when receipt rights are finalized by the resolution of the shareholders general meeting.
(v) Concession Agreement to PPA S.A.: In persuasion of the 35th article of 2932/2001 Law, Greek Government and the Company signed on 13.2.2002 the Concession Agreement, by which the government transfers its exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone lands, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port to the Company.
This concession was agreed for fixed period initial duration of 40 years, beginning on the day the agreement and ending on 13.2.2042. The initial duration is possible to be extended once or several times by Law. A new written agreement and modification of the 4.1 article of the Concession Agreement. With the Common Ministry Decision (CMD) no. 8322/3-12-2008, published in Government Paper 2372/21-11-2008, the Concession Agreement duration has been modified from 40 to 50 years, beginning on the 13/2/2002 (initial signature date) and ending on the respective date of the year 2052.
Management has examined whether the contract for the concession of the exclusive right to use and exploit land, buildings and facilities at the Port of Piraeus Land Zone fall under the scope of the provisions of Interpretation 12. Management concluded that the the concession does not fall under the scope of application of Interpretation 12.
Government has received 1% of the Company's consolidated annual income for each of the first 3 years of the concession. The above percentage has increased to 2% of the Company's consolidated annual income after the 3rd year, on the same calculation basis. Based on the new Concession Agreement signed on 24.6.2016 the percentage to Greek State has increased to 3.5% of the Company's consolidated annual income excluding finance income. The concession consideration is recognized in expenses for the year and is included in third party expenses and is included in Accrued and other liabilities(Note 20).
The Company most significant obligations arising from this agreement are:
 Constant rendering of port services
 Responsibility for the installation, improvement and maintenance of the security level in Piraeus Port.
 Ensure fair deal to all port users
 Payment of maintenance expenditure for all the property included in the Concession Agreement

w) Concession Agreement of Piers II and III with COSCO Pacific Ltd (currently COSCO Shipping Port Ltd): The Law 3755/2009 ratified by the Parliament ruled the concession of use and operation of Piers II and III between the Company and COSCO Pacific Ltd. The contract term provided for 35 years at current exchange rates of  4.3 billion, of which 79% is guaranteed and will be held investments totaling  620 million. The Concession Agreement entered into force on 1/10/2009 and till 31/5/2010 the operation of Pier II was provided by the staff of the Company as a subcontractor. Within this period the project in Pier I, which was constructed by the Company, was completed and started its operation by providing services directly to Company's clients.
The Agreement B. Modification of the original Concession Agreement (OG 52 / 30.03.2009) between the Company and PCT S.A., following the 'Practical Process Amicable Settlement', has been published in the Government Gazette 269 / 24.12.2014.
According to the above, the payment of the Guaranteed consideration was suspended until 31.12.2021 and has been replaced by paying only Variable consideration that arises as a percentage on consolidated revenues of PCT S.A. from the previous contract year.
The calculation of fixed consideration I & II is adjusted regarding the length of exploitation and the corresponding sq.m (Note 21).
The concession consideration is recognized in income for the period and the amount of the consideration is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract (Note 21). The payment of Variable Consideration is performed on a monthly basis in arrears and the payment of the standard exchange every six months in advance.
(x) Foreign Currency Conversion: All the operations of the Company are all performed in Euro. Transactions made in foreign currencies are converted into Euro using exchange rates effective at transaction date. Receivable and liabilities in foreign currency are adjusted at the financial statements preparation date in order to state the exchange rates effective at that date. Gains or losses arising from these adjustments are included in the Statement of comprehensive income as foreign exchange gains or losses.

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the annual financial statements, are consistent with those followed for the year ended December 31, 2016, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations applicable for fiscal periods beginning at January 1, 2017. However, those standards have either no significant effect on the Financial Statement of the Company, or no application for the Company.
Standards and Interpretations effective for the current financial year
IAS 7 (Amendments) "Disclosure initiative" These amendments require entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
IAS 12 (Amendments) "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" These amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A. Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Standards and Interpretations effective for subsequent periods
IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and subsequent amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 which deals with the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used today. IFRS 9 establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the current model in IAS 39. The Company plans to adopt the new standard on 1 January 2018 and will not restate the comparative information. During 2017, the Company has performed an impact assessment and concluded that the impact of the implementation of the new standard will be on the impairment of trade receivables. For trade receivables the Company will apply the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The assessment performed is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Company in 2018 when the Company will adopt IFRS 9. The Company expects an increase in the loss allowance resulting in a negative impact on its equity when the new standard is adopted in 2018.
IFRS 9 (Amendments) "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met--instead of at fair value through profit or loss. The Company cannot early adopt the amendments as they have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). IFRS 15 has been issued in May 2014. The objective of the standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. It contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognised. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and that comparatives will not be restated. The Company performed an assessment on its revenue streams based on the five steps prescribed in the standard in order to identify any impacted areas. Management has determined that contracts in general comprise of a single performance obligation and prices are fixed, based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer. Based on this assessment the Company concluded that this standard will have no significant effect on its Financial Statements.

(amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

IFRS 16 "Leases" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). IFRS 16 has been issued in January 2016 and supersedes IAS 17. The objective of the standard is to ensure the lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. The Company has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its financial statements. The Company expects to recognise a significant amount of new assets and liabilities due to its exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone land, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port granted to the Company by the Greek State until 2052, in exchange of an annual percentage payment based on Company's income with a minimum annual fee of Euro 3.5 million.
IFRS 17 "Insurance contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021).IFRS 17 has been issued in May 2017 and supersedes IFRS 4. IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard and its objective is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The new standard solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner. Insurance obligations will be accounted for using current values instead of historical cost. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 2 (Amendments) "Classification and measurement of Shared-based Payment transactions" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The amendment clarifies the measurement basis for cash-settled, share-based payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 4 (Amendments) "Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The amendments introduce two approaches. The amended standard will: a) give all companies that issue insurance contracts the option to recognise in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard is issued; and b) give companies whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 2021. The entities that defer the application of IFRS 9 will continue to apply the existing financial instruments standard--IAS 39.
IAS 40 (Amendments) "Transfers of Investment Property" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018).The amendments clarified that to transfer to, or from, investment properties there must be a change in use. To conclude if a property has changed use there should be an assessment of whether the property meets the definition and the change must be supported by evidence. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IAS 28 (Amendments) "Long term interests in associates and joint ventures" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). The amendments clarify that companies account for long-term interests in an associate or joint venture--to which the equity method is not applied--using IFRS 9. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.

IFRIC 22 "Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The interpretation provides guidance on how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on foreign currency transactions, IAS 21. The Interpretation applies where an entity either pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currency-denominated contracts. The interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRIC 23 "Uncertainty over income tax treatments" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). The interpretation explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. IFRIC 23 applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is such uncertainty, including taxable profit or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates. The interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Annual Improvements to IFRS (2014 ­ 2016 Cycle)
The amendments set out below describe the key changes to two IFRSs. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 12 "Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities" The amendment clarified that the disclosures requirement of IFRS 12 are applicable to interest in entities classified as held for sale except for summarised financial information. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. IAS 28 "Investments in associates and Joint ventures" The amendments clarified that when venture capital organisations, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities use the election to measure their investments in associates or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), this election should be made separately for each associate or joint venture at initial recognition. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Annual Improvements to IFRS (2015 ­ 2017 Cycle) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019)
The amendments set out below include changes to four IFRS. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 3 "Business combinations" The amendments clarify that a company remeasures its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains control of the business.
IFRS 11 "Joint arrangements" The amendments clarify that a company does not remeasure its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains joint control of the business.
IAS 12 "Income taxes" The amendments clarify that a company accounts for all income tax consequences of dividend payments in the same way.
IAS 23 "Borrowing costs" The amendments clarify a company treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing originally made to develop an asset when the asset is ready for its intended use or sale.

32. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying sheets of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position. The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets. Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
