TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Letter from the Management Board

Management Board
Vlasios Choulidis Director of Sales, Marketing and Customer Care

Paschalis Choulidis Executive-Board Spokesman, Director of Finances, Financial Communication, Controlling and IT

Dear Sir or Madam,
During the past scal year, we were able to continue the unbroken success of past years and to exceed our targets. Overall, our Company's development was better than that of the general market. The transformation in our operations from our former position as a classic service provider to that of a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the Telefónica O and Vodafone networks which we launched in the fourth
2
quarter of 2010 is the implementation of an important strategic decision. Initial positive results became evident in 2011. We have now laid a solid foundation so that we will be able to continue protable growth with our innovative products and services in the future as well, and we are full of condence as we enter the new scal year 2012.
Two major events left their mark on 2011:
1. Our interest in freenet AG: During the rst and second quarters of 2011, we purchased additional shares in this company, strengthening our position as the largest shareholder at freenet AG. Since these additional purchases, Drillisch AG now holds an interest of more than 20% in freenet AG. Hedge transactions have secured this increase against stock price uctuations. Crossing the holding threshold of 20% led to a change in accounting methods as well. The participation in freenet AG is now shown under the position "Financial assets shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method".
2. Cooperation with Deutsche Telekom AG (Telekom): Despite the conduct of intensive negotiations since the beginning of 2010, the realisation of a more exible purchasing model on the product side with Telekom which is not based on one-off payments was not possible. As a consequence, the level of close cooperation with Telekom going back many years has been reduced; it played merely a subordinate role in 2011 and will continue to do so in the Drillisch AG planning for the future. In October 2011, Telekom objected to the use of certain SIM cards provided to the Drillisch Group exclusively for sending text messages, both parties issued notices of termination of current contractual relationships at the beginning of November 2011 and Telekom issued a press release to this effect which had not been authorised by Drillisch AG.
The Drillisch Group on the one hand and Telekom on the other are in disagreement regarding the legal manifestations of these circumstances, which have in part become the subject of litigation.
On 21 March 2012, an agreement to wind up the contractual relationships which were the subject of the litigation and to settle the legal dispute was concluded with Telekom. One objective of the agreement is to ensure that the transfer of subscribers pursuant to the termination of the contracts will be effected without any difculties. The execution of the agreement is subject to a number of reservations, in particular

Letter from the Management Board

the approval of the German Federal Cartel Ofce.
We do not believe that the termination of the contractual relationship with Telekom will have any major impact on the business operations of the Drillisch Group because, as mentioned above, the operating business with Telekom now plays no more than a subordinate role for the Drillisch Group.
We continue to set new standards with our innovative products. In 2011, we once again gave new impetus to the market with the launch of new innovative products focusing on the customer-friendly, individual billing of used services by means of intelligent automatic billing mechanisms. We offer clear rate plan concepts without xed contract terms for voice and data under our brand names.
In the rst quarter of 2011, we established an innovative rate plan known as best4me. best4me offers an automatic best price mechanism for the brand helloMobil. This rate plan always offers the customers the lowest-price combination from the available telephone at rates, minute packages, text message at rates or data options. While our competitors' customers must decide in advance which of the offered packages might be the right one for them, our automatic best price mechanism guarantees the combination with the lowest prices at the end of the billing period.
Yet another example for innovative products is our OptiSurf option which gives customers the opportunity to select a data at rate with an intelligent automatic billing mechanism. Customers of the brands simply, maXXim and helloMobil with this product select a monthly maximum charge between 4.95 and 14.95 and can then use their mobile devices to surf up to the selected volume (100 MB, 200 MB, 500 MB or 1 GB) at high speed. What makes this so special: a customer who uses a lower volume also pays less. If a user surfs less than the chosen volume in one month, only the lower price is charged.
Our established brands such as simply, maXXim, helloMobil and McSIM are regularly singled out during the impartial comparisons of rate plans in journals and consumer magazines with respect to both price and quality. Even our new brand smartmobil.de (www.smartmobil.de), which did not appear on the market until April 2011, was rated almost immediately as "excellent" in the category Mobile Internet on Mobile Phones (All-in 100) by Tariftipp.de in July 2011. Data at rates from Drillisch have regularly been crowned "Least Expensive Mobile Internet Rate" by the comparison portal Handyatrate-Preisvergleich.de.
The comparison portal Tariftipp.de awarded Drillisch products the best mark of "Excellent" in the three most important categories in 2011:
 Mobile phone rate plans for frequent callers (PHONEX All-in Flat)  Mobile internet on mobile phones (smartmobil.de)  Mobile internet per USB stick (surfROYAL Data L)
We turn to external auditors to verify our statements of quality. During the course of an audit in October 2011, the ISO certication for the brands simply and maXXim in accordance with the standard DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 was conrmed and renewed. They received the ISO certicate in 2010, making them the rst providers to have been so recognised by a successful audit of customer service in both the back ofce and the call centre. A completely new accomplishment for all of our websites is the certication within the framework of the S@afer-Shopping programme at TÜV SÜD. Over the course of a comprehensive series of procedures, all of the relevant security and quality criteria were audited and approved. Anyone purchasing merchandise and services on the Internet should pay close attention to this seal of approval (Stiftung Warentest, November 2011).
So we can state with condence: every customer will nd the right rate plan for his or her situation in our portfolio of rate plans. We are certain that this assures us an outstanding competitive position in all market areas.
The wireless services market is the most important growth factor for the telecommunications industry. Communication of the future is mobile. Estimates from the VATM indicate that the total data volume increased by 77% from 67.9 million gigabytes in 2010 to 120.2 million gigabytes in 2011. The share of

Letter from the Management Board
revenue generated by mobile data trafc rose in the sector of non-voice sales by 3% to 59% (2010: 56%). According to a study from Cisco Systems, mobile data trafc will increase in the future at a rate three times faster than that of cable-transmitted trafc. Smartphones and tablets are penetrating more and more deeply into people's daily lives and are becoming their constant companions. As they do so, new concepts for rate plans which can satisfy the needs of various user types will be required. People who use their smartphones for e-mails only, for instance, do not require the full bandwidth and could benet from rate models at lower prices. Heavy users, on the other hand, are prepared to pay more for better performance. The major success factors on the market include innovative rate models which offer low-cost and transparent solutions to meet the needs of various user types, devices and usage scenarios. We recognised this trend to smartphones and the increasing acceptance of mobile internet at an early stage and set up our portfolio to include combined voice and data rate plans.
Our gures speak for themselves. In the scal year just ended, we realised revenues of 349.1 million (2010: 362.50 million). The decline in revenues of 13.4 million was primarily a consequence of the decrease of 39.0 million in business with hardware and prepaid bundles, transactions with low prot margins. In contrast, the high-margin service sector saw revenue rise by 25.6 million to 303.1 million (2010: 277.5 million). This positive income development in service revenue was realised with 2.550 million subscribers (2010: 2.431 million). Thanks to the expansion of the higher-value postpaid business, the ratio of postpaid to prepaid subscribers improved further to 59% to 41% (2010: 49% to 51%). Gross prot came to 102.8 million at the end of the year, an improvement over the previous year (2010: 88.4 million) of 16.2% or 14.4 million. The gross prot margin improved by 5.0% to 29.4% (2010: 24.4%). The EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary expenditures and income posted a rise of 6.7% or 3.3 million to 52.6 million (2010: 49.3 million) and exceeded the forecast for 2011. Consolidated results rose by 32.5% or 10.0 million to 41.0 million (2010:  31.0 million) and the prot per share came to 0.77 (2010: 0.58).
In view of this positive development, we are able to offer to our shareholders a reasonable and attractive return on their capital. That is why we will, with the approval of the Advisory Board, propose the third dividend increase in succession to the upcoming Annual General Meeting, this time to 0.70 per share for the past scal year 2011; this proposal follows the dividends of 0.50 and 0.30 per share in the previous years. We expect an increase in revenue in the sector of "service revenues" and an adjusted EBITDA of about 58 million for 2012. As far as we can see at this time, these positive developments in earnings in business operations will continue in 2013 as well.
We wish to take this opportunity to thank expressly our associates for their commitment and their performance because reliable cooperation in a spirit of trust both in and outside of the Company is very important for economic success. We also want to express our sincere thanks for the trust which our shareholders, customers and business partners have placed in us.
Warmest regards from Maintal.

Report of the Supervisory Board

Dear Sir or Madam,

Fiscal year 2011 which has just ended was an extraordinarily successful business year for Drillisch AG. Once again, the Company was able to increase prots, but was moreover able to lay major cornerstones for its future. The Supervisory Board was able to accompany the Management Board for the expansion of our direct position as shareholder of freenet AG as well as for the optimisation of earnings from subscribers as a means of driving an improvement in margins. By implementing these measures, we have together laid a solid foundation for continued growth in earnings at Drillisch AG.

During scal year 2011, the Supervisory Board diligently performed the duties required of its members by law and Company Charter. We continuously advised the Management Board in signicant questions concerning the management of the Company and monitored activities to satisfy ourselves of the proper management of the rm. The Supervisory Board was involved in all of the decisions of fundamental signicance for the Company directly and in good time.

Marc Brucherseifer Dipl.-Kfm., Frechen. Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Drillisch AG.

The Supervisory Board obtained regular information ­ in both written and oral form ­ from the Management Board, contemporaneously and comprehensively, concerning the course of business events, the position of the Company and any and all questions of corporate planning and strategic further development. Our special attention was given to the risk situation and risk management. The strategic positioning of the Company on the market was another focus of our consultations.

Based on the reports from the Management Board, we thoroughly discussed all of the business transactions of essential importance during the Supervisory Board meetings. Whenever required by legal or Company Charter regulations, we voted on the resolution proposals submitted by the Management Board after thorough review and discussion.

A total of seven Supervisory Board meetings were held as live meetings during scal year 2011. They were held on 24 March, 11 May, 27 May, 4 August, 26 and 27 September and 9 November. In addition, the Supervisory Board dealt with current and urgent matters outside of the live meetings by electronic means or by means of a written consent procedure in lieu of a meeting in a total of eight cases, employing this procedure for the adoption of resolutions as needed. All of the Supervisory Board members participated in at least six of the seven Supervisory Board meetings. Average attendance was 98%.

The main topics of the Supervisory Board's activities in the past business year were as follows:  Reappointment of the members of the Management Board and the conclusion of new Management Board employment contracts  Strategy related to the interest in freenet AG  Strategic alignment of the Company, especially with respect to the earnings expectations in the collaboration with the network operators  IT security, including data security and data protection  Exchange of ideas and consultation with the Company's expanded management team within the framework of an intensive workshop  Legal dispute with VS GmbH  Accusations of Deutsche Telekom AG and the steps subsequently required to assure long-term the conduct of daily business  Acquisition of additional freenet stock and crossing of the 20% threshold

Report of the Supervisory Board

Moreover, the development of turnover and prots, the development of the number of subscribers and the tax circumstances and the nancial position of the Company and of the Group were the subject of regular discussions. Furthermore, we discussed the effects of current legal developments and our risk management system in joint meetings with the Management Board.
The Supervisory Board also received regular, detailed information about ongoing developments as well as about all projects and plans which were of special signicance for the Company in the form of comprehensive monthly reports and special information (e.g. about the Company's risk management) between the actual meetings. Besides the intensive work together as a full group, my fellow members of the Supervisory Board and I had regular contact with the Management Board outside of the meetings. At such times, we obtained information about current business development and the major business transactions.
None of the Management and Supervisory Board members were confronted with conicts of interest which must be disclosed immediately to the Supervisory Board and reported to the Annual General Meeting.
During the reporting period, the Supervisory Board did not act on the opportunity to view the ledgers and correspondence of the Company or to engage special experts for specic tasks (Section 111 (2) AktG (German Company Law)); actions of this nature did not appear necessary or meaningful due to the regular and intensive reporting from the Management Board and the supplementary supervisory measures described above.
The Supervisory Board closely observed the further development of the corporate governance standards. The Management Board reported on the corporate governance in a separate section of the Annual Report, which was also directed to the Supervisory Board. We have conducted detailed discussions with the Management Board regarding the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code at Drillisch. The Supervisory Board and Management Board issued a joint, updated Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 AktG on 15 March 2011. Moreover, Management and Supervisory Board submitted an updated Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 AktG on 22 March 2012 and made it permanently accessible to our shareholders on the Company's website.
The Supervisory Board currently maintains three committees: the Audit Committee, the Personnel Committee and the Nomination Committee.
The Audit Committee, comprising the members Mr Weindl (chairperson), Dr Lennertz, Dr Schmidt, Dr Schenk (until 30 June 2011) and Mr Brucherseifer, Dipl.-Kfm. (from 04 July 2011) met four times during scal year 2011: on 24 March, 2011; 11 May 2011; 04 August 2011; and 09 November 2011. The meetings focused in particular on the major points for the audit of annual accounts and on the engagement, independence and fee payment of the auditor. The results of the audits of the quarterly accounts were discussed during the meetings held at the relevant times. The balance sheet meeting was held in conjunction with the meeting of the full Supervisory Board, as were the consultations on the quarterly accounts; all of these discussions took place in live meetings.
The Nomination Committee, to which all of the Supervisory Board members belong, did not meet in 2011. In its meeting on 22 March 2012, the Nomination Committee adopted a resolution containing a recommendation addressed to the Supervisory Board that Ms Dr Susanne Rückert be nominated for election to the Drillisch AG Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2012.
The Personnel Committee, whose members were Dr Schenk (member and chair until 30 June 2011), Mr Brucherseifer, Dipl.-Kfm. (member and chair from 04 July 2011), Mr Müller-Berg and Dr Lennertz, met on 30 June 2011, at which time the subject of the discussion was the revision and extension of the Management Board employment contracts. In addition, the Personnel Committee participated in a workshop with the Management Board and management of Drillisch AG and the Drillisch Group on 26 September 2011.
The consolidated annual accounts, the consolidated management report and the annual accounts and management report for scal year 2011 were audited by the BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,

Report of the Supervisory Board
Düsseldorf, designated by the Annual General Meeting to be the auditor for the annual accounts and consolidated annual accounts and engaged by the Supervisory Board to perform the audit, and were each certied by the issue of an unqualied auditor's opinion. The annual accounts per 31 December 2011 and the management report were prepared in accordance with the statutes of the German Commercial Code (HGB); the consolidated annual accounts per 31 December 2011 and the consolidated management report were prepared in accordance with Section 315a HGB on the basis of the international accounting standards IFRS as they are to be applied in the European Union. The audit reports were sent to all of the Supervisory Board members in good time. The reports were the subject of intensive discussions in the Supervisory Board meeting on 22 March 2012. The auditor took part in the Supervisory Board meeting, reported on the major results of the audit and was available to the Supervisory Board to answer questions and provide supplementary information. The Supervisory Board carefully examined the annual accounts, the consolidated annual accounts, the management report and the consolidated management report as well as the proposal for the appropriation of the retained earnings. Focal points of the examination were once again the estimates of the investment book values and the goodwill as well as the values of the investment in MSP Holding GmbH and of the stock in freenet AG held directly. After concluding its examination, the Supervisory Board did not raise any objections; the Supervisory Board accepted the conclusions reached by the auditor and is in full agreement with the content. During its meeting on 22 March 2012, the Supervisory Board approved the annual accounts and consolidated annual accounts for scal year 2011; the annual accounts for Drillisch AG have thus been adopted. After conducting its own review, the Supervisory Board accepted the Management Board's proposals for the appropriation of the retained earnings. Dr Hartmut Schenk, our Supervisory Board chairperson for many years, resigned from the Drillisch AG Supervisory Board on 30 June 2011 so that he could assume new responsibilities as a member of the freenet AG Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board members elected Mr Marc Brucherseifer, Dipl.-Kfm., to be his successor as chair of the Drillisch AG Supervisory Board on 04 July 2011. The Supervisory Board wishes to thank the Management Board for its work and its successful business activities in 2011. At the same time, the Supervisory Board wishes to express to all of the employees of the Group its appreciation for their work during the reporting period and their contributions to the success of the corporation.

Declaration on Corporate Management / Corporate Governance Report

The term "corporate governance" refers to responsible, effective corporate management aimed at securing long-term added value. Efcient cooperation between management and supervisory boards, respect for shareholders' interests, openness and transparency of corporate communications are major aspects of good corporate governance. It has always enjoyed a position of high priority at Drillisch and is a major factor for a company's success.
In the following declaration, the Management Board ­ simultaneously on behalf of the Supervisory Board ­ reports on the corporate governance of the Company in accordance with Clause 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Codex as well as in accordance with Section 289a HGB (German Commercial Code) regarding corporate management.
Declaration of Conformity Pursuant to Section 161 AktG (Germany Company Law)
The current Declaration of Conformity issued by the Management Board and Supervisory Board on 22 March 2012 and which has been made permanently accessible on the Internet at the site www.drillisch. de (to be found there under the section "Corporate Governance", subsection "Declaration of Conformity"), reads as follows:
Drillisch Aktiengesellschaft Declaration of the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Drillisch AG Regarding the Recommendations
of the "Government Commission German Corporate Governance Codex" Pursuant to Section 161 AktG

Management Board and Supervisory Board of Drillisch AG hereby declare that the Company has been and is in conformity with the recommendations of the "Government Commission German Corporate Governance Codex" announced by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the ofcial section of the electronic Federal Gazette on 02 July 2010, subject to the following exceptions

Clause 2.3.3 (2) Concerning support of the shareholders in postal vote procedures

The German Corporate Governance Code does not recommend provision of an option for a postal vote; it merely recommends support for a postal vote, if and when such an option has been made available. The Company's Charter does not provide for a postal vote procedure. Management and Supervisory Boards have not submitted any proposals to the General Meeting to make any corresponding amendments of the Charter. The Boards believe that personal participation in the General Meeting, especially open discussion among the shareholders, is an important element of the General Meeting. Moreover, Management and Supervisory Boards have not been able to determine that shareholders would thereby gain any advantages in the exercise of their rights over the proxy rights subject to instruction currently offered by the Company.

Clause 3.8 (3)

Concerning the agreement of an excess from no less than 10% of the loss or damage to no less than 1.5 times the xed annual compensation for a member of the Supervisory Board in a D&O insurance policy for the Supervisory Board.

The Company has concluded a liability insurance policy covering pecuniary loss for the Supervisory Board which at this time does not include an excess. In the opinion of the Management Board and Supervisory Board at Drillisch AG, there is a risk that the agreement of an excess for negligent actions and the related liability risks would counteract the efforts of Drillisch AG to obtain the services of highly qualied persons to serve on the Supervisory Board. This is the reason for the decision not to agree to an excess. At this time, there is no legal obligation to provide for an excess in a D&O insurance policy for the Supervisory Board.

Declaration on Corporate Management / Corporate Governance Report

Clause 5.4.1 (2) and (3)

Concerning the specication of concrete objectives by the Supervisory Board for its composition which, while taking account of the company's specic situation, give due consideration to the international activities of the company, potential conicts of interest, the denition of a maximum age for Supervisory Board members and its diversity and provide for an appropriate number of women members; concerning the implementation of these objectives in the proposals submitted by the Supervisory Board to the responsible election committees; and concerning the publication of the Supervisory Board's objectives and the status of their realisation in the corporate governance report.

The Supervisory board has not previously established, and will in the future not establish, concrete objectives for its composition in consideration of diversity and an appropriate number of women members. The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that restrictions of this nature are irrelevant in comparison with other criteria for the nomination of candidates for election to the Supervisory Board and wishes to make its decisions related to proposals for its composition specically in each concrete situation.

Clause 5.4.6 (1) (3)

Concerning the inclusion of the chair of and the membership in committees in determining the compensation paid to Supervisory Board members.

The chair and the deputy chair positions on the Supervisory Board were given consideration in determining the compensation paid to Supervisory Board member, but not the chair of or membership in a committee. Supervisory Board activities as actually practised have shown that the committee meetings largely take place in close temporal and spatial proximity to the meetings of the Supervisory Board itself. The Management and Supervisory Boards are of the opinion that the assumption of a position on a committee is adequately compensated by the current compensation.

Working Methods of Management Board and Supervisory Board
The corporate management is based on close, constructive cooperation in a spirit of trust between Management and Supervisory Boards as well as an intensive and constant ow of information ­ this is in line with the common understanding of good corporate governance held by Management and Supervisory Boards at Drillisch.
The Management Board currently has two members; the membership on the Management Board at this time is shown in the consolidated notes (page 83, point 35 of the Annual Report). They manage the Company on their own responsibility and dene, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, the strategic direction of the Drillisch Group. The distribution of authority on the Management Board is regulated in rules of procedure. Fundamentally, each member of the Management Board manages the business units of the Company assigned to him by the rules of procedure on his sole authority. Measures of special signicance or which involve unusual risks always require the prior agreement of the entire Management Board. The rules of procedure contain in addition a catalogue of the major transactions and events which require approval by the Supervisory Board. The Management Board regularly and contemporaneously noties the Supervisory Board in written and oral form about the course of business, the position and protability of the Group, the planned business policies and other fundamental issues of corporate planning as well as about transactions which may be of major signicance for the protability or liquidity of the Group. Moreover, the Management Board reports to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board as required by other important events.

Additional Information on Corporate Governance
Risk Management
If the Company's success is to be assured over the long term, it is essential to identify and analyse the risks of business actions effectively and to eliminate or restrict their effects by means of the appropriate steering mechanisms. The risk management system at Drillisch ensures the responsible handling of these risks. It is especially designed with the aim of recognising risks early, then assessing and controlling them. The system is subject to constant further development and adapted as necessary to changing circumstances. As necessary, the Management Board regularly reports to the Supervisory Board regarding current risks and the measures initiated to handle them. The effectiveness of the internal risk management system is monitored by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee.
The major features of the internal controlling and risk management system with regard to the accounting process are described in detail in the management report pursuant to Section 289 (5) HGB and in the consolidated management report (page 38 of the Annual Report) pursuant to Section 315 (2) HGB. The Management Board also reports in detail in this document on current risks and their development.
Compensation of Management Board and Supervisory Board

The year 2011 on the stock exchanges ­ debt crisis and rating agencies the root of volatility
In 2011, the DAX lost 14.7% or 1,015.8 points, falling to 5,898.35 points (2010: 6,914.19), while the TecDAX fell by 165.6 points or 19.5% to 685.06 points (2010: 850.67).
The debt crisis and its impact on politics as well as the constant stream of announcements from rating agents found concrete expression in the extreme volatility of the markets. As the year came to an end, the visions of the most devastating worst-case scenarios began to fade a bit, but the crisis of condence has remained a loyal companion into 2012.

The performance of the Drillisch stock during the stock market year 2011 in comparison with the indices:

Close-out 2011  7.11 685.06 852.65

% change + 16.6% - 19.5 - 16.2

Once again, the Drillisch stock outperformed the market as a whole in stock market year 2011. The closeout price at the end of year came to 7.11. This corresponds to a gain of 16.6% or 1.01 in comparison with the close-out of 2010. As a daily average, 330,916 shares of Drillisch stock (2010: 273,322) were traded on Xetra. Since its inclusion in the TecDAX in September 2009, the Drillisch stock has steadily improved in the relevant criteria of free-oat market capitalisation and stock exchange turnover and holds a solid place among the 30 members of the index.

Corporate strategy and attractive dividend policy
The corporate strategy is based on sustained development of company value and builds on organic growth. Solid dividend policies ensure that shareholders participate in the Company's success. The Annual General Meeting in May 2011 adopted a resolution distributing a dividend of 0.50 per voting share. In the previous year, a dividend of 0.30 was paid to shareholders, so there was an increase of 70%.

Investor Relations Report

An attractive distribution is the target for subsequent years as well. The realisation of this strategy is contingent upon Drillisch AG being able to report the corresponding balance sheet prot in its nancial statements prepared under commercial law for the respective scal years and upon the responsible boards adopting the corresponding resolutions, bearing in mind the current situation of the Company at each respective point in time.

Outlook for operations 2012 ­ dependable forecasts in the tenth year
In the 9-month report 2011, we published an outlook for the coming scal year earlier than ever before (source: ad hoc announcement, 09 November 2011). Based on the budgets, we have targeted an EBITDA 2012 (adjusted) of 58.0 million for 2012 (an increase of 11.5% in comparison with the forecast for 2011) and continued positive development of the subscriber basis (postpaid). Our planning for the following years presumes comparable growth dynamics.

Investor relations
We continued to stress one of our core tasks ­ the maintenance of an intensive dialogue with the capital market ­ during the past year. The Company follows a policy of open and frank communication with all sectors of the capital market so that all of the shareholders are notied of important developments in the same manner and without discrimination. We were able to explain in detail the corporate strategy of Drillisch AG to the capital market at a number of national and international road shows, during a number of meetings at the Company headquarters in Maintal, at various Company presentations and in interviews.
Drillisch AG consistently fullled the high standards for complete and contemporaneous information to all investors at all times during 2011. The Company is also happy and willing to consider suggestions from stockholders.

Innovative Rates for dynamic growth in smartphone market
Drillisch AG increased company value once again over the course of the past year by following a determined course of concentration on the growth sectors discount and data services. We recognised the trend to smartphones and the increasing acceptance of mobile internet at an early stage and set up our portfolio to include combined voice and data rate plans. The Company's major success factors include innovative rate models which offer low-cost and transparent solutions to meet the needs of various user types, devices and usage scenarios. Thanks to experienced management, a ready and able staff and lean cost structures, we are able to realise successfully the corporate strategy even in this market environment of intense competition.
The wireless services market is the most important growth factor in the telecommunications industry. Communication of the future is mobile. Innovative device concepts and a broad range of supplementary applications, the so-called "apps", open up new possibilities for digital lifestyles. Smartphones are becoming more and more indispensable in people's daily lives and have become constant companions and digital assistants in many different sectors. Whether mobile shopping, m-payment, mobile phone tickets, online banking or e-health ­ the functionality of smartphones rises with the appearance of each new app. In turn, optimal access to permanently available high-performance networks at simple and low-cost terms and conditions is becoming more and more important.
More and more people communicate more and more frequently while on the go
In September 2011, the industry association BITKOM reported 61 million mobile phone users in Germany, corresponding to about 87% of the population age 14 or more. In the meantime, even 72% of the senior citizens over the age of 65 have a wireless connection, an increase of almost 10% in comparison with the previous year. Moreover, the calls made from mobiles continued to rise strongly in the past year. According to a market study conducted by VATM and Dialog Consult, there were about 192 billion minutes in calls from mobile networks in 2011 (2010: 180 billion). The average mobile phone owner uses a mobile for 42.5 hours in calls a year ­ 3.5 hours a month. One reason for this growth: according to information from the German Federal Statistical Ofce (destatis), wireless phone calls in Germany have decreased in price by an annual average of 3.5%.
Projections indicate that there are about 98 million mobile phones in use in Germany, and estimates by BITKOM from December 2011 show that on the average every person living here has 1.3 mobile phones which are in active use. 29 million Germans use at least two phones, and 7 million use three or more mobile phones parallel to one another. According to a study by the Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) in August 2011, about 30% of mobile phone users could imagine doing without a landline connection completely. One out of two respondents hopes to have signicant monetary savings by switching completely to wireless services. Of the total 110.9 million wireless subscriptions in Germany, many SIM cards are in use in the sector machine-to-machine (M2M for short) in technical devices for remote monitoring, control and maintenance of machinery, plants and systems besides the applications in mobile phones and surf sticks.
Smartphone sales rising rapidly, driving demand for mobile internet
No doubt about it: mobile internet has arrived on the mass market. While only 17% of German internet users went online with their mobile phones in 2010, the gure reached 28% this year. This was the result of the annual Forsa survey conducted on behalf of the consulting company Accenture. The acceptance among the age group 14- to 19-year-olds is even more striking. Now 35% of the internet users go online with their mobile phones; in the previous year, only 10% surfed while on the go. But not only the number of mobile surfers is increasing; the frequency of usage is rising steadily as well. Sixty-eight per cent of the respondents told Forsa that they were online with their mobiles at least once a day; the corresponding gure in 2010 was only 43%. Women especially are discovering the benets offered by mobile internet. As 20% of them use mobile devices for surng, they are more active than men (16%).

Mainly people aged 20 to 29 years are online via smartphone several times a day.

Three major factors continue to drive the trend to mobile internet:  New devices: sales of smartphones and tablet PCs are growing at a rapid pace. Devices and operating systems optimised for the internet make mobile surng even simpler.  Surng experience: the many and diversied useful applications (apps) which are downloaded from webshops expand the functionality of mobile phones, and communication via social networks is displacing text messages and mobile phone calls.  Low-cost rate plans: at rates and combination rate plans assuage users' fears of unpredictable costs and promote acceptance for the convenience of mobile surng.
Last year, 11.8 million smartphones were sold in Germany, an increase of 31% in comparison with 2010. This was reported by the high-tech association BITKOM at the beginning of the year, based on the latest data from the European Information Technology Observatory (EITO). So the actual gures exceeded the most optimistic forecasts by industry representatives. The development that began ve years ago when Apple introduced the rst iPhone has turned into a mass phenomenon today, one that is served by the appearance of more and more new devices in rapid succession and various operating systems from virtually all mobile phone manufacturers. According to Juniper Research, touch screen mobile phones will have taken over 72% of the world market within ve years.

Apps turn smartphones and tablets in digital all-rounders

The boom is even more breathtaking for tablet PCs ­ compact, at mini-computers with signicantly larger displays than smartphones which are especially suitable for viewing e-books, digital magazines, educational media or pictures and videos thanks to internet access via SIM card. In spring 2011, BITKOM forecast about 1.5 million in total sales of tablet computers, but in December the high-tech association had to correct its forecast upward to 2.1 million devices sold in response to the latest market research results. In the year-on-year comparison, sales rose by 162%. This development clearly indicates that tablet computers are conquering the mass market and moving into increasingly broad user groups. Market researchers from Goldmedia Research see a potential of nine million tablet users in Germany.

Apps turn smartphones and tablets into digital all-rounders
There are virtually no limits to what the new devices can do. The manufacturers are not the only ones who determine what a smartphone or tablet PC can do. A decisive factor for their success is also the scope of available applications ­ the apps ­ which can turn a smartphone into a digital Swiss pocketknife. Convenient shopping solutions, price comparisons with scanned barcodes, train tickets or check-in at the airport by smartphone are in common use even now and providing more impetus in the direction of m-commerce. The number of people in Germany who use their smartphones to go to shopping sites online has more than doubled in the past twelve months, increasing by 112%, according to a study released by ComScore in January 2012. And even real shopping behaviour will change as the smartphones of the future take advantage of short-range radio NFC at state-of-the-art cash registers to make payment by credit card a thing of the past. Management and monitoring of people's homes by smartphone while travelling or the medical assistant which monitors important body functions and can make a visit to the doctor superuous are no longer visions of a distant future.

Mobile data trafc doubling every year - Flexible tariffs for all users

Mobile data trafc doubling every year
As the sales of smartphones and tablet PCs rise and the devices are used more intensively, mobile data trafc is increasing dynamically. According to Cisco Systems, more than 10 petabytes of data are transmitted every month worldwide. And this data quantity is expected to rise to almost 320 petabytes a month by 2015, corresponding to a capacity of 79.3 million DVDs a month or 874 million text messages a second. Mobile data trafc is increasing three times faster than cable transmission. The expansion of network capacities now is urgently needed. New concepts for rate plans which can satisfy the needs of various user types are also required. People who use their smartphones for e-mails only, for instance, do not require the full bandwidth and could benet from rate models at lower prices. Heavy users, on the other hand, are prepared to pay more for better performance.

LTE is here, but the devices have not arrived
LTE (Long Term Evolution), the successor technology for today's UMTS, is ready to go. Now that frequencies have been assigned by the German Federal Network Agency and the initial expansion phases to eliminate the "white areas" in rural regions are past, network operators are beginning to install higher transmission speeds in the rst large cities and metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, LTE is at this time being positioned more as a replacement product for stationary DSL connections and less for smartphone users. Even though the rst LTE smartphones made an appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January, the introduction of these products in Germany is not to be expected before the second half of 2012.
Drillisch AG will prot in the future as well from the continuing positive dynamics in the data sector. As we are the price leaders and offer attractive rate plans and devices for any user ­ from entry level to expert ­ featuring the greatest possible degree of exibility and transparency, we are poised in an outstanding position.

MARKETING REPORT
Drillisch successful with innovative products for the mobile internet
In 2011, the successful brands from Drillisch AG introduced innovative and low-price products merging voice and data rates, above all for the mobile internet. Our subscribers can use their smartphones and tablets to take advantage of all of the possibilities of modern communication at low cost. Independent rate comparisons document that our products can regularly be found in leading positions in terms of the criteria price and quality, prompting numerous journals, consumer magazines and comparison portals to recommend our brands.
All-in ­ the product family with Germany's lowest triple at rate The product family of the All-in rate plans offers a choice of 50, 100 or 200 included minutes and the same number of text messages as well as a at rate for the internet and appeals to subscribers who have a clearly dened usage prole. Another member of the All-in family ­ the triple at rate All-in Flat ­ has easily maintained its position as the lowestprice at rate in all networks (rst place in all of the criteria of the category "Mobile Phone Flat Rates in All Networks + Internet Flat Rate" of the magazine Computerbild). There is also the All-in Flat Safe, a rate plan with an upper limit which turns into a at rate at 35 a month. Until this ceiling has been reached, subscribers are billed only for their actual use. The All-in rate plans, originally launched for specialist stores under the name Telco, have been marketed for all distribution channels and brands of the Drillisch Group since 2011. The rates are also offered for the brand PHONEX (www.phonex.de), for instance, on an online portal and enhanced by their own site on Facebook.
smartmobil.de ­ the new smartphone rate plan with high recognition effect smartmobil.de (www.smartmobil.de) is the new brand which appeared on the market in April 2011 and attracted substantial attention within a very short time. A completely new marketing approach was selected, from the development of the brand to the product start to the advertising and social media concept. This is yet another instance in which the focus is on a product with an especially simple rate logic. Costing 9.95 a month, smartmobil.de offers the best value for money for smartphone users. This message was provided with
the required support right from the market launch by the placement of short, succinct 15-second spots with a high recognition value in the television advertising block of broadcasters with widespread coverage. This classic advertising was complemented by publications in the social media environment, e.g. on YouTube and the newly created fan page for smartmobil.de on Facebook, reaching a target group of young consumers with high purchasing power.

Drillisch gave new impetus with innovative rate plans and options
simply, maXXim, helloMobil ­ no-frills brands with a new look Drillisch has continued to expand the products and services for the established brands in the no-frills segment as well. In addition to the 8-eurocent rates with obtainable options for landline, text messaging or mobile internet, simply, maXXim and helloMobil, discoTEL and discoPLUS are also offering new rate plans for smartphones and tablets. Everyone will nd the right rate plan for his or her individual needs:  Infrequent phone users  Text message fans  Occasional surfers  Smartphone experts This diversity of rate plans is reected on the user-friendly websites such as www.simplytel.de.
Quality features of all brands All of our brands offer simple and clear rate concepts without xed-term contracts. But the price per minute and text message is no longer the sole and exclusive determining factor. Other quality criteria include attractive combination rate plans for voice and data which can be purchased on invoice basis (postpaid) or with advance payment (prepaid). The brand maXXim (www.maxxim.de + www.maxximdata.de) is a good example of such an option. The 8-eurocent mobile phone rate ­ available as either prepaid or with payment by invoice ­ is supplemented by further options and variations. One new rate, for instance, is the smartphone rate plan MaxxLimit 35 with a charge ceiling of 35. The brand DeutschlandSIM (www. deutschlandsim.de) also offers a charge ceiling rate in the D-Network with a cap at 49.
Innovative rate plans and options give new impetus Drillisch AG generated a lot of attention in the second half of 2011 with two fundamentally new rate plan concepts and once again gave new impetus to the wireless services market. Emphasis is on customerfriendly and individual calculation of the actual use of the services by intelligent, automatic billing systems.
OptiSurf ­ paying only for the mobile internet actually used By selecting the new data at rate OptiSurf, subscribers with the 8-eurocent rates of the brands simply, maXXim and helloMobil have since September chosen only their personal monthly maximum of between 4.95 and 14.95 and can take advantage of the maximum high-speed volume for each limit (100 MB, 200 MB, 500 MB or 1 GB). What makes OptiSurf so special and new is the intelligent, automatic billing system which ensures that customers who use less also pay less. If a user does not surf as much in one month, only the lower price is charged. So all users, whether occasional surfers or smartphone experts, can be sure that they never again pay too much for at-rate volumes they have not used, yet retain full exibility.

While the competition's subscribers must always decide in advance for the coming month what the right minute package will be or which at rate is most suitable, the automatic best price calculation of best4me always guarantees the most favourable combination of the available telephone at rates, minute packages, text messaging at rate or data options. And the whole process is automatic and not performed until the end of the billing period. In addition, the best4me packages and at rates for landline service, mobile phone surng and text messaging cost about 10% less than comparable offers from the competition.

Price leader in data rates for laptops, netbooks and tablet PCs as well
But the Drillisch offers of lowest rates are not limited to smartphone users. The data-only rates offered for the new tablet PCs as well as for classic laptops or netbooks can stand up to any comparison. The brands simply data, maXXim data, McSIM data and discosurf and their established data at rate of 5 GB high-speed volume have been supplemented by the addition of variants of 500 MB, 1 GB and 3 GB. So mobile surng is available for as little as 7.95 a month. Drillisch offers the lowest-price rates on the market for every use and every usage scenario in this segment as well. And anyone who does not yet have an Apple iPad can purchase the cult device from Drillisch for an attractive one-time price with a genuine internet at rate with 1 gigabyte highspeed volume for only 24.95 a month.

Better business climate in ICT market
Drillisch brands are always right at the front of the pack in rate comparisons and rate recommendations
Drillisch attracts a high level of attention with the diversity of its brands. This is reected in its frequent mention during rate plan comparisons of leading online portals and in trade journals and popular magazines. The comparison portal Tariftip.de has in recent months awarded Drillisch products the best mark of "Excellent" in the three most important categories:  Mobile phone rate plans for frequent callers (PHONEX All-in Flat)  Mobile internet on mobile phones (smartmobil.de)  Mobile internet per USB stick surfROYAL Data L.
No fewer than three data at rates from Drillisch have regularly been crowned "Least Expensive Mobile Internet Rate" by the comparison portal Handyatrate-Preisvergleich.de:
simply data, maXXim data and Weltbild Mobil Data.
Moreover, numerous Drillisch products can regularly be found near the top of the lists in rate comparisons by the magazines FINANZtest, connect or Computerbild. The Stiftung Warentest recommended the free community rate friends4free for the brands simply, maXXim and helloMobil in its magazine test (6/2011). A rate list which is updated monthly on www.test.de regularly features simply clever, maXXim plus or helloMobil 8 Cent and others as the "lowest rates" in the tested categories.
ICT market signicantly better than the Ifo index ­ software and IT services in the lead
The BITKOM index, for which the high-tech association has been collecting sales projections from companies every quarter for many years, showed a plus of 60 points in the middle of December 2011. This gure is signicantly higher than the Ifo business climate index for the overall economy, which noted minus 9 points at the same point in time. As early as September 2011, 75% of the surveyed companies expected increasing sales for the year 2011 as a whole. Turnover from software has been developing at an especially strong rate for many years. It will rise by more than 5% in both 2011 and 2012, noted Professor Dieter Kempf, BITKOM president, at the time of the yearly closing press conference in the middle of December 2011. The rapid development on the app market was one of the more important contributors to this positive result. But IT services also grew thanks to outsourcing and cloud computing. Hardware manufacturers, on the other hand, were hard hit over the course of 2011, above all by the tsunami disaster in Japan and the major ooding in Thailand. The European debt crisis has not had any signicant impact on the ITC sector. BITKOM projections indicate that the German ITC market will break through the mark of 150 billion this year for the rst time and grow by 2.2% to 151.3 billion.

1.1. Drillisch making the transformation from a service provider to a "virtual network operator"

During scal year 2011, Drillisch steadfastly continued its development which began in the fourth quarter

of 2010 from its previous position of a classic service provider into an MVNO (mobile virtual network ope-

rator). Drillisch procures standardized, unbundled advance services from the wireless network operators

Telefónica O Germany GmbH & Co. OHG ("O ") and Vodafone D2 GmbH ("Vodafone"), a situation which

2

signicantly enhances its manoeuvrability on the product and sales side. The Company is able to determi-

ne autonomously its own rate plans and options independently of the sales rates of the network operators

and to combine these plans and options exibly with one another. The resulting exibility assures inde-

pendence and the capability to plan business over a longer term. In the future, commissions for network

operators, a major component of a service provider procurement model, will no longer be charged. Owing

to the elimination of the activation charges on the part of the network operators, new customer acquisiti-

on will be nanced fully from the Company's own funds in the future. The independence from the control

over new and current customer business exercised by network operators thus gained will contribute to a

signicant improvement in planning security for Drillisch's own business.

This exibility enables Drillisch to pioneer regularly new developments on the wireless services market as well as to offer for the rst time products featuring innovative automatic billing methods such as "OptiSurf" or "best4me" which can be perfectly adapted to customers' usage habits. The demand for smartphones has risen by more than 30% in comparison with 2010. Drillisch recognised this trend at an early stage and now offers smartmobil.de, the rate plan All-in Flat Smart and other opportunities to combine high-end smartphones with attractive, low-cost rate plans. From a general perspective, the focus continues to be on the marketing of innovative voice and data products. The scope of the Company's services encompasses all of the transmission technologies available both now and in the future.

The most important sales channels are the sales and cooperation partners along with the webshops on the internet; moreover, the classic wireless services specialist trade continues to be an important pillar. Social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter are also used to target customers.

Drillisch will continue to serve current customers in the Telekom Deutschland GmbH ("Telekom") and EPlus Mobilfunk GmbH ("E-Plus") networks on the basis of the service provider agreements.

Drillisch AG is the Group's holding
Within the Drillisch Group ("Drillisch"), Drillisch AG, the parent company, concentrates on holding tasks such as management, nances and accounting, controlling, cash management, human resources, risk management, corporate communications and investor relations along with the denition, management and monitoring of the global corporate strategy. The subsidiaries Drillisch Telecom GmbH ("Drillisch Telecom"), Maintal, SIMply Communication GmbH ("simply"), Maintal, and MS Mobile Services GmbH ("MS Mobile"), Maintal, handle the operational wireless services business. All of the IT know-how of the Drillisch Group has been concentrated in IQ-optimize Software AG ("IQ-optimize"), Maintal. Working together with eteleon e-solutions AG ("eteleon"), Munich, a specialist for innovative sales solutions on the telecommunications market, the Company extends sales activities via e-commerce and additional distance trade channels to expand the product line and, by doing so, to intensify efforts to acquire new customers. MSP Holding GmbH ("MSP"), Maintal, is an afliated company of Drillisch; as per 31 December 2011, this afliate and Drillisch AG together held more than 20% of the share capital of freenet AG.

The latest smartphones, tablet PCs or notebooks for use with these plans are available from the online shops for each of the brands. The innovative automatic billing mechanism of the new rate plan "best4me" at Drillisch Telecom, launched in the third quarter 2011, frees customers from concerns about the charges for mobile phone calls without having to book rate plan options ahead of time. Subscribers electing best4me always nd the most favourable combination of at rate and charges based on minutes for their specic usage in each case. The established premium brands Telco and VICTORVOX stand primarily for business with xed-term contracts. Drillisch uses the brand Alphatel to offer cash cards, starter cards and bundles in prepaid business together with cash codes via its own platform, g~paid ­ the only wireless services provider in Germany to do so.
simply ­ low-cost offers and award-winning quality of products and service
simply ­ one of the discount pioneers in Germany ­ continues its success story for yet another year without showing any signs of slowing down. simply makes use of webshops on the internet along with sales and cooperation partners to market wireless services at especially favourable conditions. The new All-Inclusive smartphone savings rates or the iPad2 packages are seamless extensions of the innovations initiated by simply in the middle of last year (rst smartphone discount rate with a double at rate in Germany); besides rate plans at discount prices, simply offers a broad palette of low-priced services for mobile data communications in combination with attractive hardware offers featuring the iPad or iPhone from Apple and popular products from other well-known manufacturers.
Award-winning quality management in product marketing and customer service
simply and its subscribers have meanwhile received ofcial conrmation that low prices, high quality and good service do not have to be mutually exclusive. Following a successful audit in 2010, simply was awarded the DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 certicate for quality management in the sectors online product marketing and customer service, the rst provider of wireless services discount products to earn this distinction. The quality criteria on which the certicate is based were once again conrmed during an audit in October 2011.
MS Mobile ­ smart rates featuring smart service
Since the beginning of April 2011, MS Mobile has been offering smartmobil.de, the rst rate plan available across Germany tailored precisely to the needs of smartphone users. The straightforward, low-cost and transparent product started a new trend in the wireless services sector and was awarded the ISO certicate for outstanding quality management in the areas of online product marketing and customer service in accordance with DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 in the very rst month. The smartmobil.de customers have long known that smartmobil.de is outstanding. This was ofcially conrmed in November when it was designated "UMTS Provider of the Year" by the independent rating portal "Tariftipp.de". smartmobil.de was able to impress the Tarifftipp.de jury with the innovative strength of the Company, the customer friendliness of the rates, the range of options from various customised smartphone rate plans and the excellent value for money. As appropriate for the best smartphone rate plan, smartmobil.de has been offering a matching smartphone at no additional cost since the fourth quarter of 2011. The "TripleCard" from smartmobil.de is the chance for subscribers to be smart in three ways. It can be used to provide accessibility to the network for as many as three mobile devices simultaneously so that users can carry on parallel tasks of phoning, surng and e-mailing ­ with only one contract, one invoice and one mailbox. In addition to smartmobil. de, MS Mobile has been offering the brand maXXim since 2008, one of the least expensive rate plans on the German wireless services market at a price of only 8 eurocents for phoning and texting. This rate plan was enhanced in 2011 by the addition of low-cost rates for mobile surng.

eteleon ­ new highlights on the wireless services market at 7.5 eurocents a minute
discoTEL and discoPLUS are successful brands offered by the subsidiary eteleon. These rate plans have been the market leaders in Germany since their introduction, featuring a price of only 7.5 eurocents per minute or text message. In response to the rapid rise in demand for smartphones, eteleon introduced the "All in Flat Smart" rate plans in 2011 and offers subscribers the opportunity to combine the latest devices with a fourfold at rate featuring terms and conditions that have never been equalled.
In accordance with the resolution adopted by Ordinary Annual General Meeting of eteleon e-solutions AG on 27 June 2011, the shares of the other shareholders (minority shareholders) of eteleon e-solutions AG were transferred to Drillisch AG within the scope of a procedure for the exclusion of minority shareholders (Sections 327a et seqq. Germany Company Law) in return for payment of cash compensation. This resolution was entered in the Commercial Register on 16 August 2011 and has become legally effective. Since that date, Drillisch AG has held 100% of the shares of eteleon e-solutions AG.
IQ-optimize guarantees IT expertise
Drillisch has bundled its IT expertise in its subsidiary IQ-optimize. This company performs all of the IT services for the Group companies.
MSP Holding
MSP Holding GmbH ("MSP Holding"), Maintal, is a subsidiary of Drillisch AG; its functions include the strategic positioning of Drillisch on the wireless services market. Drillisch AG, together with MSP Holding, currently holds more than 20% of the share capital in freenet AG. In 2011, Drillisch additionally acquired about 10.5 million no-par value registered shares in the share capital of freenet AG, once again clearly emphasising its strategic positioning.
Employees
In 2011, an average of 329 employees (previous year: 379), including the two members of the Drillisch AG Management Board, was on the payroll of the Drillisch Group. The Company rmly believes that good vocational training is important for the future of young people. Because of its convictions, it takes its social responsibility seriously and gives more young people opportunities for vocational training than required to satisfy its own needs. The number of vocational trainees, which is not included in the above gure, rose to 47 (previous year: 41).
1.2. Company management ­ objectives and strategies
The Company`s strategy emphasises protable growth. The focus for new business is on the marketing of innovative and low-cost products. In the estimation of the Management Board, low, transparent rates represent the greatest opportunities for growth on the German market. The highest growth rates here are expected in the data communication sector.
The Company has placed its own successful brands, including simply, maXXim, McSIM, helloMobil, smartmobil.de, discoPLUS and discoTEL. Drillisch offers attractive products in combination with smartphones and tablets, enabling the Company to benet from the continuing boom in demand for mobile high-end devices.
The expansion of current sales activities and the opening of new distance trade channels by means of attractive product lines such as smartmobil.de, helloMobil or McSIM are at the forefront of the Company's efforts. The ultimate objective is to expand the higher-priced postpaid business, thereby realising protable margins on a highly competitive market. Active quality management continuously monitors products and services.

Value-oriented management system
The focus of the value-oriented management system at Drillisch is on a long-term increase in the corporate value through protable growth. The key performance indicator is the adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, adjusted for extraordinary and one-off factors). In addition to the EBITDA, gross prot and cash ow are the subjects of special attention.
Major elements of value-oriented management include:
1. Thanks to its lean structure, Drillisch works highly efficiently in terms of costs. This approach has enabled the group to increase its EBITDA continuously over the past nine years. Drillisch achieves this high level of economic efficiency by consistently optimising business processes and by making efficient use of its personnel.
2. The major IT services required at Drillisch are performed by its subsidiary IQ-optimize so that the Company is not dependent on external providers, enabling fast and flexible action and response on the market.
3. Drillisch is innovative in the design and development of new products and rate plans. The Company is one of the first providers to sell wireless services under its own discount brand name. This innovation strength makes it possible for the group to develop new business fields ahead of competitors.
4. Drillisch constantly works on the further development of distribution paths, taking advantage of its competence and new ideas, so that the Company can successfully market its innovative products.
Moreover, long years of experience are available to Drillisch at the rst and second management levels.
1.3. Market and competition
Wireless services sales in Germany declined slightly in 2011
According to a TC market analysis conducted jointly by Dialog Consult and VATN, sales on the German wireless networks market fell slightly from 24.3 billion in the previous year to 23.9 billion in 2011. The year-on-year decline is primarily a consequence of the ongoing reductions in price structures. The number of active SIM cards rose from 108.3 million in the previous year to 110.9 million in 2011. Voice trafc over wireless services connections increased from 258 million to 288 million minutes per day. As management expected, the data volume on the wireless services networks rose further at a breakneck pace. Estimates from the VATM indicate that the total data volume in 2011 increased by 77% from 67.9 million gigabytes in 2010 to 120.2 million gigabytes. The share of revenues from mobile data trafc in the sector non-voice revenues rose from 56% in 2010 to 59% in 2011 so that about 4.3 billion of the wireless services revenues came from the mobile data trafc sector.
IT industry growth continues in 2011
The IT industry was in 2011 able to continue the positive development of the previous year without even a hiccough. According to information from BITKOM (December 2011), sales in Germany rose by about 4.5% to 73.0 billion. The IT industry created another 10,000 jobs in 2011, so it is one of the job engines in the German economy as well as one of the most innovative business sectors.
Drillisch grows on the wireless services market in 2011
Drillisch is in competition with the four network operators (Vodafone, O , Telekom and E-Plus) and with 2
other service providers and MVNOs. The network operators have a market share of about 85.6% in Germany as shown in a TC market analysis from VATM in 2011. The remaining market is essentially shared by the service provider freenet and the independent service providers Drillisch and United Internet. In contrast to most of its competitors in Germany, Drillisch succeeded in growing in terms of turnover in the service

revenues, subscriber base and EBITDA in the past scal year.
Telekom Deutschland GmbH terminated the cooperation with the Drillisch Group companies Drillisch Telecom and simply without notice per 04 November 2011 and led criminal charges. simply had given ordinary notice of termination to Deutsche Telekom GmbH on the day before. The management of simply and Drillisch Telecom regard the claims asserted by Telekom to be groundless.
1.4. General economic conditions
"Strengthen trust ­ Create opportunities ­ Grow steadily with Europe" is the title of an annual economic report published by the German government in January 2012. The German economy continued the recovery of the previous year and posted growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.0% in 2011. More people than ever before had jobs in Germany in 2011, a total of 41.1 million workers. Thanks to the positive development in gross wages in 2011 (increase of 2.3%), domestic demand also rose by 1.2%.
However, the Drillisch Management Board has noticed little impact on the Company´s own wireless services business from the rise and fall of the economy in recent years. The steady growth in the discount business and for mobile Internet has been of greater signicance.
1.5. Turnover and earnings position
By posting strong turnover growth once again in the sector "service revenues" in scal year 2011, Drillisch conrmed the wisdom of the transformation to an MVNO which began in the fourth quarter of 2010 as well as improved substantially on the excellent results of scal year 2010. This excellent business development is supported by the ongoing dynamic developments in the elds of wireless services discount and mobile internet products. Drillisch uses innovative products and marketing and sales concepts to sustain its top position in the German telecommunications industry.
The "service revenues" and the new customer acquisition revenues, essentially the income from the provision of the ongoing wireless services (voice and data transmission) and their billing on the basis of the current customer relationships, rose in 2011 by 25.6 million or 9.2% to 303.1 million (previous year: 277.5 million). Other revenues, which include low-margin business such as sales of devices and prepaid bundled sales, declined by 39.0 million to 45.9 million (previous year: 85.0 million). Sales from the segment software services amounted to 0.1 million (previous year: 0.1 million). Total turnover in 2011 declined by 13.4 million or 3.7% to 349.1 million (previous year: 362.5 million). In the strict quarteron-quarter comparison, however, revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 rose just as they had in the third quarter, increasing by 1.4 million to 102.1 million (previous year: 100.7 million). The number of subscribers increased by 119,000 to 2.550 million (31 December 2010: 2.431 million). The subscriber base in the more protable postpaid business rose by 321,000 or 27.0% in comparison with the end of 2010 to 1.512 million subscribers (31 December 2010: 1.191 million). The number of subscribers in the prepaid sector was reduced by 16.3% to 1.038 million (31 December 2010: 1.240 million). The underlying reasons behind the decline include the continued removal of inactive subscribers from the clientele lists and a declining acquisition of new subscribers in this sector because the investment costs per new subscriber have risen. Thanks to the expansion of the higher-value postpaid business, the ratio of postpaid to prepaid subscribers improved further to 59% to 41%, an increase of 10 percentage points compared to the end of 2010 (31 December 2010: 49% postpaid to 51% prepaid).
The cost of materials decreased overproportionately to the decline in turnover during 2011 by 10.1% to 246.3 million (previous year: 274.1 million). As a consequence, the gross prot improved by 16.3% to 102.8 million (previous year: 88.4 million). The gross prot margin increased by 5.0 percentage points to 29.4% (previous year: 24.4%). Personnel expenses fell by 13.0% to 20.8 million (previous year: 23.9 million). This decline is essentially a consequence of the expenditures for restructuring measures incurred for the concentration of the operating locations in the previous year's gures. This led to expenditures of 3.2 million last year, mainly as funding of a social plan for employees leaving the Company. Correspon-

dingly, the personnel expenses ratio decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 6.0% (previous year: 6.6%). Other operating expenses rose by 48.9% to 34.3 million (previous year: 23.0 million). The greatest part of these expenditures was for advertising, which grew by 9.8 million to 17.1 million This is more than double the gure for 2010 (7.3 million). Despite this substantial increase in advertising expenditures, there was a major improvement in the EBITDA in comparison with the same period of last year. The consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation), one of the most important management indicators in the Drillisch Group, rose by 11.5% to 51.4 million (previous year: 46.1 million). The adjusted consolidated EBITDA in 2011 amounted to 52.6 million in comparison with 49.3 million in the previous year. Extraordinary expenses 2011 amounting to 1.2 million concern the derecognition of a residual claim from a settlement in scal year 2009 and extraordinary charges related to a legal dispute. The adjusted EBITDA margin came to 15.1% (previous year: 13.6%). Depreciation declined by 41.5% to 3.4 million (previous year: 5.7 million). In previous years and the rst quarter of 2011, the intangible assets identied within the framework of the purchase price allocation from the Telco acquisition of 2007 were written off as scheduled over their useful life. These write-offs have now been completed. As a consequence, the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 19.0% to 48.1 million (previous year: 40.4 million). The EBIT ratio improved by 2.7 percentage points to 13.8% (previous year: 11.1%). The freenet shares held by MSP Holding and Drillisch AG since 14 June 2011 have been valuated according to the equity method because of the signicant inuence on the Company from the voting rights quota. The results from this inclusion amounted to 28.3 million as per 31 December 2011. This item also includes income from the reversal of the market valuation provision. This provision was originally created subject to only 5% of the deferred taxes pursuant to Section 8b KStG (German Corporate Income Tax Act), so the reversal has now had little impact on the tax results. Moreover, the share of the updating of the proportional equity of freenet AG effective on prots in the amount of 19.9 million is included in the "Results from the nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method". In the previous year, the holding was classied as "Available for sale" in accordance with IAS 39 and changes in value were reected without impact on prots as a market valuation provision in equity. The Other nancial results in the amount of -19.9 million result essentially from a payment obligation agreed within the framework of a nancing transaction and the valuation on the closing date of a hedging transaction which was concluded within the framework of the nancing of the acquisition of the freenet shares in 2011. The value of the hedging transaction is recalculated as of every closing date and is primarily a result of the price of the freenet stock on the closing date and of the remaining term. A rising stock price tends to lead to a declining value of the hedging transaction, which can also be negative. In this case, it is disclosed under the long-term nancial liabilities. If the value on the closing date is positive, it is capitalised under Other nancial assets. Per 31 December 2011, it was necessary to create deferred tax assets of 2.0 million which reduced the taxes on the Group correspondingly and lowered the tax rate. The increase in the utilisation of bank loans and the rise in interest rates in 2011 caused the results from interest to decline by 3.0 million to -4.2 million (previous year: -1.2 million). Taxes on income fell by 0.3 million to 11.3 million (previous year: 11.6 million). The substantially lower tax rate was caused, as described above, in particular by the fact that income from the nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method was not to be taken into account for tax purposes. Prot per share came to 0.77 (previous year: 0.58).

General statement on business development
Operating in a favourable, although highly competitive economic sector, Drillisch fullled the business forecast which had been conrmed once again in November 2011. The number of subscribers was increased and turnover in the sector of "service revenues" rose. The protability and yield indicators relevant for Drillisch of gross prot and gross prot margin, along with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA ratio, continued to improve. Business development clearly demonstrated that Drillisch has been pursuing a course of consistently protable growth for many years which is largely independent of general economic uctuations. Management Board and Supervisory Board will therefore propose a dividend of 0.70 for each share entitled to dividends to the Annual General Meeting.
1.6. Assets, liabilities and nancial position
The balance sheet total for the Drillisch Group rose by 119.1 million to 393.7 million as per 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: 274.6 million), primarily a consequence of investments in nancial assets. The equity ratio declined accordingly from 51.1% per 31 December 2010 to 41.9% at the end of the year 2011.
Cash declined by 6.9 million to 20.7 million (31 December 2010: 27.6 million). Trade receivables increased by 13.3 million to 41.7 million (31 December 2010: 28.4 million). This rise was a result of the signicant push in the sale of high-quality devices in scal year 2011 related to the current smartphone rate plans among other factors. In total, current assets increased by 4.8 million to 75.2 million (31 December 2010: 70.4 million).
Fixed assets rose by a total of 114.3 million to 318.5 million (31 December 2010: 204.2 million). Other intangible assets, on the other hand, declined by 0.4 million to 10.9 million (31 December 2010: 11.3 million) as a result of scheduled depreciation. As of the closing date, Drillisch AG, in conjunction with MSP Holding, held more than 20% of the share capital in freenet subsequent essentially to the additional participation in freenet AG acquired in the 2nd quarter of 2011. The participation exceeded the 20% threshold on 14 June 2011 and is now disclosed in the nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method. Value as per 31 December 2011 came to 236.4 million. In the previous year, the freenet stock was shown in the balance sheet under the Other nancial assets. The freenet stock in this item declined to zero as of the closing date (31 December 2010: 122.8m). The balance of the two items affected by the freenet holdings increased by 113.6 million in comparison with 31 December 2010.
Thanks to the good business results of 2011 balanced against the dividend distribution, the accumulated decit decreased by 14.4 million to 43.1 million (31 December 2010: 57.5 million). The accumulated decit in 2008 resulted primarily from the change in the stock market evaluation of the freenet AG shares. The market valuation provision reected the value change in the other nancial assets taken into account as non-operating results up to 14 June 2011. The freenet stock held by Drillisch AG and MSP Holding, now valuated and shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method, was a major component of the other nancial assets. Any changes in the freenet AG equity are now basically realised directly in the income statement. In comparison with 31 December 2010, total equity increased by 24.6 million to 165.0 million (31 December 2010: 140.4 million).
Long-term liabilities rose by 102.1 million to 163.0 million (31 December 2010: 60.9 million). This increase is essentially a consequence of the rise in liabilities due to banks owing the acquisition of additional shares in freenet AG during the rst half of the year.
Short-term liabilities declined by 7.6 million to 65.7 million in comparison with the end of scal year 2010 (31 December 2010: 73.3 million). Trade accounts payable rose by 0.3 million to 25.1 million (31 December 2010: 24.8 million) as a consequence of the balance sheet date. Tax liabilities declined by 1.5 million to 5.7 million (31 December 2010: 7.2 million). Payments received on account fell by 3.1 million to 22.4 million (31 December 2010: 25.5 million).

1.7. Cash ow
Cash ow from current business activities amounted to 20.0 million (previous year: 40.8 million) in scal year 2011. The main causes of this change are the increased gain in postpaid subscribers on the one hand and the reduction of the prepaid business, in terms of both subscriber base and voucher sales, on the other. Along with uctuations related to the closing date, this development overall led to an increase in net working capital which was reected above all in an increase in trade receivables of 13.3 million (previous year: decline of 5.0 million), the reduction of 4.0 million in trade accounts payable and other liabilities and provisions (previous year: rise of 1.8 million) and in the drop of 3.1 million in advanced payments received (previous year: decline of 0.7 million). Furthermore, advance payments for media services were effected as part of the signicantly rising advertising expenditures in 2011, but had not been released as of the closing date. Finally, the increase in interest payments of 1.0 million in comparison with the previous year resulted in a higher outow of funds.
Cash ow from investment activities totalling -69.8 million is decisively characterised by payments for investments in nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method amounting to 114.5 million (previous year: 0.0 million). 3.1 million went to other investments in 2011 (previous year: 4.3 million). This was countered by payments from the sale of nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method in the amount of 25.4 million (previous year: 0.0 million) and the dividends amounting to 22.4 million (previous year: 3.1 million) received from freenet.
In scal year 2011, there was a net inow of cash in the amount of 42.9 million from nancing activities (previous year: outow of cash in the amount of 39.0 million), essentially representing the balance between the taking out and amortisations of nancial loans in the amount of +78.0 million (previous year: -23.0 million) on the one hand and payments for the acquisition of own stock in the amount of 8.0 million (previous year: 0.0 million) and dividend payments in the amount of 26.6 million (previous year: 16.0 million) on the other.
1.8. Employees
As an annual average, Drillisch employed a staff of 329, including the two Management Board members (previous year 379). The Company rmly believes that good vocational training is important for the future of young people. Because of its convictions, it takes its social responsibility seriously and gives more young people opportunities for vocational training than required to satisfy its own needs. The number of vocational trainees, which is not included in the above gure, rose to 47 (previous year: 41).
1.9. Principles and objectives of the nancial and capital management
The nancing of the Group is always handled centrally by the parent company Drillisch AG. The top priority of the nancial management at Drillisch is to secure the Company's liquidity at all times. Liquidity reserves are always maintained in such an amount that any and all payment obligations can be met on time. Liquidity is secured on the basis of detailed nancial planning. Business operations are nanced from cash ow and free cash. The Company strives to develop further and to optimise the nancial management continuously.
As a general principle, the company law provisions form the framework of capital management in the Drillisch Group. In cases in which contractual provisions must be observed, the equity is taxed additionally in accordance with the principles dened in these provisions. In cases in which no special provisions must be observed, the taxable equity is the equity as shown in the balance sheet. Otherwise, the equity from the balance sheet is adjusted according to the contractual requirements. During the reporting period, the Company complied with both company law and contractual provisions at all times.

1.10. Non-nancial performance indicators In addition to efcient, value-oriented corporate management, the non-nancial performance indicators described below make an important contribution to the success of Drillisch. Quality of the products: In 2010, simply Communication GmbH became the rst provider of wireless services discount products to be certied in accordance with the standard DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 for its quality management system used in the marketing of voice and data plans for the brands simply and maXXim. The quality criteria on which the certicate is based were once again conrmed during an audit in October 2011. The ISO seal which was awarded simultaneously meets the high standards of the EU RAS norm and applies to the entire product family at simply as well as to the brands maXXim, ja! mobile, PENNY MOBIL and Weltbild Mobil. MS Mobile GmbH was also awarded the ISO certicate in accordance with DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 for outstanding quality management in the areas of online product marketing and customer service in May 2011, one month after the introduction of smartmobil.de. Knowledge of the markets: As a consequence of the more than 20 years of activities by Drillisch and its predecessor companies on the wireless services market, the Company has established a position of trust among customers and network providers. This proximity is what enables Drillisch to recognise upcoming trends in good time and to utilise them to raise value. Realising innovative marketing ideas and alternative distribution solutions has repeatedly led to Drillisch's success in offering products which meet the needs of the customers at an early stage. One important objective is the increase of the subscriber base with long-term value and obtaining a greater market share in the relevant segments. First-class customer service: Drillisch sets high standards for its own customer service, based on its many years of experience as a wireless services provider. Not content just to maintain these standards, the Company has succeeded in improving them through consistent quality management. This has also been conrmed by ofcial sources in the form of ISO certication. So we have demonstrated that innovative, low rates and good customer service are denitely compatible with each other. Efciency of business processes: Drillisch works constantly on the improvement of efciency in business processes. Measures for the continuous reduction of costs have already led to sustained increases in productivity. In the Company`s own estimation, Drillisch is one of the most protable wireless services providers in Germany.

Risk Report
2. Risk Report
2.1. Risk management
The risk management system is an integral component of corporate policy aimed at early exploitation of opportunities as well as the detection and limitation of risks. Drillisch operates a risk management system throughout the Group which includes continuous observation to ensure early recognition and the standardised recording, assessment, control and monitoring of risks. The objective is to obtain information about negative developments and the related nancial effects as early as possible so that the appropriate measures can be initiated to counteract them. The management of the company results and company value makes use of the instrument of risk management. It can become a strategic success factor for corporate management ­ for Drillisch itself as well as for the subsidiaries.
If the Company is to be consistently successful in the conict between opportunities for prot and the threat of loss, risks must be taken into consideration during the decision-making process systematically and in accordance with standards which are uniform throughout the Group. Risk management includes the denition of risk elds, the recording of risks and the communication of risks by the operational units, the assignment of responsibilities and tasks and the documentation of these steps. The concrete implementation of the procedures which have been issued is secured by a monitoring system. The Drillisch risk management process utilises the following building blocks for the exploitation of opportunities without delay and the early discovery of risks:
 The internal controlling system  The daily, weekly and monthly management reporting, especially in the areas controlling, cash ma-
nagement and the operational business segments  The continuous monitoring of the market
The coordination of risk management is handled at the Group level by the Group controlling and the legal department. Based on monthly close-outs, the regular comparison of budget and as-is gures as well as market analyses and market observations, opportunities and risks from both operational and strategic areas can be recognised early so that a risk portfolio can be created and implemented in the appropriate measures. Competencies and responsibilities are clearly regulated at Drillisch and are based on the corporate structure of the Drillisch Group. Risk management includes the securing of risks outside of the Group as well. Adequate insurance policies, provided that they are regarded as being economically justiable, have been concluded to cover incidents of loss and liability risks arising in the course of daily business.
The Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board are regularly provided with reports on the risk situation and the effectiveness of the risk management with all of its controlling functions. The results are discussed by both the Management Board and Supervisory Board.
2.2. Description of the major features of the internal controlling and risk management with respect to the accounting process (Section 315 (2) HGB)
The internal controlling system in the Drillisch Group includes all of the principles, procedures and measures to secure the effectiveness, correctness and economic efciency of the accounting and to assure compliance with the relevant legal requirements. Besides the manual process controls in the form of the "two sets of eyes principle", automatic IT process checks also form a major part of the integrated controlling measures. The auditor and other auditing bodies are indirectly incorporated into the controlling environment of the Drillisch Group with auditing activities independent of processes. The audit of the separate and consolidated annual accounts and review of the semi-annual reports by the auditor are especially important as major monitoring measures with respect to the accounting process.

38

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Risk Report
The risk management in the Drillisch Group as a component of the internal controlling system is oriented to the risk of incorrect representation by the bookkeeping and the external reporting possible in the accounting. A "monitoring system for the early recognition of risks threatening the Company´s existence" has been set up in the Drillisch Group to ensure the systematic early detection of risks throughout the Group so that, going beyond the scope originally required by statutory provisions, other risks as well as those threatening the existence of the rm are detected early, controlled and monitored. In accordance with Section 317 (4) HGB, the auditor appraises the functional capability of the system for the early detection of risks so that it can be adapted without delay to any and all changes in the environment. The bookkeeping software from the manufacturer Sage is used for the posting of accounting items in the Drillisch Group, while the consolidation software from the manufacturer Infor Global Solutions is used at the Group level. Risks related to accounting can arise from the conclusion of unusual or complex transactions, for example. Moreover, business transactions which are not handled as a matter of routine include a latent risk. The measures of the internal controlling system oriented to the correctness of the accounting ensure that all of the business transactions are recorded completely and contemporaneously in conformity with legal and statutory requirements. Furthermore, it is assured that assets and debts are correctly measured, appraised and shown in the annual accounts. The controlling activities include the analysis of material circumstances and developments, for example, using special indicator systems. The organisational separation of administrative, executive, billing and approval functions signicantly reduce vulnerability to fraud. The internal controlling system also assures the representation of changes in the economic or legal environment of the Drillisch Group and ensues the application of any new or amended legal provisions for the accounting.
2.3. Market-related risks The major overall risks related to the market are as follows:
 Drillisch operates in a market environment which is by and large saturated and consequently highly competitive. Increases in overall turnover cannot be expected on the German wireless services market in 2012.
 Drillisch may possibly not be successful in acquiring and maintaining a satisfactory share of this market.
 The increasing availability of low-cost rates and products may cause the prices which can be charged for wireless services to decline.
 A decline in prices on the market for wireless services or the reduction in the forwarding charges could result in falling revenues and income.
 The expenditures required to acquire new customers and retain the loyalty of current customers are comparatively high, especially in the segment of xed-term contracts. These expenditures may continue to rise in the future.
 Drillisch is subject to regulatory restraints in its business activities. These general conditions may change and could impact business.
 Wireless services providers are dependent on network operators in offering their products and services because they do not have their own network.

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

39

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Risk Report
2.4. Company-specic risk factors The major risks specic to Drillisch are as follows:
 The net nancial debt of Drillisch could increase, e.g. as a consequence of the takeover of companies, leading to a worsening of the nancial results and the equity ratio. This could have a long-term effect of the Company's ability to pay dividends and to take out new loans.
 Risks which affect the assets and liabilities, the nancial position or prot and loss of freenet or the value of its stock could also inuence Drillisch owing to its holdings of freenet stock. During the acquisition of the shares in freenet, Drillisch was dependent on documentation which was available to the general public. If this information should prove to be incorrect or incomplete, Drillisch may be exposed to unknown threats.
 The freenet holdings of Drillisch and MSP lead to a book value of the shares which must be reviewed regularly with regard to their value. The review can lead to extraordinary write-offs both in the consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS and in the separate annual accounts in accordance with HGB.
 A loan agreement which Drillisch has concluded contains obligations which restrict the entrepreneurial exibility of Drillisch.
 The interest rates on the bank loans are in part variable. This could result in a threat from changes in interest rates.
 The maintenance of the functional capability and the regular further development of the software systems used by the Company, which it developed in part itself, for the administration of the customers and the billing of performed services is of decisive importance for the success of Drillisch. Software errors can cause disruptions in the program execution, in extreme cases causing a permanent crash of the software and the loss of data, and prevent the Company from developing and offering new wireless service products within a short period of time.
 Drillisch is subject to the risk that contract customers will not meet their payment obligations from their wireless service contracts.
 Drillisch is highly dependent on members of the Management Board and on employees in key positions.
 The termination of the contracts with Telekom Deutschland GmbH and the legal disputes related to this termination may also lead to payment obligations on the part of the subsidiaries simply and Drillisch Telecom. Current xed-term contracts for the Telekom network can be continued.
There were no major changes in the risk situation in 2011 in comparison with the previous year with the exception of the legal disputes with Telekom Deutschland GmbH. The risks described here are the major risks which have been identied at this time. The possibility that additional major risks which have not been recognised by management exist, or that the probability of the occurrence of such risks has been wrongly assessed as negligible, cannot be excluded. Adequate precautions have been taken to counter any probable risks. There are at this time no known risks which would threaten the Company´s existence.

Prediction Report
3. Forecast Report This report contains certain statements oriented to the future which are based on the current assumptions and projections of the Company's management. Various risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known and unknown, can cause the actual results, nancial position, development or performance of the Company to deviate substantially from the assessment shown here.
3.1. General economic conditions In the opinion of the German government and the great majority of the most important economic research institutes, the economic upswing in Germany is not yet at an end. Owing to continuing uncertainty caused by the nancial and government debt crisis and the darkening of the economic situation in Europe and other international areas, however, Dr Philipp Rösler, German Federal Economics Minister, presumes that economic growth in Germany in 2012 will be lower than in 2011. The Deutsche Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) expects economic growth of about 1.0% for 2012. This forecast is in line with the development of the IFO business climate index. Further events related to the European crisis of trust and government debt will continue to have a decisive impact on further economic developments. Thanks to the domestic German economy, which remains very healthy, real economic development in Germany is remarkably resilient.
3.2. Drillisch Management Board forecast regarding the development on the German wireless services market The Drillisch Management Board expects the telecommunications and IT markets in Germany to continue to serve as important innovation drivers for the German economy. However, there will presumably not be any growth in turnover because, although usage is increasing, the price sensitivity will remain at the same level. The most important growth segment will be mobile data communications. Moreover, the displacement of the landline network by wireless services will continue. A study by the Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) in August 2011 showed that about 30% of mobile phone users could imagine doing without a landline connection completely. One out of two respondents hopes to have signicant monetary savings by switching completely to wireless services.
3.3. Opportunities and risks of future development Simple means for making phone calls and "surng" at low prices will remain the focus of interest for wireless services customers. The virtually full-area availability of mobile high-speed Internet, the accelerating spread of smartphones and services such as "near-eld" and "machine-to-machine communication" give rise to the expectation that growth rates in the use of mobile data communications will continue to be high. The greatest growth in turnover and growth potential are predicted for this segment of the wireless services market. Drillisch intends to make use of its customer-friendly portfolio to prot from this development. The termination of the contracts with the network operator Telekom Deutschland GmbH will not have any negative impact on Drillisch's development. The Management Board expects an increase in sales in the sector of "service revenues" and an EBITDA (adjusted) of about 58 million for 2012. The Management Board presumes that these positive developments in earnings in business operations will continue in 2013 as well.

Compensation Report

4. Compensation Report
The structure of the compensation system for the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board. The criteria for the reasonableness of the compensation include in particular the duties and responsibilities of each of the Management Board members; their personal performance; the performance of the Management Board as a whole; and the economic position, the success and the future prospects of the Company, taking into account its comparative environment. The compensation for the Management Board members comprises short-term components and factors with long-term incentive components. The short-term components consist of elements independent of success and elements contingent on success. The elements independent of success comprise xed compensation as well as payment in kind and other benets. The xed compensation as basic compensation independent of success is paid monthly as a salary and reviewed annually. In addition, the Management Board members receive other benets, in particular allowances for pension, health and long-term care insurance, as well as payments in kind (essentially the use of the company car). The Management Board's compensation always includes variable compensation elements which are components contingent on success. These elements are redened every year by the Supervisory Board on the basis of targets.
In 2011, the Supervisory Board concluded an agreement with both Management Board members providing for a "Long-Term Incentive Bonus" (LTI) with a term of ve years as a long-term incentive component. The parameter for determining success is the consolidated EBITDA. In the event of premature termination of the employment relationship within the agreed term, each of the Management Board members will receive a predetermined amount based on the point in time at which he leaves the Company's service.
The term of the contracts with the Management Board expires on 31 December 2015. The Management Board contracts do not contain any express commitments for severance pay ­ with the exception of the following regulation for a change of control clause ­ in the event that the employment relationship is terminated. In the event that Drillisch experiences a change in the shareholder structure of more than 30% (change of control), a part of the compensation independent of success and a part contingent on success will be deemed earned. The Management Board members receive compensation of 20k for their Supervisory Board activities at IQ-optimize and eteleon. The Management Board members did not receive any loans or advance payments in the reporting period. No pension commitments have been made to the Management Board.
Compensation for the members of the Company's Management Board comprises the following elements:

Contributions of 230k for each Management Board member are paid annually into a pension fund as deferred compensation.
The long-term variable compensation contains an incentive component of 250k for each Management Board member; it will not be paid unless certain performance indicators are achieved in scal year 2016.
The members of the Supervisory Board receive reasonable compensation for each full scal year of their participation in the Supervisory Board; the amount is specied in the Company Charter. The chairperson receives twice the amount, while the deputy chairperson receives 2k in addition to the regular compensation. Furthermore, attendance fees per meeting and Supervisory Board member are paid if and when the number of meetings exceeds that stipulated in Section 110 (3) AktG. Supervisory Board members who did not belong to the Supervisory Board during the full scal year receive pro rata temporis compensation according to the duration of their membership on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board members also receive variable

compensation. The variable compensation for all Supervisory Board members is dependent on the distributed dividends per share which exceed 0.10 in dividends per share. However, the variable compensation for each Supervisory Board member may not exceed the amount of the xed compensation which the relevant Supervisory Board member receives. One-quarter of the xed compensation is payable upon the expiration of each and every calendar quarter. The attendance fees as accrued are payable upon the expiration of each and every calendar quarter. The variable compensation is payable on the day after the adjournment of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting which adopts a resolution regarding the appropriation of the retained earnings for the scal year for which the compensation is owed. The Supervisory Board members are also reimbursed for all of their expenses and for any turnover tax which must be paid on their compensation and expenses.
The compensation for the Supervisory Board members in 2011 comprised the following elements.

nal determination of the issue price by the Management Board. The number of shares issued subject to exclusion of the subscription pursuant to Section 186 (3), fourth sentence AktG (German Company Law) may not exceed 10% of the share capital, neither at the point in time at which the authorisation becomes effective nor at the point in time that it is exercised.

C. Consolidation
Consolidation principles and consolidated companies Business combinations are measured according to the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the identied assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiary. The value relationships at the point in time at which the control over the subsidiary is obtained are authoritative. Measurable assets and the assumed liabilities are valued at their full fair value, regardless of the amount of the participation. Any remaining positive difference is shown as goodwill. A negative difference which remains is included as directly effective on income. The disclosed hidden reserves and hidden encumbrances are carried forward to the following periods in the same way as the handling of the corresponding assets and liabilities, written off as scheduled or reversed. Joint ventures and interests which are unilaterally controlled are included in accordance with the equity method. The balance sheets for these companies are prepared with their identied, proportionate assets which have been revaluated (plus any goodwill) and liabilities in one item. The goodwill derived during the application of the equity method is not written off as scheduled depreciation, but it is reviewed at least once a year for any signs of a decrease in value. The equity measurement is always updated by the proportionate period results. Unrealised prots and losses from business transactions with these companies are eliminated proportionately. Consistent accounting and valuation methods are applied to the separate accounts included in the consolidated annual accounts of Drillisch AG. All of the receivables and payables as well as income and expenditures among the companies included in the consolidated annual accounts were eliminated, as were interim results. The parent company´s annual accounts as well as those of all of the important subsidiaries controlled by the former, whether directly or indirectly, were included in the consolidated annual accounts of Drillisch AG as per 31 December 2011. There is control of a company if the parent company, legally or de facto, has the opportunity to determine the nancial and business policies of a company with the aim of obtaining economic benets. The initial inclusion in the consolidated annual accounts takes place at the point in time from which control can be exercised or at which the criteria for joint ventures and associated companies are fullled. Companies which are not included are singly and in their totality of only minor importance, both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and the balance sheets are prepared in accordance with IAS 39.

eteleon e-solutions AG, Munich
The Ordinary Annual General Meeting of eteleon e-solutions held on 27 June 2011 adopted a resolution by unanimous vote to convey the shares of the other shareholders (minority shareholders) of eteleon esolutions AG to the main shareholder, Drillisch AG in Maintal, in accordance with the procedure for the exclusion of minority shareholders (Sections 327a et seqq. German Company Law) against payment of a cash settlement of 2.65 per share.
The squeeze-out resolution was entered in the Commercial Register for the Company on 16 August 2011. The squeeze-out has become effective, and all of the shares of the minority shareholders (4.95%) have been conveyed to Drillisch AG by operation of law.
freenet AG, Büdelsdorf
As of 31 December 2011, Drillisch AG held a total of 11,540,650 shares in freenet AG. The combined holdings in freenet AG stock of Drillisch AG and MSP Holding GmbH amounted to 26,000,000 shares per 31 December 2011, corresponding to a share in the freenet AG capital of 20.30%. The fair value per share of freenet AG stock as per 31 December 2011 amounted to 10.00, while the book value per share came to 9.09.
Owing to the additional purchases from 14 June 2011 on in the second quarter of 2011, the shares in freenet AG are shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method because unilateral control of the company is now possible. The shares were previously shown in the balance sheet according to the available for sale method.
D. General accounting and evaluation methods

Realisation of income and expenses
In the telecommunications segment, sales are generated from the offered wireless services, one-time installation charges and from the sale of mobile end devices and accessories. Sales from wireless services include monthly service charges, charges for special features and connection and roaming charges. Sales from wireless services are realised on the basis of utilisation units which have been used and contractual charges, less credit notes and adjustments due to price discounts. The turnover generated from the sale of mobile telephones, mobile data devices and accessories and the related expenses are realised as soon as the products have been delivered and accepted by the customers.

54

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes
Some of the end customer contracts in the telecommunications sector are multiple-component contracts within the sense of IAS 18.13. In the case of multiple-component contracts, the revenue must be recognised for each of the separately identiable components. The revenue is recognised on the basis of the fair values of the separate components. Agreements for the sale of bundled products or the performance of bundled services must be broken down into their separate components and a separate contribution to earnings must be recognised for each component. The price for the multiple-component transaction in its entirety is distributed among the various components on the basis of the proportionate fair value (i.e. the fair value of each separate component is set in ratio to the fair value of the bundled services as a whole). However, the proportionate fair value of a single component and therefore the realised revenue for this component is recognised separately from that part of the consideration to be paid by the customer for the multiple-component transaction in its entirety independently of the performance of further services.
In the segment software services, sales are generated from the offered customised software solutions and from maintenance and support services. Sales from software solutions and sales from maintenance and support services are based on contractual provisions.
The interest in freenet AG is presented in the segment Equity interest. freenet AG is presented in the consolidated annual accounts in accordance with the equity method and the result is disclosed in the Results from nancial assets shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method.
Operating expenditures are recorded as expenses when the service is used or at the point in time they are caused.
Interest expenses are recorded appropriately for the period in consideration of the outstanding loan total and the effective interest rate which is applicable. The effective interest rate is the interest rate which results in the cash value of the estimated future payments over the expected useful life of the nancial asset being the equivalent of the net book value. Dividend income from nancial investments is recorded when a legal claim to payment arises.
Intangible assets
Intangible xed assets are shown in the balance sheet at acquisition or manufacturing costs, less scheduled depreciation calculated according to the straight-line method. A useful life of three to four years is taken as the basis. The manufacturing costs include overhead costs as well as the immediately attributable direct costs.
Intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life are not written off according to a schedule, but are instead subjected to a recoverability test once a year and, in addition, whenever there are indications of a decrease in value; as appropriate, this is based on entities which generate cash. If the book value of the intangible asset or of the cash-generating entity on which it is based exceeds the recoverable value, the asset must be written off to the recoverable amount.
If the reasons for the previously recorded devaluations cease to exist, the assets are written up without goodwill.
In accordance with IFRS, there has no longer been any scheduled depreciation of goodwill since scal year 2005. The goodwill is reviewed annually to determine any loss of value.
Within the framework of the review of loss of value, the goodwill acquired during a corporate merger is allocated to the cash-generating entities which will presumably prot from the assets which determine the value, but which cannot be measured. The recoverability test is conducted once a year and, in addition, whenever there are indications for a loss of value in the corresponding cash-generating entity. If the book value of the cash-generating entity exceeds its recoverable value, the goodwill allocated to this cash-generating entity must be written off in the amount of the difference; devaluations are not reversed in this case.

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

55

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes
The recoverable value for a cash-generating entity which corresponds to the legal entity is calculated on the basis of its use value. The use value is determined by application of the DCF procedure. The calculations are based on projections resulting from nancial plans approved by management and are also used for internal purposes.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are measured at acquisition costs less scheduled straight-line depreciation. The depreciation period for xtures, ttings and equipment varies between two and nineteen years. Additions during the scal year are written off pro rata temporis. Borrowing costs are measured in the period in which they are incurred as expenditures because there are no qualifying assets in accordance with IAS 23.5.
Financial instruments
A nancial instrument is a contract which simultaneously leads to the creation of a nancial asset for one company and to the creation of a nancial liability or equity instrument for another company. Financial instruments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the point in time at which a consolidated company becomes the party of the nancial instrument. However, the day of performance is relevant in the case of purchases and sales usual on the market for the initial inclusion in and the removal from the balance sheet.
A nancial asset is derecognised when the conditions of IAS 39.17 et seq. have been fullled. If the Group assigns its contractual rights to payment ows from an asset and retains essentially all of the threats and opportunities related to the ownership of this asset, the Group continues to record the assigned asset in the scope of its on-going commitment.
Financial assets include in particular cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, nancial assets available for sale and loans and receivables and derivative nancial assets maintained for commercial purposes. Financial liabilities include trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, liabilities from nancing leasing relationships and derivative nancial liabilities. Financial assets and nancial liabilities are shown as balances only if there is an offset right with respect to the amounts and the intention is to realise a balance on a net basis.
Financial instruments are measured at fair value when recognised for the rst time. The transaction expenses which are directly attributable to the acquisition must be taken into account for all of the nancial assets and liabilities which are subsequently measured at the attributable fair value without effect on income. The attributable fair values measured in the balance sheet correspond as a rule to the market prices of the nancial assets and liabilities.
The subsequent valuation depends on whether a nancial instrument is held for commercial purposes or until its nal maturity, whether it is available for sale or whether it comprises loans and receivables of the company. Financial instruments held for commercial purposes are valuated at the fair value with effect on income. If it is intended, and can also from a commercial standpoint be expected with reasonable condence, that the nancial instruments will be held until their nal maturity, they are valuated in accordance with the effective rate of return method with the acquisition costs carried forward. All other original nancial assets, unless they are loans and receivables, must be classied as available for sale and valuated at fair value. This value is determined on the basis of market prices (exchange prices). The prots and losses resulting from the valuation at fair value are included in shareholders' equity as non-operating results. This does not apply if there are permanent or major losses in value of nancial instruments. When the nancial instruments are derecognised, the cumulative prots and losses recorded in shareholders' equity are shown in the income statement effective on income.

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes

Other nancial assets
Other nancial assets are always measured at acquisition costs less required valuation allowances.
Inventories
The inventories, comprising solely and exclusively merchandise and payments on account, are measured at the lower of acquisition costs or realisable net sales value. The measurement of the merchandise is based on the FIFO principle.
Receivables and other assets
Receivables and other assets were measured at nominal value in the balance sheet. Valuation allowances were created for default risks. Receivables and liabilities related to the network operators Telekom, Vodafone, E-Plus and O are shown in the balance sheet as balances in each case. Any receivables which
2
result from the calculation of the balance are shown in the other current assets, liabilities under the trade accounts payable.
Liabilities
Financial liabilities are shown at acquisition costs carried forward in accordance with IAS 39. Directly attributable issue costs are deducted when the nancial liabilities are taken out and distributed with effect on earnings over the entire term.
Leases
Leases are classied, pursuant to IAS 17, as nance leases if and when essentially all of the threats and opportunities associated with the ownership of the leased object are transferred to the lessee. Any other leases are to be classied as operating leases.
Assets held within the framework of nance leases are capitalised at the beginning of the lease at their fair value or, if it is lower, at the cash value of the minimum leasing instalments, then written off according to straight-line depreciation. The corresponding liability to the lessor is shown in the balance sheet as obligation from nance lease. The leasing instalments are allocated proportionately to nancing expenses and reduction in the lease obligation so that over the periods a constant interest rate on the remaining balance of the obligations is created for each reporting period. Rent payments from operating leases are recorded according to the straight-line method with effect on income over the term of the pertinent lease.
Pension provisions
Pension provisions for merit-based pension commitments are determined actuarially according to the projected unit credit method and shown in the balance sheet on the basis of an assessor's valuation on the balance sheet date.
The pension commitments shown in the balance sheet represent the cash value of the merit-based commitment adjusted for the service period expenses which are to be offset retroactively and for actuarial prots and losses, less the fair value of the scheme assets. Actuarial prots and losses are taken into account and allocated to the average future remaining service period solely to the extent that they exceed a corridor corresponding to 10% of the scope of the obligation or the market value of the scheme assets, whichever is higher.
Short-term provisions
Provisions are created for a legal or de facto obligation which originated in the past if it is probable that the fullment of the obligation will result in an outow of Group resources and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

57

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
Consolidated Notes
Deferred taxes Deferred taxes are shown according to the liability method for all temporary differences between the tax value measurements and the book values. The tax rates which will presumably apply at the point in time of the reversal of the temporary differences are applied. Deferred taxes are not created if the temporary difference results from goodwill. Deferred taxes are shown as tax revenue or expenses in the income statement unless they directly affect items included in shareholders' equity as non-operating results; in this case, the deferred taxes are also shown as non-operating results in shareholders' equity.
Long-term incentive components The variable compensation paid to the Management Board contains a long-term incentive component which will not be paid out unless specic indicators are fullled in scal year 2016. A provision has been created on the basis of the fair value.
Usage of assumptions and estimates During the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts, assumptions were made and estimates applied which affected the disclosure and measurement of the assets, liabilities, earnings, expenditures and contingent liabilities shown in the balance sheet. These assumptions and estimates are related primarily to the determination of commercial lifetimes used as a standard throughout the Group, the assumptions concerning the recoverability of goodwill, brand rights, receivables and investments, the valuation of provisions and the realisability of future tax relief. The actual values may, in individual cases, deviate from the assumptions and estimates which have been made, especially with respect to dividend returns, interest rates and volatilities. Any changes will be given due consideration with effect on the results whenever more precise knowledge becomes available. Estimates are necessary especially in measuring the goodwill in the balance sheet and its recoverability tests, in determining the interest factor for calculation of the pension provisions and the valuation of other provisions when showing them in the balance sheet. The Drillisch Group has a key approach of nancial risk management for the identication, measurement and control of risks. The risk items are derived from the income and expenditures affecting payments which are undertaken and planned throughout the Group.

Taxes on income which have either been paid or which are owed as well as deferred taxes are shown as taxes on income. Taxes on income comprise corporate income tax, solidarity surcharge and trade tax. Effective and deferred taxes are levied on stock companies as follows: corporate income tax 15.0% (previous year: 15.0%), solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (previous year: 5.5%) and trade tax, levied according to the rates charged in the specic municipality.
The actual tax expenses were not reduced in 2011 by the utilisation of decits carried forward for MSP Holding GmbH which had previously not been taken into consideration. There were accumulated decits carried forward relevant for corporate income tax in the amount of 9,870k (previous year: 2,481k) and accumulated decits carried forward relevant for trade tax in the amount of 6,825k (previous year: 2,085k) at MSP Holding GmbH per 31 December 2011, neither of which has been shown.

The additions of the own produced software are related to the software developed by IQ-optimize AG and used by the Company.
During the purchase price allocation process for Telco GmbH in 2007 and eteleon e-solutions AG in 2009, customer relationships, own produced software and the trademarks Telco and eteleon were recognised. The trademarks are intangible assets with an unlimited useful life. Based on the analysis of the relevant factors (planning related to the future use of the asset, expected market behaviour, and so on), there is no foreseeable limitation to the periods in which the trademarks will presumably generate net cash ows.

The goodwill of Drillisch Telecom GmbH results from the original goodwill in the companies Alphatel GmbH, VICTORVOX GmbH and Telco GmbH. With the exception of IQ-optimize AG, the goodwill has been allocated to the telecommunications segment.

The acquisition costs and the accrued depreciation as well as the resulting book values did not change in comparison with the previous year.

The value of the goodwill was reviewed using the amounts realisable for these cash-generating entities, calculated on the basis of their utilisation values. The utilisation values result from the future cash ows, including interest. The company planning approved by management for the years 2012 to 2016 and for the time after that is based on a sustained net prot at a constant growth rate of 0.5% (previous year: 1.0%), derived from the budgetary gures for 2016. The budget presumes average growth in gross prot for Drillisch Telecom GmbH and IQ-optimize AG in the lower single-digit percentage range for this period. Average growth in gross prot which barely breaks into the two-digit percentage range at the end of the budgetary scope is expected for eteleon e-solutions AG owing to the expansion of the business model. The major assumption for the planning of the cash-generating entities is the number of subscribers. Discounting on the cash ows for the period 2012 to 2016 was calculated at an interest rate of 11.38% (previous year: 8.30%) and for the following period at an interest rate of 10.88% (previous year: 7.60%) pa (in each case, before taxes). No adjustments in the value of the goodwill were required in scal year 2011. There was no value reduction in goodwill from a reduction of the discount interest rate by about 1% and in consideration of a lump-sum deduction of 25% from the expected cash ow.

12. Other nancial assets

The freenet shares held by MSP Holding GmbH and Drillisch AG since 14 June 2011 have been valuated according to the equity method because of the unilateral control over the company from the voting rights quota. The results from this inclusion amounted to 28.3 million as per 31 December 2011. This item also includes income from the reversal of the market valuation provision. The transition from a classication as "available for sale" to the equity method valuation resulted in the reversal of the market valuation provision effective on prots.
Moreover, the share of the updating of the proportional equity of freenet AG effective on prots in the amount of 19.9 million is included in the "Results from the nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method". In the previous year, the interest was classied as "Available for sale" in accordance with IAS 39 and was disclosed in the item Other nancial assets.
The table below shows the long-term and short-term assets and liabilities in full and the performance indicators for the company freenet AG shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method per 30 September 2011.

With respect to the receivables which as of the closing date had not been devaluated and which were not overdue, nothing was known as of the closing date which would indicate that the debtors would not full their payment obligations.
Receivables which as of the closing date were not devaluated, but which were overdue, comprise receivables due from customers and suppliers with whom payment in instalments in the amount of 3,810k has been agreed. As long as these debtors full their payment obligations, there will not be any valuation allowances and the receivables will continue to be measured at acquisition costs.
In the Drillisch Group, valuation allowances are created on doubtful receivables to take into account estimated losses which result from customers' insolvency. The criteria used by management for the assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation allowances for doubtful receivables are the maturity structure of the receivable balances and experience related to the write-offs of receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers and the changes in terms and conditions of payment. If the customers' nancial position deteriorates, the scope of the write-offs which must actually be taken can exceed the scope of the expected write-offs.
The valuation allowances on trade receivables have developed as shown below:

Nor is a later redemption or resale of these shares to third parties against cash payment excluded.

Capital surplus
The capital surplus contains the premium over the nominal amount from the issue of shares by Drillisch AG. The amount required for the purchase of treasury stock in excess of the par value of 1.10 was deducted from the capital surplus.

Earnings reserves
The earnings reserves contain the prots realised in the past by the companies included in the consolidated annual accounts which were not distributed or carried forward to a new account from a Group perspective.

Non-controlling shareholders The item of non-controlling shareholders is related to third-party shares at eteleon e-solutions AG up to the time of the transfer of the shares to Drillisch AG on 16 August 2011.
Approved capital The Annual General Meeting of 30 May 2008 authorised the Management Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company's share capital by as much as 29,253,957.70 by a single or multiple issue of new shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind before the lapse of 29 May 2013 (approved capital). In the event of cash contributions, the new shares may also be taken over by one or more banks, subject to the obligation to offer them for purchase to the shareholders (indirect subscription right). On principle, a subscription right is to be granted to the shareholders. However, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights:
 So that fractional amounts are excluded from the subscription right;  If the capital increase is achieved by cash contributions and the issue price of the new shares is not sig-
nicantly lower than that of the equivalent shares already traded on the exchange at the time of the nal determination of the issue price by the Management Board. The number of shares issued subject to exclusion of the subscription pursuant to Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG may not exceed 10% of the share capital, neither at the point in time at which the authorisation becomes effective nor at the point in time that it is exercised. Any shares which have been issued or must be issued to satisfy subscription rights from options or convertible bonds, provided that the debenture bonds have been issued during the term of this authorisation subject to application mutatis mutandis of Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG and excluding the subscription right must be included in this gure. Furthermore, any shares which are issued or sold, subject to the exclusion of a subscription right, during the term of this authorisation on the basis of an authorisation for the use of treasury stock in accordance with Section 71 (1) no 8 and Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG must be included in this gure;  If the capital increase against contributions in kind is carried out for the purpose of providing shares within the framework of corporate mergers or of acquiring companies or parts of companies, holdings in companies or other assets;  So that new shares up to a proportionate amount of the share capital totalling 2,925,395.00 may be issued as staff shares to employees of the Company or of afliated companies within the sense of Section 15 et seqq. AktG. Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further content of the stock rights and the terms and conditions of the issue of the shares.

19. Pension provisions

Provisions are created for commitments from pension expectancies to present and former employees or their survivors.
Pension provisions are shown in the balance sheet and measured in accordance with IAS 19. The future commitments are valuated by applying actuarial procedures and using prudent estimates of the relevant inuential variables. The company pension plan in the Group is merit-based and as a rule depends on the time of service to the Company and the compensation paid to the employees.
The following calculation parameters are used in addition to the assumptions about life expectancy:

The pension provisions are always valuated by applying the 10% corridor rule. Actuarial prots or losses are not considered with effects on income provided that they do not exceed 10% of the higher of the scope of the commitments or market value of the scheme assets. Any amount exceeding this corridor is distributed with effect on income over the average remaining time of service of present employees. The scheme assets represent a pension plan reinsurance which has been pledged to the employees.
The reference tables 2005 G from Klaus Heubeck were used for the biometrical basis of the calculations. The uctuation probability was estimated specically to age and sex.
The income expected from the scheme assets was determined essentially on the basis of the development of the reinsurance policy in the past.

In addition, contribution-oriented schemes have been in place. This does not result in any obligations for Drillisch AG beyond the payment of the contributions to external institutes. The expenditures for the funding of these contribution-oriented schemes in the scal year amounted to 1.4m (previous year: 1.1m).

20. Bank loans and overdrafts / Financial liabilities

A loan agreement for a total of 100 million was agreed between the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt, and the West LB AG, Düsseldorf, as the arrangers and Drillisch AG on 15 October 2010. The loan is divided into a bullet loan (40 million) and a revolving loan (60 million) and was utilised to the extent of 60 million as per 31 December 2011 (previous year: 57 million). The interest rate comprises two components: the EURIBOR applicable to the relevant interest period and a margin agreed in the loan agreement. As of 31 December 2011, the combined interest rate came to 2.41% (previous year: 2.36%). The term of the loan runs until 15 October 2014. The loan must be repaid at the end of the term at the latest; interim obligatory repayments have not been agreed. Voluntary premature amortisation is possible at any time.
The applicable margin is adjusted quarterly and oriented to the ratio of consolidated net nancial debt to consolidated EBITDA on the basis of the 12 months previous to the relevant quarterly closing date. The minimum margin is 1.10% for the bullet loan and 1.25% for the revolving credit and will be applied if the ratio of consolidated net nancial debt to consolidated EBITDA is less than 1 to 1. If this ratio is greater than 2 to 1, the maximum possible margins of 2.10% and 2.25%, respectively, will apply.
The bank charges of 950k due and payable when the loan became available will be set off according to the effective interest method and distributed per schedule over the term.
Drillisch AG has pledged 2.5 million shares of the freenet stock it holds directly as security for the loan. As of the closing date, the total value of the security was 22.7 million (previous year: 19.7 million); fair value amounted to 25.0 million (previous year: 19.7 million).

Consolidated Notes

The loan is tied to specic nancial indicators (degree of indebtedness and equity ratio); in the event of failure to comply with these indicators, the loan agreement may be terminated.
The interest expenses related to the loans amounted to 1,592k in scal year 2011 (previous year 1,166k).
On 11 February 2011 and 03 May 2011, MSP Holding GmbH concluded nancing transactions with the Bank of America N.A. (BANA) of 31.1 million and 58.6 million, respectively, for the additional purchase of stock in freenet AG. Each of these nancing transactions consists of three partial amounts ("buckets") which must be repaid with due dates in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. There will not be any interest payments during the terms.
The interest expenses related to the nancing transactions will be provided in the form of ratable discounting until the time of the repayment. Voluntary premature amortisation is possible at any time.
The structuring fee of 600k incurred with the nancing transaction will be distributed per schedule according to the effective interest method over the term.
MSP Holding GmbH has pledged 13.3 million shares of the freenet stock it holds directly as security for the loan. As of the closing date, the security had a total value of 120.9 million (fair value: 133.2 million). There are no other securities.
The interest expenses related to the nancing transactions amounted to 2,513k in scal year 2011 (previous year 0k).
The nancial liabilities are related to the closing-date valuation of a hedge transaction concluded as part of the nancing of the freenet stock acquired in 2011. The value of the hedging transaction is recalculated as of every closing date and is primarily a result of the price of the freenet stock on the closing date and of the remaining term. A rising stock price tends to lead to a declining value of the hedging transaction. Since the security transaction does not meet the requirements of a hedging pursuant to IAS 39, this nance instrument is measured separately effective on prots.

In the scal year, 1,457k (previous year: 1,625k) from rent and leasing payments was included in expenditures. Furthermore, there are additional nancial obligations pursuant to contracts with network operators in the amount of 10.0 million. 5.0 million of these obligations will be due in 2012 and 5.0 million in 2013.

29. Additional disclosures of nancial instruments in accordance with IFRS 7

A nancial reporting system responsible for the security and nancing activities of the Group has been installed throughout the Drillisch Group. Market, liquidity and loan risks of the Group can be identied and appropriate measures and strategies determined with the aid of this nancial reporting system. The risks are managed centrally in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Management Board.
The Drillisch Group is subject to various threats in its business elds. These threats and their management are described in detail in the risk report which is part of the consolidated management report. Capital management is described under Point 1.9 of the consolidated management report.
The risks resulting from the nancial instruments are related to loan risks, liquidity risks and market risks. The loan risks take the form of the risks of losses of nancial assets. Liquidity risks are renancing risks and are risks of the on-time fullment of the Group's existing payment obligations. Market risks occur in the Group in the form of interest risks and stock price risks.
The risk of asset losses in the Group is limited as a maximum to the book values of the nancial assets. For the original nancial instruments, this is the total of the book values. The risk of asset losses is given due consideration by valuation allowances or insurance policies. There is no concentration of risks of loss of assets on individual debtors, especially because of the mass business. When seen against this background, the risk of loss is deemed to be slight.
Early recognition of the future liquidity situation is obtained by considering payment ows, taking into account the planned assets and liabilities and earning position in the 5-year planning of the Group. The short-term liquidity planning is updated daily with actual gures.
IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses to show market risks. The inuence of risk variables on earnings and equity is to be described by hypothetical changes in these variables based on past experience. In this regard, risks due to changes in interest and stock prices are above all relevant for the Drillisch Group.
The holdings in the nancial instruments as of the balance sheet date are representative for the entire scal year. The holdings in the nancial instruments are measured as imputed values with additions and deductions to the risk variables to determine their effects on earnings and equity.
Interest risks results from changes in the market interest level. Within the framework of the sensitivity analysis of IFRS 7, the effects of changes in the market interest level on interest payments, interest expenses and interest income, on other sectors of the results and on equity are shown.

Drillisch Annual Report 2011

77

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
Consolidated Notes
The sensitivity analyses of interest risks are based on the following premises: Original nancial instruments with xed interest rates are subject to interest risks only if they are measured at fair value. Financial instruments which are measured at acquisition costs are not subject to any risks from changes in the market interest level. Original nancial instruments with a variable interest rate are subject to market interest risks and are included in the sensitivity analysis. Stock price risks result from changes in the market prices (stock exchange prices). Within the framework of the sensitivity analysis of IFRS 7, the effects of changes in the stock exchange prices on the results and on equity are shown.
Sensitivity analysis In the event of a change in the market interest level as per 31 December 2011 of ±100 base points, the Group results would be 600k lower or 600k higher. This hypothetical effect on results is based on original nancial debts subject to variable interest rates. In the event of a change in exchange price of the freenet AG stock per 31 December 2011 of ±1.00, but no change in any other conditions, the consolidated results/equity would be 7.5 million (after taxes) lower and 7.5 million (after taxes) higher, respectively.
Miscellaneous disclosures about nancial instruments None of the nancial assets were reclassied into another valuation category of IAS 39 during the reporting period. None of the nancial assets and nancial liabilities were designated as effective for income at the attributable market value during the reporting period. The pertinent book value for short-term nancial assets and liabilities which are not derivatives is a reasonable approximation of the attributable market value within the sense of IFRS 7.29(a). The book values of nancial assets shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method which serve as collateral for liabilities and the terms and conditions of collateral are shown under the item "Liabilities due to banks".

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be classied according to the valuation hierarchy of IFRS 7 (so-called fair value hierarchy) as shown here.

The hedging transaction disclosed under nancial liabilities is classied in the level "derived from prices (Level 2)" and is shown in the balance sheet at a fair value of 6.5 million.

The basis of the hierarchy levels is the factors used to determine the fair value. Level 1 utilises the quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 utilises inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 utilises inputs which are not based on observable market data and must be determined on the basis of valuation methods. No measurements have been made at Levels 1 and 3.

With the exception of the equity interest of 236.4 million, the nancial liabilities of 157.8 million, the equity result of 28.3 million and the other nancial results plus interest expenses of -24.6 million, the assets and liabilities as well as expenses and income of the group must be attributed almost exclusively to the telecommunications sector.
The consolidation includes the elimination of the business relationships within or between the segments. Such relationships are essentially the offsetting of the expenses and income within the Group. The accounting methods (IFRS) are identical for all of the segments.
The transfer prices correspond on principle to the prices determined by arm's length comparison. Since the Drillisch Group is active only in Germany, there are no geographic segments. The most important nonoperating segment expenses and income include the allocations to the provisions and the measurement of the hedging transaction and the equity result.

AUDITOR´S OPINION

Auditor´s Opinion

Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated nancial statements prepared by the Drillisch Aktiengesellschaft, Maintal, comprising the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the statement of nancial position, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash ows and the notes to the consolidated nancial statements, together with the group management report for the business year from 1. January 2011 to 31. December 2011. The preparation of the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to sec. 315a para. 1 HGB are the responsibility of the parent company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated nancial statements and on the group management report based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated nancial statements in accordance with sec. 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of nancial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, nancial position and results of operations in the consolidated nancial statements in accordance with the applicable nancial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual nancial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and signicant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the ndings of our audit, the consolidated nancial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to sec. 315a para. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, nancial position and results of operations of the group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated nancial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
