ROCKWOOL Business model
At ROCKWOOL, all our products are based on the natural power of stone, and we are committed to market-leading excellence in stone wool technology, manufacturing, and customer service. As several of
our markets are cyclical and our production platform
is capital intensive with high operational leverage, we apply a conservative financial strategy and operate with a low-risk transactional business model.
Some 90% of our business is based on local recurring transactional sales with return customers. Average
order size is modest, carrying product guarantees, but no system warranties. We produce and distribute our fully recyclable products overwhelmingly locally with an average shipping distance of approximately 300 km. This proximity gives us extensive opportunities to provide long-term employment and to engage with current and prospective customers frequently.

Dear Stakeholders,
ROCKWOOL Group has come a long way since we first began producing stone wool in 1937. We have expanded our product range well beyond building insulation, and now employ more than 11,000 people representing 61 nationalities oper- ating in 39 countries. We have 45 manufacturing facilities and sell our products in 100+ countries around the world.
At ROCKWOOL, we understand that our industry affects society and the environment. Quality of life, health and wellbeing are heavily influenced by the built environment surrounding us. We see the challenges of modern living amidst massive urbanisation and climate change as opportunities for ROCKWOOL Group to help improve lives and reduce humanity’s impact on the environment. What’s more, aging buildings in many countries require deep renovation, creating enormous opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Throughout our 80 years, we

have built on the successes and the experience of the past to design and guide the strategy of the present and lay a solid foundation for the future. Together, we achieved a great deal in 2017. Our financial results are strong, with net sales increas- ing 7.1% in local currencies; EBIT margin reaching 10.8%; and we are debt free with a net positive cash position of EUR 241 million. Our customers are responding well to our focus on meeting
their needs, with our customer satisfaction scores almost 25% above 2016 and 43% above 2015, far exceeding what we set out to achieve.
With a combination of considerably improved internal efficiencies as well as an effective pricing strategy, we overcame the significant input cost increases we experienced during the year. Prepar- ing for the future, we added new capacity in 2017, with the opening of Rockfon manufacturing in the United States and the acquisition of Flumroc in Switzerland. We also initiated greenfield projects in the United States and Romania and purchased a centrally located building site in Sweden.
Overall market and macroeconomic conditions in 2017 were positive for ROCKWOOL and the con- struction industry, particularly in the United States and key European markets. After a couple of difficult years in Russia we are pleased to see a re- turn to growth. Consumer confidence, investment levels, and employment continued their upswing, contributing to higher levels of construction activ- ity. And notwithstanding the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, there remains deep and broad political support for reaching ambi- tious climate targets, in which energy efficiency in buildings plays an increasingly important role.
Fire safety took on even greater prominence in 2017, following the tragic Grenfell Tower fire in London. As a result, we’re seeing more focus on fire safety issues, including on England’s current system of regulations, guidance, and testing of materials and systems. We will continue to advo- cate for stronger fire safety regulations in the UK as well as other key markets.
Compared to many other industries, the construc- tion sector has lagged behind on adopting digital innovations. During 2017, we devoted significant
effort to various digitalisation initiatives, including launching an entirely new web presence, www.rockwoolgroup.com. Our new web site
is the Group’s first major step in an ambitious digital strategy to transform our engagement with customers.
We also initiated a new customer relationship management system; continued work on an e-commerce system; and upgraded our efforts on other digital initiatives. Internally, we launched a new online learning and development platform that will among other benefits facilitate knowledge and experience sharing across the entire Group.
As we look ahead to 2018, we anticipate a period with continued growth. With a strong focus on cus- tomer service, product quality, and operational effi- ciency, we expect Group net sales to increase 7-10% relative to 2017 in local currencies, of which the acquisition and incorporation of Flumroc accounts for approx. two percentage points. The EBIT margin is expected to reach at least 11%, reflecting the pos- itive impact from higher volumes, better productivi- ty and increased sales prices as well as an expected increase in raw material and logistics costs.
As our capacity utilisation increases and we continue to invest in digitalisation, innovation and automation to support our growth, we now step into a period with a higher level of investments and capital expenditure.
In 2018, excluding acquisitions, we expect invest- ments and capital expenditures to increase by about EUR 100 million compared to last year and thus to reach a total of around EUR 230 million.

80 years of dedication, innovation and growth
Throughout our 80 years we have applied our knowledge and a can-do attitude to everything we do. Our founders and many colleagues thereafter have dared to challenge conventional wisdom and to experiment with new ideas. That’s why today we have a broad range of solutions all based on the same natural material – stone.
  1937 – Determined to succeed After buying a licence in the United States for stone wool manufacturing in 1935, we started production in Hedehusene, Denmark in 1937. One year later our factory burnt down, but that didn’t stop us. We built another and since then many more. We also overcame the scarcity of raw materials during World War II by finding substitutes to continue production.

 1954 – Beyond Scandinavia
We acquired the licence to use spinners to produce stone wool materials in 1952, resulting
in even better insulation than in our early days. During the next two years, new production methods greatly increased output and quality. In 1954, we opened a subsidiary in Germany, making it our first outside Scandinavia and three years later, set up a dedicated engineering department and have been evolving production methods
and innovating ever since. In the 1960s, acoustic insulation products under the Rockfon brand went to market and the development of a precision growing medium for horticulture began, laying the basis for Grodan.
1996 – Stock listing and international expansion
Having listed the company on the Copenhagen stock exchange in 1996 and acquired factories
in Russia, Canada, eastern Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and France, the 1990s was an era of great expansion. In 1997, Rockdelta was established to provide solutions for vibration and noise control.
2017 – Still growing
In 2017, we acquired land in the United States, Sweden, and Romania to expand production ca- pacity or otherwise meet the increasing demand for stone wool products in and around these markets. We inaugurated a Rockfon acoustic ceil- ing factory in the United States and acquired the Swiss stone wool producer Flumroc. The Group also devoted significant effort to various digital­ isation initiatives, including a new web presence and customer relationship management system, to transform our engagement with customers.
With 80 years of stone wool expertise behind us, we have a strong foundation to continue building for the next 80 years. The more we learn about stone, the more potential we discover. We will continue to innovate to create solutions to today’s unsolved, and tomorrow’s unknown, challenges.

The ROCKWOOL Strategy
At the pinnacle of ROCKWOOL’s strategy is our corporate Purpose: to release the natural power of stone to enrich modern living. This reflects our Purpose’s unifying nature, conveying that stone is our core raw material and the bedrock on which our business is based.
And while the stone we use may be millions of years old, what we do with it is cutting-edge. Every day, ROCKWOOL’s creative and entrepre- neurial colleagues are developing and applying new technologies and innovations to release yet more potential of stone to enrich modern living.
As we look to the future, stone wool and the products we make with it will play an increasing- ly significant role in addressing two of the most far­reaching megatrends influencing virtually every aspect of modern society – urbanisation and climate change.
Every week, for example, about 1.5 million people move to urban environments. By 2030, there will be 41 megacities around the globe, defined as cit- ies with more than 10 million inhabitants. And by 2050, the earth’s population will be around nine billion, 70% of whom will live in cities.
The combination of more people living in more densely populated urban areas and the worsen- ing consequences of climate change will increase the demand for modern housing and energy.
At the same time, the world will have to feed
its growing population using fewer resources, while also managing the effects of more frequent extreme weather events, particularly in urban environments.
The ROCKWOOL business strategy is driven by a passion for sustainably converting these global trends into profitable business opportunities by creating superior solutions to protect life, assets, and the environment, and to create comfortable, healthy, and attractive spaces. In other words, by enriching modern living.
Our aspiration is to grow faster than the market overall by strengthening our brand; building long- term customer relations; and driving an opera- tionally effective business across all segments and geographies where we are active.
As our business is inherently capital intensive,
we focus on exploiting our natural strengths to balance risks, which includes a differentiated approach across selected geographies. In North America, for example, we are expanding our production capacity to capture significant growth opportunities within all major business areas.
In Europe, we will grow faster than the market
by launching new products and services, while improving our customer-facing activities and the productivity of our production platform. We will expand capacity where needed to meet steadily growing demand in and near core markets and enhance our geographic coverage and customer service level. In Russia and Asia, the approach is different, in that we will develop and grow our business selectively where there is a clear demand for our premium quality offerings.
At ROCKWOOL, everything we do is based on releasing the natural power of stone to enrich modern living. Profitably offering solutions to address the challenges created by enduring global megatrends will help ensure our success- ful future growth.

Global market review and outlook 2018
Improved construction market conditions
In 2017, the construction industry rebounded as es- pecially residential markets improved in developed economies. This was largely due to robust economic growth, mainly across the Eurozone and North America. The broad-based European economic ex- pansion is expected to continue in the coming year, as it is benefitting from the upturn in other regions of the world.
In North America, general market expansion and demand for infrastructure repairs created favour-
able conditions, which are expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Conditions in emerging markets also improved, with particularly China outperforming moderate expectations and Russia benefitting from commodity price increases.
Key markets expected to grow
Construction indicators in key markets such as France, Germany, North America, and Russia point toward continued growth in 2018.
In France, for example, the government has announced major investment plans to renovate

public non-residential buildings to improve ener- gy efficiency (among other benefits). Fire safety regulations particularly for tall building facades are under revision following the Grenfell Tower tragedy in London, which could further bolster demand for fire­safe stone wool solutions.
In Germany, a high number of building permits were granted in 2016-2017 for residential and non-residential buildings, with a backlog of con- struction activity extending into 2018-2019. There is similarly a strong increase in the number of building permits granted for residential housing, with the expectation for around 400,000 units per year being built in the coming years. Combined with high fire safety and energy efficiency stand- ards in Germany, this will drive demand for stone wool insulation.
Driven by market expansion in the United States and steady growth in Canada, demand for stone wool solutions is expected to continue growing in North America. Key construction drivers including household balance sheets, unemployment rates, and consumer confidence point to continued high construction activity levels.
The Russian insulation market continues to im- prove, in line with the overall stabilisation of the economy, with GDP growth expected at 2% in 2018. Lower interest rates and government sup- port programmes are encouraging the residential mortgage market, while there are also positive developments in commercial, industrial, and infra- structure projects.
Outlook 2018
For 2018, we expect a healthy growth driven by favourable market conditions as outlined above. We see continued increases in input and logistics costs, which we aim to compensate by produc- tivity and price improvements as well as volume growth.
The strong momentum from the second half of 2017 has resulted in an increased capacity utili- sation. Several factories are expected to operate at full or near­full capacity for a significant part of the year.
With a strong focus on customer service, product quality, and operational efficiency, we expect Group net sales to increase 7-10% relative to 2017 in local currencies, of which the acquisition and incorporation of Flumroc accounts for approxi- mately two percentage points.
With the prevailing exchange rates (early February 2018), we expect a negative impact on net sales growth as expressed in our reported currency (EUR) by close to two percentage points.
For 2018, the EBIT margin is expected to reach at least 11%.
Investments excluding acquisitions for 2018 will increase compared to recent years due to capac- ity expansion and a higher level of investments in customer-focused digital initiatives and innova- tion. The main increases stem from the greenfield projects that have been initiated in the United States and Romania as well as capacity expan- sion projects in several of our existing factories
in Europe. Thus for 2018, we expect investment/ CAPEX to increase by about EUR 100 million ver- sus 2017 and reach a total of around EUR 230 mil- lion. During the year we will continuously monitor the market and capacity utilisation development with an eye on necessary capacity investments.

Insulation
We are the world’s leading manufacturer of fire­safe stone wool insulation. We offer products and solu- tions for all major application areas for residential and non-residential buildings; technical insulation
to the process, offshore, and marine industries; and customised core solutions for industrial partners and original equipment manufacturers (OEM).
The largest segment in the ROCKWOOL Group, our insulation business benefited overall from posi- tive market and macroeconomic conditions in 2017.
Building insulation in particular was strong owing to increased construction activity in key European and North American markets. Especially in Europe, building renovation is increasingly in focus, which together with positive developments in the new build industrial segment, continues driving de- mand for thermally­efficient, fire­safe stone wool insulation.
The market for technical insulation experienced a slight recovery, while core solutions provided to OEMs experienced growth particularly in sales to sandwich panel producers.
Competition-wise, we anticipate the Owens Corning acquisition of stone wool producer Paroc will have an overall positive effect on the market, helping to broaden the appeal of stone wool insulation.

We provide customers with complete acoustic ceiling systems, combining stone wool ceiling tiles with suspension grid systems and accessories. Our ceiling systems are a fast and simple way
to create beautiful, comfortable spaces. Easy to install and durable, they improve acoustic comfort and don’t contribute to the spread of fire.
Rockfon, the largest unit in our Systems segment, expanded its reach with the opening of a new production line in the United States, ROCKWOOL’s largest market for ceiling solutions.
The 12,000-square metre manufacturing facility is ROCKWOOL Group’s first stone wool acoustic ceiling product plant in North America and its fifth worldwide. The North American competitive landscape is heavily influenced by Armstrong World Industries; while Knauf’s acquisition of Armstrong’s European ceiling business will increase competition there.
Rockfon experienced generally healthy growth in Europe in 2017, while sales performance in Asia was disappointing.

 When complete in June 2018, the CITIC Tower will be the tallest build- ing in Beijing, China and the 10th tallest in the world. During 2016 and 2017, ROCKWOOL supplied Thermal- Rock and RockSafe insulation for the construction of the 528-metre-tall building. These products were chosen for their excellent thermal insulation properties and non-combustible capa- bilities, which contribute to reducing energy consumption and enhancing fire safety in this high-rise building.
China is experiencing an unprecedent- ed rate of urbanisation, with more and more tall buildings being constructed, highlighting the growing demand for en- ergy-efficient, fire-safe construction that also promotes indoor health, wellbeing and comfort. Building materials address- ing these needs help people to enjoy their modern city lives and represent
an important growth opportunity for ROCKWOOL in the high-end real estate market. The use of our products in CITIC Tower contributes to strengthening our leading position in the industry.

Old meets new
– Luzhniki sports arena
 The Luzhniki Palace of Sports arena, formerly the Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium, will be the main stadium for the FIFA World Cup 2018. The renovation of this classic sports venue in Moscow is an inspiring example of renovating for the future with respect for the past. Originally built in 1956, the arena combines today’s most advanced technologies with the charm of history to create a state-of-the-art sports facility. Renovations began in 2013 and were completed during 2017.
ROCKWOOL products used in the 81,000-seat arena include: ROCKWOOL pipe sections for thermal pipe insula-
tion; wired mats for thermal and sound insulation as well as fire protection around air ducts; and facade batts to improve
the arena’s energy efficiency and ensure the safety and comfort of spectators and employees. ROCKWOOL products were also chosen for nine other FIFA World Cup 2018 venues in Russia.

Puddles not pools – Lapinus water management
 ROCKWOOL Group Annual report 2017
27
The largest ever stone wool-based water management solution, installed in Schimmert, The Netherlands, helps solve a major problem for the town: flash flooding caused by extreme rainfall. The customised solution consists of 820 m3 of Lapinus stone wool elements placed under the playground at ‘t Kirkeveldsje primary school. When there is heavy down- pour, excessive surface water is chan- nelled into underground stone wool buffers, from which the water slowly dissipates into the ground.
Installed in July 2017, this innovative solution protects school children and residents in surrounding areas from the annoyance, inconvenience and unhygienic consequences of flash flooding. It also means that puddles on the surface stay small and safe to splash in!
As climate change leads to more extreme weather events, including urban flash flooding, Lapinus expects a growing demand for its newly intro- duced water management solutions. The Schimmert project is a big step in that direction.

Sustainability
  When it comes to ROCKWOOL Group’s approach to sustainability, it is, simply put, a matter of living our purpose to address the challenges of modern living in a sustainable manner. This means using natural materials to make products that have a positive impact on society.
We contribute to meeting 10 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
we intend to measure as much as possible how well we perform on them. In 2015, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, and in 2016, we formally launched our strategic efforts to work towards achieving the SDGs. We are continuously striving to make our positive con- tribution even greater and in 2017 we developed more robust ways to measure how we live up to our declared intentions.
Circular business model
SDG number 12, “Responsible Consumption”, is one example of how we contribute, both through the positive impact of ROCKWOOL Group’s products and by setting ambitious targets for our operations. In this SDG, we have focused on the SDG target of substantially reducing waste generation.
How do we reduce waste? Our stone wool insulation is durable and has an extremely long
lifespan, but when it does eventually become waste, it is fully recyclable. Our products can be easily removed when a building is renovated or demolished and recycled back into new products. It is a natural material that we can turn into stone wool again and again. We have even developed
a technology to take other types of waste and make stone wool from it. In other words, we have a circular business model.
Climate change
Another good example of how we work with the SDGs concerns goal number 13, “Climate Action”. We have operational goals to reduce CO2 in our own factories around the world. However, it is through our insulation products that we have by far the most significant positive impact:
– Our building insulation sold in 2017 will save 850 terawatt-hours of heating energy during its lifetime and as a result save 190 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

Carbon savings during product lifetime
  – Our technical insulation sold in 2017 will save more than 5,000 terawatt-hours heating energy during its lifetime and as a result save 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
Our products help combat climate change on a large scale and we work to increase the positive climate impact even more. We are also committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our produc- tion. We set six Group Sustainability Goals in 2016, two of which related to climate change:
– Reducing carbon emission intensity from production facilities by 20% in 2030.
– Improving energy efficiency within own (non­renovated) offices by 75% in 2030.
In 2017, we translated our carbon emission goal into individual goals at each manufacturing facility and established a robust system for monitoring progress on these goals.
Concerning improving energy efficiency within our own (non­renovated) offices, we are continu- ing our efforts to meet the established goals.
Environment
Technical insulation
Carbon emissions from raw materials and production
      In 2017, we issued a revised Safety, Health, Envi- ronmental (SHE) Policy. The policy confirms our strong determination to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, set targets for select- ed parameters, have effective SHE management systems, apply risk assessments, engage with stakeholders and maintain an open dialogue.
We carried out eight Group SHE audits at our manufacturing facilities in 2017. We included our remaining non-stone wool producing plants, i.e. our grid manufacturing sites and our render and paint producing sites.
We have a Group Sustainability Goal to reduce our relative consumption of water by 20% by 2030, compared to 2015. Our relaxed internal demands for payback times for investments related to our sustainability goals is particularly relevant for fulfill- ing this goal. In 2017 the goal was translated into plans at the level of each manufacturing facility.
4,000

Ecofys, a Navigant company, developed methodologies to calculate the CO2 savings in the lifetime of sold building insulation and technical insulation products. Ecofys endorsed that the 2017 CO2 savings calculated by ROCKWOOL correctly follow these methodologies. The methodologies are available on www.rockwoolgroup.com.

We have a Group Sustainability Goal to reduce waste to landfill by 85% in 2030. In 2017, plans were made at the level of the manufacturing facility and implementation began. We installed briquette equipment in one of our manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, enabling closed-loop reuse of waste from production, which will be fully oper- ational in 2018.
We also have a Group Sustainability Goal to offer recycling services in 30 countries by 2030. We currently offer established recycling services in five countries. In 2017 we developed a roadmap to meet the Group goal for the remaining 25 countries by 2030.
Safety
ROCKWOOL Group’s approach to health and safety is described in the Code of Conduct and the updated Safety, Health, Environmental Policy. We have zero tolerance when it comes to anything that could potentially jeopardise the health and safety of our employees and others working at our sites and in transit. Safety as measured by a Lost Time Incident (LTI) rate is one of the six Group Sustainability Goals we formulated in 2016.
We rolled out a new IT tool (RockSHE) concerning safety beyond our manufacturing facilities, for ex- ample in offices and during travel. We are now able to monitor and share good catches, near misses, incidents and risk/job safety assessments together with corrective actions across the whole Group.
Every year we run safety awareness activities called RockSAFE and in 2017 we held the second Group-wide Global Safety Day. Other safety activ- ities during 2017 included Group fire audits at 18 ROCKWOOL locations.
In 2017 we had zero fatalities, but regrettably three serious incidents – two in Poland and one in China. All serious incidents concerned con- tractors working at our premises. Investigations and subsequent detailed reports resulted in the implementation of corrective actions.
People
We have global policies related to providing equal opportunities, promoting diversity and working against all kinds of discrimination.
As an example, we apply and constantly develop recruitment practices and processes so they are free of bias and discrimination. In 2017, we updated our Compensation & Benefits and Recruitment policies and published new policies concerning the employ- ment of relatives and hiring of interns and students.
In 2017 we started implementing a workplace learning concept to broaden our reach and impact on people development activities. To support this, we started implementing a digital cloud-based learning platform called RockWise.
We continue our positive trend of high engage- ment in our annual RockPulse employee survey. The 2017 survey was completed with a high par- ticipation rate of 87% of white-collar employees and 77% of blue-collar employees.
Among numerous topics, the survey asks employees about their perceptions on how the company is behaving in terms of sustainability and integrity
as well as their day-to-day experiences regarding career opportunities, safe working conditions, fair pay, and leadership. Relative to a High-Performance Norm benchmark, employees rate ROCKWOOL very highly on “sustainable engagement” and “trust and empowerment”. Overall results show a slightly positive trend relative to last year.
Women in management
It is our ambition to continuously increase diversity in our management teams as well as our Group functions. In 2013, we established a goal to have 15-30% women in our management teams by 2017. Our talent and succession man- agement process supports both cross-cultural and cross-functional diversity through increased visibility and focus on talent development. We have published our diversity ambition on our ROCKWOOL Group website www.rockwool- group.com. Management is accountable for our diversity goals, and reporting on progress helps drive a positive development.
Our industry has traditionally been male dominated and the gender split for the total Group has been very stable at an 18/82 female/male split over the past few years. The trend is however now positive for the management teams with a three percentage point increase of women to 18% in 2017 (15% in

2016). We are very pleased about the positive trend and outlook for the future; of all line managers hired during 2017 into our office environment, 34% were female (31% in 2016). We will continue focusing on increasing diversity as we firmly believe that bring- ing different experiences, perspectives and cultures together will benefit our business.
Our current Board of Directors is composed of a highly­qualified group of leaders with complemen- tary experience and expertise, and relatively short seniority in their current positions. With regards to female members elected to the Board of Directors by the General Assembly, a new target was set in 2017 to have at least one member by end 2020. The selection of two new members of the Board of Directors during 2017 included diversity considera- tions, where gender was a part, as was the assess- ment for the overall composition of the Board.
Within the Group, also ROCKWOOL A/S, in Den- mark, has set a target for its Board of Directors. The target is to have one woman on the Board of Directors by 2020. Currently, the Board of Direc- tors has only male members.
Business ethics
In 2017, the Group’s Integrity Committee intro- duced a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct confirms ROCKWOOL Group’s commitment to the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles. At the same time, the Code of Conduct serves as a compass in guiding individuals and the organisa- tion to achieve our long-term business goals.
As part of the onboarding process in the Group, new employees participate in an introduction course, which includes training in business ethics.
Anti-corruption
The purpose of our anti-corruption policy is to cre- ate awareness and avoid instances of corruption, bribery and facilitation payments in our organisa- tion and value chain. The anti-corruption policy is based on the requirements in the UK Bribery Act. It is also available to suppliers, customers and other third parties on the Group’s website.
Our whistle-blower policy outlines the procedure for handling integrity cases, including corruption and bribery. ROCKWOOL Group’s whistle-blower
policy requires employees to report any suspicion of non-compliance to Management, to the Integri- ty Officer or via the whistle­blower procedure.
Compared to previous years, we investigated an in- creased number of integrity cases in 2017 concern- ing bribery. We investigated 12 integrity incidents, nine of which were reported and investigated as
a result of whistle-blowing. Eight of these led to corrective action. We attribute the higher numbers to increased awareness of business ethics among employees and we evaluate this as a good result.
The Audit Committee is informed about all integri- ty cases and we communicate broadly about these to create awareness of unethical behaviour in the Group and to underline our zero-tolerance policy.
Human rights
We oppose any kind of discrimination due to age, gender, race, colour, religion, political opinion, social origin, or any other human rights aspects. Any incident of discrimination must be reported to Man- agement. Another right we take seriously is the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. We are opposed to child labour and do not use forced or compulsory labour or knowingly engage with business partners that do so.
In 2017, we worked to enforce these policies through the dissemination of the Code of Conduct in relation to employees and suppliers.
Also in 2017, we published an annual statement pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act. The statement describes the company’s supply chain and explains what initiatives we take to avoid modern slavery.
Sustainable sourcing
The Supplier Code of Conduct is designed to explain our expectations to our suppliers in detail. ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to comply with all international, national and local laws and guidelines relating to employment, environmen- tal and manufacturing practices as well as ethics and bribery, particularly in relation to purchasing. ROCKWOOL Group expects suppliers to enforce these guidelines towards their suppliers. The ROCKWOOL Procurement & Purchasing Manual was updated in 2017 to reflect a new approach to supplier due diligence, selection and contracting,

 which is now done through an online tool. In 2017, we continued the implementation of this tool, and all suppliers are required to agree with our Supplier Code of Conduct as a pre­requisite to be qualified as a supplier to ROCKWOOL Group. Exceptions occur in the case of ad-hoc vendors for indirect materials and services.
A cross­functional project team carried out a gap analysis of sustainable sourcing policies and prac- tices in 2017. This led to the development of a new supplier due diligence process with a more com- prehensive and systematic approach to sustainable sourcing, which we will start implementing in 2018. Six suppliers were selected for external, third-party sustainability audits in 2017. These audits will be carried out in 2018 and the results will help cali- brate the new supplier due diligence process.
During 2017, we also implemented our REACH man- agement system for substances of very high concern. This means all direct suppliers are now required to report on REACH compliance in order to register.
Required reporting referring to the Danish Finan- cial Statement Act §99a and §99b can be found on page 2, page 12 and pages 28-35.
ROCKWOOL Group publishes a Group Sustain- ability Report in May 2018 that provides detailed information on the Group’s sustainability perfor- mance. The Sustainability Report serves as ROCKWOOL Group’s Communication on pro- gress as required by the UN Global Compact and will be available on the sustainability website www.rockwoolgroup.com/sustainability.

Risk management
Systems and processes
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensur- ing that the Group’s risk exposure is consistent with the targeted risk profile and evaluates that appropriate awareness and management process- es are in place. Risk Management is part of the Chief Financial Officer’s area of responsibility, and includes providing regular updates to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. All managing directors of our subsidiaries and Group functional heads must ensure that a risk review within their areas of responsibility is conducted at least once a year; that risks are discussed, described, scored for severity and likelihood, and quantified in terms, such as predicted financial impact.
Appropriate mitigating actions for identified risks are proposed by the company or Group function and studiously evaluated to ensure effective risk management at Group level.
The Group has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee, consisting of members from both business segment and Group functions.
The committee is responsible for reviewing and updating the internal risk management framework and for implementing related processes.
With these systems and processes, the risks within the Group are identified and mitigated, however still not eliminated but with a residual risk at an acceptable level.
Risks
IT security
Like all other companies, ROCKWOOL Group is exposed to potential breaches of our IT infrastruc- ture. With increased digitalisation of business processes, the Group is vulnerable to disruptions of operations and is increasingly engaged in the protection of data and intellectual property. IT security has a high priority within the Group and one of the objectives for IT security is to prevent
digital theft of intellectual property (know-how, recipes, and product details), limit and quickly rectify operational disruptions, and to protect employee information from digital theft or misuse.
Another focus is protecting our sales and anyone dependent on our products against product­flow disruptions. Also high on the IT security agenda is the protection of consumers against misinforma- tion or misuse of ROCKWOOL brands.
Finally, we strive to safeguard shareholders against value-destroying cyber-attacks on ROCK- WOOL brands and products or on ROCKWOOL Group’s and its partners’ value-delivery systems.
Group IT focuses on mitigating risks based on our own assessments as well as external IT auditors’ findings. Part of this mitigation includes height- ening IT security, testing disaster-recovery plans at our manufacturing facilities and improving data­flow and network activity monitoring.
Competition law compliance
Guided by our ethical values, ROCKWOOL Group competes in a fair manner on prices, quality, cus- tomer service, innovative products and more. The Group is committed to complying with national and international competition and antitrust laws.
A variety of measures are continuously provided to relevant employees to equip them with sufficient knowledge to make business decisions in accord- ance with applicable competition and antitrust laws as well as internal policies. Our regular compliance programme includes a competition law compliance manual, accompanied by specific guidelines for se- lected business areas, interactive training seminars, plus a selected review of documents and interview sessions in legal entities in ROCKWOOL Group. Group Legal Affairs personnel are also readily available to handle support requests. Furthermore, an e-learning programme, with a dedicated content section including training and guidance on com- pliance with competition and antitrust laws, will be launched and rolled out across the Group in 2018.

Corporate governance
Corporate governance at ROCKWOOL Group regulates the interplay among shareholders, the Board of Directors and Group Management, with the aim to ensure optimal operational perfor- mance while at the same time securing an appro- priate level of accountability and transparency of our business practices.
Organisation
The supervision and management of ROCKWOOL Group is divided among the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of shareholders, the Board of Directors (with well­defined committees), and Group Management.
The Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting is the supreme body of the corporate governance structure and elects the Board of Directors as well as inde- pendent auditors. The company is not aware of shareholder agreements containing pre-emption rights or restrictions on voting rights. There is
an agreement among members of the founding Kähler family to meet regularly to discuss their interests in the company, including items at AGMs, but there is no requirement for them
to vote jointly.
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors outlines the overall pur- pose and strategy of the company and ensures that the business development is on track toward agreed short­ and long­term goals. The majority of the members of the Board of Directors are non-executive members in accordance with the Danish Companies Act.
The Board of Directors today consists of nine members. Six are elected by shareholders at AGMs for a period of one year and may be re-elected. Of these, four members, including the chairman, are deemed independent, accord- ing to the Danish Recommendations on Corpo- rate Governance. Three members are elected
by employees, for a period of four years, pur- suant to the Danish Companies Act. Election coming up in 2018.
Group Management
The CEO is, together with his Group Management team, responsible for the day-to-day manage- ment, the execution of the strategy and timely reporting to the Board of Directors. The team currently consists of nine executives of which the CEO and CFO are the registered directors with the Danish Business Authority.
Board Chairmanship and Committees
Three substructures have been established by the Board of Directors.
The Chairmanship
The Board of Directors has established a Chair- manship consisting of the Chairman and the two Deputy Chairmen. They prepare the Board meet- ings and furthermore undertake a number of the functions of a nomination committee.
Audit Committee
The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee consisting of three members. The majority of its members are independent. The Audit Committee monitors accounting and audit policies plus conditions which, if determined by the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee, should be subject to thorough evaluation. Further, the Audit Committee evaluates internal control and risk systems.
Remuneration Committee
The Board of Directors has appointed a Remuner- ation Committee consisting of three of its mem- bers. The majority of its members are independ- ent. With the overall goal of being able to attract and retain high-performing top executives, the Remuneration Committee prepares the Remuner- ation Policy and Incentive Guidelines, which are approved by the shareholders at the AGM.

The Remuneration Committee annually evaluates and brings forward recommendations for the re- muneration of the Board of Directors, again subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM.
The Remuneration Committee is authorised by the Board of Directors to approve remuneration for senior executives.
Internal control
Control environment
ROCKWOOL Group considers strong internal control to be an essential management tool. The
control environment in ROCKWOOL Group is based on clear guidelines and accountability and a constant effort to strengthen the control environ- ment with due consideration of materiality and risk.
The entire Group structure is designed as a sim- ple structure based on the Group’s commercial activities with a clear segregation of management responsibilities.
All Group policies are approved by Group Management and assigned to one Group Man- agement member who has the responsibility to

ensure implementation and compliance of the policy. Policies and manuals have been adopted within all essential areas of operation, legal com- pliance and financial reporting.
Control activities
Minimum requirements of internal controls are stipulated in ROCKWOOL’s Group Standards, based on the risks identified. The control activities include procedures for authorisation, approval, reconciliation and separation of functions. The control system includes both manual and auto- mated controls.
The local management teams are responsible for ensuring that the control environment in each local entity is sufficient to meet local and Group requirements.
Information and communication
ROCKWOOL Group has established standardised information and reporting systems to identify, collect and communicate relevant information, reports, etc. on an ongoing basis and on all levels to facilitate an effective, reliable workflow. In ad- dition, an in-depth business review is performed each quarter with participation of relevant mem- bers of Group Management.
Exceptions
To a broad extent, the company is following the Committee for Corporate Governance’s recom- mendations, except for the following four sub- recommendations, where the company concludes that its present set-up is more appropriate:
3.1.2
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the selection and nomination of candidates for the Board of Directors be carried out through a thoroughly transparent process approved by the overall Board of Directors.
The Group’s position on risk management and changes in the reporting requirements is regularly communicated at financial meetings for the local finance directors, through the Group intranet and dialogue.
Monitoring
The internal control systems in relation to the presentation of financial statements are moni- tored at various levels e.g. monthly reports to Group Management on segments and markets and by regular control visits to the local entities. In addition, the Group’s Integrity Committee
ROCKWOOL Group Annual report 2017

consisting of the CEO, CFO, a member of Group Management and the Group General Counsel, monitor integrity compliance and launch ap- propriate new initiatives to constantly improve compliance. The Integrity Committee further- more reports on integrity issues to the Audit Committee.
Recommendations
As a Danish listed company, we are guided by the recommendations issued by the Danish Commit- tee on Corporate Governance. The company is generally in compliance with such recommenda- tions but has, in four cases, chosen to differ as described below. The variations are generally due to company­specific views on the requirements to optimise value for its shareholders.
ROCKWOOL Group publishes its statutory report on Corporate Governance for the financial year 2017 cf. the Danish Financial Statements Act §107b on the company’s website, including a detailed description of the Board of Directors’ consideration regarding all the recommendations. The statutory report on Corporate Governance can be found at www.rockwoolgroup.com/about- us/corporate-governance.

Explanation
The Board of Directors has authorised the chair- manship to nominate qualified candidates to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will then evaluate the candidates before it recommends them for election at the Annual General Meeting.
3.3.2
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the management report includes the following information about the number of shares, options, warrants and similar in the company, and other Group companies, owned by the member, as well as changes in the portfolio of the member of the securities mentioned which have occurred during the financial year.
Explanation
The company considers the portfolio, and changes in the portfolio during the financial year, of shares, options warrants and similar in the company of each member of the Board of Directors to be a private matter, and it is the company’s judgment that disclosure of such information will not add additional value for shareholders and other stake- holders.
3.4.6
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the Board of Di- rectors establish a nomination committee chaired by the chairman of the Board of Directors.
Explanation
The Board of Directors has not established a nomination committee. Instead, the chairmanship performs duties recommended concerning the candidates for the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors selects candidates to the positions as CEO and other Registered Directors based on their qualifications.
4.2.3
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the total remu- neration granted to each member of the Board of Directors and the Management by the company and other companies in the Group, including information on the most important contents of retention and retirement/resignation schemes, be disclosed in the annual report and that the linkage with the remuneration policy be explained.
Explanation
The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and committees is available on the company’s website.
The remuneration of each member of the Group Management is seen to be a private matter and it is the company’s judgment that disclosure of the remuneration paid to each individual member of the Group Management will not add additional value for shareholders and other stakeholders.

Overview Global market review/outlook Business updates Financial performance Financial statements
Financial performance
Strong sales development with organic growth of 7.1% and solid profitability with an EBIT margin of 10.8% driven by productivity and pricing improvements.
Acquisition of Flumroc AG
The acquisition of the majority shareholding in Flumroc AG was closed on the 17 November 2017 increasing ownership to 97.6% from 43.5%. In 2017, the result for Flumroc contributed EUR 11 million in net sales and EUR -0.2 million in EBIT including depreciation on the purchase price allocation. The remaining shares were acquired
in January 2018.
Flumroc employs approx. 230 full time employees mainly in Switzerland. All activities are included un- der the Insulation segment and geographically in Western Europe. The integration is expected to be smooth as the cooperation between ROCKWOOL and Flumroc has been close for many years.
Group performance
Net sales reached EUR 2,374 million, a growth
of 7.1% in local currencies, excluding the impact from Flumroc, with good performance in Q4, in line with the latest announced expectations. For the year, there was a positive currency impact
of 0.2%-points, bringing sales growth to 7.3% in reported figures excluding Flumroc. The inclusion of net sales from nearly two months of operations from Flumroc impacted the Group’s full-year sales growth by 0.5%-points, resulting in a combined growth of 7.8% for the year in reported figures.
The positive development in net sales was due to good growth in volume in several main markets as well as increases in sales prices. The increase in sales came mainly from an acceleration of growth for the Insulation segment with full year growth at 8.6% in local currencies (7.9% excluding Flumroc), while the Systems segment increased 4.7% in local currencies for the full year.
Compared to the outlook announced in February 2017, sales growth increased more than expected as a result of favourable market conditions.
Sales prices continued to increase especially to- wards the second half of the year which also saw overall improved efficiency in operations. Com- bined, this more than counterbalanced the nega- tive impact from input costs in the second half of the year, subsequently improving the contribution margin. In total, the contribution margin remains below last year due to the time lag in realising the impact from sales price increases.
Regional sales development
Sales in Western Europe improved by 7.5% in lo- cal currencies (6.6% excluding Flumroc) and 6.9% in reported figures. We achieved growth in the most significant markets, where especially France, Germany and UK performed well.
Sales in Eastern Europe increased by 10.7% in local currencies and by 16.5% in reported figures, where Poland, among other markets, continued to deliver strong sales performance. Russia also delivered strong Q4 growth.
In the rest of the world, net sales grew by 5.5% in local currencies with a significant currency impact in Q4, while reported growth was 4.0%. U.S. sales saw double-digit growth and sales in Canada also performed well. Sales in South East Asia were troubled by a subdued market and a decrease in the project portfolio.
Group profitability
EBITDA increased 7% to EUR 417 million with an EBITDA margin of 17.6%, almost on level with last year, which ended at 17.7%.

    Operational efficiency significantly improved
in 2017 as we leveraged costs from our healthy growth and a continued prioritisation of activities during the year. This entailed a focus on driving efficiency, while still investing in new competen- cies and growth initiatives, which helped to deliv- er satisfactory profitability for the Group. During Q4 the Group incurred additional costs related to restructuring in Rockfon and ROCKWOOL in South East Asia of around EUR 5 million.
EBIT improved significantly and totalled EUR 258 million, resulting in an EBIT margin of 10.8% with no significant impact from Flumroc. This is in line with the latest announced expectation for the year. Depreciations for the year amounted to EUR 160 million, similar to last year, however they in- cluded a net impairment charge of EUR 1.1 million
and depreciations from our new Rockfon produc- tion facility in the United States.
Compared to the outlook announced in February 2017, EBIT margin ended better as increased sales and strong factory performance overcame higher input costs.
Net financial costs amounted to EUR 11 million, up EUR 4 million compared to last year. The increase is mainly related to a fair value adjust- ment of phantom shares, while the exchange rate impact remained at a similar level as last year.
During the year, the level of borrowing and inter- est costs remained low as the Group stayed cash positive.

Financial performance Financial statements
A fair value gain on the shareholding in Flumroc was recognised at EUR 25 million in the line Income from investments in associated companies.
Tax for the year amounted to EUR 62 million compared to EUR 58 million in 2016. The effec- tive tax rate decreased to 22.4% due to a fair value adjustment of the shareholding in Flumroc and a decreasing trend of corporate taxes in some countries.
Profit after tax for the Group totalled EUR 214 million, including a fair value gain from Flumroc, a significant improvement from 2016 (EUR 166 million) and is considered a satisfactory result for the year.
Profit after tax in the parent company totalled EUR 125 million, an increase of EUR 16 million primarily due to higher royalty and dividend received.
Cash flow and investments
At the end of 2017, the Group was net cash posi- tive, amounting to EUR 241 million, even after the acquisition of Flumroc AG. The Group had unused committed credit facilities of EUR 430 million by year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities was EUR 332 million for 2017 against EUR 326 million for 2016, a

small increase. The cash flow was positively impact- ed by high operating profit, but higher working capital consumed more cash than the year before because of growth in the business.
Net working capital was EUR 190 million com- pared to EUR 175 million in 2016. The increase mainly stems from higher trade receivables and a planned higher inventory to ease the pressure on capacity of certain production equipment. The working capital ratio to net sales was 8.0% in 2017, stable compared to 2016.
Investments reached EUR 130 million exclud-
ing acquisitions, which is an increase of EUR 41 million compared to last year. For the acquisition
of Flumroc a consideration of EUR 83 million was paid against cash acquired of EUR 48 million - a net impact of EUR 35 million. The largest individual in- vestments in 2017 related to the new U.S. Rockfon production facility, the building of a new factory
in Romania, the factory re­engineering project in Poland and several new digital investments, includ- ing the new web-environment for the Group and several business segments.
Free cash flow amounted to EUR 167 million against EUR 237 million for 2016 – a decrease of EUR 70 million primarily due to the acquisition of Flumroc and higher investments.

Invested capital
Return on invested capital improved significant- ly in 2017, mainly due to improved profitability, reaching 17.9% compared to 15.8% in 2016. Invested capital amounted to EUR 1,452 million against EUR 1,433 million last year.
At the end of 2017, total assets were EUR 2,164 million, an increase compared to 2016 mainly due to the increased cash level and the consolidation of assets from Flumroc.
Equity
Equity of the Group totalled EUR 1,685 million as of 31 December 2017 compared to EUR 1,536 mil- lion last year, corresponding to an equity ratio of 78% compared to 77% in 2016. Equity was mainly affected by the profit for the year, dividend and exchange rate adjustments.
Business segments
Sales in the Insulation segment reached EUR 1,782 million, which is an increase of 8.6% in local currencies and 9.1% in reported currencies. Net sales from Flumroc during 2017 had a positive impact of EUR 11.1 million or 0.7%-points on the Insulation segment. The increase was mainly from the flat roof segment and building insulation seg- ment in Western and Eastern Europe.
The Insulation segment’s EBIT reached EUR 184 million with an EBIT margin of 9.2%, an increase of 1.3%-points compared to last year. Especially North America, UK and central Europe showed a higher earnings level benefitting from growth in the underlying market, improved pricing manage- ment and factory productivity improvements.
The Systems segment’s sales amounted to EUR 592 million, which is an increase of 4.7% in local currencies and 4.2% in reported figures. Rockfon in Asia did not perform well during the year and a refocussing of its activities and organisation is underway, which is expected to restore Rockfon’s growth in the region during the coming quarters. The other Systems segment businesses experi- enced healthy growth.

 The System segment’s EBIT reached EUR 74 million, a decrease of 9% from EUR 81 million last year. Earnings from Rockfon were affected neg- atively by the disruption in Asia. A restructuring cost of EUR 4 million, mainly covering redundan- cy costs and write-down of tangible assets and inventory, was included to address the required improvements in the Rockfon Asia business. Also, Rockfon North America was, as planned, affected by high start-up costs in the new U.S. production facility and higher input costs, especially for steel.

            During Q4, we increased the ownership in Flumroc from 43.5% to 97.6% through an acquisition effective from 17 November 2017. The financial statement during Q4, as well as full year, is impacted by the consolidation of Flumroc. The results for Flumroc included in the Q4 results amounted to EUR 11 million in net sales and EUR -0.2 million in EBIT including depreciation on the purchase price allocation.
Global sales development
Net sales in the fourth quarter reached EUR 644 million, a growth of 10.3% in local currencies excluding the impact from Flumroc and a growth in reported figures at 10.6% including a negative currency impact of 1.6%-points and 1.9%-points impact from
the Flumroc net sales. The negative currency impact is mainly derived from a weaker USD.
Increase in sales prices had a positive impact on growth during the quarter and the general positive market development allowed for strong growth in several of our key markets.

Dividend is included as a liability at the time of adoption by the Annual General Meeting. Dividend that is expected to be paid for the year is shown separately in the equity.
Sale and purchase of, as well as dividends on own shares are recognised under retained earnings in the equity. The reserve for foreign currency translation consists of exchange rate differences that occur when translating the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements from their functional currency into EUR.
Hedging adjustments comprise changes in the fair value of hedging transactions that qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges and where the hedged transaction has not yet been realised.
Group
Attributable to shareholders of ROCKWOOL International A/S
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests are recognised at the minority’s share of the net assets. The difference between the costs and the non-controlling interests’ share of the total carrying amount including goodwill is transferred from the minority interests’ share of the equity to the equity belonging to the shareholders of ROCKWOOL International A/S.
Reserve for development costs
In compliance with the Danish Financial Statements Act from 1 January 2016 an amount equal to the years capitalised develop- ment projects is reserved in equity of the Parent Company. The reserved amount must be dissolved in line with the deprecia- tion of the corresponding development project. The dissolved amount is moved to retained earnings.

                  ROCKWOOL Group operates in two business segments based on products: Insulation segment and Systems segment. The information is based on the management structure and internal management reporting to Group Management and constitutes the reportable segments.
Headquarters costs are allocated to the business segments based on allocation keys used in the internal management re- porting. These allocation keys are reassessed annually based on planned activity in the segments. Intangible and tangible assets and related amortisation/depreciation are not fully allocated to business segments as all stone wool production is done in the Insulation segment. Financial income and expenses, and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments.
Internal net sales from the Insulation segment to the Systems segment are at arms’ length prices. The Insulation segment includes among others interior building insulation, facade insu- lation, roof insulation and industrial and technical insulation. The Systems segment includes acoustic ceilings, cladding boards, engineered fibres, noise and vibration control, and horticultural substrates.
A write-down of assets in HECK Wall Systems and a reversal of the write-down in Asia from previous years is recognised in the Insulation Segment. For additional information please refer to note 2.5.

An equity-based share option programme has been established, which is offered to Management and senior managers. The share option programme is not part of the ordinary remuneration, as the Board of Directors of ROCKWOOL International A/S will, from time to time, decide whether share options are to be offered.
On issuing of share options, the value of the allotted options is estimated in compliance with the formula of Black & Scholes at the time of allotment and is expensed under staff costs over the expected life of the option. The amount charged is set off against equity.

2.1 Intangible assets
Accounting policies
The costs of research activities are carried as expenditure in the year in which they are incurred. The costs of development pro- jects which are clearly defined and identifiable, and of which the potential technical and commercial exploitation is demonstrated, are capitalised to the extent that they are expected to generate future revenue. Other development costs are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement under operating costs.
Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and write-downs.
Amortisation of the following intangible assets is made on a straight- line basis over the expected future lifetime of the assets, which is:
Development projects: 2-10 years Patents: up to 20 years
Software: 2-4 years
Trademarks: up to 20 years Customer relationships: 10-15 years
Uncertainties, estimates and assumptions
The expected lifetime for intangible assets is determined based on past experience and expectations for future use of the assets. Especially the expected lifetime of customer relationships is linked to uncertainty due to the unknown retention of customers
Goodwill arisen from acquisition of enterprises and activities are stated at cost. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units at the acquisition date. Identification of cash-generating units is based on the management structure and internal financial control. Acquired CO2 rights are capitalised under intangible assets. Granted CO2 rights are not capitalised.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and the book value of other assets is reviewed on indications of impairment. When testing for impairment, the value is written down to the estimat- ed net sales price or the value in use, if greater.
Intangible assets under construction are also tested for impair- ment annually.
From 1 January 2016 an amount equal to the year's capitalised development costs is to be reserved in equity of the parent company. Please refer to the Statement of changes in equity on page 61-62.
in the future. Reassessments of the expected future lifetime are also made in connection with changes in production structures. Please also refer to note 2.5 regarding impairment tests.

       Goodwill is allocated to the Insulation segment at an amount of EUR 34.3 million (2016: EUR 27.1 million) and to the Systems seg- ment at an amount of EUR 53.6 million (2016: EUR 61.0 million).
Goodwill has been impairment tested in 2017 and 2016 for
the identified cash-generating units, which for 2017 has led to write-downs of EUR 6.1 million (2016: EUR 0.0 million), of which EUR 5.9 million relates to HECK Wall Systems in the Insulation segment.
The impairment test of goodwill is based on current and future results for the CGUs to where the results are allocated. Most of the goodwill in the Group is related to the acquisition of Flumroc in 2017, Chicago Metallic in 2013 and CSR in 2010 and this part of the Group is performing according to plan.
Please refer to note 2.5 for further details.
The net book value of other intangible assets includes devel- opment projects amounting to EUR 3.9 million (2016: EUR 5.2 million) and brands amounting to EUR 8.3 million (2016: EUR 5.7 million).

2.2 Tangible assets
Accounting policies
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of technical plant and machin- ery manufactured by the Group comprises the acquisition cost, expenditure directly related to the acquisition, engineering hours, including indirect production costs and borrowing costs.
Financial leased assets are recognised in the balance sheet at market value at the date of acquisition, and are written off at depreciation rates equivalent to those for the same category of owned assets.
Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis, based on current assessment of their useful lives and scrap value.
Uncertainties, estimates and assumptions
The expected lifetime for tangible assets is determined based
on past experience and expectations for future use of the assets. Especially the estimated lifetime of plant and machinery is linked to uncertainty due to varying utilisation and the significant amount of maintenance costs. Reassessments of the expected future lifetime are also made in connection with changes in production structures.
When there is an indication of a reduction in the profitability of an asset an impairment test is performed for the assets in ques- tion and write-downs are made if necessary.
The expected lifetimes are:
Buildings: 20-40 years
Operating equipment and fixture and fittings: 3-10 years Technical plant and machinery: 5-15 years
On sale or scrapping of assets, any losses or gains are included under other operating income for the year.
Investment grants are recognised as income in step with the depreciation against the equivalent tangible assets. Investment grants not yet recognised as income are set off against the assets to which the grant is related.
The recoverable amounts of the assets and cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates as they are based on budgets, business plans and projections for 5 years and take into account previous experience and represent Man- agement’s best estimate of future developments. Key param- eters are growth in sales margin, future investments, working capital, discount rate and future growth expectations. Please refer to note 2.5.

Management has performed the yearly impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill. In addition, impairment test of other assets has also been made, where indication of reduction of value was found. In the impairment test, the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the discounted value of the future cash flows. The assessment of future cash flows is typically based on 5-year management reviewed budgets and business plans, where the last year is used as a normalised terminal year. Net sales, raw material prices, future investments, working capital, discount rate and future growth assumptions constitute the most material parameters in the calculation.
The average growth rate in the terminal period has been set to 0.5% similar to last year. Growth in sales is estimated to be between 0-13% depending on the businesses.
The high growth rates are used in countries where we historically have seen steep increases after a slow period. Gross margins
are based on average values the last 3 years and adjusted over the budget period for efficiency improvements and expected raw material inflation based on past actual price movements
and future market conditions. Future investment is derived from the historic investment level to secure a smooth operation of

2017
HECK Wall Systems is a German producer of wall systems for fa- cade renovation acquired 1 January 2014. Due to difficult market conditions, HECK Wall Systems has not performed as expected which has resulted in a low result for the year. The impairment test based on updated market outlook has resulted in a write- down of EUR 5.9 million related to goodwill. The net present val- ue of HECK Wall Systems amounts to EUR 32.1 million. The key assumptions used is volume growth depending on the market conditions and the conversion to stone wool.
On the other hand, the Chinese business has successfully turned around in 2017 overcoming the problems with a slowing economy and overcapacity in the market. The remaining write- down from 2015 excluding goodwill of EUR 5.0 million has been reversed. The WACC applied for this calculation in China was 11.7% were the WACC applied in 2015 was 11.3%.

2.5 Impairment tests (continued)
2016
The impairment tests for 2016 have not shown a need for write- downs nor reversals of the write-downs recognised previous years.
Sensitivity analysis
As part of the preparation of impairment tests, sensitivity analy- ses are prepared on the basis of relevant risk factors and scenar- ios that management can determine within reasonable reliability. Sensitivity analyses are prepared by altering the estimates with a range of probable outcomes.
2017
The sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other things being equal; an increase in the discount rate of 1%, a decrease in the growth rate of 1% p.a. and an increase of input costs of 1% p.a. The write-down in HECK Wall Systems would have been EUR 3-5 million higher if the discount rate was to increase 1% or the growth was 1% lower.
Furthermore, if the growth rate in the budget period was to decrease by 1.0% p.a. in the Indian business an additional write-down of EUR 2-3 million would be needed. The business is monitored closely to see if the performance is in line with the plan. Otherwise corrective actions will be made to secure improved profitability.
2.6 Pension obligations
Accounting policies
Pension payments concerning defined contribution plans are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement.
Defined benefit plans are stated at the net present value at the balance sheet date and included in the consolidated financial statements. Adjustments of the plans are carried out on a regular basis in accordance with underlying actuarial assessments. Actu- arial gains or losses for defined benefit plans are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income. The actuarial assessment is carried out every year.
Uncertainties, estimates and assumptions
The present value of defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Any changes to

We consider the chosen scenarios as the most realistic why none of the impairment tests have given rise to adjustment of the value.
2016
The sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other things be- ing equal; an increase in the discount rate of 1%, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5% p.a. and an increase of input costs of 1% p.a.
The impairment test of goodwill in HECK Wall Systems shows only small headroom. If the discount rate was to increase 1%, there would be a need for write-down amounting to EUR 1.7 million. Furthermore, if the growth rate was to decrease by 0.5% p.a. a write-down of EUR 1.6 million would be needed. The busi- ness is monitored closely to see if the performance is in line with the plan. Otherwise corrective actions will be made to secure improved profitability.
The performance of the factories that were written down in
2015 is following the expected development, and therefore no adjustments are made. We consider the chosen scenarios as the most realistic, why none of the impairment tests have given rise to adjustment of the value.
Funded benefit plans have assets placed in trustee-administered pension funds, which are governed by local regulations and practice in each country. The payments to the pension funds are based on the usual actuarial assessments and are recognised in the income statement after maturity. Provided that the actuar-
ial assessments of pension obligations show noticeable excess solvency or insolvency in relation to the pension fund’s assets, the difference is entered to the balance sheet and the future pay- ments are adjusted accordingly. With regard to these schemes, the actuarial assessment is also carried out every year.
these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The discount rate and other key assumptions are based in part on the current market conditions.

An additional defined benefit plan has been added to the Group with the acquisition of Flumroc AG in Switzerland.
A number of the Group’s employees and former employees par- ticipate in pension schemes. The pension schemes are primarily defined contribution plans. In Belgium, Switzerland, UK and a small number of employees in Norway and Germany defined benefit plans are used. The plans in UK, Norway and Germany are closed for new entries.
Under a defined benefit plan the Group carries the risk associat- ed with the future development in e.g. interest rates, inflation, salaries, mortality and disability.
Defined benefit plans typically guarantee the employees a retire- ment benefit based on the final salary at retirement.

The pension benefit plans in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium have assets placed in independent pension funds. A number of plans in Germany, Poland, Italy, France and Norway are unfund- ed. For these plans the retirement benefit obligations amount to approximately 21% (2016: 29%) of the total gross liability.
Except for the UK and Swiss plans, the mentioned defined benefit plans are not subject to regulatory requirements regarding mini- mum funding.
The granted pension payments of the mentioned defined benefit plans are based upon the salary of the participating employees during the period of employment. The Group’s contributions
are derived from the split of the pension premium between the employee and employer.

The accumulated value adjustment related to these hedge transactions is transferred from other comprehensive income when the position is realised, and is included in the value of the hedged position e.g. the adjustment follows the cash flow.
For derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify as hedging instruments, changes to the fair value are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.

As a consequence of ROCKWOOL Group’s extensive interna- tional activities the Group’s income statement and equity are subject to a number of financial risks. The Group manages these risks in the following categories:
– Exchange-rate risk – Interest-rate risk
– Liquidity risk
– Credit risk
The Group’s policy is to identify and hedge significant financial risks on an ongoing basis. This is the responsibility of the indi- vidual companies in which financial risks might arise. The parent company continuously monitors the Group’s financial risks in ac- cordance with a framework determined by Group Management.

Exchange-rate risk
As a consequence of the Group’s structure, net sales and ex- penditure in foreign currency are to a significant degree set off against each other, so that the Group is not exposed to major exchange-rate risks.
Commercial exchange-rate risks in the companies which cannot be set off are hedged on a continuous basis, to the extent
that they may significantly affect the results of the individual company in a negative direction, using currency loans, currency deposits and/or financial derivatives. Exchange-rate risks are hedged in the individual companies.
The Group’s net sales and expenditures will be subject to ex- change-rate fluctuations on translation into Euro; however, the risk is assessed to be limited.

Overview Global market review/outlook Business updates Financial performance Financial statements
Notes
4.2 Financial risks and instruments (continued)
A sensitivity analysis is made for the Group’s result and equity based on the underlying currency transactions. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are cash, debt- ors, creditors, non-current and current liabilities and financial investments without taking hedging into consideration. The result of the sensitivity analysis cannot be directly transferred to the fluctuations on translating the financial result and equity of subsidiaries into EUR.
The Group’s result is mostly exposed to USD and CAD. A move- ment of +/- 5%, other things equal, in USD would change the result of around EUR +/- 9-13 million (2016: EUR +/- 4-6 million) and a +/- 10% movement, other things equal, in CAD would give a change in the result of around EUR +/- 4-6 million (2016: EUR +/- 3-5 million).
The Group’s equity is most exposed to USD. A +/- 10% move- ment, other things equal, would result in a change in the equity of around EUR +/- 18-26 million (2016: EUR +/- 4-6 million). A +/- 10% movement in RUB, other things equal, would result in a change in the equity of around EUR +/- 2-3 million (2016: EUR +/- 13-19 million), while a +/- 10% movement in CAD, other things equal, would result in a change in the equity of around EUR +/- 4-6 million (2016: EUR +/- 6-9 million).
The impact on the net sales of the difference between average rate and year-end rate amounts to EUR -25.0 million (2016: EUR 36.3 million) for the 4 largest currencies (USD, RUB, CAD and PLN), which is a change of -1.1% (2016: 1.6%).
Parent company
The Group’s policy is not to hedge exchange rate risks in long- term investments in subsidiaries.
When relevant, external investment loans and Group loans are, as a general rule, established in the local currency of the com- pany involved, while cash at bank and in hand are placed in the local currency.
In the few countries with ineffective financial markets loans can be raised and surplus liquidity placed in DKK, EUR or USD, sub- ject to the approval of the parent company’s finance function.
Most Group loans that are not established in DKK or EUR are hedged in the parent company via forward agreements, currency loans and cash pools or via the SWAP market.
Interest-rate risk
The Group’s interest-rate risk primarily comprises interest-bear- ing debt since the Group does not currently have significant interest-bearing assets of longer duration, however currently the Group does not have any significant interest-bearing debt or as- sets. The Group’s policy is that necessary financing of investments should primarily be affected by raising 5 to 7 year loans at fixed or variable interest rates.
Drawings on credit facilities at variable interest rates generally match the funds, and all Group loans are symmetrical in terms of interest rates. As a consequence, changes in interest rates will not have a significant effect on the result of the Group.
Liquidity risk
The current surplus and deficit liquidity in the Group’s compa- nies is set off, to the extent that this is profitable, via the parent company acting as intra-Group bank and via cash pool systems. When considered appropriate, underlying cash pool systems are established in foreign companies.
To the extent that the financial reserves are of an appropriate size, the parent company also acts as lender to the companies in the Group.
Parent company
In order to ensure financial reserves of an acceptable size, invest- ment loans can be raised on a continuous basis to partly cover new investments and to refinance existing loans. The parent com- pany has guaranteed for some credit facilities and loans. Please refer to note 2.3 for further specification of the loans.
The parent company has issued ownership clauses and/or deed of postponements in connection with intercompany loans. Please refer to note 5.6.
The parent company ensures on an ongoing basis that flexible, unutilised committed credit facilities of an adequate size are es- tablished with major solid banks. The Group’s financial reserves also consist of cash at bank and in hand, and unused overdraft facilities.
Credit risk
As a consequence of the considerable customer spread in terms of geographical location and numbers the credit risk is fundamentally limited. To a minor degree, when considered necessary, insurance or bank guarantees are used to hedge outstanding debtors.
As a consequence of the international diversification of the Group’s activities there are business relations with a number of different banks in Europe, North America and Asia. In order to minimise the credit risk on placement of funds and on entering into agreements on derived financial instruments, only major sound financial institutions are used.
No customer exceeds 10% of the Group’s net sales neither this year nor last year.
Categories of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value are related to foreign exchange rate forward contracts, foreign exchange rate swaps or interest rate swaps all of which have been valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs (level 2). The Group is using no other valuation technique. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions.
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market ob- servable inputs are mainly foreign exchange forward contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot rates. All derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty and the Group’s own non-performance risk.

5.1 Acquisition of subsidiary
Flumroc AG
On 17 November 2017 the acquisition of the majority sharehold- ing in Flumroc AG was closed, increasing the ownership to 97.6% from 43.5%. The remaining 2.4% was acquired in January 2018.
Flumroc is a local Swiss insulation business represented in all regions of the country. The acquisition builds on the productive and successful relationship that has existed between the two com- panies since ROCKWOOL acquired a minority stake in Flumroc’s shares in 1969 as part of a technology licensing agreement. Since then, ROCKWOOL has obtained 43.5 percent of Flumroc's shares.
The total consideration paid was EUR 83.2 million and is recognised in the cash flow statement as investing activities. As a consequence of the full consolidation of the subsidiary Flumroc AG, the cash posi- tion was increased by EUR 47.9 million. Transaction costs amounts to EUR 0.1 million and have been recognised as an expense.
Net assets at fair value amount to EUR 140.2 million. The as- sessment of the fair value of sites and buildings is based on a calculation method also used by external appraisers. The fair value of plant and machinery is based on an internal valuation. The fair value of customer relationships and trademark is based on an earn- ings model with estimates for future cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty payment, etc. The fair value for patents are based on acostapproachandCO2 quotesarevaluedatcurrentvalue.
After recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value, goodwill was recognised with a fair value of EUR 13.6 million. Goodwill represents the value of employees and knowhow and expected synergies from the merger with ROCKWOOL Interna- tional A/S. The goodwill recognised is not tax deductible. The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to EUR 0.8 million where only a limited provision for bad debt has been included. None of the trade receivables have been impaired and it is ex- pected that the full contractual amounts will be settled.
5.2 Tax on profit for the year
Tax policy
We acknowledge that tax practice is an important part of society and equally an important part of responsible corporate citi- zenship. The aim of our tax policy is to reflect and support our business by ensuring a sustainable tax rate, mitigating tax risks and complying with rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
In all tax matters we apply the same values and integrity as in our general Code of Conduct by making sure that our primary focus is the ordinary operation of the Group. We do not adopt tax posi- tions which are not defendable under full disclosure.

For the non-controlling interests the Group has recognised the val- ueatitsproportionalshareoftheacquirednetidentifiableassets.
A gain of EUR 25.2 million has been recognised in the income from investments in associated companies in the income statement as a fair value gain on the shares owned prior to the acquisition.
From the date of acquisition, Flumroc has contributed with EUR 11.1 million of net sales and EUR 0.2 million to the profit after tax of the Group. Had Flumroc been fully owned during 2017 contri- bution to the net sales would have been approx. EUR 70 million, and profit after tax would have increased approx. EUR 2 million.
There were no acquisitions in the year ending 31 December 2016.
We are committed to being a responsible tax payer and avoid ag- gressive tax planning. We have a clear and transparent corporate structure with no contrived entities or structures.
There are many transactions between ROCKWOOL Group com- panies, and the transfer pricing policy for these transactions is driven by the activities undertaken and the value created in each part of our businesses. The key component in our profit allocation is our transfer pricing setup and methods in which we are commit- ted to the principle of paying tax where value is created.

5.2 Tax on profit for the year (continued)
Accounting policies
The parent company is taxed jointly with all Danish subsidiaries. Income subject to joint taxation is fully distributed. Tax on profit for the year, which includes current tax on profit for the year as well as changes to deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement.
In the course of conducting business globally, transfer pricing disputes, etc. with tax authorities may occur, and Management judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such dis-

The most probable outcome is used as the measurement method, and Management believes that the provision made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with local tax authorities is adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and is dependent on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.
Tax on changes in other comprehensive income is recognised directly under other comprehensive income.

5.4 Deferred taxes
Accounting policies
Provisions for deferred tax are calculated on all temporary differ- ences between accounting and taxable values, calculated using the balance-sheet liability method.
Deferred tax provisions are also made to cover the re-taxation of losses in jointly taxed foreign companies previously included in the Danish joint taxation.
Uncertainties, estimates and assumptions
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining provision for uncertain tax positions or the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
A tax asset is recognised if it is assessed that the asset can be utilised in a foreseeable future based on strong indications that

Deferred tax is stated according to current tax regulations. Changes in deferred tax as a consequence of changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement.
sufficient future profits are available to absorb the temporary differences including the Group's future tax planning.
Specific on losses carried forward the expectations are viewed for the coming 3-5 years.

Tax assets not recognised amount to EUR 31.0 million (2016: EUR 46.0 million). The tax assets have not been recognised as they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time and there is no evidence of recoverability in the near future.

5.8 New standards and general accounting policies
The Annual report for ROCKWOOL International A/S has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The fiscal year for the Group is 1 January – 31 December 2017.
The accounting policies are unchanged compared to last year.
New and changed standards and interpretations
The following EU adopted standards and interpretations with relevance for the Group were implemented with effect from 1 January 2017:
– Amendments to IAS 7: Statement of cash flows on disclosure initiative
– Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes on Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
The changed standards and interpretations have not impacted the recognition and measurement and have only led to addition- al information.
New and changed standards and interpretations not yet entered into force
EU adopted standards and amendments issued by IASB with effective date after 31 December 2017 and therefore not imple- mented, comprise:
– IFRS 9: Financial instruments (effective date 1 January 2018)
– IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers (effective date
1 January 2018) – including amendments.
– IFRS 16: Leases (effective date 1 January 2019)
It is assessed that only IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 might have an impact on the recognition and measurements of the Group accounts. The Group has finalised an analysis of the estimated effect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, while only a high-level analysis is made for the effect of IFRS 16.
IFRS 9 "Financial instruments"
The standard introduces several changes to IAS 39 – including a new impairment framework, new rules for hedge accounting and new requirements and guidance on classifications and measure- ment of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has prepared an analysis of the impact from the new standard based on the current financial structure and risk profile. Based on this analysis it is assessed that the standard will have limited effect on the Group accounts.
IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers"
The standard introduces a new framework for revenue recogni- tion and measurement. The Group has prepared an analysis of the impact from the new standard on the revenue from custom- ers. Based on the current types of contracts and products it is estimated that the standard will have no significant impact on the recognition of net sales. Areas like "multi elements agree- ments" and "variable and contingent fees" are assessed to have
no significant impact while the expected future use of extended warranties to customers might have a smaller impact.
In some countries and markets, it is customary to give extended warranties for products and product systems. It has been assessed that 1-1.5% of the Group's net sales is subject to such warranties. The historic risk on warranties has proven to be limited, however, with an expected future increase in the use hereof, a minor provision will be considered going forward.
IFRS 16 "Leasing"
IASB has issued IFRS 16 “Leasing”, with effective date 1 January 2019. Per the new standard all leases must be recognised in the balance sheet with a corresponding lease liability, except for short-term assets and minor assets. Leased assets are amortised over the lease term, and payments are allocated between instal- ments on the lease obligation and interest expense, classified as financial items.
ROCKWOOL has preliminarily assessed the impact of IFRS
16 on the balance sheet. Recognition of leases will affect a number of financial ratios such as EBITDA margin, return on equity and solvency ratio. The change will have a minor impact on EBIT margin as IFRS 16 requires the lease payments to be split between a depreciation charge included in operating costs and an interest expense on lease liabilities included in finance costs.
Furthermore, IASB has issued "Annual improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016)" with effective date 1 January 2017, Amendments to IFRS 2 "Share based payments" with effective date from 1 Jan- uary 2018 and Amendments to IFRS 9 "Financial instruments", Amendments to IAS 28 "Long-term Interests in Associates
and Joint Ventures" and IFRIC 23 "Uncertainty over Income
Tax Treatments" with effective date from 1 January 2019. They currently await EU endorsement. The changes are minor and are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statement.
Group Accounts
The consolidated financial statements comprise ROCKWOOL International A/S and the enterprises in which this company and its subsidiaries hold the majority of the voting rights.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
as a consolidation of the parent company’s and the individual subsidiaries’ financial statements, determined according to the Group’s accounting policies, and with elimination of dividends, internal revenue and expenditure items, internal profits as well as intercompany balances and intercompany shareholdings.
Besides shares, capital investments in subsidiaries include long- term loans to subsidiaries if such loans constitute an addition to the shareholding.
Translation of foreign currency
The Annual report has been presented in Euro (EUR) which is the Group’s presentation currency. The functional currency for the
ROCKWOOL Group Annual report 2017
97

Overview Global market review/outlook Business updates Financial performance Financial statements
Notes
5.8 New standards and general accounting policies (continued)
parent company is DKK. Each company in the Group determines its own functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currency are translated using the ex- change rate at the transaction date or a hedged rate. Monetary items in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date for balance sheet items, and average exchange rates for items
of the income statement.
All exchange rate adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items, apart from the exchange rate differences arising on:
– Conversion of equity in subsidiaries at the beginning
of the financial year using the exchange rates at the
balance sheet date
– Conversion of the profit for the year from average exchange
rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date
– Conversion of long-term intercompany balances that
constitute an addition to the holding of shares in subsidiaries
– Conversion of the forward hedging of capital investments
in subsidiaries
– Conversion of capital investments in associated and other
companies
– Profit and loss on effective derivative financial instruments
used to hedge expected future transactions.
These value adjustments are recognised directly under other comprehensive income.
Net sales
Net sales are recognised in the income statement provided that delivery and risk transition has taken place before year-end. Net sales are calculated excluding VAT, duties and sales discounts. Royalty and licence fees are recognised when earned according to the terms of the agreements.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements
IFRS requires the use of certain key accounting estimates when preparing the consolidated financial statements. When determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities it requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about future events.
Assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors, and are considered by Management as rea- sonable in the circumstances, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and therefore the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
Management considers estimates and judgments under the following items as significant to these consolidated financial statements:
– Impairment testing (note 2.5)
– Expected lifetime for assets (note 2.1 and 2.2) – Deferred tax assets (note 5.4)
– Pension obligations (note 2.6)
– Acquisitions of subsidiaries (note 5.1).

Independent auditor’s report
To the Shareholders of ROCKWOOL International A/S
Our opinion
In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position at 31 December 2017 and of the results of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our Auditor’s Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
What we have audited
The Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements of ROCKWOOL International A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2017 (page 54-105) comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive in- come, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies for the Group as well as for the Parent Company. Collec- tively referred to as the “Financial Statements”.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Stand- ards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applica- ble in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Inter- national Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.
Appointment
We were first appointed auditors of ROCKWOOL International A/S on 9 April 2014 for the financial year 2014. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 4 years including the financial year 2017.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2017. These matters were addressed in the con- text of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
 Key audit matter
Impairment of intangible and tangible assets
Intangible and tangible assets might be impaired due to for example increased competition in local markets, changes
in the global economy and changes in the strategy of the Group.
We focused on this area as the determination of whether or not an impairment charge for intangible and tangible assets was necessary involves significant estimates and judgements made by Management, including especially:
– estimation of future cash flows and the key assumptions underlying Management’s expectations;
– discount rates applied in discounting future cash flows; and
– long-term growth rates
Reference is made to notes 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 to the Consoli- dated Financial Statements.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We tested the impairment tests prepared by Management and evaluated the reasonableness of estimates and judge- ments made by Management in preparing these.
Our audit procedures included assessing the Group’s impairment model.
Special focus was given to the key drivers of the future cash flows, including growth in net revenues, cost inflation, efficiency improvements, capital expenditure and working capital, as well as the discount rates and long-term growth rates applied.
We tested the reliability of Management’s estimates by comparing budgeted figures to actual figures for the past years and evaluated the discount rates and long-term growth rates applied.
Furthermore, where possible, we compared to independently determined acceptable ranges and externally derived data.
Moreover, we examined sensitivity analyses performed over changes in discount rates, revenue growth and efficiency improvements.

 Key audit matter
Uncertain tax positions and valuation of deferred tax assets
The Group operates in many territories and is, consequently, subject to local laws, cross-border transfer pricing legislation and investment promotional tax benefits which complicates the tax matters of the Group as a whole.
Where utilisation of tax losses and tax amortisation balances are uncertain a write-down is recorded based on Management’s judgment. Where the amount of tax payable or receivable is uncertain, a provision for uncertain tax positions is recorded based on Management’s judgement.
We focused on valuation of deferred tax assets as it involves significant estimates and judgements made by Management in terms of utilisation of tax losses and tax amortisation balances.
Moreover, we focused on the tax accounting area as the completeness and valuation of tax balances are made difficult by a complex multinational tax structure as well as tax arising from acquisition accounting.
Reference is made to notes 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
In understanding and evaluating Management’s judgement, we considered estimates and judgemental positions taken relating to valuation of uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets.
In addition, we used our own local and international tax specialists, evaluated the adequacy of Management’s key assumptions and read relevant correspondence with tax authorities to assess the valuation of tax assets and liabilities.
Statement on Management’s Review
Management is responsible for Management’s Review (page 2-53).
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management’s Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read Management’s Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management’s Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, we considered whether Management’s Review includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Management’s Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial
Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Management’s Review.
Management’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

(continued)
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
– Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s internal control.
– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
– Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
– Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
