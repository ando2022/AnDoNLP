A PROSPEROUS YEAR

We have had a prosperous year, allowing us once again to celebrate strong top-line performance and increased profitability. 2014 delivered remarkable growth for PANDORA both in terms of geographical areas and products and with the opening of concept store number 1,400 we now have more branded stores in our network than ever before.
In 2014, PANDORA moved into seven new markets, and expanded further in existing markets. In our more developed markets, the US, the UK, Germany and Australia, we opened 96 concept stores, while our existing concept stores in these countries delivered increasing sales-out in all four quarters of the year, compared with the same quarters in 2013. Most of our markets saw the same trend ­ an increase in the number of concept stores and positive developments in existing stores. In line with our aim to expand PANDORA's online sales, we continued our eSTORE expansion in 2014, with the establishment of PANDORA-owned eSTOREs in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. We now have our own eSTOREs in a total of seven European countries.
With growth of more than 25% in revenue from charms and charm bracelets in 2014, both the Moments collection and the PANDORA ESSENCE COLLECTION continue to be as successful as ever. Also, our second core category, Rings, had a tremendous year. The focused effort on growing this category resulted in revenue from Rings of more than DKK 1 billion, which represents 10% of full-year revenue compared with only 6% in 2013. During the year, we entered into a strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company that resulted in the launch of 41 Disney-inspired charms in the US in November. The charms have been very well received by consumers.
We continued to expand our branded network in 2014. Our main focus is to increase our share of revenue from concept stores, in which we offer our customers the best possible branded experience. During the year we opened

310 new concept stores, taking the total to 1,410 and revenue from the store type increased by approximately 50% compared with last year. 56% of our revenue is now generated in concept stores compared with 49% last year. The total number of stores actually decreased during the year, but the number of branded PANDORA stores increased by 564, while the number of PANDORA-owned stores also increased during the year.
We operate a strong franchisee model, but also operates owned and operated branded stores in selected markets when deemed beneficial. Examples of this in 2014 include the acquisition of net 22 PANDORA stores in the US, the forward integration of our operations in Japan, beginning in January 2015 and taking over up to 78 commercial store leases in prime locations in Germany, which we will convert into PANDORA-owned concept stores in 2015.
We owe a substantial part of our success to our crafting facilities in Thailand. In 2014, we produced around 91 million pieces of jewellery and in the process we hired more than 3,100 new employees, bringing the total to 11,400, of whom approximately 7,900 are located at our facilities in Thailand. In 2015, we plan to expand production by at least one new facility to cater for future demand.
Here on the threshold of an exciting 2015, we extend a hearty `thank you' to our people for their efforts and hard work in the past year ­ without their dedicated and strong performance we would not have been able to achieve these results. On behalf of PANDORA's Board of Directors, Executive Management and employees, we would also like to sincerely thank all our customers as well as our shareholders for the interest and trust they have shown in our company throughout 2014.

2015 Guidance
> 14 approx. 37% approx. 800 approx. 20%

2014 Actual
11.9 36.0%
455 20.0%

In 2015, PANDORA will continue to focus on driving likefor-like growth in the existing stores, as well as expanding the store network in newer as well as in more penetrated markets. Revenue is expected to increase to more than DKK 14 billion, with the two growth drivers expected to contribute equally. The EBITDA margin is expected to increase from 36.0% in 2014 to approximately 37% in 2015. The increase includes an expected gain from lower hedged commodity prices compared to 2014, tempered by continued investments in infrastructure. Expectations are based on unchanged currency rates.
CAPEX for the year is expected to be approximately DKK 800 million. The expected level of investments includes development of the crafting facilities in Thailand, investments in the Company's distribution network, including the announced accelerated expansion in Germany, China and Japan, as well as significant IT investments. CAPEX in the period 2016-2017 is expected to continue to stay at an elevated level similar to 2015, due to continued investments in the aforementioned areas.
PANDORA plans to continue to expand the store network and expects to add more than 300 new concept stores in 2015. This includes an expected opening of around 60 new owned and operated concept stores in Germany following the recent acquisition of up to 78 leaseholds in the country. The geographic split of the remaining concept store openings is expected to be similar to the concept store openings in 2014.

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME
In the 2013 Annual Report, PANDORA announced its intention to buy back own shares of up to DKK 2,400 million during 2014 in a share buyback programme. At 31 December 2014, a total of 5,875,257 shares had been bought back, corresponding to a purchase price of DKK 2,400 million and an average purchase price of DKK 408.5. At 31 December 2014, PANDORA owned a total of 7,216,058 treasury shares, corresponding to 5.6% of the share capital.
The purpose of the share buyback programme is to reduce PANDORA's share capital, to adjust the capital structure in accordance with the Company's policy on capital structure and to meet obligations arising from employee share option programmes. At 31 December 2014, the total potential obligation amounted to 1,382,800 shares due to the annual allocation under the Company's employee share option programme.

A proposal will be presented to the Annual General Meeting to reduce PANDORA's share capital by DKK 5,818,651 by cancelling 5,818,651 treasury shares held by the Company.
In 2015, an additional share buyback programme will be launched, under which PANDORA expects to buy back own shares to a maximum consideration of DKK 3,900 million. The programme will end no later than 31 December 2015.
The full share buyback programme is subject to the approval of an extension of the current authorisation to acquire own shares on behalf of the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 18 March 2015. PANDORA has bought back own shares corresponding to 7.2% of the share capital under the current authorisation, which allows the Company to acquire own shares with a total nominal value of up to 10% of its share capital.

KEY EVENTS IN 2014

Middle East In March 2014, PANDORA signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in Pan Me A/S. The transaction was closed on 16 January 2015 upon fulfilment of certain conditions. Pan Me A/S holds the rights to distribute PANDORA jewellery in the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. PANDORA paid a one-time cash payment of DKK 110 million, primarily related to the rights to distribute PANDORA jewellery in the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, and non-current assets and inventories related to 11 concept stores and three shop-in-shops in the UAE.
Japan In September 2014, PANDORA signed an agreement with Bluebell on joint distribution of PANDORA jewellery in Japan from 1 January 2015. Through the cooperation, PANDORA plans to accelerate the store roll-out, enhance the retail focus and make significant marketing investments in the Japanese market. Bluebell will contribute with in-depth knowledge of the retail market and the Japanese consumer as well as its insight into the Japanese real estate market.
As part of the agreement with Bluebell, PANDORA will purchase the assets related to the distribution of PANDORA jewellery in Japan in a non-cash transaction on 1 January 2015. The initial term of the agreement is five years. Upon termination of the agreement, PANDORA will take over the full distribution of PANDORA jewellery in Japan. The total amount to be paid to Bluebell will depend on the realised revenue in 2019 and will be in the range of HKD 74-220 million (or approximately DKK 52-156 million).

The transaction value totalled USD 28 million (DKK 162 million), including locations, inventories and other assets. Initial in-store remodelling costs are estimated at USD 6 million (DKK 37 million), bringing the total investment to USD 34 million (DKK 199 million).
Organisational changes Chairman of the Board of Directors In March 2014, PANDORA announced that Marcello Bottoli would be standing down from his role as Chairman of the Board due to other professional commitments. At an Extraordinary General Meeting in October, Peder Tuborgh was elected as new member of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors subsequently constituted itself with Peder Tuborgh as new Chairman.
CEO In August, PANDORA announced that Anders Colding Friis will succeed Allan Leighton as CEO in March 2015. At that time, Allan Leighton will be stepping down from his role as CEO. At the next Annual General Meeting, the current Board of Directors will recommend Allan Leighton as new Co-Deputy Chairman of the Board.
CFO Peter Vekslund, former Senior Vice President, Head of Finance, succeeded Henrik Holmark as CFO of PANDORA on 1 January 2015. As announced in August 2014, Henrik Holmark stepped down from his role as CFO of PANDORA to join Dr. Martens Airwair Group Ltd as CFO.

Hannoush (US) In August 2014, PANDORA acquired 27 concept stores from US jeweller Hannoush, as part of a process to refresh the network in the Northeastern US, which has been underp erforming relative to the rest of the US. Following the transaction five of the stores located outside the Northeast were sold to a franchisee, resulting in a net total of 22 stores acquired.

Indictment In November, the District Court in Glostrup passed its verdict in a case against PANDORA concerning potential breach of section 27(1) of the Securities Trading Act, cf. section 93(6), cf. subsection 1. PANDORA was found to be in breach of this section in the Securities Trading Act and the Company was to pay a fine of DKK 2 million. PANDORA has appealed the verdict to the Eastern High Court.

6 · The PANDORA story 2014

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

The verdict concerned a case dating back to 2011 and relates to Company Announcement No. 30 of 2 August 2011, when the Company announced its downward adjustment of its revenue growth expectations, two weeks earlier than the ordinary reporting date for the Q2 2011 results. The District Court in Glostrup found that the Company was obliged to announce a downward adjustment of the revenue growth expectations for 2011, no later than 18 July 2011. As previously communicated, PANDORA's position is that: · the Company acted properly during a swift and
unexpected downturn in sales by making a timely and precise announcement adjusting its annual forecast in light of new information and based on an analysis of the changing market dynamics in July 2011, · the Company has at all times been in full compliance with all relevant rules and regulations for issuers of shares.
EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Germany In January 2015, PANDORA entered into an agreement with DHG GmbH (DHG) to take over up to 78 commercial leaseholds in Germany formerly trading under the BiBa name (a ladies fashion brand). PANDORA will pay a service fee to DHG for making the leaseholds available. All 78 leaseholds concern stand-alone stores located in prime locations in Germany that fit well with our existing concept store expansion strategy in Germany. During 2015, PANDORA will open owned and operated concept stores in the new locations, some of which will be a relocation of existing PANDORA-owned stores.
The total investment for the new owned and operated stores, including establishment and relocation of stores (including initial inventory in the stores), costs related to temporarily inactive stores in the transition period, service fees to DHG as well as all other costs related to store implementation, is expected to be around EUR 50 million

(approximately DKK 370 million), of which the majority will be recognised as CAPEX and inventories. The funds will be spent over the course of 2015.
China In February 2015, PANDORA entered an agreement with Oracle Investment (Hong Kong) Limited ("Oracle") about joint distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018. At the end of the agreement, PANDORA will take over the full distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China.
PANDORA plans, through the cooperation, to accelerate the store roll-out, enhance the retail focus and make significant marketing investments in the Chinese market. Oracle will contribute with its in-depth knowledge of the retail market and the Chinese consumer as well as their insight into the Chinese real estate market, which will aid PANDORA in securing the most attractive locations.
On 1 July 2015, PANDORA will, as part of the agreement with Oracle, purchase the majority of Oracle's assets in China. The term of the agreement ends December 2018. The total amount to be paid to Oracle will depend on the realised revenue in 2018 and part of the payment will be delayed to end of the term of the agreement. The initial payment to Oracle is expected to be approximately HKD 120 million (or approximately DKK 100 million), depending on the value of the assets at the time of the completion of the agreement. The total payment will be in the range of HKD 200-500 million (or approximately DKK 170-420 million). The agreement is subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled.
Major shareholder announcement On 16 February 2015 PANDORA was notified by BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited that BlackRock, Inc. has increased its holding of shares in PANDORA A/S at 13 February 2015 to 6,434,446 shares, corresponding to 5.02% of the share capital and the voting rights.

Personal storytelling We enable women to express their uniqueness, style and taste. PANDORA's meaningful products provide opportunities to tell a personal story ­ whether worn personally or given as a gift to someone special.
Contemporary design We embrace renewal and continually refresh our products so that we are always relevant in the eyes of consumers. Our brand universe is stylish and feminine, with a warm, joyful and inspirational feel.

Focus on branded sales channels Our branded sales channels allow us to strengthen the image of our brand in the retail environment and to invest in an expanded product offering compared with our other points of sale. By increasing the number of PANDORA branded points of sale, particularly concept stores, we can give customers the best, branded experience.
Adopt a tailored approach in new markets We will continue to enter new geographical markets while at the same time expanding our presence in existing markets.

We continually gather and analyse data from different parts of the value chain to ensure our organisation remains efficient. This allows us to benefit from scalability and flexibility, maintain a clear and complete overview of operations, and develop products and activities to match changing market needs.

PANDORA RELEASED 387 NEW PIECES IN 2014

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Our strategy involves capitalising on our product offering through consumer-centric, market-led design of new products. Many factors, including sales-out data on existing PANDORA products, raw material prices and price points, are taken into account when deciding on designs, and the themes for each collection are chosen based on global trends and seasonality.
PANDORA's primary focus is to continue to develop the Charms and Bracelets categories. Our secondary focus is the Rings category, which we believe holds significant, untapped potential. It is the largest jewellery category in the world, but rings generated just 6.1% of PANDORA's revenue in 2013. We therefore focused on growing the Rings category, leading to a share of 10.0% of revenue in 2014. Out of a total of 387 new pieces, 11.1% were rings.
Both the Charms and Bracelets categories and the Rings category saw significant growth in 2014. The Other jewellery category, which includes earrings, necklaces and pendants, completes the PANDORA product universe and holds great long-term potential.

Consumer-centric and market-led design Our retail insight system provides us with sales-out figures for products in concept stores. This data is fed back into product design. If a certain design or colour performs particularly well, for example, we may create a number of variations of that design for the next product launch.
This process is known as design-to-data. Since we introduced this process in 2012, the sales-out share of new products (defined as products launched within the last 12 months) has increased significantly, indicating that our design team is able to meet consumer demand in terms of design, colour, materials and price.
Launch strategy In order to keep freshness and relevance in our collections, we introduced a new launch structure in the second half of 2012. We now have seven product launches a year, arranged around traditional fashion and gift-giving seasons to ensure consumers have a constant variety of new PANDORA products to choose from.
This launch strategy has contributed significantly to PANDORA's growth in like-for-like sales-out figures, as it both refreshes the assortment and drives traffic into stores throughout the year. In total, PANDORA introduced 387

new pieces in 2014. Slow-moving items were retired through sales promotions on discontinued items, clearance through outlets or permanent stock balancing programmes in selected countries.
Our design team begins preparations for each launch a year in advance. In order to ensure each launch has a modern and innovative feel, our designers keep abreast of the latest trends ­ not just within jewellery, but within all aspects of consumer behaviour, from fashion and interior design to cars and IT. This information is then combined with sales data from our retail insight system to create a mood board that sets the scene for the launch.
Once a theme has been settled on ­ the theme for Autumn 2014, for example, was Mystical Fairytale ­ the design work starts. Each piece of jewellery is drawn in 3D at the PANDORA Innovation Centre in Thailand, a stateof-the-art facility where design and crafting converge. The centre's development team creates prototypes of each piece and analyses the new designs in order to establish the most efficient crafting process.
For each launch, we develop a 360° marketing and sales toolkit. The toolkit is designed around consumer touch points and contains a full range of materials, from advertisements and PR to point-of-sale materials and sales training. Prior

to and during a launch, we also promote the new products through our digital channels, including social media, the PANDORA Club and our blogging network.
Crafting Developing the right designs requires access to the right raw materials. PANDORA sources high-quality materials from around the globe. These are crafted into finished jewellery at our crafting facilities in Gemopolis, just outside Bangkok, Thailand. The facilities combine standardised and scalable modern production techniques with centuriesold craftsmanship, and every piece is hand-finished by experienced and skilled craftspeople. Collectively, PANDORA Production Thailand employs more than 7,900 people.
As we own our crafting facilities, we are able to ensure a constant supply of high-quality products to the market and to scale the production of different pieces up or down, depending on demand. In 2014, we produced around 91 million pieces of jewellery, an increase of 16.5% compared with 2013. In order to further expand capacity, we are looking to open new facilities in Thailand. Detailed planning for this will begin in 2015.

WELCOME TO GEMOPOLIS

It's 4.50pm in Gemopolis and the streets outside PANDORA's crafting facilities are buzzing. It's shift change time, and a fleet of PANDORA buses has just pulled up, bringing in thousands of people from nearby Bangkok. People fill the streets, chatting and laughing as they head into the facilities to start work or board the buses to be taken home. Welcome to Gemopolis.
At our crafting facilities in Thailand, love, care and attention to detail are bestowed on every hand-finished piece, bringing to life our design ideal of a contemporary aesthetic fused with traditional artistry. Here, skilled jewel-smiths, goldsmiths, silversmiths and stone-setters use traditional tools and techniques to apply the finishing touches, turning every piece of PANDORA jewellery into a piece of affordable luxury.

We are committed to retaining, training and developing our team of more than 7,900 people in Thailand and have created an inclusive working environment where everyone is valued, engaged and encouraged to improve. PANDORA Radio, for example, went on air in 2012 to provide entertainment, news and training for our people and is run by volunteer employee DJs.
Other initiatives include the PANDORA Edutainment Centre, an e-learning room and library with more than 15 computers and 10,100 books borrowed in 2014; an Employee Shop that sells everyday provisions (the stock is selected by our people) at prices lower than at supermarkets and convenience stores; and a Savings Cooperative managed by our people.

THE PANDORA PRODUCT UNIVERSE
PANDORA's products are a direct reflection of our desire to offer women a universe of high-quality, hand-finished and modern jewellery at affordable prices. Each product is a piece of personal storytelling, affordable luxury and contemporary design ­ and the jewellery can be worn on its own or combined with other PANDORA products to create a unique and individual look.
Charms and Bracelets PANDORA's classic charm bracelet concept Moments offers a selection of charms and bracelets that let women wear mementos of their unforgettable moments on their wrists. Equipped with patented `stoppers' and `keepers', the bracelets enable women to add and combine charms in any way they choose to create highly personalised pieces of jewellery. As a result, almost no two PANDORA charm bracelets are ever the same. In 2014, sales of PANDORA's Charms and Bracelets made up 78.4% of revenue. 284 new charms were added to the collection and 217 were discontinued.

With the launch of the PANDORA ESSENCE COLLECTION in November 2013, we added a new dimension to our Charms and Bracelets categories. The collection features a range of new slender silver bracelets and an accompanying assortment of charms representing personal values. It also includes an innovative and patent-pending solution that enables the wearer to position charms along the bracelet, and keeps the charms in place through the use of a flexible silicone grip inside the core of each charm. The collection was developed using extensive research including the help of thousands of women worldwide.
Rings In line with our brand DNA, most PANDORA rings can be stacked to create a personal look and are designed to complement other PANDORA jewellery. The Rings category was a key focus area in 2014. New initiatives in this category, such as a ring marketing toolkit and touch-and-feel in-store displays, proved very successful. Ring sales doubled in 2014, and Rings made up 10.0% of revenue compared with 6.1% in 2013. This has firmly established Rings as our second core product category.

PANDORA HEARTS OF TODAY
In 2014, we launched a new social cause platform in the US called PANDORA Hearts of Today. Many women work every day to make a difference in their communities and the world at large. PANDORA Hearts of Today celebrates these women. Entrants are nominated by colleagues, friends or family and a panel of inspirational women selects the semi-finalists. The general public then votes online to select the winners who receive a donation to help the organisation they work with.

Connecting with consumers In 2014, we continued to build and strengthen the PANDORA brand. Broadly speaking, the typical PANDORA consumer is a woman between 25 and 49 years of age, and within this group of people we find several relevant consumer segments, each with individual characteristics. In addition to female consumers, we also connect with men buying PANDORA jewellery as gifts for women. Aided brand awareness in our female target group has reached a high and stable level in our developed markets over time, while we are still seeing healthy growth in awareness in our newer markets.
We enjoy a close relationship with consumers, and this is enhanced by continuous online engagement via a variety of social media platforms such as Facebook, the PANDORA Club and Instagram. The monthly online PANDORA Magazine has around half a million visits per month and our global Facebook page sees around 300 fan posts per week.

BUSINESS STRATEGY · 17

Marketing We constantly assess the media landscape and adjust our media spread to increase the effectiveness of campaigns to ensure we connect with consumers in the most effective way. In recent years, we have shifted much of our media spend from traditional print and broadcast media to online. Online media gives us an opportunity to both connect and interact with consumers. We create online spaces where consumers can meet and share their passions, jewellery designs and fashion tips ­ and consumer feedback is monitored and fed back into the design process.
In 2014, we spent 9.6% of our revenue on marketing compared with 9.8% in 2013, an increase of 29.9%. In addition, our global marketing spend was supplemented by the marketing spend of franchisees, multi-brand retailers and third-party distributors.
In 2014, we completed a target group segmentation study providing deep insights into current and potential customers. Information from the study will enable us to target communication and products to different consumer groups even more effectively.
More than 60% of the women who own PANDORA jewellery receive it as a gift, and more than half of the gift givers are men, and we dedicate a certain amount of our marketing spend to men in order to support this position.
However, the majority of our efforts in the gift-giving area focus on helping women indicate to gift buyers which PANDORA jewellery they would like to receive. For example, the PANDORA Club allows members to share their wish lists with friends and family.

YEAR OF THE RINGS
PANDORA'S REVENUE FROM THE RINGS CATEGORY SAW AN AMAZING INCREASE IN
2014. WHAT DROVE THIS GROWTH?
When we decided to increase focus on the Rings category, we knew that the go-to-market materials needed to be as well thought-out as the products themselves. So at the end of 2013, we launched a ring toolkit, a collection of best practices and sales and marketing tools to promote the Rings category. One of the toolkit's focal points was to improve the way rings were presented in stores. Today, at least 20% of the retail category space in each concept store is dedicated to rings, and rings have experienced increased attention from consumers as a result.
Sizing is important for consumers when buying rings, so the toolkit includes various ways to help consumers ensure they get rings of the right size. This includes ring-sizing features on PANDORA's digital touch points. A PANDORA Club member, for example, can include her ring size on her wish list and share it with her friends and family through social media channels.
All the combined efforts to grow ring sales meant an increase in revenue from Rings of 116.7% to DKK 1,192 million in 2014.

MEETING CUSTOMERS IN THE DIGITAL WORLD

When an image of the PANDORA Valentine's Collection 2015 was posted on Instagram, it quickly attracted more than 20,000 `likes' and hundreds of comments from followers, many of which were recommendations to friends or hints to boyfriends and husbands. What drives so many women to follow us?
For PANDORA, the most powerful marketing tool is the women who share their lives and personalities through our products, and in many ways social media is the perfect platform. It enables women (around 95% of our followers and fans are female) to easily share their stories, style and passion for our products with friends and family, as well as with millions of other women across the globe.
The cornerstones of our digital presence remain Facebook and the PANDORA Club. These are supported by a strong presence on Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter ­ and we are always on the lookout for other relevant digital platforms. Our Instagram account was recently highlighted as top performer in the watches and jewellery industry by the digital think tank L2, and our Facebook pages were recognised for their high level of organic fan engagement.

Our Facebook pages have nearly five million `likes', and between 200,000 and 300,000 people interact with us on Facebook each month, either through our global Facebook page or one of 15 local pages. These interactions vary from sharing personal stories to simply `liking' our content or recommending it to others.
The PANDORA Club builds a strong sense of brand loyalty among its 6.2 million members by offering regular newsletters with sneak peeks and special content, as well as member functionalities on our website such as a ring size saver. Members can even create a PANDORA wish list and share it with friends and loved ones through other social media channels.
This high level of digital interaction enables us to develop close connections with customers and build buzz around new products through sneak peeks and special promotions. But above all, we empower women from all over the world to share their stories and passion for our products with each other, and spreading their love for our brand.

SALES CHANNELS

Entering the PANDORA universe When customers walk into a PANDORA concept store, they are entering a complete PANDORA universe. Every aspect of the in-store experience, from the lighting and music to product displays and interaction with the sales staff, is carefully thought through. This 360° approach has made our concept stores, along with our other branded sales channels, an increasingly important part of our business model.
We continuously focus on expanding our network of PANDORA branded sales channels, particularly concept stores, and in 2014 we started to revamp the shop experience with the Evolution store design concept. In 2015, all new PANDORA stores will feature the Evolution concept and work on refitting existing stores with Evolution will commence.
Our focus on our branded distribution network includes opening owned and operated branded stores in selected markets when deemed feasible. This improves implementation of our branded network strategy, which focuses on high-quality locations and strong in-store execution. Examples from 2014 include the acquisition of Hannoush stores in the US, the forward integration of our operations in Japan and taking over up to 78 commercial store leases in prime locations in Germany.
Concept stores, shop-in-shops and gold stores Concept stores, shop-in-shops and gold stores are an integral part of PANDORA's business model. Here, our products are displayed in a PANDORA-branded environment, giving us full control over the consumers' shopping experience. Branded store environments have a positive impact on sales. In 2014, branded stores made up 85.6% of revenue, compared with 82.3% in 2013.
Our strategy is to increase the number of branded stores in selected markets, by upgrading silver or white stores where PANDORA products are selling well and by opening new concept stores and shop-in-shops. In 2014, we opened 310 new concept stores and 183 shop-in-shops.

Silver and white multi-brand stores Silver and white stores have historically been an important part of our strategy, especially in new and expanding markets, as the stores enable us to reach a broader customer base with low investment. As we move further into branded sales, the number of silver and white stores naturally decreases. In 2014, PANDORA jewellery was available in a total of 4,541 silver and white stores, compared with 5,478 in 2013.

PANDORA'S POINTS OF SALE
Consumers can purchase our products through 9,906 points of sale in more than 90 countries. The points of sale range from concept stores, shop-inshops and gold stores where products are displayed in a PANDORA-branded environment, to silver and white multi-brand stores where our products are sold alongside products from other brands.

EVOLVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

Entering a PANDORA concept store is like meeting an old friend. But people change over time, and the PANDORA store has to evolve to stay relevant. That's where the Evolution store concept comes in.
The PANDORA concept store design is changed approximately every five years to ensure the store experience remains relevant to customers' changing demands and needs.
Created in collaboration with a Swiss architecture and design firm, Evolution is an accessible and feminine in-store environment with a warm and bright feel and unique zoning colours that help customers find their way to the products they seek. Every inch of the store has been carefully designed to reinforce the unique PANDORA aesthetic and improve the sales experience. The detailing on the showcases, for example, uses bracelet-like patterns to create a visual and tactile link to our signature product.
Details of this kind do not materialise overnight. Work on Evolution began in early 2012 and the first `lab store' was created in Stuttgart, Germany, later that year. After two years of development, testing, tweaking and establishing an efficient procurement supply, the global roll-out of Evolution began in 2014. Before an Evolution

store materialises, our in-house team of technical designers draws the store in 3D and fits the Evolution elements to the store's unique size and shape.
Brings products closer to the customer The Evolution design reflects our brand's promise to help women remember, cherish and share their unforgettable moments. The traditional counters have been split up and spread out across the store so that sales staff and customers can stand side by side as they discuss the products. The jewellery is beautifully framed in cabinets and displayed on the walls to create a wall of memories. In addition, newly designed fixtures allow customers to touch and feel the products, giving them a tactile experience and a sense of the products' quality.
Fabulous and functional façades The PANDORA store façade is the face of our brand ­ it is what people recognise as they pass by in the street or in a shopping centre. To enhance this reassuring moment, the Evolution design highlights core elements of the brand's visual identity, including the ribbon image that appears on many of our marketing materials.

Seeking growth globally With 9,906 points of sale across more than 90 countries, PANDORA products are readily available to customers almost anywhere on the globe. In 2014, we continued to grow our presence in new markets, while at the same time growing revenue in developed markets. We did this through a continuous effort to renew and develop our product offering and our store network.
Growing in new markets Our aim is to reduce our dependency on individual markets and seek growth opportunities by entering and expanding in new markets. We apply a tailored approach to new markets

in order to best take advantage of opportunities, present our brand the right way and mitigate risk. This tailored approach also applies to marketing and the split between branded and unbranded stores.
Italy, France and Russia are three of Europe's largest jewellery markets. Revenue in these three new markets for PANDORA, constituting around 15% of total revenue in 2014, increased 57.0% compared with 2013. There is still great growth potential in all three markets and we aim to expand our business here.
Asia is still a very new region for PANDORA and holds great potential for the Group. PANDORA has had a presence in this region since 2009, but its presence in large jewellery

PANDORA ESTORES
By the end of 2014, PANDORA had eSTOREs in seven European countries. The first PANDORA eSTORE in the UK has proven successful with high traffic, high conversion rates and low return rates. PANDORA eSTOREs appeal particularly to male gift buyers, who may not find their way to a physical PANDORA store. We will continue to develop and open PANDORA eSTOREs in an aim to offer PANDORA online sales globally.

markets like China and Japan is still limited. In 2015, we will increase our focus on China and Japan, which together represent almost one third of global jewellery sales.
The global jewellery market is currently worth approximately DKK 1,700 billion (2013) and is predicted to grow to DKK 2,200 billion by 2017, according to Euro monitor International. A very large proportion of this growth will come from Asia, mainly driven by China and India.
Driving growth in developed markets Our business model is as strong as our signature product, the charm bracelet, encourages repeat purchase of charms. However, we also see significant opportunities in leveraging

our brand recognition in other jewellery categories, especially so in developed markets, where the PANDORA brand is strong and well known.
The US, the UK and Australia are some of our most developed markets, jointly making up 51% of the Group's total revenue in 2014. Although developed, these markets still hold potential for growth. In 2014, revenue in the UK and Australia grew by 42.8% and 18.4% respectively, driven both by increasing sales of Charms and Bracelets and by a strong performance in the Rings category. Revenue in the US grew by 13.4%, driven by positive like-for-like sales in all areas other than the Northeast, as well as the opening of new stores on the West Coast.

GROWING IN BOTH NEW...

BUILDING A STRONG BRAND IN THE LAND OF DESIGN

Four years ago, almost no-one in Italy knew the name PANDORA. Today, it is one of the best-known jewellery brands in the country, with increasing revenue and a blossoming reputation.
Italy is one of Europe's largest jewellery markets, with an annual retail value of almost DKK 28 billion according to Euromonitor International. The Italian jewellery industry is characterised by a large number of independent jewellers ­ around 20,000. PANDORA chose to focus on the top 1,000 jewellers as well as opening a number of own and operated concept stores to showcase the brand.

The openings were followed by a number of brand awareness campaigns and the brand rose to fame. One of the first franchisees to sign an agreement with PANDORA was the Songa Group ­ one of the biggest jewellery traders in Italy ­ firmly establishing the PANDORA brand in Italy.
Today, PANDORA products are available through a total of 749 points of sale across the country, including 36 concept stores and seven shop-in-shops. In 2014, PANDORA Italy delivered sales-out growth of more than 40% compared with 2013.

...AND DEVELOPED MARKETS
DRAWING RINGS AROUND AUSTRALIA
How can you boost sales in one of your bestperforming and most developed markets? Give consumers something they did not know they wanted ­ rings.
PANDORA has been present in Australia since 2004. Today, consumers can buy PANDORA products in more than 393 stores across the country, and Australia is one of our most developed markets. Yet, Australia delivered like-for-like growth of 25.5% in 2014.
Ring sales have more than doubled in Australia since 2012, thanks to a clearly defined category strategy that combines merchandising, sales and marketing, aligning all commercial functions within the business. In 2014, for the first time, more of PANDORA Australia's revenue derived from rings than from bracelets ­ even though the Charms and Bracelets categories delivered revenue of DKK 504 million, an increase of 13.8% compared with 2013, the Rings category contributed revenue of DKK 149 million, an increase of 52.0%.

GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
The stone-setting method called pavé (French for `paved') involves considerable skill. Small stones are mounted into a piece of jewellery with multiple tapered holes and set almost level with the surface. The stones are placed close together to fill as much of the surface as possible, making the piece look like it has been paved with stones.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

RECOMMENDATIONS AND PRACTICE
PANDORA's aim regarding good corporate governance is to ensure transparency, accountability and that the Company meets its obligations to shareholders, customers, consumers, employees, authorities and other key stakeholders to the best of its ability in order to maximise long-term value creation.
PANDORA will exercise good corporate governance at all times and assess its practices according to the corporate governance recommendations of the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. As a publicly listed company, PANDORA is subject to the disclosure requirements laid down by Nasdaq Copenhagen, which has included the recommendations in its `Rule Book for Issuers of Shares'. The Danish corporate governance recommendations were updated in May 2013 with a minor revision in 2014, which does not impact PANDORA's reporting. In 2014, PANDORA chose to deviate partly from Clause 3.4.6 as the Chairman of the Nomination Committee is not the Chairman of the Board. In PANDORA, the Nomination Committee elects a chairman, who must be either the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman of the Board. A new Chairman was appointed in 2014 and the Deputy Chairman was elected as Chairman of the Nomination Committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board share the Chairmanship and thus, in practice, the Deputy Chairman represents the Chairman on the Nomination Committee.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE BOARD
Powers are distributed between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board and independence exists between these two bodies as is normal practice in Denmark. The Board of Directors is elected at the General Meeting and all Board members are up for election every year. The Executive Board is appointed by the Board of Directors. The Executive Board handles day-to-day management, while the Board of Directors supervises the work of the Executive Board and is responsible for the general strategic direction.

The Board of Directors' primary duties are to ensure that PANDORA has a strong management team, an adequate organisational structure, efficient business processes, optimal capital structure, transparent bookkeeping and practices, and responsible asset management.
The composition of the Board of Directors must be such that, at any time, the combined competencies of the Board of Directors enable it to supervise the Company's development and diligently address the specific opportunities and challenges faced by PANDORA. The Board of Directors, together with PANDORA's Executive Board, develops the Company's overall strategies and oversees that the competencies and resources are in place to maximise the likelihood of PANDORA achieving its objectives. Furthermore, the Board of Directors oversees the financial development of PANDORA and the related planning and reporting systems.
BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2014
In 2014, the Board held seven ordinary Board meetings. The total attendance rate was 85%. In 2014, the primary commercial focus area for the Board was the continued global expansion exemplified by a distribution agreement in Japan, acquisition of concept stores in the US and a strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company.
Board Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee.
The Board of Directors appoints Committee members and the Committee chairman. The Committees' terms of reference are disclosed on the Company's website.
The Audit Committee The current members of the Audit Committee are Anders Boyer-Søgaard (Chairman), Andrea Alvey, Nikolaj Vejlsgaard and Michael Hauge Sørensen. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the Company's financial reporting and audit process as well as the internal control systems

26 · GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

and evaluates the adequacy of control procedures. More specifically, the duty of the Audit Committee is to supervise the following areas: · financial reporting process · internal control and risk management systems · external audit
In 2014, the Audit Committee met seven times and had an attendance rate of 93%. The main activities were: · meetings with the Executive Board and external auditors
to review the audited annual report · meetings with Management to review quarterly financial
statements, the key accounting policies and significant accounting estimates · review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and risk management systems · review of the Company's significant financial risks · assessment of the need for an internal audit function · recommendation for the appointment of external auditors, including evaluation of independence, competencies and compensation · the Audit Committee's annual self-assessment
The Remuneration Committee The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Peder Tuborgh (Chairman), Bjørn Gulden, Andrea Alvey, Torben Ballegaard Sørensen and Christian Frigast. The main duties of the Remuneration Committee are: · to prepare recommendations to the Board on the pay
and remuneration policy applicable to the Board and the top 15 executives, including the Executive Board, with respect to fixed and variable pay components · to submit proposals to the Board for the total individual pay and remuneration packages of the Board members and the Company's executive managers · to verify that the information on remuneration in the annual report is true, accurate and adequate
The Remuneration Committee met 4 times in 2014 and had an attendance rate of 85%. The main activity was the annual review of the remuneration policy and guidelines on incentive pay as well as approval of the Company's overall pay regulation. The Committee also performed a review of the Long Term Incentive Programme covering the Company's top management.
The Nomination Committee The current members of the Nomination Committee are Christian Frigast (Chairman), Anders Boyer-Søgaard, Ronica Wang and Per Bank. The Nomination Committee assists the

Board in fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to the: · description of the qualifications required for members of
the Board and the Executive Board · nomination of candidates for approval by the Board to
fill vacancies on the Board and the Executive Board · self-evaluation of the Board · assessment of the performance of the Executive Board
and the cooperation between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board · succession planning for top executive positions
In 2014, the Nomination Committee met 3 times, with an attendance rate of 83%. With the search for and recruitment of a new Chairman, two new Board members as well as a new CEO and CFO, 2014 was an unusual year for the Nomination Committee.
Board self-evaluation The Board conducts an annual self-assessment to constantly improve its performance and its cooperation with the Executive Board. The assessment is carried out by each Board member completing a questionnaire followed by a Board discussion where areas for improvement are defined and agreed upon. Once a year, the CEO must perform an assessment of the individual members of the Executive Board.
Among the topics covered in the Board self-assessment are Board composition, nomination process and the competencies of the Board. Topics also include the Board's involvement in financial management and control, risk management, cooperation with the Executive Board, personal contributions and committee work.
The self-assessment conducted in 2014 identified the following strengths and development areas for the Board: in general, the Board demonstrates appropriate industry knowledge and includes a diversity of experience and backgrounds well fitted to PANDORA's business and strategy. Board structure and committee work are effective, and the Board feels sufficiently involved in financial oversight. The primary action item for 2015 is to allocate time to further market visits and exposure to non-executive management levels to gain further insight into the PANDORA-specific market and business dynamics.

PANDORA Ethics fully covers the 10 principles defined by the United Nations Global Compact, and the entire PANDORA Group is certified compliant with the provisions from the Responsible Jewellery Council's (RJC) Code of Practices, which includes the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This demonstrates that we either meet or exceed the standards for responsible business practices in the jewellery value chain.

When entering into a contractual agreement with PANDORA, suppliers sign our Supplier Code of Conduct. To ensure compliance with the code, we screen all suppliers, taking into consideration a range of parameters, such as business importance and product-related and country-related risks as well as company-specific information. This screening process is part of our four-step Responsible Supplier Programme, which also includes training and auditing suppliers and ensuring timely follow-up whenever noncompliance is identified.
Thanks to the Responsible Supplier Programme, we were able to meet one of our 2014 sourcing Key Performance Indicators, which required that, in 2014, 80% of the total sourcing value for PANDORA Production Thailand and 80% of the purchasing value from group procurement categories (such as fixtures and furniture, bags and boxes etc.) must originate from companies that are either certified members of the RJC or have been audited by independent consultants to verify compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Over the course of 2014, our crafting facilities in Thailand had management systems audited and re-certified in accordance with the ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health & Safety Management) standards. In addition, PANDORA Production Thailand was certified to the ISO 50001 standard (Energy Management).
People Maintaining a working environment in which everyone has clarity, competence, confidence and commitment remained the foundation of PANDORA Production Thailand's organisational development programmes in 2014. Over the year, PANDORA Production Thailand welcomed an additional 2,000 colleagues, who enjoy safe and healthy working conditions and attractive compensation and benefits.
PANDORA Production Thailand's Safety, Health & Environment team (SHE) was expanded in 2013 and the roll-out of SHE-related training continued in 2014. All our people have received SHE-related training, using a number of training methods and supported by communication channels

such as PANDORA Production TV and PANDORA Radio. PANDORA Production Thailand's Edutainment Centre, where our people can borrow books and study during breaks ­ received a total of 50,900 unique visits during the year. Despite the unprecedented growth in the number of jewellery pieces produced, PANDORA Production Thailand managed to keep average weekly working hours in line with ILO standards by hiring additional people and introducing shift work.
We regard shop associates as front-line brand ambassadors and take special pride in ensuring that they are fully up to date with the latest PANDORA information and training, and here e-learning is especially important.
As part of the PANDORA Ethics programme, we continued our CSR and compliance-related training and monitoring activities in 2014. PANDORA Ethics is now included as modules in our e-learning system. PANDORA's 50 in-house trainers conduct thousands of hours of face-toface training and coaching throughout the Group each year. In addition, all shop associates and office team members can access our e-learning platform to receive training on a range of topics, from general sales techniques to visual merchandising and specific jewellery collections.
We believe that a successful company benefits from having a diverse management team. To this end, the Group has set a number of management diversity objectives, and progress is reviewed once a year. The objectives and recent results are as follows: · B y 2020 at the latest, the gender split in senior
management positions (members of the Executive Management, general managers and vice presidents) should be 40%-60%. At the end of 2014, 34% of senior management were women, up from 31% in 2013. · T he gender composition of the Group's leadership programmes for the years 2012-2015 should mirror the gender composition of staff in vice president and director positions (on aggregate). On 1 January 2014, women accounted for 50% of this management group, and made up 50% of the enrolment in our leadership programmes in 2014.

WE OFFER OUR SUPPLIERS TRAINING, ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM COMPLY WITH OUR CSR REQUIREMENTS

· It has been PANDORA's objective that, by 2015, at least 35% of Board members elected at the Annual General Meeting must be women. At the end of 2014, women made up 20% of our Board members, which is well above the average 11% for Danish listed companies, but still below our 35% target. Subsequently we have changed the target year from 2015 to 2018, and from 2015 we will work to reach our target.
Planet As part of our commitment to continuously minimise our environmental footprint, PANDORA Production Thailand in 2014 initiated a Life Cycle Assessment of its environmental impact. The project is being run in collaboration with the Eco-Efficient Engineering Research Laboratory (EcoLab) at Mahidol University in Thailand and has already resulted in a range of interesting findings. Under effective environmentally controlled conditions, the reuse of precious metals will considerably reduce carbon emissions compared to mining.
Based on the Ecoinvent Database, Eco-Lab estimates that reused gold results in CO2 emissions of as little as 5% compared to gold mining. The corresponding figure for silver is estimated to be 7%. This makes the use of reused precious metals extremely efficient in terms of potential CO2 reductions.
As part of our efforts to promote environmentally responsible sourcing practices 90% of the gold grains used in PANDORA products in 2014 originated from recycling. The remaining 10% originated from mines certified either according to the RJC's Chain-of-Custody standard or the `Good Delivery Refinery' standard issued by the London Bullion Market Association.
When it comes to silver, 99% of the silver grains sourced by PANDORA originate from reused sources. The remaining 1% can be traced back to certified responsible mining. Further, PANDORA is working with our specialised silver product suppliers to ensure that the silver used in their products also originates from reused sources. Reused silver may enable us to guarantee the ethical origin of silver sourced by PANDORA, but it does not help solve potential problems related to the silver mining in

general. In 2015, we will work in close cooperation with our suppliers to develop responsible chain-of-custody standards for silver mining.
PANDORA Production Thailand is our most energy consuming entity by far, but we have a modern and energy efficient production setup. The amount of energy used here was up from 19,170,000 kWh in 2013 to 23,243,000 kWh in 2014. The rise in energy consumption reflects the increase in complexity and the number of pieces of jewellery produced. Besides the state-of-the-art burn-out ovens used in the crafting process, the extensive use of chillers ensuring a comfortably cool working environment consumes a considerable amount of energy. Ovens and chillers put together account for approximately 40% of the energy consumption.
In Q2 2014, PANDORA Production Thailand achieved the ISO 50001 certification on energy management through which we define and monitor our goals, methodology and performance in reducing our energy consumption. 2014 also saw several new pilot projects aimed at reducing our energy consumption. Thus, solar panels have been installed across the entire roof of one of the buildings, LED lights have been tested in a relevant area with good results and will be installed where appropriate. In addition, we are testing how to optimise energy consumption in different processes. Training in energy management awareness has been initiated and will continue into 2015, when an expected 500 selected people are to undergo training.
Finally, we have identified CO2 emissions from the transport of our jewellery as a new focus area, and we are investigating, in close cooperation with our transport providers, how to gather data to minimise these emissions in the future.
More information about PANDORA policies within business ethics, human rights, working conditions and environmental footprint, as well as the action taken to implement these, can be found at: www.pandoragroup. com/csr, where you can also find our PANDORA Ethics 2014 Report.

FROM PURE WASTE TO TRUE RECYCLING

At PANDORA, waste is seen as a resource. In 2014, 81% of the waste produced by our crafting facilities in Thailand was reused or recycled, an increase of 24% compared with 2013. Our waste management procedures were improved with the help of recycling experts from Mahidol University in Thailand.
The crafting of our jewellery generates three main types of process waste: gypsum, glass and rubber. The gypsum derives from the jewellery casting process, the

glass from making our Murano charms and the rubber from jewellery moulds. Today, 90% of our gypsum waste is recycled in the construction sector, 100% of our Murano glass waste is recycled for producing glass tiles and 100% of our rubber waste is used as fuel by the cement industry.
It is a great pleasure to see our waste being transformed into something useful. The benefits are twofold as we optimise the world's resources and also reduce our own waste.

100%
of glass waste is used to make tiles - up from 45% in 2013

90%
of gypsum waste is reused in the construction industry - up from 46% in 2013

100%
of rubber waste is used as fuel - up from 29% in 2013

INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL

PROTECTING THE PANDORA BRAND
The PANDORA brand is one of the most recognised in the jewellery world, and protecting it is crucial to the ongoing success of the PANDORA Group. This work entails safeguarding intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and patents, as well as retaining and training our people and stopping the production and sale of counterfeit jewellery.
Intellectual property rights and policies PANDORA's intellectual property rights are mainly vested in trademarks, copyrights, patents and designs. They are strengthened by business secrets, visually distinct products, non-disclosure procedures and non-competition regulations.
PANDORA's intellectual property rights are crucial to our business, competitive advantage and future development. We therefore protect these intellectual property rights using all available means, including a comprehensive global surveillance, registration and control programme. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards

infringement of PANDORA's intellectual property rights on the internet and towards counterfeit products and trademarks in general. No distributors, dealers or others are permitted to register or use PANDORA's intellectual property without prior agreement.
Patents PANDORA's international patent families encompass patent rights relating to the functionality of the charm bracelet. Patents have been granted by the member states of the EU, the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, China, Switzerland and Norway. In general, these patents protect a jewellery chain (a necklace or bracelet) with a stop joint, known as a `stopper', which prevents charms from falling off the chain. The patents also protect a detachable holder, known as a `keeper'. A keeper can be added to a jewellery chain in order to divide the charms into groups and to prevent the moveable charms from bundling at one end of the chain. In the US, PANDORA's patent expires in 2023 and in other jurisdictions in 2024.
PANDORA filed patent applications related to the PANDORA ESSENCE COLLECTION in 2013. The first patent was granted in 2014 in Australia and more patents are expected to be granted in the first half of 2015.

COUNTERING THE COUNTERFEITERS
Our unique designs are protected by either design registrations or copyrights. However, the fight against counterfeiters is an ongoing battle that entails, among other strategies, visiting manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers who sell counterfeit jewellery, and removing counterfeit PANDORA products from web outlets. In 2014, we succeeded in removing more than 2,800 fake PANDORA websites and more than 93,000 pieces of counterfeit PANDORA jewellery from auction sites.

Trademarks PANDORA has word and figurative trademarks registered in a number of jurisdictions worldwide, including the EU, the US, Australia and Asia. The trademarks are registered in various international goods and service classes, but are primarily in international class 14, which covers jewellery and watches. The trademark portfolio includes EU registrations of the PANDORA name and crowned O logo in various international classes, including the international classes for jewellery, leather goods and clothing. At the end of 2014, PANDORA's trademark portfolio consisted of approximately 1,000 trademark applications and registrations. Of these, more than 100 trademark applications were filed in 2014.

HUMAN RESOURCES
Our people are the heart of the PANDORA Group and their continual development has always been a main driver of our success. To help every member of our global team feel empowered in their daily work and prepare for future challenges, we offer a number of training programmes developed for various levels and areas within the organisation.
Most training is run by local HR departments, ensuring that content is directly related to our people's daily work. This locally offered curriculum includes a centrally developed management training course designed to help prepare the next generation of PANDORA leaders. The course covers a range of topics, from personal effectiveness to leadership, and almost 1,500 leadership training courses were taken by managers around the world.
Global training programmes, which bring together people from around the world, include the Life Leadership Programme ­ a one-year development curriculum for vice presidents and potential vice presidents launched in 2012. In 2014, 20 leaders completed the programme, which includes a module developed and facilitated specifically for PANDORA by Harvard Business School.
Our e-learning platform, PANDORA on Demand (POD), is another essential tool that enables more than 29,000 users worldwide, including shop associates in non-PANDORAowned points of sale, to follow a broad selection of training modules. More than 380,000 POD e-learning modules were completed globally in 2014, up from 200,000 in 2013.
In 2014, we also began a number of initiatives to ensure stability of succession and bolster our reputation as an attractive place to work. In 2014, we started developing an

HR succession tool that will help identify candidates for leadership positions around the globe and ensure we can create a robust internal pipeline for the future. We are also initiating a global graduate programme that will enable high-performing young graduates to undergo a two-anda-half-year training programme working in four different countries. The first pilot programme is being run in Group Supply Chain in 2014 and 2015, and other departments are also being considered for the programme.
The continual addition of new talent is essential to a dynamic, growing organisation. To ensure that we can continue to attract the best people, we initiated a number of projects in 2014 that help us define the benefits and opportunities that we offer our people.
THE HEARTBEAT OF PANDORA
An employee satisfaction survey can tell you many things, but perhaps the most important is how engaged your people are. Conducted globally between January and September 2014, the Heartbeat Survey took the pulse of our people. Here are the highlights:
· 86% of our people would recommend PANDORA as a workplace
· 81% of our people see the PANDORA values in the organisation

RISKS

Taking action to mitigate risks As a global company with central crafting facilities, a global distribution network and points of sale across the world, PANDORA needs to be fully aware of future risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors makes regular assessments of the overall and specific risks associated with the Group's business and operations to ensure all risk is managed in a proactive and efficient manner. The Board also develops long-term and short-term strategies to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

The Board of Directors regularly reviews the Group's established internal control systems ­ including a whistleblowing function ­ to ensure that they remain appropriate and sufficient. In the case of highly complex transactions and contracts, we work with advisers to mitigate risk.
The significant current risks are (no specific order):

BRAND AND REPUTATION
Our sales are to a large extent dependent on the success of the PANDORA brand, and loss of brand value or damage to the brand's reputation could have an effect on the Group's earnings.

Description

Status

Our reputation and business could be affected by negative events covered on social media, related to PANDORA's core business and values. PANDORA has not experienced negative coverage on social media on a major scale.

In recent years, we have strengthened our presence in digital media channels through our websites, eSTOREs, PANDORA Club and social media. These channels enable us to engage directly with end customers and respond quickly and transparently to questions and comments.

Our reputation and business could be seriously affected if the Group does not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if it is perceived by the public as failing to meet certain Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards, including labour standards.

We have taken steps to align our CSR standards globally. These steps include formally adhering to the United Nations Global Compact, taking an active role in the Responsible Jewellery Council, and integrating PANDORA Ethics, our CSR and compliance programme, into our entire value chain.

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

CONCENTRATION OF KEY FUNCTIONS IN THAILAND AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION Our production and product development are concentrated in Thailand and supply four distribution centres globally.

Description

Status

We have concentrated key functions in Thailand, including Production and New Product Development. In addition, we have one of four global distribution centres located in Thailand.

We set up a Thailand Business Continuity Management Department in 2012 to monitor any factors that could impact operations or production. The Business Continuity Plan for production has been tested with satisfactory results.

Our operations are dependent on raw materials being imported into Thailand and on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities. In the past, political unrest in Thailand has occasionally caused brief disruptions to our supply chain.

Supply chain disruptions have not had any significant impact on production or product development to date.
We continuously evaluate the benefit and risk of concentrating production and product development in Thailand.

Thailand, including Bangkok, is occasionally hit by heavy monsoon rain, which can result in severe flooding.

We currently have seven crafting facilities in Gemopolis, an industrial zone outside Bangkok. This area is generally well drained and protected from flooding. We have a contingency plan in place should flooding occur, although there have been no significant disruptions to date.
In addition, we are planning to establish a new crafting facility in Northern Thailand. Detailed planning for this facility will begin in 2015.

We operate four global distributions centres responsible for supplying stores with merchandise throughout the year. A major breakdown of IT or facilities with lengthy supply chain outage as a result will impact PANDORA's results.

Our global physical and information security requirements ensure that our operations can be restored to minimise impact on the business.

MAJOR MARKET DEPENDENCY PANDORA's revenue is to some extent exposed to the development in major markets.

Description

Status

We are exposed to performance and development in the major markets. The major markets have experienced solid growth for a substantial period. In the event of a significant market decline or loss of access to a market, this will have an impact on Group results.

We continuously analyse the key drivers of potential growth and failure in major markets.

Major markets constituting 5% or more of the Group's revenue include the US, Canada, the UK, Italy, Germany, Russia and Australia.

We have developed market-specific strategies to ensure continued growth in our major markets.

FLUCTUATIONS IN RAW MATERIAL PRICES An increase in silver or gold prices may have an adverse material effect on PANDORA's business.

Description

Status

Raw materials make up the largest part of the Group's cost of sales. Our products are mainly made of silver and gold, hence these metals account for a significant part of the cost of sales. An increase in silver or gold prices could therefore increase cost of sales significantly.

PANDORA's financial policy requires that exposure to raw material price fluctuations is mitigated, and the Group uses financial instruments to hedge both silver and gold exposure. The Group hedges approximately 100%, 80%, 60% and 40% of the risk for the following 1-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months and 10-12 months respectively. Actual production can deviate from the 12 month rolling production plan. In case of deviations, the realised commodity hedging ratio can deviate from the estimated hedging ratio.

Since PANDORA needs to stay in the affordable luxury segment, it may not be possible to transfer this increased cost to end consumers, as jewellery competes with other fashion, leisure and entertainment products for consumers' discretionary expenditure.

These 12-month rolling hedges, combined with the time lag from inventory turnover, mean that we can take raw material prices into account when selecting the main materials to use in upcoming product launches.

PRODUCT RISK
We are dependent on the performance of launched new collections throughout the year. A large part of our revenue is driven by products launched in the last year.
We have a high exposure to the Charms & Bracelets category as it accounts for a significant part of revenue reported.

Description

Status

Our ability to achieve future goals is dependent on our ability to develop products aligned with market trends and consumers' preferences.

To provide consumers with new and contemporary products, we have seven product launches a year.
When developing new collections, we use data from various sources, including trendspotters, external global design talent and our in-house designers, to ensure that our designs are aligned with market trends.
In addition, we use a data retail insight system to determine how to structure our collections. We also apply product life cycle management, sales-out data and portfolio analysis to ensure that we deliver the optimum split between category, drops, metal and design into the right pricing points.

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

TAX RISKS Changes in the distribution of the Group's profit could have significant impact on the Group's consolidated tax payments.

Description

Status

Due to significant differences in tax rates between Group entities, a change in the distribution of the Group's profit could have significant impact on the Group's consolidated tax payments.
The risk mainly relates to differences in corporate taxation in Denmark and Thailand. Corporate income tax in Denmark is 24.5% (gradually to be reduced to 22% by 2016) while PANDORA Production Co. Ltd. is currently subject to a BOI agreement that significantly reduces the corporate tax rate in Thailand (many types of income are free from taxation, while other types are subject to taxation at 20%).

We maintain an ongoing dialogue with tax authorities, including the Danish and Thai authorities, with regard to the computation of taxable income. In Management's opinion, the tax recognised reflects the most likely amount required to settle the present obligation, including potential tax cases.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS
Responsibility for PANDORA's internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process rests with the Board of Directors and the Executive Board.
The purpose of PANDORA's internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process is to ensure that the financial statements give a true and fair view, free from material misstatements, and to ensure that the financial statements are presented in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies. While the internal controls and risk management systems are designed and aim to ensure that material misrepresentation of assets, losses and/or significant errors or irregularities and omission in the financial reporting are avoided, it provides no absolute assurance that all errors are detected and corrected. Internal controls and risk management systems are under continuous development.
Control environment The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee that assists the Board of Directors in supervising the financial reporting process and the efficiency of PANDORA's internal controls and risk management systems. The Audit Committee reviews significant risks related to PANDORA's business, activities and operations as well as risks related to financial reporting. The Audit Committee seeks to ensure that such risks are managed proactively, efficiently and systematically.
The Executive Board is responsible for maintaining controls and an effective risk management system and it has taken the necessary steps to address the risks identified in relation to financial reporting.
Risk assessment The Board of Directors and Executive Board assess risks on an ongoing basis, including risks related to financial reporting and an assessment of measures to manage or eliminate and/or reduce the identified risk. The Audit Committee reviews certain high-risk areas quarterly, including significant accounting estimates and material changes to accounting policies.
At least once a year, the Audit Committee oversees a review of the current internal controls to consider whether they are effective in relation to the risks identified in the financial reporting process.

Control activities PANDORA operates with a global Finance Management Forum that meets three to four times a year. This forum sets the Finance Strategy for the Group. In addition, PANDORA Finance Manager conferences are held in order to discuss the latest developments in significant accounting matters and best practice regarding internal controls.
Controlling functions in the corporate finance function, reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for controlling the financial reporting from the Parent Company and the subsidiaries, and monitor compliance with relevant legislation on an ongoing basis.
The Group has adopted and defined an internal control framework that identifies key processes, inherent risks and control procedures, in order to secure accounting processes. The control procedures include a variety of processes in order to prevent any misrepresentation, significant errors, omission and fraudulent behaviours. The control procedures are tested bi-annually and reported to the Audit Committee annually.
Information and communication The Board of Directors has adopted an IR policy that prescribes that all communication, including financial reporting, to stakeholders must be conducted adequately, timely, openly internally as well as externally and must be conducted factually and truthfully and with consideration to legislation and applicable regulations.
Monitoring PANDORA's internal controls and risk management systems are continuously monitored, tested, documented and subject to quality control. The Audit Committee monitors the internal controls and risk management systems to ensure that any weaknesses are eliminated and that any material errors are corrected, including controls or procedures implemented to prevent such errors.
PANDORA's external auditors are appointed for a term of one year at the Annual General Meeting upon recommendation by the Board. Prior to recommendation, the Board of Directors assesses, in consultation with the Executive Board, the independence and competencies and other matters pertaining to the auditors.
The framework for the auditors' duties, including their remuneration, audit and non-audit tasks, is agreed annually between the Board of Directors and the auditors upon recommendation by the Audit Committee.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE
It is PANDORA's capital structure policy to maintain an NIBD/EBITDA ratio of 0-1x on a 12-month rolling basis. The Board of Directors determines, on an ongoing basis, whether any surplus capital should be distributed through share buyback programmes or as an extraordinary dividend in order to reach the optimal capital structure.
DIVIDEND
The Board of Directors aims to increase the nominal dividend per share annually. For the financial year 2014, the Board of Directors proposes a dividend of DKK 9.0 per share.
PANDORA shares are traded ex-dividend the day after the Annual General Meeting, which will be held on 18 March 2015. The dividend will be paid automatically via VP Securities on 23 March 2015.
SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME
The Board of Directors is authorised to acquire own shares on behalf of the Company until 17 September 2015 with

a total nominal value of up to 10% of PANDORA's share capital, according to a decision made at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 September 2010. The purpose of the share buyback programme is to reduce PANDORA's share capital, to adjust the capital structure in accordance with the Company's policy on capital structure and to meet obligations arising from employee share option programmes.
Share buyback 2014 5,875,257 shares, corresponding to 4.6% of the share capital, were bought back in 2014 at an average price of DKK 408.5 and a total value of DKK 2.4 billion. At the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose that the Company's share capital be reduced by a nominal amount of DKK 5,818,651 by cancellation of 5,818,651 own shares of DKK 1, equal to 4.5% of the Company's total share capital. The remaining treasury shares may be used to meet obligations arising from employee share option programmes. Total share options outstanding at 31 December 2014 are 1,382,800.
Share buyback 2015 The Board of Directors of PANDORA has decided to launch a share buyback programme in 2015, under which PANDORA expects to buy back own shares to a maximum consideration of DKK 3,900 million.
The share buyback programme is subject to approval of an extension of the current authorisation to acquire own shares on behalf of the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 18 March 2015. PANDORA has bought back own shares corresponding to 7.2% of the share capital under the current authorisation, which allows the Company to acquire own shares with a total nominal value of up to 10% of PANDORA's share capital.
The Board of Directors intends to propose to PANDORA's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2016 that PANDORA's share capital be reduced by shares purchased under the programme. PANDORA may also use shares purchased under the programme to meet obligations

Revenue development Total revenue for 2014 was DKK 11,942 million, an increase of 32.5% or 32.7% in local currency, compared with 2013. All major regions saw significant revenue growth. The development was driven by significant marketing investments, strong retail execution, global network expansion and increasing share of branded sales channels.
At the end of 2014, sales return provisions corresponded to approximately 8% of revenue value which was unchanged from 2013.
Like-for-like sales-out in concept stores in PANDORA's four major markets (US, UK, Germany and Australia) developed positively in all quarters of 2014. The positive development was driven by successful new product launches and generally better execution in stores. About one third of the concept stores' sales-out was generated by new products launched within the last 12 months.

The Group's revenue is realised in different currencies. A 10% deviation in the main currencies (1% deviation for EUR) would have affected revenue by DKK 452 million for USD, DKK 169 million for GBP, DKK 84 million for CAD, DKK 31 million for EUR and DKK 81 million for AUD.
Due to the seasonal nature of the jewellery business, higher revenue is historically realised in the second half of the year. Refer to company announcement no. 217 for a review of the development in Q4.
Revenue breakdown by geography The geographical distribution of revenue in 2014 was 41.5% for the Americas compared with 46.1% in 2013, 44.4% for Europe compared with 41.7% in 2013 and 14.1% for Asia Pacific compared with 12.1% in 2013.

414 Concept stores in Americas

Revenue in the Americas, constituting 41.5% of total Group revenue, was up 19.3% to DKK 4,959 million in 2014 from DKK 4,156 million in 2013. Excluding foreign exchange rate movements, the underlying revenue increase was 20.6% compared with 2013. The increase was driven equally by the US and Other Americas, which benefited from the inclusion of Brazil in the region from 1 January 2014, adding DKK 171 million to revenue. The Disney collection was launched in North America in November, and has been very well received.
Revenue in the US, constituting 30.4% of total Group revenue, was up 13.4% compared with 2013. The growth in local currency was 13.0%. Growth was primarily driven by increasing demand for PANDORA's newer products, as well as an improved store network. The focus on Rings in the US supported growth, with revenue from this category having more than tripled compared with 2013. During 2014, 38 new concept stores were opened in the US, bringing the total number of concept stores to 315. In September 2014, PANDORA purchased a net total of 22 concept stores in the US from former franchisee Hannoush as part of a process

to refresh the store network. The impact of converting wholesale revenue to retail revenue added around DKK 50 million to revenue in the US.
As in 2013, PANDORA experienced positive like-forlike sales-out of US concept stores throughout 2014. The strong sales-out performance was based on strong salesthrough for newly launched products.
Revenue from Other Americas was DKK 1,330 million, an increase of 39.3% compared with 2013. The strong development in the Canadian market continued in 2014 with revenue growth of 22% compared with 2013. Revenue in Canada now accounts for more than 60% of revenue in Other Americas.
The number of branded stores in Americas increased by 225 to a total of 1,978 stores during 2014. By the end of the year, branded stores accounted for 58.5% of the total number of stores compared with 54.2% at the end of 2013.

Revenue in Europe, constituting 44.4% of total Group revenue, was DKK 5,304 million corresponding to an increase of 41.1% or 38.8% in local currency.
The UK is PANDORA's largest single market in Europe, accounting for 13.9% of Group revenue compared with 12.9% in 2013. Revenue in the UK was DKK 1,654 million, up 42.8% or 36.1% in local currency compared with 2013. Growth in the UK was primarily driven by positive salesout development, expansion of the store network and the continued success of the UK eSTORE.
PANDORA experienced positive like-for-like sales-out of UK concept stores throughout 2014. The strong sales-out performance was driven by newness in the overall product assortment driving a significant increase in transactions as well as focus on the Rings category.
Germany accounts for 4.8% of 2014 Group revenue, compared with 6.0% in 2013. Revenue in Germany was DKK 578 million and increased by 6.3% in 2014 compared with 2013.
PANDORA experienced positive like-for-like sales-out of German concept stores throughout 2014, driven by strong performance by PANDORA's owned and operated stores. As part of its ongoing efforts to improve its store network, PANDORA opened 22 owned and operated concept stores in Germany in 2014.

At the end of 2014, PANDORA owned and operated stores made up 61 of the 84 concept stores in Germany.
Revenue in Other Europe was DKK 3,072 million, up 49.3% on 2013. The main drivers of growth were Italy, France and Russia. Growth in these countries was driven by expansion of the store network and continued high like-forlike growth. However, growth in Russia slowed down in Q4. Revenue for the three new markets constituted around 60% of revenue from Other Europe in 2014.
During 2014, the number of branded stores in Europe increased by 281 to a total of 2,843 stores, in line with PANDORA's overall strategy to increase branded sales. The share of branded stores increased compared with 2013, accounting for 48.6% of the total number of stores by the end of 2014 compared with 39.9% in 2013.
The total number of stores in Europe decreased by 563 to a total of 5,851 in 2014 due to the closing of 844 unprofitable unbranded stores.
At the end of 2014, PANDORA had eSTOREs in seven European countries.

in Asia Pacific

Revenue in Asia Pacific was DKK 1,679 million, constituting 14.1% of total Group revenue, and corresponding to an increase of 53.5% or 58.1% in local currency compared with 2013. Growth was driven by a positive development in most of the region.
Revenue in Australia, constituting 6.7% of Group revenue, increased by 18.4% in 2014 compared with 2013. In local currency, the growth was 25.6%. The growth in Australia reflected continued strong sales-out growth, fuelled by successful new launches, as well as an expansion of the branded store network. The Rings category is performing well in Australia and revenue from this category was up 52% compared with 2013. This category represented around 18% of revenue for the year compared with 14% in 2013.

PANDORA experienced positive like-for-like sales-out of Australian concept stores throughout 2014. The positive development was primarily due to an increase in store traffic driven by newness in the stores.
Revenue from Other Asia Pacific, constituting 7.3% of total Group revenue, increased by 111.4% in 2014 compared with 2013. The increase was primarily driven by Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan in a combination of strong like-for-like growth and improvement of the store network.
In Asia Pacific, the distribution network increased by 45 shops to a total of 675 in 2014. The increase was primarily related to an increase in branded stores, which accounted for 80.6% of the total number of stores compared with 77.1% at the end of 2013.

SALES CHANNELS AND PRODUCT MIX

Direct distribution accounted for 96.7% of revenue in 2014 compared with 97.0% in 2013. The increase in distributor revenue showed growth in all markets, but was primarily driven by strong performance in Spain.
Branded sales accounted for 88.5% of total direct sales compared with 84.8% in 2013. Underperforming unbranded stores are being closed across all regions in order to improve the quality of revenue and focus on branded store performance and, as a consequence, the number of unbranded points of sale decreased by 937 stores compared with 2013.
Concept stores accounted for 56.4% of total revenue in 2014 compared with 49.4% in 2013 and PANDORA opened net 310 new concept stores and 183 shop-in-shops during 2014. The expansion of the store network in PANDORA's new markets continues, and the network increased by 137 concept stores and 53 shop-in-shops in 2014.

Revenue from PANDORA's owned and operated stores, including all PANDORA eSTOREs, increased 83% compared to last year and corresponded to 17% of Group revenue compared with around 12% in 2013. The growth in retail revenue was driven by strong in-store execution resulting in positive like-for-like growth as well as the addition of 115 new owned and operated stores in 2014 to a total of 251 concept stores and 70 shop-in-shops.
PRODUCT OFFERING
Revenue from Charms was DKK 7,933 million in 2014, up 26.1% on 2013, while revenue from Silver and gold charm bracelets increased by 23.3% compared with 2013. The two categories represented 78.4% of total revenue in 2014 compared with 82.7% of total revenue in 2013. In November, the Disney collection - comprising 41 Disney

products - was launched in North America, and initial feedback has been positive.
Revenue from Rings was DKK 1,192 million, an increase of 116.7% compared with 2013. The revenue growth in most markets reflected the improved offering as well as an increased commercial effort. This category represented 10.0% of total revenue compared with 6.1% in 2013.
Revenue from Other jewellery was DKK 1,390 million, an increase of 37.6% compared with 2013. The growth was driven by all subcategories, in particular revenue from

other bracelets (including bangles), necklaces and earrings. Other jewellery represented 11.6% of total revenue in 2014 compared with 11.2% in 2013.
In 2014, the average sales price (ASP) recognised by PANDORA was DKK 140, compared with DKK 130 in 2013. The increase in ASP was mainly driven by a higher share of revenue from Rings, which are sold at higher average prices compared to individual charms as well as a proportionally higher share of revenue from PANDORA owned and operated stores. Prices for each individual product were virtually unchanged compared with 2013.

INCOME STATEMENT

GROSS PROFIT

OPERATING EXPENSES

Gross profit was DKK 8,423 million in 2014 compared with DKK 5,999 million in 2013, resulting in a gross margin of 70.5% in 2014 compared with 66.6% in 2013. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to lower prices for silver and gold, as well as a higher share of revenue for PANDORA owned and operated stores, which have a higher gross margin compared with wholesale revenue.
Cost of sales is impacted by hedging of raw materials. Excluding hedging and the time lag effect from inventories, the underlying gross margin would have been approximately 73% based on the average gold (USD 1,266/ oz) and silver (USD 19.08/oz) market prices in 2014. Based on these assumptions, a 10% deviation in quarterly average gold and silver prices would impact our gross margin by approximately +/- 1 percentage points. Reference is made to note 4.4.
COST
Total costs for 2014, including depreciation and amortisation, were DKK 7,870 million, an increase of 24.3% compared with 2013. The increase was primarily due to increasing sales. Costs corresponded to 65.9% of revenue for the year compared with 70.2% in 2013.

Operating expenses in 2014 were DKK 4,351 million compared with DKK 3,318 million in 2013, representing 36.4% of revenue in 2014 compared with 36.8% in 2013.
Sales and distribution expenses increased to DKK 1,957 million in 2014 from DKK 1,517 million in 2013, an increase of 29.0%, and corresponding to 16.4% of revenue in 2014 compared with 16.8% in 2013. The nominal increase in sales and distribution expenses was primarily driven by increasing sales efforts and an increase in the number of PANDORA-owned stores (321 stores in 2014 compared with 206 stores in 2013).
Marketing expenses in 2014 were 9.6% of revenue compared with 9.8% in 2013. Marketing expenses increased to DKK 1,143 million in 2014 from DKK 880 million in 2013. The increase was due to higher PR and media activity.
Administrative expenses amounted to DKK 1,251 million in 2014 compared with DKK 921 million in 2013, representing 10.5% of revenue, up from 10.2% in 2013. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to costs related to relocation of offices, higher IT costs and increased headcount.

EBITDA
EBITDA for 2014 increased by 49.0% to DKK 4,294 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 36.0% compared with 32.0% in 2013.
The EBITDA margin for Americas was 41.4%, down 1.2 percentage points compared with 2013. The decrease was partially due to the inclusion of Brazil in Other Americas (previously included in Other Europe), which had a diluting effect on margins of approximately one percentage point. Furthermore, EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the purchase of inventory from a net total of 22 concept stores from US jeweller Hannoush at wholesale prices which will continue to impact EBITDA negatively until sold out. The EBITDA margin was also affected by the improvement in gross margin from lower raw material prices, which was partially offset by nominally higher customs cost in Canada and Brazil.
The EBITDA margin for Europe increased from 36.1% in 2013 to 43.3% in 2014. The increase in Europe was primarily driven by the increase in gross margin as well as improved leverage on the cost base from an increase in revenue primarily in the UK, Italy and France.
The EBITDA margin for Asia Pacific region improved by 11.7 percentage points to 49.5% in 2014. The improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue in the region as well as improved gross margin.
Unallocated costs were 7.4% of revenue in 2014 compared with 7.4% in 2013.

EBITDA is impacted by different currencies. A 10% increase in average exchange rates for the main currencies (1% deviation for EUR) would impact EBITDA by approximately DKK 164 million for USD, DKK 138 million for GBP, DKK 73 million for CAD, DKK 21 million for EUR, DKK 60 million for AUD and DKK -163 million for THB.
EBIT
EBIT for 2014 increased to DKK 4,072 million (2013: DKK 2,681 million), an increase of 51.9% compared with 2013, resulting in an EBIT margin of 34.1% for 2014 versus 29.8% in 2013.
NET FINANCIALS
Net financials amounted to an expense of DKK 200 million in 2014 compared with income of DKK 61 million in 2013. The decrease in net financials was mainly related to unrealised exchange rate losses.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
Income tax expense was DKK 774 million in 2014 compared with DKK 522 million in 2013, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 20% for 2014 compared with 19% in 2013.

BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW

PANDORA generated a free cash flow of DKK 3,868 million in 2014 compared with DKK 1,956 million in 2013 corresponding to a cash conversion of 124.9% compared with 88.1% in 2013. The improved cash flow was primarily driven by increasing profits as well as a favourable movement in working capital.
Operating working capital at the end of 2014 was 16.7% of revenue, compared with 20.5% at the end of 2013.
Inventories were DKK 1,684 million, up 13.0% on 2013, primarily driven by higher production as a consequence of higher revenue. Compared with 2013, silver and gold prices affected inventories with a decrease of approximately 17%. However, this decrease was more than offset by the higher production.
Trade receivables increased to DKK 1,110 million in 2014 (9.3% of revenue) from DKK 895 million in 2013 (9.9% of revenue).
Trade payables increased to DKK 804 million in 2014 compared with DKK 539 million in 2013. The increase was primarily related to a higher level of activity.
PANDORA invested a total of DKK 455 million in capital expenditure (CAPEX) in 2014, including intangible assets of DKK 164 million mainly related to key money

in connection with the opening of PANDORA-owned stores and IT investments. Investments in property, plant and equipment of DKK 291 million mainly consisted of investments in crafting facilities in Thailand, office relocations and leasehold improvements related to the opening of several stores during the year. CAPEX was 3.8% of 2014 revenue.
During 2014, DKK 2,400 million was used to purchase own shares related to the share buyback programme launched on 18 February 2014. At 31 December 2014, PANDORA held 7,216,058 treasury shares, corresponding to 5.6% of the share capital.
Interest-bearing debt was DKK 10 million at the end of 2014 compared with DKK 49 million at the end of 2013.
Cash amounted to DKK 1,131 million at the end of 2014 compared with DKK 686 million at the end of 2013.
Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) at the end of 2014 was DKK -1,121 million corresponding to a ratio of -0.3 to EBITDA (NIBD/EBITDA).

NOTES

PANDORA is continuously developing the Group's financial reporting. As part of this development, PANDORA has restructured the consolidated financial statements in order to increase focus on what drives the Group's performance. The notes have therefore been grouped into five sections related to key figures. The notes contain the relevant financial information as well as a description of accounting policies applied for the topics of the individual notes.

NOTES
SECTION 1: BASIS OF REPORTING

This section introduces PANDORA's accounting policies and significant accounting estimates. A more detailed description of accounting policies and significant estimates related to specific reported amounts is presented in the respective notes. This is done to provide full transparency on the disclosed amounts, describing the relevant accounting policy, significant estimates and numerical disclosure for each note.

1.1 BASIS OF REPORTING

PANDORA A/S is a public limited company with its registered office in Denmark.
The Annual Report for the period 1 January - 31 December 2014 comprises the consolidated financial statements of PANDORA A/S and its subsidiaries (the Group) as well as separate financial statements for the Parent Company, PANDORA A/S.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for the annual reports of listed companies.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner and all amounts are rounded to the nearest million (DKK million) except where otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies as described below and in the respective notes have been used consistently for the financial year and for the comparative figures.

Accounting policies The overall accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements as a whole are described below. The accounting policies related to specific line items are described in connection with the notes to which they relate.
The description of accounting policies in the notes forms part of the overall description of accounting policies:

The consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which PANDORA obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses, unrealised gains and losses and dividends resulting from intercompany transactions are eliminated in full.

Foreign currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in DKK, which is also the functional currency of the Parent Company. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency, and items recognised in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognised by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.

Consolidated financial statements · 63

NOTES
SECTION 1: BASIS OF REPORTING, CONTINUED

Group companies with another functional currency than DKK The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into DKK at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date, and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
The consolidated income statement The consolidated income statement is presented based on costs classified by function. Cost of sales comprises direct and indirect expenses incurred to generate the revenue for the year, comprising raw materials, consumables, production staff and depreciation of production equipment.
Sales, distribution and marketing expenses comprise expenses related to the distribution of goods sold and sales campaigns, including packaging materials, brochures, wages and salaries and other expenses related to sales and distribution staff and depreciation of distribution equipment.
Administrative expenses comprise expenses incurred in the year to manage PANDORA, including expenses related to administrative staff and amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses.
The distribution of amortisation and depreciation is presented in notes 3.1 and 3.2.
Implementation of new or amended standards and interpretations PANDORA has adopted all new or amended standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the EU and which are effective for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2014.
The implementation of the new or amended standards has not had any material impact on PANDORA's consolidated financial statements.
Standards issued, but not yet effective The IASB has issued a number of new IFRS standards, amended standards, revised standards and IFRIC interpretations, which are effective for financial years beginning after 1 January 2014.

PANDORA is currently assessing the effect of implementing IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 not yet adopted by the EU, expected to be effective on 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2017 respectively. All other new or amended standards and interpretations not yet effective are not expected to have any material impact on PANDORA's consolidated financial statements.

Significant accounting estimates In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management makes various accounting estimates and assumptions which form the basis of the presentation, recognition and measurement of PANDORA's assets and liabilities.
Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimates and assumptions concerning future events. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, which Management assesses to be reasonable, but which by their nature involve uncertainty and unpredictability. These assumptions may have to be revised, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur.
PANDORA is subject to risks and uncertainties which may lead to actual results differing from these estimates, both positively and negatively. Specific risks for PANDORA are discussed in the relevant sections of the Management's review and in the notes.
Management regards estimates related to return provisions, valuation of inventories and tax as key estimates. However, all significant accounting estimates are described in the following notes:

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR

This section comprises notes related to the results for the year, including operating segment disclosures, and provides additional information related to two of PANDORA's key targets: revenue and EBITDA.
In 2014, Group revenue was DKK 11,942 million compared with DKK 9,010 million in 2013. The continued growth in revenue across all major regions was driven by a strong network roll-out strategy and

consistent, high like-for-like growth in all regions supported by successful new product launches.
A detailed description of the results for the year is given in the Financial review section of the Management´s review.

Accounting policies Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to PANDORA and the revenue can be reliably measured and when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, sales taxes and duties.
Provisions for rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers are recognised as a reduction of revenue on the basis of historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements.
The effect of expected returns is recorded as a reduction of gross profit, ie. revenue and cost of sales. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for expected sales returns is recognised.

2.2 SEGMENT INFORMATION
PANDORA's activities are segmented on the basis of geographical areas in accordance with the management reporting structure.
In determining reporting segments, a number of segments have been aggregated. All segments derive their revenue from the types of products shown in the product information in note 2.1.
The Group operates with two performance measures, both measured on business performance. EBITDA is the

primary performance measure and EBIT the secondary performance measure.
Management monitors the segment profit of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance management. Segment results are measured as EBITDA, corresponding to `operating profit' in the consolidated financial statements before amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses in respect of non-current assets.

The Group's pension plans are primarily defined contribution plans. PANDORA has defined benefit plans relating to obligations to pay a defined benefit to employees in Thailand and Italy. The defined benefit plans are recognised at the present value of the actuarially measured

obligations. In 2014, these obligations amounted to DKK 20 million (2013: DKK 9 million). The increased obligation was due to a combination of an increased number of employees and increased wages and salaries.

2.3 STAFF COSTS, CONTINUED

Accounting policies Wages and salaries, social security contributions, leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised in the year in which the services are rendered by employees of PANDORA. Whenever PANDORA provides long-term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees.

Termination benefits are recognised at the time an agreement between PANDORA and the employee is made and no future service is provided by the employee in exchange for the benefits.

2.4 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND EMPLOYEE SHARES

The decision to grant share options is made by the Board of Directors in accordance with general guidelines on incentive payments for PANDORA A/S. Share options have

been granted to members of the Executive Board, selected members of the Board of Directors and other key employees in PANDORA.

The total cost of share-based payments was DKK 71 million (2013: DKK 64 million). The cost of share-based payments is included in staff costs. In the remaining vesting periods, an amount of DKK 62 million (2013: DKK 59 million) is expected to be recognised in respect of the current share option programmes.
As part of the severance agreement with Allan Leighton, participation (pro rata) in the upcoming programmes expected for 2015 and 2016 has been agreed. Salary costs relating to this participation has been included in 2014 for share-based payments with an amount of DKK 7 million.
For options exercised in 2014, the average share price was DKK 354.5 at the time of vesting.

Granted in 2014 In 2014, PANDORA granted a total of 227,555 share options. The market value at the grant date was DKK 78 million. The value of the programme is recognised over the vesting period based on the likelihood that targets for group revenue and EBITDA for 2016 will be reached, and that the share options will vest.
Granted in 2013 In 2013, PANDORA granted a total of 540,523 share options in two different share-based programmes. One programme comprises 103,295 options with a vesting

period of only one year and a market value at the grant date of DKK 14 million. The other share-based programme comprises 437,228 options with a vesting period of three years and a market value of DKK 64 million. The value of the programmes is recognised over the vesting periods based on the likelihood that targets for group revenue and EBITDA for 2013 and 2015 respectively will be reached, and that the share options will vest.

Granted in 2012 In 2012, PANDORA granted 1,009,977 share options. The recognised value of the share options in the income statement and in equity is based on the number of shares expected to vest in February 2015 as the targets for this programme are reached.

Accounting policies Key employees of PANDORA receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (`equity-settled transactions').
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The calculated fair values are based on the Black-Scholes model for measuring share options. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and PANDORA's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expenses recognised at the beginning and end of that period.

Assumptions Assumptions concerning the calculation of fair value at date of grant:
Given that the exercise price for one option equals 1% of the market price of one share at grant date, the fair value of one option almost equals the market value of one share at grant date. The assumptions listed below therefore have a very limited impact on the estimated fair value of the options granted.

NOTES
SECTION 2: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR, CONTINUED

2.5 TAXATION, CONTINUED

Accounting policies Income tax The Group is taxed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from the date they are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date on which they are no longer consolidated. Current tax assets and liabilities for current and prior periods are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted, by the reporting date, in the countries where PANDORA operates and generates taxable income.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance-sheet liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available. The deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be offset against this profit except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will

be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the Group had a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax relates to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority.
Significant accounting estimates PANDORA is subject to income tax worldwide. Significant estimates are required in determining the worldwide accrual for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and provision for uncertain tax positions.
Due to significant differences in tax rates between the Group entities, a change in the distribution of the Group's profit could have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated tax payments. For instance, the corporate tax rate in Denmark is 24.5% (will gradually be reduced to 22% in 2016) while in Thailand PANDORA is subject to a Board of Investment agreement (BOI) which significantly reduces Thailand income taxes.
Under the Thailand BOI, many types of net income are free from taxation, while other types of income are subject to 20% tax. This rate applies to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Before that the rate was reduced from 30% to 23% in 2012. Under the tax legislation in Thailand, the classification of different types of income and expenses therefore determines the amount of tax payable. (The BOI status of PANDORA Production Co. Ltd. has currently been granted until Q3 2020).
PANDORA has ongoing dialogue with tax authorities with regard to the computation of taxable income, including the Danish and Thai authorities. In Management's opinion, the tax expense recognised reflects the most likely amount required to settle the present obligation, including potential tax cases.

INVESTNEDOTECS APITAL AND WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS

The notes in this section describe the assets that form the basis for the activities of PANDORA and the related liabilities.

Additions to invested capital in 2014 included the acquisition of a net total of 22 concept stores from US jeweller Hannoush, DKK 143 million.

Approximately 80% of invested capital is made up of intangible assets, the value of which remains unchanged as both the PANDORA brand and free cash flow continue to grow.

Working capital at the end of 2014 was 16.7% of revenue, compared with 20.5% at the end of 2013.
Financial risks are described in note 4.4.

1 P ANDORA's acquisition of all of the voting shares in PANDORA Production Co. Ltd. and the Danish companies Populair A/S and Pilisar ApS. The companies comprise the Danish headquarters and the Thai crafting facilities.

Goodwill Goodwill was acquired in connection with the acquisitions of PANDORA Jewelry A/S, PANDORA Jewelry America ApS (subsequently merged with PANDORA A/S), PANDORA Production Co. Ltd. (Thailand) and Pilisar ApS on 7 March 2008, the acquisition of AD Astra Holdings Pty Ltd. in July 2009 and the acquisition of PANDORA Jewelry Central Western Europe A/S in 2010. Additions in 2014 mainly relate to the acquisition of a net total of 22 concept stores from US jeweller Hannoush.
Brand The brand `PANDORA' is the only brand of the Group that is capitalised as an asset in the financial statements. It is built on a group of complementary intangible assets relating to the brand, domain name, product, image and customer experience related to products sold under the PANDORA brand. The brand was acquired with the PANDORA core business in 2008.
Distribution network The distribution network covers PANDORA's relations with its distributors. The main part of the distribution network was acquired with the PANDORA core business in 2008.
Distribution rights Distribution rights are mainly related to the distribution rights for PANDORA products in North America. They were acquired with the American distributor in 2008 and the carrying amount was DKK 1,034 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 1,034 million).
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly comprise software implementation projects.

Accounting policies All intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. Reference is made to `Significant accounting estimates' below.
Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised at the amount by which the purchase price for a business combination exceeds the recognised value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill comprises future growth expectations, buyer-specific synergies, the workforce in place and know-how. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised, and impairment losses charged in previous years are not reversed.
Brand Brand is measured based on the Relief from Royalty method. The brand is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Based on the very long future life expected for the brand, any set time would be arbitrary.
Distribution network The distribution network is initially recognised at fair value based on an estimation of the costs the entity avoids by owning the intangible assets and not needing to rebuild it (the cost approach). The distribution network is amortised over an expected life of 15 years.
Distribution rights The distribution rights for PANDORA products in the North American markets are measured based on a residual model, since the distribution agreement underlying the distribution rights is non-terminable. Consequently, the distribution

Consolidated financial statements · 77

NOTES
SECTION 3: INVESTED CAPITAL AND WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS, CONTINUED

3.1 INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONTINUED

rights are considered to have an indefinite useful life. Other acquired distribution rights are measured based
on the Multi-period Excess Earnings model and amortised over their useful lives.
Other intangible assets Software is measured at cost and amortised over three years.
Significant accounting estimates At each reporting date, PANDORA assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing of an asset is required, PANDORA estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) less costs to sell and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for the individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash

flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.
Goodwill and distribution rights are allocated to five CGUs: Americas, UK, Central Western Europe, Australia and distributors & travel retail. The recoverable amount has been based on a calculation of the value in use using cash flow estimates based on budgets and expectations for the next three years. The long-term growth rate in the terminal period has been set to equal the expected long-term rate of inflation of 2.0% (2013: 2.0%).
The brand is applied and supported globally in all of the Group's entities. Through common strategy and product development at Group level and marketing in the individual sales entities, the brand is maintained and preserved. Therefore, the brand is tested for impairment at Group level. The calculations of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs are based on the following key assumptions:
Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU. The Group discount rates have been estimated based on a weighted average cost of

capital for the industry. The rates have further been adjusted to reflect the market assessment of any risk specific to the CGU.
The EBIT figures used in the impairment test are based on the budget for next year, prepared and approved by Management, and the expectations for the two subsequent years. The EBIT margin in the budget of the individual CGU is based on historical experience and expectations to: · revenue growth considering development in network
(store openings, retail/wholesale share), product mix and market share · cost of sales based on metal consumption and average lagged hedge commodity prices at the time the budget is prepared · OPEX development

· c urrency rates are based on actual rates at the time the budget is prepared.
The net working capital in the budget for next year, relative to the revenue of the individual CGUs, is based on historical experience and is maintained for the remainder of the expected lives. The working capital is thus increased on a linear basis as the level of activity increases.
The impairment tests did not show any need for impairment losses to be recognised. In Management's opinion, no probable change in any of the key assumptions mentioned above would cause the carrying amount of the Group or CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.

PANDORA has a large number of individually insignificant leases. The leases are mainly for stores, offices and copy machines etc. The increase in commitments in 2014 is mainly related to new owned and operated concept stores, including the stores acquired from US jeweller Hannoush, and the lease for a new Danish headquarters from April 2016.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.

Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Operating lease payments are recognised as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The write-downs of inventories are recognised in Cost of sales DKK 130 million (2013: DKK 209 million), and Distribution expenses DKK 80 million

(2013: DKK 51 million).

Inventories at 31 December 2014 include inventories at a nominal value of DKK 1,930 million (2013: DKK 1,790 million), which have been written down to DKK 1,684 million (2013: DKK 1,490 million).
Silver and gold prices decreased in 2014, leading to losses on re-melting of goods, with a negative impact on gross profit of DKK 136 million (2013: DKK 189 million).
Accounting policies Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows: · raw materials ­ purchase costs on a first-in, first-out
basis · finished goods and work in progress ­ cost of direct
materials and labour and a proportion of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Significant accounting estimates Net realisable value Net realisable value is the re-melt value or the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and distribution. The re-melt value is based on the weight of silver and gold in the products and the market prices for silver and gold on the reporting date. Future changes in the market prices of silver or gold will result in changes in the re-melt value.

PANDORA divides inventories into four categories: introduction, released-for-sale, phasing-out and discontinued. Group Supply Chain monitors the sales-out of all products and, based on sales ratios, some products may be regarded as slow-moving and thus assigned to the categories phasing-out or discontinued. The part of discontinued inventory that is not expected to be sold is written down to re-melt value. Inventories in the phasingout category can be sold on normal terms or transferred to the discontinued category, and the amount expected to be transferred to discontinued is therefore written down as described above.
Sales forecasts are used to assess which products in the released-for-sale category need to be written down. Inventories exceeding estimated demand for the next 12 months are written down.
Historically, PANDORA has not made any significant write-downs as a result of damaged goods.
Capitalised production overheads Capitalised production overheads are calculated using a standard cost method, which is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant assumptions concerning capacity utilisation, lead times and other relevant factors. The carrying amount of capitalised production overheads was DKK 39 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 24 million).

Trade receivables at 31 December 2014 include receivables at a nominal value of DKK 1,133 million (2013: DKK 928 million), which have been written down to DKK 1,110 million (2013: DKK 895 million).
Historically, PANDORA has not suffered any significant bad debt losses.
Accounting policies Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, such financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Any losses arising from impairment are recognised in the income statement as administrative expenses.

A write-down for bad or doubtful debts is made if there is any indication of impairment of a receivable or a portfolio of receivables. The write-down is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows associated with the receivable. The discount rate used is the effective interest rate for the individual receivable or portfolio.

Sales return and warranty provisions In 2014, provisions for warranty claims were reclassified so that they are now presented together with return provisions. This is due to a change in the handling of warranty claims, which now mainly lead to replacements instead of repairs.
PANDORA only provides return rights to customers in some countries. Sales return provisions in 2014 mainly related to the Americas, DKK 460 million (2013: DKK 353 million).
Other provisions Other provisions include a provision for onerous contracts due to the future relocation of PANDORA's office in Denmark which may lead to a period of rent payments for an empty location.
Earn-outs, acquisition of non-controlling interests The earn-out payment provision DKK 0 million (2013: DKK 0 million) relates to the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in PANDORA Jewelry Central Western Europe A/S.

Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when PANDORA has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to any provision is recognised in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
A provision for estimated sales returns is recognised when there is historical experience or when a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made. The provision is recognised at the gross margin on the expected returns.
Significant accounting estimates In some countries, PANDORA has provided return rights to customers. The provision is to a large extent based on historical return patterns and changes in future return patterns may therefore result in changes compared to the provision recognised. Provisions are also made on a case by case basis when PANDORA expects to take back specific goods for commercial reasons.

SECTION 4
CAPITALNSOTTERSUCTURE AND NET FINANCIALS

This section includes notes related to PANDORA's capital structure and net financials, including financial risks (see note 4.4). As a consequence of its operations, investments and financing, PANDORA is exposed to a number of financial risks that are monitored and managed via PANDORA's Group Treasury. PANDORA uses a number of financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and similar. Financial instruments are described in note 4.5.

The basis of PANDORA's capital management is the NIBD/EBITDA ratio, which Management seeks to maintain between 0 and 1. At 31 December 2014, the ratio was -0.3. PANDORA's ability to keep this low ratio is based on the high cash conversion. The cash conversion was 124.9% in 2014 compared with 88.1% in 2013.

Capital management The principal objectives of PANDORA's capital management are to ensure shareholders a competitive return on their investment and to ensure that PANDORA will be able to meet all the commitments set out in the loan agreements with the banks. The basis of PANDORA's capital management is the NIBD/EBITDA ratio. It is the policy of the Group that this ratio should be between 0 and 1 on a 12-month rolling basis. At 31 December 2014, the NIBD/ EBITDA ratio was -0.3 (2013: -0.2).

In February 2014, PANDORA obtained a new revolving credit facility in the amount of DKK 1,000 million. Total committed credit facilities amount to DKK 3,500 million (2013: DKK 2,500 million) and are committed until July 2018.
Accounting policies Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium at inception and fees and costs.

4.4 FINANCIAL RISKS
As a consequence of its operations, investments and financing, PANDORA is exposed to a number of financial risks that are monitored and managed via PANDORA's Group Treasury.
To manage financial risks, PANDORA uses a number of financial instruments, such as forward contracts, silver and gold swaps, currency and interest rate swaps, options and similar instruments within the framework of its current policies. Financial risks are divided into commodity price risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
Financial risk related to commodity prices PANDORA's raw material risk is the risk of fluctuating commodity prices resulting in additional costs. The most important raw materials are silver and gold, which are priced in USD by suppliers.
It is the policy of PANDORA to ensure stable, predictable raw material prices. Based on a rolling 12-month production plan, the policy is for Group Treasury

to hedge approximately 100%, 80%, 60% and 40% of the risk for the following 1-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months and 10-12 months respectively. Any deviation from the policy must be approved by the Group CFO and the Audit Committee. Commodity hedging is updated at the end of each month or in connection with revised 12-month rolling production plans. Actual production can deviate from the 12 months rolling productions plan. In case of deviations, the realised commodity hedging ratio can deviate from the estimated hedging ratio. For fair value of hedging instruments see note 4.5.

4.4 FINANCIAL RISKS, CONTINUED

Foreign currency risk PANDORA's presentation currency is DKK, but the majority of PANDORA's activities and investments are in other currencies. Consequently, there is a substantial risk of exchange rate fluctuations having a negative impact on PANDORA's reported cash flows, profit (loss) and/or financial position in DKK.
The majority of PANDORA's revenue is in USD, CAD, AUD, GBP and EUR. A drop in the strength of these currencies against DKK will result in a decline in the translated future cash flows. A substantial portion of PANDORA's costs are related to raw materials purchased from suppliers that price their products in USD. PANDORA also purchases raw materials and pays other costs in THB. Exchange rate increases will result in a decline in the translated value of future cash flows. PANDORA finances the majority of its subsidiaries' needs for cash via intercompany loans denominated in the local currency of the individual subsidiary. A drop in the strength of these currencies against DKK will result in a foreign exchange loss in the Parent Company. PANDORA owns foreign subsidiaries where the translation of equity into DKK is influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Declining

exchange rates will result in a foreign exchange loss in the Group's equity.
Exchange rate fluctuations may lead to a decrease in revenue and an increase in costs and thus declining margins. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations affect the translated value of the profit or loss of foreign subsidiaries and the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
It is PANDORA's policy to hedge foreign currency risks related to the risk of declining net cash flows resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. PANDORA basically does not hedge balance sheet items or ownership interests in foreign subsidiaries. It is PANDORA's policy for its Group Treasury to hedge 100% of the risk 1-3 months forward, 80% of the risk 4-6 months forward, 60% of the risk 7-9 months forward and 40% of the risk 10-12 months forward, based on a rolling 12-month liquidity budget. Foreign currency hedging is updated at the end of each quarter or in connection with revised 12-month rolling cash forecasts.
Below is an illustration of the impact in DKK million on the net profit and changes in equity resulting from a change in the Group's primary foreign currencies after the effect of hedge accounting.

4.4 FINANCIAL RISKS, CONTINUED

Credit risk PANDORA's credit risk is primarily related to trade receivables, cash and unrealised gains on financial contracts. The maximum credit risk related to financial assets corresponds to the carrying amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
It is PANDORA's policy for subsidiaries to be responsible for credit evaluation and credit risk on their trade receivables. In case of deviation from standard agreements, Group Treasury and/or the CFO must approve any significant transactions related to direct distributors and local key customers.
Note 3.4 includes an overview of the credit risk related to trade receivables.
Credit risks related to PANDORA's other financial assets mainly include cash and unrealised gains on financial contracts. The credit risk is related to default of the counterparty with a maximum risk corresponding to the carrying amount of the assets. It is PANDORA's policy for Group Treasury to monitor and manage these credit risks.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of PANDORA's cash not covering PANDORA's payables due.
The aim of liquidity management is to maintain optimal cash resources to fund PANDORA's commitments at all times, to minimise interest and bank costs and to avoid

financial distress. PANDORA's Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing PANDORA's total liquidity position. PANDORA currently does not use cash pools, but intercompany loans exist between PANDORA A/S and its subsidiaries. Whenever possible, liquidity is accumulated in PANDORA A/S.
PANDORA's cash resources comprise cash and unutilised committed and uncommitted credit facilities. It is Management's opinion that the cash resources of the Group and the Parent Company are adequate. It is PANDORA's policy to ensure adequate cash resources in case of unforeseen cash fluctuations.
PANDORA has revolving credit facilities of DKK 3,500 million, which are committed until July 2018. Furthermore, PANDORA has minor local uncommitted credit facilities to ensure efficient and flexible local liquidity management. These credits are facilitated by PANDORA's Group Treasury.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of interest rate fluctuations resulting in additional costs. Most of PANDORA's interest rate risk is related to floating-rate loans. It is PANDORA's policy to minimise interest rate risk by managing the overall duration of interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. At the reporting date, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings were unhedged.

4.5 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and liabilities are measured at cost with the exception of financial instruments (forward contracts etc.), which are measured at fair value.
PANDORA uses a number of financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices,

exchange rates and interest rates. Financial instruments include forward commodity contracts, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps.

Classification according to the fair value hierarchy The fair value at 31 December 2014 and 2013 of PANDORA's financial instruments was measured in accordance with level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (IFRS 7). Level 2 is based on non-quoted prices, observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). PANDORA uses third-party valuation specialists to quote prices for the unrealised financial instruments. The value of unrealised silver and gold instruments are tested against the prices observable at LBMA (London Bullion Market Association). The value of unrealised foreign exchange instruments are tested against observable foreign exchange forward rates.
Accounting policies Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date on which a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation methods. Such methods may include comparison with recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same or discounted cash flow analysis.

PANDORA has designated certain financial instruments as cash flow hedges as defined under IAS 39. Hedge accounting is classified as cash flow hedge when hedging variability in cash flow is attributable to a highly probable forecast transaction. PANDORA uses a range of 80% to 125% for hedge effectiveness and any relationship which has effectiveness outside this range is deemed to be ineffective and hedge accounting is suspended. PANDORA designates and documents all hedging relationships between commodity contracts and transactions.
Financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the unrealised gain or loss on all hedging instruments is recognised directly as other comprehensive income in the equity hedging reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised in net financials.
The effective part of the realised gain or loss on a commodity hedging transaction is recognised in Group inventories whereas the ineffective part is realised in net financials. The realised gain or loss on all forward exchange contracts is recognised in net financials.

Accounting policies Finance income and costs comprise interest income and expenses, realised and unrealised gains and losses on payables/receivables and transactions in foreign currencies. For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income or expenses are recognised using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.

5.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Acquisitions in 2014 Acquisition of a net total of 22 concept stores from Hannoush On 22 September 2014, PANDORA acquired 27 stores from US jeweller Hannoush in a business combination. With the acquisition of the 27 stores PANDORA will execute its strategy to refresh its network in the Northeast region of the US.
The purchase consideration was DKK 162 million and was paid in cash. There were no other significant terms or payments related to the acquisition. The transaction costs, DKK 1 million, have been recognised as administrative expenses in profit or loss for 2014.
Five of the acquired stores located outside the Northeast region were re-sold to an existing franchisee on 22 September 2014. The sale did not have any effect on profit or loss. The net cash effect from the Hannoush acquisition was an outflow of DKK 143 million.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed mainly comprise inventories, equipment and obligations to restore the leased premises. Inventories have been measured at market value based on the saleability of the individual items.
Goodwill from the acquisition amounted to DKK 81 million (excluding goodwill of DKK 6 million related to

the five stores that were re-sold), and is attributable to the expected synergies from an increased presence in the region, including the effect from a refreshed network. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for income tax purposes.
The 22 stores contributed approximately DKK 95 million in revenue and DKK 22 million in net profit since the acquisition on 22 September 2014. If the stores had been acquired on 1 January 2014, revenue and net profit would have been DKK 115 million and DKK 4 million higher respectively.
Other business combinations in 2014 PANDORA acquired concept stores in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands in 2014. These were accounted for as business combinations. Assets acquired mainly consist of key money and other assets relating to the stores. Of the purchase price, DKK 6 million was allocated to goodwill. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for income tax purposes.
The impact on revenue and net profit for 2014 from the acquired stores was insignificant. If the stores had been owned from the beginning of the year, the impact on PANDORA's revenue and net profit would have been equally insignificant.

(the name has subsequently been changed to PANDORA do Brasil Comércio e Importação Ltda.), based in São Paulo, obtaining control of the company. The company is a retail company with eight stores and an e-store operating in five cities in Brazil.
With the acquisition, PANDORA has strengthened its presence in a country with great potential. A base in Brazil will provide PANDORA with the opportunity to directly affect distribution in Brazil and other South American markets.
The above table summarises the consideration paid for City Time do Brasil Comércio e Importação Ltda., and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
The purchase price was DKK 40 million, of which DKK 2 million was deferred. The deferred payment was due on 1 January 2018, but the amount was paid in full in 2014.
Acquisition-related costs of DKK 1 million were recognised as administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Assets and liabilities assumed mainly comprise key money, property, plant and equipment related to the acquired stores, inventories and accounts payable. The market value of key money is calculated annually by the centre operators and is deemed to have an indefinite life.

The goodwill of DKK 30 million arising from the acquisition is attributable to the expected synergies from a strengthened presence and increased opportunities to improve both the retail and wholesale markets in South America while maintaining control of the PANDORA brand. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for income tax purposes.
Other acquisitions in 2013 In 2013, PANDORA acquired concept stores that have been accounted for as business combinations and are also recognised in the line acquisition of subsidiaries and activities.
Impact on the consolidated financial statements The acquisitions have neither individually nor in combination had any significant impact on the Group's revenue or net profit. If the acquired companies had been owned by the Group from the beginning of the year, there would have been no significant impact on Group revenue or Group net profit.
Acquisition after the reporting period Strategic alliance in Japan On 1 January 2015, PANDORA acquired assets related to the distribution of PANDORA jewellery in Japan from Bluebell in a business combination. In addition to the distribution rights, assets included branded stores ­ one concept store and nine shop-in-shops. The acquisition was part of a strategic alliance with Bluebell in Japan with the intent to jointly distribute PANDORA jewellery in Japan.

SECTION 5: OTHER DISCLOSURES, CONTINUED

5.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, CONTINUED

The agreement initially has a five-year term. On termination of the agreement, PANDORA will take over the full distribution of PANDORA jewellery in Japan. The total amount to be paid to Bluebell will depend on the realised revenue in 2019. The discounted fair value of the earn-out is DKK 55 million.
Intangible assets comprise reacquired distribution rights (remaining lifespan approximately three years) of DKK 29 million. The fair value is based on comparison of peer markets similar to the Japanese market and the EBITDA that can be expected from similar stores in these markets.
Inventories, DKK 6 million, have been measured at market value based on the saleability of the individual items.
Goodwill is attributable to the expected synergies from combining PANDORA's willingness and ability to invest in the Japanese market with Bluebell's in-depth knowledge of the Japanese retail market, Japanese consumers and insight into the Japanese real estate market, to build a considerable presence in Japan. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for income tax purposes.
Transaction costs, DKK 3 million, have been recognised as administrative expenses in profit or loss for 2014.
Acquisition of Pan Me A/S On 16 January 2015, PANDORA acquired 100% of the shares in Pan Me A/S. Pan Me A/S holds the rights to distribute PANDORA jewellery in the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
PANDORA has paid the purchase price of DKK 110 million primarily related to the rights to distribute PANDORA jewellery in the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, as well as non-current assets and inventories related to 11 concept stores and three shop-in-shops in the UAE. An amount of DKK 1 million is withheld until fulfilment of certain conditions related to inventories.
Due to the late closing date of the acquisition, it has not been practically possible to prepare the initial accounting for the business combination. The purchase price allocation for the acquisition will be included in the interim financial report for the first quarter of 2015.

China In February 2015, PANDORA entered an agreement with Oracle Investment (Hong Kong) Limited ("Oracle") about joint distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018. At the end of the agreement, PANDORA will take over the full distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China. On 1 July 2015, PANDORA will, as part of the agreement with Oracle, purchase the majority of Oracle's assets in China. The agreement is subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled.
Due to the subsequent closing date, it is not possible to prepare the accounting for the business combination.
Accounting policies Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to those of PANDORA's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination. Where goodwill forms part of a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is recognised in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative value of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.
If any part of the cost of an acquisition is contingent on future events or achievements, this cost is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition.

sheet, the Group does not expect to incur any significant financial losses as a result of these contracts.
Significant accounting estimates Litigation The factors taken into account when estimating a potential liability in connection with litigation include the nature of the litigation or claim.

SECTION 5: OTHER DISCLOSURES, CONTINUED

5.8 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Germany In January 2015, PANDORA entered into an agreement with DHG GmbH (DHG) to take over up to 78 commercial leaseholds in Germany formerly trading under the BiBa name (a ladies fashion brand). PANDORA will pay a service fee to DHG for making the leaseholds available. All 78 leaseholds concern stand-alone stores located in prime locations in Germany that fit well with our existing concept store expansion strategy in Germany. During 2015, PANDORA will open owned and operated concept stores in the new locations, some of which will be a relocation of existing PANDORA-owned stores.
The total investment for the new owned and operated stores, including establishment and relocation of stores (including initial inventory in the stores), costs related to temporarily inactive stores in the transition period, service fees to DHG as well as all other costs related to store implementation, is expected to be around EUR 50 million (approximately DKK 370 million), of which the majority will be recognised as CAPEX and inventories. The funds will be spent over the course of 2015.
China In February 2015, PANDORA entered an agreement with Oracle Investment (Hong Kong) Limited ("Oracle") about joint distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018. At the end of the agreement, PANDORA will take over the full distribution of PANDORA jewellery in China.

PANDORA plans, through the cooperation, to accelerate the store roll-out, enhance the retail focus and make significant marketing investments in the Chinese market. Oracle will contribute with its in-depth knowledge of the retail market and the Chinese consumer as well as their insight into the Chinese real estate market, which will aid PANDORA in securing the most attractive locations.
On 1 July 2015, PANDORA will, as part of the agreement with Oracle, purchase the majority of Oracle's assets in China. The term of the agreement ends December 2018. The total amount to be paid to Oracle will depend on the realised revenue in 2018 and part of the payment will be delayed to end of the term of the agreement. The initial payment to Oracle is expected to be approximately HKD 120 million (or approximately DKK 100 million), depending on the value of the assets at the time of the completion of the agreement. The total payment will be in the range of HKD 200-500 million (or approximately DKK 170-420 million). The agreement is subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled.
Major shareholder announcement On 16 February 2015 PANDORA was notified by BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited that BlackRock, Inc. has increased its holding of shares in PANDORA A/S at 13 February 2015 to 6,434,446 shares, corresponding to 5.02% of the share capital and the voting rights.

PANDORA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

NOTES FOR THE PARENT COMPANY

1.1 SUPPLEMENT TO MANAGEMENT´S REVIEW FOR THE GROUP

Inventory CWE The financial statements of PANDORA A/S are affected by a transaction with the subsidiary PANDORA Jewelry Central Western Europe A/S (CWE). Since 2012, wholesale inventory for all European countries has been centralised and owned by PANDORA A/S. Part of the inventory was sold by PANDORA A/S to CWE in December 2014 at normal sales prices at a total value of DKK 177 million. At 31 December 2014, CWE consequently owned the wholesale inventory related to CWE markets. The transaction was completed as a result of the earn-out agreement with PANDORA's former distributor in Central Western Europe in order to neutralise the sale of the wholesale inventory in 2012.
Gross profit The Parent Company takes back inventory from subsidiaries for the purpose of re-melting excess inventory. Gross profit

is significantly impacted by realised losses from re-melting activities and unrealised losses from inventory write-downs. Fluctuations in market prices of silver and gold have a major impact on gross profit.
Hedging transactions The Parent Company realised a net loss of DKK 7 million (2013: DKK 0 million) on commodity hedge contracts. A net loss of DKK 12 million relates to the elimination of overhedged positions. A net gain of DKK 5 million (2013: DKK 0 million) relates to efficient hedging of re-melt of metal.
Earn-out Changes in the value of the earn-out provision are recognised in the income statement as finance income or finance costs. In 2014, there were no adjustments (2013: DKK 0 million).

1.2 BASIS OF REPORTING

Parent Company financial statements The accounting policies for the Parent Company are unchanged from last year and identical to the accounting policies in PANDORA's consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:
Foreign currency translation Foreign exchange adjustments of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment in enterprises that have a functional currency other than DKK are recognised in profit for the year as net financials in the Parent Company financial statements.
Dividends from investments in subsidiaries are recognised in the financial year in which they are received.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the Parent Company financial statements. Impairment testing is carried out if there is any indication of impairment, as described in PANDORA's consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised as a finance cost in profit for the year. If the Parent Company has a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries, a provision for this is recognised.

Significant accounting estimates In the process of preparing the Parent Company financial statements, a number of accounting estimates and judgements have been made that affect assets and liabilities at the reporting date and income and expenses for the reporting period. Management regularly reassesses these estimates and judgements, partly on the basis of historical experience and a number of other factors in the given circumstances. Management is of the opinion that no accounting estimates or judgements are made in connection with the presentation of the Parent Company financial statements applying the Parent Company accounting policies that are material to the financial reporting, other than those disclosed in note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements concerning impairment testing.
New standards and interpretations Reference is made to the description in note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Earn-out, acquisition of non-controlling interests The earn-out payment provision relates to the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in PANDORA Jewelry Central Western Europe A/S.
Sales return provisions Provisions regarding returns of products from customers are based on historical return percentages. Where the return prices are reduced over time, this has been taken into account in the calculation of the provisions.
From time to time, the Parent Company takes back inventory from subsidiaries, primarily related to discontinued items and excess inventory.

Inventory is taken back at original sales prices invoiced to the subsidiaries. The provision represents expected losses in the Parent Company related to expected returns from subsidiaries of discontinued products included in inventories at subsidiaries at year end. This does not impact PANDORA's consolidated financial statements.
Other provisions Other provisions include a provision for onerous contracts due to the future relocation of PANDORA's office in Denmark, which may lead to a period of rent payments for an empty location.

The consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and Parent Company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for such internal control that Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and Parent Company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation of consolidated financial statements and Parent Company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.
