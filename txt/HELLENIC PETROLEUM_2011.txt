Message to Shareholders

Christos - Alexis omninos
Chairman of the BoD

John Costopoulos
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholders,
2011 was a year of significant challenges. However, despite the unfavourable European and domestic environment, our Group's performance remained positive.

The economic crisis that has characterized the past few years continues to affect the development of the western world, being more pronounced in southern Europe, especially in Greece. Political and social instability, which prevailed in certain oil producing countries and its effect on crude oil availability, maintained high crude oil prices. This development, combined with the decline in oil products demand in Europe and North America, resulted in a drop in refining margins, directly affecting industry players and their profitability, particularly in Europe. Many European refineries were forced to reduce their production, while others had to permanently shut down or be converted into storage facilities. Constantly increasing environmental demands and the gradual adoption of new technologies, continued to intensify pressure

and competition within the sector, mainly in advanced European economies.
In Greece, the recession-induced income reduction combined with the large increases in excise duties on oil products and the decline in activity in key areas of the economy, led to a sharp drop of 8% in overall fuel demand, while the decrease in auto fuels reached 11%. The uncertainty in the environment, lack of liquidity, high borrowing costs and credit risks have further exacerbated the situation.
Our Group, four years ago, launched a wide reaching transformation program with particular emphasis on three key areas:
· Implementing a major investment plan totaling approximately  3 bn,

over five years, with an emphasis on modernizing and upgrading our refineries,
· Increasing competitiveness through an integrated program, focusing on reorganization, cost control and operational excellence,
· Managing risks, including pricing, foreign exchange and trade receivables.
This program had a positive effect, as demonstrated in 2011, when despite the economic crisis, we achieved satisfactory results.

Message to Shareholders

In Refining, Supply & Trading, which remains the Group's main pillar of profitability, the reduced demand led to lower domestic sales volumes, whilst the refineries' upgrading and maintenance projects affected production and exports. Adjusted earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to  259 m. Low refining margins in the 2nd half of the year were partially offset by the improved performance in Supply & Trading, which secured the uninterrupted supply of crude and products, despite international adversity. In addition, cost control and lower provisions for bad debts due to improved credit management, contributed to profitability. The Thessaloniki refinery upgrade was successfully completed and has been operational since October 2011. he major upgrade project at the Elefsina refinery is at the end of the commissioning phase and is expected to be fully operational in 2012.
Domestic Marketing was characterized by lower volumes and margins due to market conditions. Furthermore an increase in credit risk as well as very limited liquidity led to a reduction in the number of fuel stations in operation. Nonetheless, the Group demonstrated

significant achievements, such as the introduction of diversified products onto the market through EKO and HELLENIC FUELS, with an emphasis on the implementation of innovative programs for the customers, the rationalization of the supply chain, efficient risk management and reduction of operating costs. The aforementioned initiatives resulted in a comparable EBITDA of  21 m.
In International Marketing, despite the deteriorating macroeconomic environment which affected demand in most markets, we managed to improve performance and sustain profitability through margin enhancement, market share increase and effective cost control. The adjusted EBITDA reached  45 m.
In Petrochemicals, polypropylene sales were affected by the maintenance and upgrading projects in Group refineries. Margins and international prices fell in the 2nd quarter due to decreased international demand which led to an adjusted EBITDA of 44 m. We maintain our strong export orientation, with 60% of sales directed towards selected markets.

The Group's activity in the fields of Gas and Power made a significant contribution to the Group's results through the participation in DEPA and Elpedison respectively. Specifically, DEPA's contribution to the Group's results amounted to  67 m, with higher sales, due to the increase of natural gas participation in the energy mix and the local supply and distribution subsidiaries performance improvement. Meanwhile, weather conditions and increased electricity production from natural gas improved Elpedison's results, despite the decline in GDP, thereby contributing  2 m to the Group's profitability.
In 2011, through its subsidiary HELLENIC PETROLEUM Renewables, the Group further expanded its position in renewable energy sources (RES), as part of its strategy for sustainable development, through its strategic alliance with LARCO. Two Joint subsidiaries were established, in which HELLENIC PETROLEUM Renewables owns 51% for the exploitation of LARCO's inactive mines with RES installations. Overall, the Group's RES portfolio at the end of 2011 includes projects with a total capacity of 80 MW (solar & biomass) in various permitting and construction stages.

6 01 The Group

In 2011, the Group continued with its strategic portfolio optimization activities, withdrawing from Georgia, which was not included in its main markets, while in Exploration and Production, the Group's partial farm-out from West Obayed was granted final approval from the Egyptian authorities.
The Group's financial position further strengthened in this difficult economic environment, through effective working capital and cash flow management, as well as the refinancing of credit lines maturing in 2011 and at the beginning of 2012. Considering 2011 overall financial results, which on a comparable EBITDA basis amounted to  363 m and the projected performance for 2012, the Board will propose at the Annual General Meeting a total dividend, for the fiscal year 2011, of  0.45 per share, at the same level as in previous years.

Despite the continuing difficult operating environment, 2012 is expected to be a positive turning point for our Group, as the results of our commitment to our strategy for competitiveness and sustainable development will become even more visible. Our immediate priority is to complete the Elefsina refinery upgrade program and to commence its commercial operation, which will in turn have a significant impact on our results, our exports as well as our environmental performance. We will also continue to place an emphasis on improving our performance in the domestic market, the petrochemicals business, our exports, our international activities, as well as the renewable energy sector, where we are starting to invest. We are also continuing with the implementation of our plan to further enhance the Group's competitiveness, growth and openness, as we believe that only the most competitive and financially resil-

ient companies among the European refining industry, will remain profitable and growing.
Our vision is to be a leading international energy group, with sustainable growth embedded in our strategy and with a strong presence in Southeastern Europe. Our goal is to claim one of the leading positions in every business activity across the markets, where the Group is active, and to be at the forefront in terms of human resources development, competitiveness, innovation and transparency. Finally, we will continue to invest in the areas of safety, environment and Corporate Social Responsibility.
With the substantial support and contribution of all of our people and the proven support of our shareholders, who we also thank, we will continue moving towards our vision of providing "Energy for Life".

Strategic Objectives Main pillars of strategy for sustainable development and competitiveness
A long term strategy has been designed, with the main objective of strengthening the Group both domestically as well as in S.E. Europe, based on: 1. The upgrading of facilities and assets of domestic Refining and Marketing businesses. 2. Enhancing competitiveness and export orientation through restructuring and transformation programs. 3. Expanding International Marketing and promoting vertical integration. 4. Developing Power Generation and RES and the exploration of new technologies. 5. Optimising organizational structures. 6. Continuously developing our people with a particular emphasis on training.

Actions and transformation programs

Optimising markets and supplies "BEST 80" Program

The BEST 80 program is one of the Group's major transformation programs which aims at cost containment throughout the Group's supply chain, using a methodology based on marketing (synergies, strategy specification, market research, negotiations, etc.) as well as technical (specifications, operation mode, etc.) tools and levers.
This specific program requires the participation of all stakeholders (suppliers, customers) as well as the Group's Procurement Division which organizes, coordinates and directs this program.
The Best 80 program is an extension of the BEST 50 program, which was successfully completed in December 2010, achieving the original goal of  50 m in cash benefits, mainly through realising synergies between the parent company HELLENIC PETROLEUM and the subsidiary EKO, and in-

ternally, between various divisions. The BEST 80 program's objective is for further economies of scale amounting to approximately  30 m, through the more identification of additional savings and synergies from the integration of HELLENIC FUELS.
In the above context, in 2011, the implementation of the BEST 80 program grossed a total of  7 m in savings for the Group, arising for the most part from cost reductions in the following purchases: Supply of spare parts for the refinery upgrade projects in Elefsina and Thessaloniki, sandblasting, painting of tanks at the refineries in Aspropyrgos and Elefsina, the supply of liquid nitrogen to the Thessaloniki refinery, the catalyst procurement for the Aspropyrgos refinery and the Polypropylene plant, equipment supply and information technology services.

14 02 The Group and its Strategy

The "DIAS" Refinery Optimization Program

In May 2008, the HELLENIC PETROLEUM Group began an optimization project on its three refineries in Greece, otherwise known as the `DIAS' program. The Group's experienced executives, in collaboration with Shell Global Solutions, reviewed major activities in the facilities' operation and maintenance in order to identify areas with improovement pontetal. The improvements are based upon:
· Producing a greater number of higher added value products · Reducing operating costs and as a result, increasing the Group's profitability · Ensuring for the Upgrade Projects' efficient operation.
In 2011 we used methods and techniques which, with the advancement of technology and accumulated experience in the refining industry, provide the opportunity for improvement. Similar methods and techniques are applied by the best oil and chemical companies worldwide, for the operation and maintenance of their facilities.
Indicatively, the areas for which particular emphasis was given are shown below:
· Addessing legacy equipment issues · Enhancing credibility as a central goal of maintenance activities · Predictive maintenance · Improved programming · Improved organization of shut-downs · The reorganization of the spare parts storage facility · The thorough training of staff

All of the above combined with the high technical expertise and dedication of our people, served to promote the reliability of our Refineries, reduce equipment failures and improve safety, by limiting the exposure of both people and facilities to the dangers caused by equipment failures, all with the objective of achieving high levels of reliability similar to those at a European level.
In terms of improving margins and reducing costs, the cumulative annual benefits from the beginning of the program

to 2011 amounted to  55 m. The benefits materialised on the back of improvements in the supply chain (evaluation of enlarged list of crude/purchase of "new'' types of crude), in the Refineries' operation (increase of performance/production in processing units, reducing energy costs and losses, interventions in equipment) as well as the introduction of new production methods. For the five year period 20122016 including the launch of the upgraded Elefsina Refinery, synergies that have been assessed can bring about additional annual cash benefits amounting to c.  18 m.

Annual Report 2011 15

The Group and its Strategy

The first millestone for the contribution of DIAS program, in the Group's profitability increase, was in fact achieved as a result of all the employees' efforts and their overwhelming response to the task at hand. The next challenge is to establish a monitoring system for key performance indicators, which will take into account operational changes and the volatile economic environment.

With regards to training at the Refineries, the WALP training system (Work Area Learning Program) was applied for the first time in the Group, pertaining to the Refineries' technical personnel. The system is based on Shell's International Best Practice.
After April 2012, the `DIAS' program will continue with the increased involvement of expert staff at the refineries, whereby Shell Global Solutions' presence will decrease, aiming to continuously improve the performance of our three domestic refineries.

Marketing Competitiveness
In Domestic Marketing, the program's aim, which has been ongoing since 2009, is to improve competitiveness through the optimization of synergies, by integrating the BP network to the Group, the reorganization of the supply chain and shared support services.
In 2011, the supply chain was restructured with the closure of 5 facilities, which led to the improved management of throuhput and cost reduction. Finally, the reorganization of support services continued, with total annual benefits since 2009  24 m.

Business Environment

The Global Economy

The global economy, after a strong recovery in 2010 following the recession of 2009, slowed down once again in 2011, due to extraordinary political and economic events, especially in North Africa and Middle East region. As a result, the international price of crude oil and other commodities recorded a significant increase in the first four months of the year, with a negative effect on the global industrial production. Then, the major natural disaster in Japan harmed both the country's infrastructure and its exports, causing serious disruptions in the supply chains of many international trade. sectors.

Global GDP growth is estimated to have slowed in 2011 to 3.8% from 5.2% last year. The variance across regions was material. The slowdown was more pronounced in the U.S. (1.8%), milder in the Eurozone (1.6%), while GDP in Japan dropped as a result of the developments in the first half of the year (-0.9%). By contrast, economic activity in emerging markets, although decelerating in 2011, remained strong (6.2% vs 7.3% in 2010), driven by emerging economies in Asia, especially China and India where Real GDP rose by 9.2% and 7.4% respectively in 2011.

The intensifying public debt crisis in Greece and other peripheral European countries, especially from the summer of 2011 onwards, and temporarily in the United States, were probably the main factors that drove the deteriorating international environment. The ineffective management of the situation caused great uncertainty in the international markets leading to falling international stock markets and significant declines in consumer spending and investment, especially in the Eurozone.

In the EU-27 the slowdown in the growth rate of GDP (1.6% versus 2.0% in 2010) was felt more in the second half of the year. There was however, a great variation in economic performance between countries. Only two economies were in recession in 2011 (Greece and Portugal), compared to five economies in 2010, while 12 of the 27 countries, despite the unfavorable economic environment, showed improvement in economic activity in 2011. Despite the impact of the financial crisis in Greece, GDP growth accelerated in 2011 in 4 of the 17 economies in the Eurozone, whereby Ireland and Spain overcame the recession, achieving positive GDP growth in 2011.

Financial Indicators

In 2011, the /$ exchange rate showed significant volatility, peaking at 1.49,with 1.29 as the year's lowest. The average rate stood at 1.39 (2010: 1.33), without a material impact on the Group's results.

The most significant impact on the Group's financial costs was the increased borrowing cost, faced by all Greek companies, as a result of the economic crisis.

Developments in the oil market

In 2011, global oil demand reached 89.1 mbpd versus 88.3 mbpd in 2010 signifying an increase of 0.9%. In China, oil consumption grew by 4.9% reaching 9.5 mbpd. Demand from countries in the Middle East rose by 2.5% to 8.0 mbpd. European OECD member countries reduced their demand by 2.1% to 14.3 mbpd, whilst demand in North America also decreased by 1.1% to 23.5 mbpd.
In 2011, global oil production amounted to 88.5 mbpd versus 87.4 in 2010, signifying a 1.2% increase. OPEC increased its production by 2.7% to 35.8 mbpd, non OECD country members stabilized their production to 29.8 mbpd, whilst OECD member countries increased their production by 0.2% reaching 18.9 mbpd.

Global crude oil prices have continuously increased since the beginning of 2009 and exceeded 100 $/bbl at the beginning of 2011 for the first time since the summer of 2008, eventually reaching 123.5 $/bbl in April 2011. This was the combined result, on the one hand of the strong international demand for oil from emerging economies and on the other hand, the serious disruptions in the overall supply and reserves due to political instability and armed conflicts, which occurred throughout various countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Since then, due to the slowdown of the global economy, international prices fell slightly.

The Brent-Urals differential after major fluctuations that occurred within the year, closed at 1.7 $/bbl, compared to 1.4

$/bbl in 2010. It is worth noting that due to the significant price hikes in the 1st half of the year, the differential range was at high levels, a situation which was reversed in the 2nd half due to the balance in demand between heavy and light crude oil types. In November 2011, the differential reversed with the indicative price for Urals was 0.2 $/bbl higher than that of Brent.

In euro terms, the increase in international oil prices in 2011 exceeded 2008 levels (Brent price  79.9 per barrel, compared to  60.0 in 2010 and  66.1 in 2008).

The sharp rise in crude oil prices and the general decline in demand for oil has put pressure on refining margins, significantly reducing industry profitability. In particular, according to the International Energy Agency the indicative margin of a complex refinery in the Mediterranean in 2011 amounted to 0.56 $/bbl compared to 1.34 $/bbl in 2010. Hydroskimming refinery margins moved in the same direction, averaging -6.6 $/bbl in 2011 over -4.18 $/bbl in 2010.

Despite the efforts that have been made in the last year to stimulate the economy amid the debt crisis plaguing Europe, Greece remained caught in a deep recession for the fourth consecutive year in 2011. The economic contraction that began in the second half of 2008 peaked in 2011, when GDP fell by 6.9%, according to the estimates compiled by EL.STAT, while total employment is estimated to have declined by 6.7% and the average annual unemployment rate stood at c. 17.5%. The recession is projected to continue in 2012 and, according to recent estimates, the average annual decline in GDP will be c. 4.5%, total employment will decline by 3% and the average annual unemployment rate will exceed 19%. The budget deficit, despite continuous fiscal measures and the successive upward revisions of the target due to the recession and implementation delays, reached 10.8% of GDP.

The Greek fuels market was significantly affected by these events. The high duty on unleaded gasoline ( 670/m3 over  350/m3 in 2008), the increased value added tax (23%), the increase in excise duty on auto diesel (from  293/m3 to  412/ m3), the strict fiscal policy and the crisis in the banking system have created new market conditions. The oil market recorded a further reduction in demand, which is estimated to be around 8%, versus 2010. Auto fuels were particularly affected, with the demand for auto diesel decreased by 12%, compared with already reduced sales in 2010, while gasoline fell by 11% compared with 2010.

Elefsina Refinery Upgrade Project

The start-up of the upgraded Elefsina refinery is expected in 2012. This is the largest manufacturing investment in Greece amounting to 1.2 bn, a milestone in the Group's history.
he project includes the installation of the following basic units:

· Vacuum distillation unit with a capacity of 45,000 barrels/ day.
· Hydrocracker with a capacity of 39,000 barrels/day, the only of its kind in Greece for the production of ulfla low sulfur diesel.
· Flexicocker with a capacity of 20,000 barrels/day, the second of its kind in Europe using Exxon technology, for the gasification of the coke residue and its conversion into clean fuel gas, serving the refinery's energy and raw materials needs.
· Hydrogen unit with a capacity of 125,000 m3/hour.
· Utility units (air, steam, sulfur recovery, amine, cooling water and others).
The project started in 2009, whereby the main contractor has been Technicas Reunidas, a specialized contractor on projects of this size and complexity, as well as HELPE engineering subsidiary ASPROFOS. The project

is expected to be completed in 2012. At the end of 2011, the project had reached 96% completion rate. Given its magnitude, the project also provides an impetus to the Greek economy. A significant percentage of the work was executed by Greek companies, creating up to 3,500 jobs during the construction phase. During its operation, 400 jobs will be maintained, whilst 165 additional new jobs will be created.
The upgrade will increase the Nelson complexity index from 1.5 to 7.2, rendering the Elefsina refinery one of the most modern and profitable in Europe. With the new configuration, the refinery will have an increased middle distillates yield (auto and heating diesel, aviation fuel) of modern and environmentally friendly standards, which are in shortage in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Similarly, it will significantly reduce the production of fuel oil, sold at much lower prices with its use gradually declining in the European market.

In 2011, the Aspropyrgos, Elefsina and Thessaloniki refineries processed a total of 7.9 million tons of crude oil and produced 8.6 million tons of products.
The OKTA refinery processed 700 thousand tons of crude, producing 645 thousand tons of products and sold 930 thousand tons, of which 583 thousand were absorbed by the local market.

2011 was characterized by reduced refinery production, mainly due to upgrading projects and maintenance in the Aspropyrgos refinery. The reduced margins for both the complex refining but even more for the simple refineries affected profitability. In particular, the indicative margin of a complex refinery (FCC Cracking) in the Mediterranean in 2011 reached $2.86/Bbl compared to $4.37/Bbl in 2010. The decrease was more intense in the second half of the year.

Aspropyrgos Refinery Maintenance

In the fourth quarter of 2011, a scheduled maintenance (intermediate turnaround) took place at the Aspropyrgos refinery. The work included the change in catalyst in the desulfurization, isomerization and mild hydrocracker units, the maintenance of the crude unit, naptha catalytic reformer (hydrotreater), decoking of vacuum and visbreaker units and the revamp of the catalytic cracker (FCC).

The maintenance work, that was within budget, ensures the smooth operation of the Aspropyrgos refinery and provides a significant improvement in performance. The project was completed safely and the timely start-up of operations at the refinery, demonstrate the Company's operational excellence and high level of capabilities and training of the facilities' staff.

The duration of the maintenance was 4 weeks as planned, during which the production of the refinery was reduced.

Supply - Crude Oil Supplies
Supplies of crude oil are centrally coordinated through term contracts as well as spot transactions. The main origin countries for crude oil are Russia (Urals, Siberian Light - 31.96%) and Iran (Iranian Heavy, Iranian Light - 31.41%), whilst significant quantities of crude oil were sourced from Kazakhstan (9.10%), Libya (8.59%), Saudi Arabia (6.11%) and Egypt (5.94%).
Russia ran Kazakhstan Libya Saudi Arabia Egypt Other

Imports of crude oil

The Aspropyrgos refinery's increased operation affected the processing of crude, where the heavy, high sulfur crudes accounted for a larger percentage in the Group's processing mix with a positive impact on profitability. The ability to access and procure as well as the flexibility of the Group's refineries to process a wide variety of crudes, is one of its key

competitive advantages, of particular importance in terms of both profitability as well as of its ability to respond to supply disruptions in specific types of crude, like in the cases of Libya in early 2011 and most recently of Iran, thereby ensuring the smooth supply of the markets, where the Group operates.

Refinery Sales (Wholesale Trading)

Sales of fuel are carried out by the parent company HELLENIC PETROLEUM S.A. to fuel marketing companies - including subsidiaries of the Group, HELLENIC FUELS and EKO and certain special customers, such as the armed forces. A percentage of production is exported, while heating oil for seasonal needs, not covered by domestic production, is imported. All of the Group's refined products meet the applicable European standards.

Sales of the Group's domestic refineries' products were reduced compared with 2010 to 11.46 million tons. Apart from reduced production, which affected exports, a substantial reduction in domestic demand led to lower sales amounting to 6.04 million tons. Stabilising trends were recorded in the duty-free markets for shipping and aviation fuel where sales stood at 3.04 million tons. Exports were reduced in 2011 to 2.38 million tons, due to reduced production in refineries undergoing upgrading.

In Greece, the EKO retail network amounts to a total of 1,040 stations, out of a total of 7,000 in the country, while stations operated by HELLENIC FUELS, exceed 1,000 under the trade name of BP. The two companies combine 15 bulk storage and supply terminals, 23 aircraft refueling stations at major airports, 2 LPG bottling plants, and 1 lubricant production and packaging unit. Their market share, taking into account industrial customers, amounts to about 30%.
In 2011, the deteriorating conditions in the Greek market and the reduction in disposable income, led to a reduction in domestic demand, resulting in a significant drop of petroleum products sales across the board. The decrease was more pronounced in auto fuels, exceeding 10%.

tive effects on profitability. The Group's companies increased the supply of diversified fuels and high value innovative services to the consumer at affordable prices, expanding its range of product offerings.
In April 2011, as a response to market conditions, EKO launched a new generation unleaded gasoline, the 95 EKONOMY, increasing its market share. At the end of the year, HELLENIC FUELS (formerly BP) also launched a new product, unleaded gasoline BP ULTIMATE 95, seeking to offer the latest technology in differentiated products to consumers, stabilising its market share. For heating oil, EKO, introduced a new accuracy meter, named MPS, which ensures the delivery of oil to customers in exact amounts.

The difficult environment left its mark on the Group's market- The aviation business made a significant contribution to doing companies. The decline in sales reached 8%, with nega- mestic marketing profitability due to increased tourist traffic.

The difficult credit conditions resulted in a further increase in credit risk, as many outlets and customers face problems in raising the necessary capital due to the drop in demand, as well as the weakness in the domestic financial system to supply the market with sufficient liquidity. Changes in the Group's credit policy, before the outbreak of the crisis, and immediate adjustment to new conditions, including the restructuring of the customer portfolio, resulted in a material reduction of exposure to doubtful debts.

Finally, continued efforts were made towards network rationalization, with a gradual decrease of less profitable stations and strengthening of those with a better outlook; synergies implementation between the two networks was accelerated through optimizing distribution, technical support and support functions.

Abroad, the retail network lists a total of 294 stations. In Cyprus and Montenegro, local subsidiaries Hellenic Petroleum Cyprus and Jugopetrol Kotor respectively, which originate from the acquisition of leading players in the respective markets. In Bulgaria and Serbia, where activities developed through greenfield investments, the Group's subsidiaries EKO Bulgaria and EKO Serbia have recorded rapid growth since 2005 and are now among the top five companies in their markets. In FYROM, a network of 29 stations carries the sign of the Group's OKTA refinery local subsidiary. In Albania, the Group is reviewing its strategic options regarding its presence in that country. In 2011, the Group sold its subsidiary EKO GEORGIA in Georgia in the context of disengaging from non-strategic investments.
All foreign countries where the Group operates were impacted during 2011 by the downturn which affected European economies, thereby reducing overall fuel consumption, compared with the previous year. However, the Group's four main foreign marketing companies succeeded in maintaining or increasing their shares in their respective markets, based on their commercial and promotional activities, as well as improved levels of service and quality, compared with the competition. For the Group's International Activities, 2011 was a year whereby moderate expansion and investment in the renewal of the network took place, where a greater emphasis was placed on strengthening the competitiveness and profitability of our companies.
In Cyprus, our companies Hellenic Petroleum Cyprus and Ramoil achieved the budgeted EBITDA target for 2011, increasing their market shares both in retail as well as in wholesale. Market conditions remain difficult, however, and are expected to affect both sales volumes and margins in the near future. The ongoing crisis in the financial sector is causing an economic slowdown affecting particularly important sectors of the fuel market, including automotive, construction and industry segments.

In Bulgaria, EKO Bulgaria has significantly increased volumes and market shares by implementing a targeted and very effective marketing strategy. Profit margins in the Bulgarian market were strongly affected in the second half of 2011, influenced by external factors. The prospects of EKO Bulgaria for next year remain positive. Our company continues to strengthen its presence and activities, maintaining a satisfactory operating performance, despite the overall decrease in the Bulgarian.fuel market.
In Serbia, EKO Serbia took advantage of the liberalization of the local fuel market, differentiated products and good cost control, to close the year with significantly improved operating performance, relative to the previous year and targets. The Serbian market remains competitive, while the economy has been affected by general economic conditions and is not expected to see material growth within the next year.
Montenegro is going through a downturn in economic activity, with the exception of tourism, a factor which has weighed heavily on the fuel market in the country. Jugopetrol Kotor, exploiting its economic strength and its leading market position, increased its market shares in 2011, despite the reduction in volumes, compared with the previous year. The unfavorable public finances situation continues to negatively affect the economic activity of the country, especially in construction and manufacturing. Coupled with rising international oil prices, the fuel market in Montenegro is expected to remain under pressure in 2012.

Production and Trade of Petrochemicals/Chemicals

Petrochemical activities are primarily focused on the further processing of refinery products such as propylene, polypropylene, minerals and solvents and their marketing in the domestic market. Part of the production process takes place in Aspropyrgos, where propylene is produced, while most of the petrochemical units are located at the Thessaloniki refinery. Note that the production of polypropylene is based on the Basel technology, which is regarded as one of the top internationally.

Based on their contribution to the Group's results, the propylene and polypropylene value chain constitute one of the Group's main activities. Finally, particular importance is given to the export of chemical products, as approximately 60% of sales volume is directed towards the Turkish, Italian and Iberian markets where they are used as raw materials in local industries.

he main points for 2011 were:
· Satisfactory demand conditions and prices in the international Petrochemicals market in the first half of 2011, unlike the second half, where there was a significant decline in prices as a result of sluggish demand and the overall impact of the global economic slowdown. In the Greek market, the economic and credit crisis continued which had adverse effects on the consumption of chemicals and overall marketing activity.
· Despite the crisis in the Greek market, the difficult operating environment in the second half of 2011 and production losses, chemicals results were at satisfactory levels, mainly due to the intensification of the marketing effort and margin optimization.
· Production and sales volumes were affected by the upgrading works and planned maintenance at the Thessaloniki and Aspropyrgos refineries respectively.

Oil & Gas Exploration and Production

In 2011, the Group's activities focused on Egypt, through the participation in joint ventures in the areas of West Obayed (W. Desert) and Mesaha (Upper Egypt).
Following international bidding in 2010, the Group farmed out 70% of exploration and production rights in the W. Obayed region to VEGAS West Obayed Limited, which also undertook the management of the consortium, in accordance with the Co-management Agreement. This ensures for the company's continued participation in research activities with reduced research risks and costs. The Agreement on the transfer of rights to Vegas was approved by the competent Egyptian authorities on October 12, 2011. The consortium is studying existing research data in order to choose the locations of two new exploratory wells, which it is committed to undertake in 2012.
Given the transfer of the project management to VEGAS, HELLENIC PETROLEUM significantly reduced infrastructure costs and personnel at the office in Cairo.

In the Mesaha region, exploration activities continued with the seismic data processing on the 1,700 km2 region, the assessment of which will be decided upon the first exploration drilling, which is expected to start at the end of 2012.
In view of the Greek State's possible announcement concerning the international tender for the concession rights pertaining to Exploration and Production in areas in western Greece, the Group is evaluating the available technical data in the wider geographical area.
In 2010, the Montenegro government announced that it intends to proceed to offshore concession and requested oil companies to express interest. HELLENIC PETROLEUM participated actively in the process and was accepted by the government of Montenegro to participate in a future round of concessions. In this context, the Group has entered into an agreement with the Italian company Edison, whereby the technical and commercial data will be reviewed, in order for a bid to be made through a joint venture.

Renewable Energy Sources (R.E.S)

HELLENIC PETROLEUM - RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES S.A. (HELPE RES S.A.) was founded in 2006 and is a 100% subsidiary company of the Group. The purpose of the company is the production, distribution and trade of renewable energy sources, as well as the participation in other companies for the production, import, distribution and trade of renewable energy.

Power Generation and Natural Gas

The Group's activities in the fields of Power Generation and Natural Gas are carried through its participation in ELPEDISON BV and DEPA S.A., respectively. The contribution of the two companies, according to their provisional financial statements, amounted to  68.7 million, an increase of 122% compared with 2010.
ELPEDISON BV's results were boosted by the favorable outcome of the arbitration with DEPA (on the charges during the shutdown of the unit in Thessaloniki in 2009) and reduced production of the lignite and hydroelectric units.

In 2011, ELPEDISON BV recorded a total net production increase of 133% compared with 2010, mainly due to the launch of its power plant in Thisvi, already in place at the end of 2010, as well as increased production from the Thessaloniki power plant, up by 13% compared to 2010. Also, the average spark spread ranged at higher levels than in 2010, resulting in ELPEDISON's EBITDA reaching  61m in 2011 (versus  18 m in 2010).

Risk Management
Demineralised Water Tank-Elefsina Industrial Installations

The Company's Internal Audit System and Risk Management in relation to the process of preparing the financial statements and financial reporting, includes safeguards and monitoring mechanisms at various levels within the organization, as described below:
Safeguards at the corporate level

Identification, Evaluation, Measurement and Risk Management:
The size and complexity of the Group requires that a complex system be in place for identifying and managing risks, applying to all Group subsidiaries.
The identification and risk assessment takes place mainly during the drafting phase of strategic planning and the annual business plan. The topics that are examined vary depending on market and industry conditions and include, in particular, political developments in the markets where the Group is active or which are important sources of raw materials as well as technology changes, macroeconomic indicators and the competitive environment.

Planning and Monitoring / Budget:
The company is monitored through a detailed budget by activity sector and market. Due to the nature of the activities, the development of the Group's financial results depend largely on exogenous factors such as the international refining environment, crude oil prices and the euro-dollar exchange rate. For this reason, the budget is adjusted periodically to take these changes into account. The company's management monitors the progress of the Group's financial results through regular reports, comparisons with the budget and management team meetings.

Sufficiency of the Internal Audit System:

Management has designed and performs ongoing surveillance activities, which are incorporated into the operation of the Company and which ensure that the internal audit system maintains its effectiveness over time. The company carries out regular individual assessments as to the suitability of the Internal Audit System, which are mainly implemented through the company's Internal Audit Division.
The Company has an independent Internal Audit Division, which, among other things, ensures that the processes of identification and risk management applied by management, are adequate to ensure the effective operation of the Internal Audit System and the quality and reliability of the information provided by management to the Board, regarding the System

of Internal Audit. The structure of the Management's Audit Plan is based on performance, which is founded on risk assessment as well as issues that have been identified by Management and the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan itself is submitted to the Audit Committee for approval.
Risk assessment process is carried out regularly and takes into account the assessment conducted by the BoD within the context of company's Risk Management framework.
The adequacy of the Internal Audit System is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Reports prepared both by Management and the Internal Audit Division provide an assessment of inherent ma-

jor risks and the Internal Audit System's adequacy in dealing with them. Any identified weaknesses are disclosed in the reports, including the effects that they have had or may have in the future as well as Management's efforts in correcting them.
To ensure the objectivity of the Group's external audit of financial statements, the BoD follows a specific policy and procedure to develop recommendations to the General Assembly to elect a regular auditor. This policy provides, inter alia, the selection of the same auditors for the entire Group, as well as for the auditing of the consolidated financial statements and the fiscal books , and finally electing an auditor of international standing, while safeguarding the independence thereof.

Risk Management
Roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors:
The role, duties and related responsibilities of the BoD are described in the Company's Internal Operating regulations, which is approved by the BoD.

Prevention and Suppression of financial fraud:

Safeguards in Information Technology Systems

As part of risk management, the areas that are considered high risk for financial fraud are monitored with appropriate controls and safeguards. This refers particularly to the existence of detailed organizational charts, operating regulations (suppliers, oil market, credit, treasury management) as well as detailed procedures and approval limits. Also, apart from audit mechanisms applied by every division, all company's operations are subject to audits by the Internal Audit Department, whose results are presented to the BoD.

The Group's Information Technology Division is responsible for implementing the strategy on technology and information technology and staff training to meet any needs that arise. In addition, it is responsible for supporting applications through updating software manuals, in conjunction with external contractors where appropriate.
The Company has developed an adequate framework for monitoring and controlling information systems, which is defined by individual control mechanisms, policies and procedures.

Internal Operating Regulations:
The Company has compiled relevant internal regulations, approved by the Board. Within the framework of the Rules, powers and responsibilities of key roles are defined, thus promoting an adequate segregation of duties within the Company.
Group's Code of Conduct

Safeguards for Financial Statements and Financial Reporting
As part of the reporting processes for the Company's financial statements, specific safeguards exist which are related to the use of tools and methodologies based on commonly accepted international practices. The main areas in which the safeguards operate associated with the preparation of the Company's financial reports and financial statements are:

The Company within the scope of good corporate governance, prepared and adopted within 2011, a Code of Ethics, adopted by the company's Board. The Code of Ethics is intended to summarize the principles according to which every person, employee or third party involved in the operation of the Group and each of its collective bodies, must act within their duties. For this reason, the Code is a practical guide to the everyday work of all the Group's employees and third parties working with it.

50 05 Risk Management

rganisation - Allocation of Responsibilities Procedures to Safeguard Assets

· The assignment of responsibilities and powers both for the company's senior management as well as middle and lower level executives, ensures the strengthening of internal control whilst preserving the required separation of duties.

· The existence of safeguards for fixed assets, inventories, cash - checks and other company assets, such as the safeguarding of cash and stocks and the physical inventory valuation and comparison of the measured quantities with those of the accounting books.

· Adequate staffing of financial services with individuals with the requisite technical knowledge and experience for the responsibilities entrusted to them.
Procedures for Monitoring and Preparing Financial Statements

· Schedule of monthly physical inventories to verify the balances of actual and accounting inventories and the existence of an analytical manual for conducting the physical measurement of inventory.

· Existence of Regulation approval levels (Chart of Authorities), which shows the delegated powers to various officers of the company to conduct specific transactions or acts (e.g. payments, collections, transactions, etc.).

· Automated checks and inspections carried out between different information systems, special accounting treatment is required for the approval of non-recurring transactions.

Financial Risk Management

Financial Risk Factors

The Group's activities are focused on oil refining and secondarily in the fields of petrochemicals, exploration and production and electricity generation & trading. Therefore, the Group is exposed to various financial risks such as the fluctuation in the price of petroleum products in the international markets, changes in exchange rates and interest rate, cash flow risks as well as risks pertaining to changes in fair values due to interest rate movements. In line with international practices and within the local market and legal framework, the Group's overall risk management program

focuses on reducing potential exposure to market volatility and/or mitigating any negative impact on the financial position of the Group, to the extend feasible.
The management of risks related to the pricing of products are handled by the Commercial Risk Management Service, which includes trade and financial management senior executives while financial risks are managed by the Financial Services Group, always within the approval given by the BoD.

Annual Report 2011 51

Marker Risk

Currency Risk

As the refining industry operates internationally based on the dollar, translating all transactions into local currency, the Group's activities are primarily exposed to risk from fluctuations in the /$ exchange rate. The strengthening of the dollar against the euro has a positive effect on financial results while in the case of devaluation, both the results and assets (stocks, investments) will be valued at lower levels.

As a partial hedge against the specific risk, a significant part of the financing of the Group is USD denominated, thereby creating offsetting exposure to variations in exchange rates. It is noted however that in the event of a dollar devaluation, the dollar effect on the balance sheet is offset; where an appreciation of the dollar occurs, marking to such loans results in farex losses not offset as stocks continue to be shown on the balance sheet at cost.

Product price fluctuation risk
The Group's core business as a refiner generates two kinds of exposure in product price changes: Exposure to absolute changes in crude oil and petroleum products prices, which affect the value of inventories, and exposure to changes in refining margins, which affect the future cash flows.
In the case of product price fluctuation risk, the level of exposure to the risk refers to falling prices and the inventory is determined at the end of each period, as the Group's policy is to show the stock price at the lowest between cost and net realizable value.

Cash Flow Risks and Risks associated with Fair Value Changes due to changes in interest rates
Cash flows risks from changes in interest rates originate from the level of the Group funding at variable interest rate. Moreover, because of the long time horizon of investment in sectors where the Group operates, significant increases in interest rates may cause changes in the fair value of these investments through variations in the discount rate.

The exposure to changes in refining margins is associated with the level of each refinery's refining margins. These are subject to movements in the Platts reference prices of crude and products which are formed on a daily basis. The margin variation has the respective impact on Group profit.
The Group seeks to hedge part of the exposure against price fluctuations and margins risks, as a percentage ranging from 10% -50% subject to prevailing market conditions.

Credit Risk
Credit risk management is conducted centrally at Group level. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, derivative financial instruments, as well as wholesale clients' credit risk, including outstanding amounts from clients and committed transactions. All clients are assessed by the Credit Control Department, in collaboration where necessary, with external rating agencies for their credit worthiness.

52 05 Risk Management

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is addressed by ensuring capable and available cash resources as well as adequate credit lines with banks. Due to the dynamic nature of its activities, the Group aims to maintain funding flexibility through credit lines.

Capital Risk Management

The Group's objectives in managing capital are to ensure the continuity of the Group's operations, to maintain the ideal allocation of capital, thereby reducing the cost of capital and increasing value.

Consistent with the practice followed by the industry, the Group monitors its capital on the basis of the leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt over total capital employed.

In order for the Group to maintain or adjust its capital structure, dividend to shareholders may be adjusted, return capital can be returned or new shares can be issued or assets sold, to reduce debt.

The long term goal is to maintain a leverage ratio of 20% 45% as strong fluctuations in crude oil prices lead to large variations in debt position. The relatively high leverage ratio in recent years (35% - 40%) is due primarily to the raising of funds through borrowing in order to finance projects to upgrade the refineries, as well as the increase in international prices of crude and petroleum products which increases the capital working needs.

Corporate Governance Statement

Corporate Governance refers to a set of principles which form the basis of the adequate organization, operation, management and control of a company with the long-term goal of maximizing its value and safeguarding the legitimate interests of all those connected with it.
In Greece, the corporate governance framework has developed mainly through the adoption of binding rules, such as Law 3016/2002, which requires the participation of nonexecutive and independent non-executive members of the Board of Greek listed companies, the establishment and operation of an internal audit unit and adopting internal rules of procedure.

pany law directives, creating new rules of corporate governance, such as Law 3693/2008, require the establishment of audit committees, as well as significant reporting obligations regarding the ownership and governance of a company, Law 3884/2010 relating to rights of shareholders and additional corporate disclosure obligations to shareholders in preparation of the General Assembly and the Law 3873/2010, transposed into Greek law Directive 2006/46/EC of the European Union, regarding certain types of annual and consolidated accounts. Finally, in Greece, like in most other countries, the Law on public limited companies (Law 2190/1920, which is amended by several of the above provisions of the) contains the basic rules of governance.

Code of Corporate Governance

Health and Safety in the workplace

HELLENIC PETROLEUM's first priority is the health and safety of both workers and residents in the local communities, which are close to its facilities. For this reason, employees, partners, visitors and students trainees and students are provided with a safe workplace.
Health and Safety Management System Certifications
Apart from its certification to international quality standard ISO 9001, all industrial refining and petrochemical production facilities are certified with the internationally recognized standard Health and Safety Management OHSAS 18001 (ELOT Greek version 1801). The facilities are subject to annual recertification inspection to the above standards.
In marketing, EKO's Aviation Fuels and Lubricants as well as the petrol Stations subsidiary EKO Calypso (Aspropyrgos) are certified and annually reassessed to the requirements of standard ELOT EN ISO 9001:2008.
Also, the activities of the EKO Lubricants factory, Liquid Fuels Storage Facility in Scaramaga and Elefsina and Aviation Fuel Refueling stations are certified and are recertified annually according to the requirements of ELOT 1801:2008/OHSAS 18001:2007.
Other activities of the marketing companies EKO and HELLENIC FUELS which are not included in these certified systems, have written procedures and instructions, in accordance with the requirements of Certified Systems.
In the field of road safety, EKO and HELLENIC FUELS continue to implement practices and procedures that promote the safe transport of liquid fuels such as the screening of the tanks, proper training of drivers and the other staff involved.

Safety Inspections Health Surveillance
In 2011, the planned internal safety audits at each facility continued. This is in addition to extraordinary inspections made by the Group's Health and Safety Division, on the premises of the new Elefsina project and at its subsidiary in Montenegro where reports were issued with recommendations for further improving their safety.
Similar internal inspections were carried out in the marketing arm's facilities and units where the aim was the following: To transfer experience, to identify opportunities to improve performance in Health, Safety, Environment and Quality, planned inspections by independent bodies to monitor the implementation of Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Management Systems and scheduled inspections of fueling stations at airports. In all cases the results were satisfactory, and where room for improvement was found, planned corrective actions were agreed upon and planned.
In the field of marketing, updating took place at the Health, Safety and Environment checkpoints through the STATION VISIT FORM used by Inspectors of Sales, to facilitate their identification and recording of unsafe situations and the systematic monitoring of the corrective actions.
The surveillance of the health of workers takes place in accordance with the criteria of the Greek legislation (Law. 3850/2010), European and international codes and best practices.

In March 2011, HELLENIC FUELS renewed its membership of the European Road Safety Charter, committing to actions to upgrade road safety to reduce deaths and injuries from road accidents, according to the objectives of the Charter.

Also in 2011, the integration of basic security procedures and policies of the Group's plants and two refineries in the south of the country were completed.

Health and Safety in the workplace

Risk Assessment

All facilities have written updated Occupational Risk Assessment Studies, which contain the measures taken to eliminate or minimize risks.
In planning safety corrective actions, high priority is given to the most crucial, as classified in categories, through the use of a Risk Assessment Table.

Generally, to ensure Health and Safety at Work, techniques and measures are applied which are now imposed by the regulations and laws. In this context, a study to analyze operational risks (HAZOP or Hazard & Operability Study) is a prerequisite for any new unit or major modifications to existing units.

Safety Culture

In addition to the earlier programs which are still in progress (such as the internationally recognized program "Winning Hearts and Minds"), the most recent actions in this area are the following:
The implementation across the Group reporting unsafe situations is in continuation, and in 2011, periodic systematic discussion and analysis unsafe situations (what-if scenarios) were established by groups of staff.
In the scope of their direct and practical participation in safety, Management established: a) a program of safe visits from refinery executives to all operating units, to identify and correct unsafe behaviors directly (safe visits), b) safety meetings by the South refineries Management every 15 days.
It also introduced the implementation of the Safety Performance Rewards Policy, which includes the granting of token gifts to groups of employees, when specific objectives are achieved, based on accident-free hours. The ultimate goal is to raise the staff's awareness, concerning accident prevention and safe plant operation.

In an effort to support awareness regarding Safety, Health and Protection of the Environment issues, regular updates are made throughout the Group on major accidents in the oil industry and the results of their investigation. From 2009 the Center for Chemical Process Safety, USA, (Process Safety Beacon) monthly newsletter concerning the safety of production processes is translated and distributed to technical staff at all facilities. The aim is to utilize everyone's experiences in order to prevent similar incidents in the activities of the Group.
Also, printed material is sent to all facilities in the Group to increase concern and prevent accidents related to slips, trips and falls.
Finally, in the second half of 2011, a periodical newsletter concerning Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainable Development was issued, so that staff is regularly informed.

During 2011, the objectives of 500,000 hours without an accident were accomplished at the Thessaloniki Industrial Installations (for a second time), at the Aspropyrgos Industrial Installations and at the marketing companies EKO and HELLENIC FUELS, and of 1,000,000 hours at the Group's Head Office.

Training in Health and Safety

The training of the Group's staff in Health, Safety and Protection of the Natural Environment is multifaceted and continuous and extends asides from employees, to contractors, customers, tanker truck drivers, service stations, and students.

In 2011, HELLENIC PETROLEUM was awarded, at a European level, for its joint voluntary organization, along with the companies TITAN and HALYVOURGIKI, of safety training seminars for owners contractors at the Thriasion region in Attica.

The training includes fire safety exercises and the implementation of contingency plans for maintaining the readiness of personnel.

Safety Indices

HELLENIC PETROLEUM participates in the European organization CONCAWE's1 annual survey and benchmarking for accidents, through a cooperation keeping abreast of developments and introducing additional indicators to measure safety performance. In this context, in 2011, it continued to follow all safety indices at work, as well as new process safety indicators (categories 1 and 22) according to CONCAWE's instruction and in line with API RP 754.3

he following charts show the continuous evolution of AIF4 accidents from 2005 to 2011, in comparison with the respective CONCAWE indices for the Group's domestic refineries5. They also show the evolution of the new PSIF-1 index6, in comparison with the respective CONCAWE index for the last two years.
Note that the indices pertaining to Marketing, which do not possess the complexities of the refineries, were negligible (AIF = 0.36, PSIF-1 = 0).

1 CONCAWE: uropean Oil Industry Association for Health, Safety and the Environment 2 Depending on the severity of the implications, process safety incidents are divided into incident categories 1 and 2. Category 1 incidents

In the accreditation process

The Group's three domestic refineries have been accredited by ISO 17025 for the analyses required to calculate emissions of CO .
2
Significant investments were implemented with an environmental orientation, based on Best Available Techniques - BAT and the modernization of the production process (increased efficiency, energy saving, reducing the consumption of natural resources and reducing waste) in the context of sustainable development.
As with the industrial installations, EKO and HELLENIC FUELS followed the Group's basic principles of environmental policy. Specifically, in May 2011 inspections were successfully made, which monitored activities in the following storage facilities: HELLENIC FUELS' storage facilities in Aspropyrgos, Thessaloniki, Corfu, Igoumenitsa, Kalamata and Heraklion, according to the requirements of ELOT EN ISO 14001:2004.

During the same period, successful surveillance audits were made of the EKO Lubricants Plant, EKO's storage facilities for liquid fuels and chemicals in Scaramanga, the liquid fuels installation in Elefsina and EKO's Aviation Fuel Refueling Stations, according to the requirements of standard ELOT EN ISO 14001:2004.
In 2011, the Group made recommendations and interventions for major legislation (new laws) related to the licensing of premises (Law. 3982), Environmental Authorisation (Law. 4014), underground water, groundwater, etc. Meanwhile, it continues to prepare for the implementation of the new Directive on industrial emissions (IED / Industrial Emissions Directive - 2010/75/EE - review of the IPPC Directive and integration of the Directive on large combustion plants - MFN), which should be incorporated into national law and implemented at a national level gradually in the coming years.

CO2 emissions and emissions trading

HELLENIC PETROLEUM, under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) presented their annual reports filed verified CO emissions to the Ministry of Environ-
2
ment, Energy and Climate Change and implemented the necessary actions, with regard to the number of allowances, corresponding to their facilities.
They also submitted the verified data to the Ministry, which is needed to calculate the allowances of greenhouse gases

(GHG) for the period 2013-2020, according to national requirements (JMD 54409/2632/2004, as amended by JMD 57495/2959/2010).
At this point, it is worth mentioning that during the whole of the previous period, HELLENIC PETROLEUM was actively involved in shaping the European benchmarking for refineries which determines the free allocation of CO2 allowances for the period 2013-2020.

Investments

Despite the economic downturn, the Group continued unhindered in the implementation of two significant investments amounting to  1.5 bn., pertaining to the modernization of the Elefsina and Thessaloniki refineries. Their completion will produce products under the new European and international standards, achieving environmental improvement by reducing local pollutants by as much as 85% and 55% for the Elefsina and Thessaloniki refineries, respectively.

The project in Thessaloniki was completed and the start-up took place in 2011, whilst the Elefsina refinery is expected to be operational in 2012.

Voluntary environmental initiatives

Gas emissions from the refinery facilities

Due to the proximity of Aspropyrgos refinery to Lake Koumoundourou and HELLENIC PETROLEUM's desire to protect the lake's ecosystem, it decided to fund the project "Monitoring of the Lake Koumoundourou's ecological status and action plan for management and restoration" which began to be implemented in early 2011 by the Greek Center for Marine Research (HCMR) under the supervision of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change.
Also in 2011, HELLENIC PETROLEUM continued the implementation of voluntary environmental actions, such as the continued adoption of tree planting and care, in an area totalling 63,500 square metres near Lake Koumoundourou. In addition, it also held, for a second time, the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from the Group's Head Office building in Maroussi and the Aspropyrgos refinery building, under the policy of limiting the Group's carbon footprint.
Harmonisation of HELLENIC PETROLEUM with the REACH Regulation

The charts below show the total emissions from the Group's Greek refineries. These emissions are either the result of measurements based on international and European standards, or the result of assessments, using methodologies recognized by European and international organizations. Note that the reported emissions are much lower than the statutory limits. However, it should be noted that the year 2011 cannot be considered to be representative, in terms of gaseous pollutants, as two out of the three Greek refineries were out of service for a long time period.
Total emissions of sulfur dioxide from the three domestic refineries ( for Aspropyrgos Industrial Installations,  for Thessaloniki Industrial Installations and BEE for Elefsina Industrial Installations) continue to be about 75% lower than the new quantitative limits for the year 2011. Similarly, emissions of nitrogen oxides appear decreased, bearing in mind that low burners are used, which emit low emissions of nitrogen oxides in the majority of combustion devices. Similarly, emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) seem to have stabilized in recent years, as a result of best practices followed in the maintenance and operation of storage tanks and the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program.

From the beginning of 2006, HELLENIC PETROLEUM has been complied with REACH Regulation's requirements (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals), R1907/2006 which came into force on June 1st, 2007.

Management of liquid and solid waste

The management and final treatment of the refineries' wastewater and solid waste is made through the application of Best Available Techniques, to both minimize the production and the improvement of the quality parameters prior to the final disposal.
With regards to waste water, the three refineries have had, for several years, modern wastewater treatment plants (WTP), which include primary, secondary and in some cases tertiary treatment. The effectiveness of the treatment is continuously monitored by specialized laboratories within the installations, based on the physicochemical characteristics of the discharged wastewater.
Moreover, priority is given to recycling, where technically possible, as when re-refining from recovered hydrocarbons from WTP and the use of treated wastewater utilities like water uses and water for firefighting.

The result of processing and recycling is to significantly reduce the volume of discharged treated waste, while the quality parameters are up to 50% below statutory limits.
Additionally, it is very important to note that over the last years no oil spill incident took place in the marine environment.
As for solid hazardous waste, the application of environmentally friendly methodologies for hazardous waste treatment continues to be applied, where their final safe disposal is the ultimate objective. Except where treatment is processed on site (in situ), e.g. for the bioremediation of oily sludge from wastewater treatment plants, where this is not possible, the pretreatment of waste and its safe disposal is performed by companies that are licensed in the management of hazardous waste.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Sustainable Development, High Competitiveness and Creativeness

Today, our society, more than ever before, is facing many economic, social and environmental challenges, and the requirements and expectations that we all have from a large Group like HELLENIC PETROLEUM are increasing. In order to satisfy these requirements, high levels of competitiveness, creativity, dedication to our principles and inspiration are needed. Only then can we ensure a sustainable course for responsible growth.

In our Group, we closely associate our sense of entrepreneurship with corporate responsibility and this is evidenced, not only through specific programs and actions, but also through the participation of all employees, who are invited to play a key role in this field, whether they are employed in industrial installations or whether they have immediate contact with customers, suppliers. Our common goal is to always understand the needs of society, and prioritizing safety and the environment, to produce high quality products, using the latest technologies. In this way, we ensure for a harmonious coexistence with local communities, respect the customer and contribute to the economy.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Dedication and Commitment to Action in Local Communities

For our Group, relations with local communities do not comprise mere contact at a "good public relations" level with local bodies, but rather a set of actions, which are characterized by stability, continuity and substantiality.
Over the past decade, both methodically and with the important contribution of local communities, we have designed and implemented programs that reach all social groups.
In 2011,  3 m were invested in activities with a social content across the Group, which can be divided into:
· Programs supporting vulnerable groups (poors-unemployed-large families).

· Programs rewarding young people (students and university students distinguished for their performance-scholarships-young entrepreneurship-employment).
· Programs which support school communities (provision of free heating oil).
· Cultural programs
· Sports programs
· Health programs
· Programs with an environmental content (cleaning-tree planting-emissions measuring stations).
· Infrastructure projects in local communities (kindergardens, squares, playgrounds).

"We reward the worthy of the new generation" program.
Over the last five years, over 1,500 students, who went on to higher education from the neighbouring Western Thessaloniki and Triasion municipalities have been awarded.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1. te No. 35 of the consolidated financial statements includes all subsidiary companies and their related information 2. No company shares are owned either by the parent company or any of the subsidiaries as at the end of the year. 3. The parent company HELLENIC PETROLEUM SA has not been subject to a tax audit for the fiscal years 2006 ­ 2010, while the most material subsidiaries for the fiscal years 2005 ­ 2010 (Note 32 of the consolidated financial statements). In June 2011 the tax audits for the financial years 2002 to 2005 of HELLENIC PETROLEUM S.A. were finalized, the outcome of which was accounting differences of 64 million. The Company has accepted accounting differences of 32 million, resulting in 18 million of additional taxes, interest and penalties, which were charged through the consolidated financial statements the year ended 31 December 2011. The Company has contested the remaining differences amounting to 32 million, as it believes these have no merit and therefore no provision has been made in this respect in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2011. 4. The accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 are consistent with those applied for the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, except for the new or revised accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in 2011, as outlined in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements of 31 December 2011. 5. As mentioned in Note 32 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group's entities are involved in a number of legal proceedings and have various unresolved claims pending arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information, management believes the outcome will not have a significant impact on the Group's operating results or financial position. 6. In July 2011 the Group has announced its exit from the Georgian market through the transfer of 100% of the shares of its subsidiary Hellenic Petroleum Georgia (Holdings) Limited, owner of 100% share interest in the Georgian entity, EKO Georgia Ltd, to Energy Solutions Investments Inc., a holding company which is active in the energy market of Eastern Europe. The consideration amounted to  6,6 million (Note 36). 7. On 4 July 2011 the merger through absorption of 100% of "Petrola S.A." by its parent "Hellenic Petroleum S.A." was completed, in accordance with the provisions of art. 68 para. 2 and 69-78 of Company law 2190/1920 and art. 1-5 of law 2166/1993. The transaction was approved by the Ministry of Development, Competitiveness and Shipping (Decision K2-5565 ­ 4/7/2011) and was duly registered with the Registry of Societes Anonymes 8. Number of employees at 31/12/2011 in Greece: Company: 2.151, Group: 3.287 (31/12/2010: Company: 2.467, Group: 3.639). 9.
