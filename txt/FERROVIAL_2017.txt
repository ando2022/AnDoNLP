LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Fellow shareholders,
Ferrovial had a positive year in 2017, underpinned by the strong performance of the infrastructure assets, our main source of value creation. The total shareholder return was 15.7% in the year. Revenues increased 13.5%, mainly as a result of the growth of the toll roads in North America and the full-year consolidation of Broadspectrum. Net profit reached 454 million, an increase of 20.6%, supported by the contribution from 407 ETR and Heathrow, which are equity-accounted.
Operating cash flow, excluding infrastructure projects and before taxes, was 999 million. Cash flow totaled 781 million, after 355 million in capital expenditure and 253 million of divestments of mature assets. This allowed to return 520 million to shareholders. The sound financial position is supported by the fact that the company ended the year with a net cash position, excluding infrastructure projects, of 1.341 billion. During the year, Ferrovial successfully completed two 500 million bond issues paying 1.375% and 2.124%, the latter a perpetual hybrid.
Business performance.-
 Toll roads had growth in earnings and traffic on the main assets in North America. Highways 407 ETR, in Toronto, and LBJ and NTE, in Dallas-Fort Worth, exceeded the expectations in the business plan. These roads, located in growing urban areas, adjust their tolls according to congestion levels. Customer satisfaction indicators demonstrate Ferrovial's ability to contribute new and efficient solutions to improve urban mobility.
 Airports confirmed Heathrow's ability to continue setting records in passenger numbers despite operating almost at full capacity. The high levels of service quality are backed by the fact that Heathrow has headed the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) league table for thirteen consecutive quarters. The other airports also performed well in terms of traffic and earnings, enabling an increase in the dividend paid to Ferrovial of 237 million, compared with 134 million in 2016. The Denver airport upgrade contract marks this division's entrance into the US market.
 Construction has reduced the high returns of previous years due to losses on two contracts already concluded and the fact that ongoing contracts involved less in-house engineering work. Budimex had another excellent year, while margins in the rest of the division were in line with the industry.

 Services maintained a good performance in Spain while increasing exposure to private sector clients. After implementing a cost-cutting program, Amey improved margins despite local government budgetary restrictions, which are puttting pressure on earnings throughout the industry. Broadspectrum completed its first full year in the group with an increase in operating efficiency and the prospects for tenders are greater than initially projected.

Backlog.- The backlog stands at 32.063 billion. In the US, the financial closing of the I-66 project in Virginia and Denver airport increased the Construction backlog by more than 2 billion. As for Australia, the Western Roads Upgrade Project in Melbourne represents a sizeable backlog for Services.

Sustainability.- Ferrovial continues to be a

Rafael del Pino Chairman

member of the DJSI, FTSE4Good and Carbon Disclosure Project, while retaining an AAA rating from MSCI. Additionally, the application of the

"Target Zero" principles in health and safety

improved accident rates, and the company also exceeded its

emission reduction commitment.

Ethics.- The company emphasizes that it is firmly committed to irreproachable ethical conduct. Ferrovial is confident that its policies, procedures, training and oversight offer sufficient assurance of impeccable conduct in the market.

Innovation.- The focus on open innovation, is reflected in the relationship with MIT and other prestigious universities, the implementation of the Digital Hub, and the relationships with startups.

Outlook.- The United States, Australia and Canada have a considerable need to upgrade and modernize their infrastructures. Ferrovial is closely monitoring these markets convinced on its competitive ability to offer original and efficient solutions to urban congestion and citizen mobility, thus covering the entire infrastructure cycle.

People.- The worldwide headcount was 95,978 at year-end; and the quality of our people represents a differentiating element towards our customers.

To conclude I would like to express my gratitude to the shareholders and customers for placing their trust in Ferrovial, and to all our professionals for their capability, commitment and values.

THE ERA OF THEHOMO MOBILIS
THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY FACES A HUGE TRANSFORMATION DUE TO NEW SOCIAL TRENDS AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION

A
A NEW SOCIETY IS EMERGING,
"Homo mobilis" conceives transportation as a shared, cheaper and simpler service. The urban concentration is growing, while traffic congestion is a problem in large cities. The planet is heating up and pollution and emissions must be reduced. Digital technology focuses on the user, based on data, fully integrated into networks, with dynamic rates, based on public-private collaboration.

B
FERROVIAL IS LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES...
Ferrovial, throw itsfour busimess line is identifying challenges and opportunities; boosting its internal capacities such as the Innovation Center, the Digital Hub, the Competence Centers and the Technical Offices; establishing alliances with research centers such as MIT*; participating in multilateral projects promoted by the EC Horizon 2020* program, EIT KICs*, or with national innovation authorities; exploring and collaborating with startups through programs like BuildUp!*; and partnering with other large corporations.

*See glossary of terms page 118.

C
...AND OFFERING SOLUTIONS FOR TODAY
The "homo mobilis" is already moving around the world, which is why Ferrovial is proposing real alternatives in its airports, toll roads and cities. Solutions that combine emerging technologies with experienced management. Dynamic tariffs, tolls without barriers, data usage, flexibility for the user, robotics, air traffic automation, Managed Lanes, 407 ETR, Heathrow and services to cities. Zity, the car sharing launched in Madrid, is another example of this spirit of innovation that pursues efficiency and improvement of quality of life.

FAST, SAFE AND RELIABLE ARE THREE OF THE ATTRIBUTES THAT ENCOURAGE OVER 400,000 TRIPS (MOVING MORE THAN 500,000 PEOPLE) ON THE TOLL ROAD IN TORONTO, CANADA EVERY DAY. IT IS THE FIRST FULLY ELECTRONIC TOLL ROAD IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BARRIERS AND RUNS 108 KILOMETRES EAST TO WEST ACROSS THE REGION. ITS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS USERS TO ENTER AND EXIT WITHOUT STOPS OR DELAYS, HELPING DRIVERS WHO USE THE ROAD AVOID CONGESTION AND TRAFFIC JAMS. DRIVERS SAVE TIME AND GAS AND REDUCE THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS.

500,000 people circulate on weekdays, around 150 million per year.
60% of the drivers confirm saving between 20 and 60 minutes per trip. They also save on fuel and maintenance.
230 km of lane added to keep traffic flowing safely and reliably.
2,600 million km travelled every year. Equivalent of 60,000 trips around the World.

GLOBAL VISION
FERROVIAL'S VISION IS TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURES AND CITIES, WITH A COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SAFETY, OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND INNOVATION, CREATING VALUE FOR SOCIETY AND FOR CLIENTS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES.

BACKGROUND
EEconomic performance is positive in Ferrovial's priority markets:
 In the United States, it is expected that during 2018 both the infrastructure investment plan (>1 trillion dollars) and the effects of the tax reform will be finalized.

 In the United Kingdom, negotiations with the EU for the Brexit continue, while investment in infrastructure is reinforced (600 billion pounds for the next decade).
 In Spain,the Government has approved a 5 billion euros infrastructure plan for the next two years.
 In Australia, the Government approved an infrastructure investment plan of 50 billion Australian dollars (32 billion euros) during the period 2013-2020, with special focus on transport, defense and renewable energy sectors.
 In Canada and Poland, investment continues to be promoted through infrastructure plans.

FERROVIAL FOCUSES ITS STRATEGY ON THREE KEY PRIORITIES: PROFITABLE GROWTH, INNOVATION AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND REAFFIRMS ITS INTEREST IN TRANSPORT AND MOBILITY BY DEVELOPING PROJECTS SUCH AS MANAGED LANES, THE DENVER AIRPORT, OR THE LAUNCH OF ZITY TO OPERATE THE CAR SHARING BUSINESS IN MADRID.

*Bridging Global Infrastructure Gaps. McKinsey Global Institute, 2016

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
In the current context, the main opportunities for business development are:
 Investment needs in infrastructures are still significant. Global investments of 3.3 trillion dollars per year are estimated until 2030*, of which a significant part will be made in key markets for Ferrovial. In addition, the difference between the needs and the rhythm of investment, added to the budgetary restrictions of the Public Administrations, are an opportunity for the private sector.
 Technological development and digitalization improve the efficiency and productivity of operations. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, robotics and others facilitating interaction with end users, optimizing the use of infrastructures and developing new businesses.
 The growth of the population and the concentration in urban centers, which increase congestion both in cities and in accesses, demand new mobility solutions. Autonomous driving, vehicle sharing and electrification will affect both transport infrastructures and the mobility services demanded. The mobility of people and goods is

24

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

one of the main sources of CO2 emissions. In this sense, it is important to design sustainable solutions to face challenges such as increased traffic and energy efficiency.
Meanwhile, the main challenges are:
 More competition in the infrastructure sector. Traditional companies have been joined by companies from emerging countries, mainly Asian, and financial investors who continue to increase their investment in the sector and technology companies developing new business models.
 Regulation and legal security are key factors and require active and efficient risk management, from contracting to the execution of projects.
 Economic environment. As mentioned, some geographical locations involve uncertainties that can affect the business.
STRATEGY
With the aim of creating value for society and for its clients, shareholders and employees, Ferrovial focuses its strategy around three key priorities:
 Profitable growth: with an international focus on six priority countries: the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Spain and Poland. In addition, it selectively develops its presence in other countries, taking into account criteria such as forecast investments, legal security and the level of development of the financial markets, among others. The presence of a group unit in a new country serves as a platform for the entry of new

businesses, generating economies of scale.
As far as sectors are concerned, the company continues to focus its activity on Highways, Airports, Construction and Services, with an industrial focus on complex projects and value-added services. Opportunities are also being explored in electricity transmission.
Ferrovial reaffirms its interest in transport and mobility by developing Managed Lanes projects such as the I-66 highway, Denver airport, the Zity launch to operate the carpooling business in Madrid, and the Western Roads Upgrade project, for the operation of highways in the west of Melbourne (Australia).
 Innovation: the company continues to promote an open innovation model with different external agents such as Public Administrations, research centers, large companies, startups and entrepreneurs, among others, encouraging the continuous exchange of solutions with the outside world. The main objective is the generation of sustainable competitive advantages to develop the operation in a more efficient and profitable way.
In this sense, the company uses new technologies to develop solutions such as dynamic real-time pricing on highways, the automation of passenger and employee traffic in airports and the use of IoT platforms for energy consumption management.
 Operational excellence: the quality of the executed projects and the services provided, the generation of recurrent cash and the efficient management of complex operations

remains essential to the offer of value-added solutions. In this connection, the development of tools such as the InSite project management system, makes it possible to maintain in-depth control over the progress of works.

Furthermore, to generate greater client and user satis-

faction, the company is promoting initiatives such as

automatic payment in satellite tolls and the design of

optimal waste collection routes using artificial

intelligence.
The development of the aforementioned strategic priorities is based on three basic pillars for the company:
 People: Ferrovial seeks to attract and retain the best talent, forming experienced teams committed to the company as part of a collaborative, flexible and inclusive working environment. The development of its human resources is key to facing challenges such as the internationalization, the constant innovation and the digital transformation of its activities. To develop digital capacities at the organization throughout 2017, the "Play the Future" project was launched, the goal of which is to familiarize employees with key elements of new

technologies (such as artificial intelligence, Big

Data, IoT, drones, etc.) and relevant topics to

railroad activities, such as people's mobility in the future.

 Financial discipline: the basis of any Ferrovial activity and materialized in:

 Comprehensive cost control and cash generation at all stages in each project.
 Asset rotation to crystallize the value of investments and fund future growth.
 Maintenance of an investment grade rating at corporate level to ensure low debt levels and competitive financing costs.
 The commitment to transparency with investors, shareholders, rating agencies and bondholders promotes a relationship of trust and allows continued access to financial markets at lower cost and with better terms.
 Sustainability: this is an important factor in the company's operation, which is reflected in the development of Corporate Responsibility projects and in the continuous presence in the main international sustainability indexes. The continued presence for 13 and 16 years in the FTSE4Good and DowJones Sustainability Index, respectively, should be noted. In addition, Ferrovial focuses on improving and optimizing the safety of users of its infrastructures and of its employees. In this regard, the naming of Heathrow as the best airport in the world in terms of security by the International Airport Review is noteworthy.
In summary, Ferrovial is a global infrastructure operator whose objective is to maximize the creation of value for all its stakeholders. The company, which participates with an industrial approach in all phases of the infrastructure cycle, reaffirms its commitment to providing efficient and sustainable transport and mobility solutions.

THE WORLD IS MOVING, AND FERROVIAL IS AS WELL
Every minute, 70 aircraft take off around the world. Right now, 10,000 aircraft are flying, transporting 1.5 million people on board. The world is driven by curiosity and a new nomadism in which technology and collaborative economy make travel easier and cheaper. Autonomous, electric and shared cars will change land transport, just as the return of the bicycle is doing in large cities. Ferrovial is playing a part in this change. In both the search for new solutions under an open innovation scheme, as well as contributing with new solutions such as car sharing Zity, Bike BCN and autonomous vehicles such as Navya and POD at Heathrow and the Satelise and Viriato projects.

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

TOLL ROADS
CINTRA IS A LEADER IN THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF PROJECTS AND THE VOLUME OF INVESTMENT. IT HAS 19,590 MILLION IN TOTAL MANAGED INVESTMENT, WITH TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE PROJECTS AND HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS.

BACKGROUND
CCintra develops its activity in predictable institutional
markets, with good economic prospects (North America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Colombia, Chile and Peru), and a high need for transport infrastructure, especially those that solve traffic congestion problems in urban areas (complex greenfield concessions) and that have freedom of pricing. It should also be mentioned that in built and mature projects (brownfield), the competition of infrastructure and pension funds is growing. The more than 50 years of experience accumulated in the sector, together with the synergies that it presents together with Ferrovial Agroman, make Cintra a company with a high potential for creating value and strong competitive advantages.
MAIN ASSETS
Cintra owns 43.23% of the 407 ETR toll road in Toronto (Canada), and 62.97% and 54.6% of the Managed Lanes NTE and LBJ toll roads in Texas (USA), respectively. These assets operate as free-flow tolls (without barriers) and are notable for their long duration and broad toll rate flexibility. In the Managed Lanes, the toll rates are dynamic, adjusted according to congestion levels, always guaranteeing a minimum speed for drivers.
VALUE CREATION
Risk reduction or "de-risking"
The price of a concession is determined by a number of factors, including the rate of return (IRR) at which it is tendered, which is the result of adding a risk premium to the risk-free rate that takes into account the risks assumed by shareholders when they invest in the concession (mainly construction, finance, operation and traffic). Subsequently, as the concession progresses, Cintra reduces or eliminates those initial risks, thus decreasing the risk premium and progressively increasing its value. This value creation process does not require any improvement over the forecast volumes, but compliance with the initial estimates.
Thus, NTE and LBJ, inaugurated in 2014 and 2015, respectively, have reached the original revenue forecasts. Although they are still in the ramp-up period, they have already reduced a significant part of the operational risks. Another example is the I-66 toll road, in Virginia (USA), which has already reached financial closure, thus eliminating this risk.
Operational and financial efficiencies
Cintra seeks to maximize operating cash flows through efficient management, innovation and the search for synergies

with its other toll roads always guaranteeing user satisfaction. Cintra contracts financing that optimizes returns for the shareholder and adapts as much as possible to the cash generation of the project.
In 2017, Cintra closed the financing of the Western Roads Upgrade project in Melbourne (Australia) with a total debt of 665 million Australian dollars, of which 400 million came from a long-term private placement to institutional investors (USPP). It is the first time in Australia that a toll road under P3 format with construction risk has been financed in the long-term capital market.
In order to estimate and optimize traffic and revenue, Cintra uses Big Data techniques to better understand congestion problems and driver behavior, with a dual objective:
 Improve reliability and reduce the estimation period of traffic and revenue in new projects: this allowed it to carry out several feasibility studies of new Managed Lanes projects in 2017 and present innovative solutions to the Administrations in record time and at minimum cost, helping to develop a pipeline of opportunities for this type of investment. They identify, for example, congestion and travel patterns in the corridor by analyzing traces of vehicles with GPS. This makes it possible to know the levels, the places of congestion and the movements of the users with enormous reliability, and to identify initiatives to improve connectivity, increasing catchment -and therefore the income and the feasibility- of each project.
 Optimize rates to efficiently manage the projects in operation: the 407 ETR followed the strategy initiated in 2016 to optimize the pricing policy by segment and direction according to the Big Data traffic analysis, of the toll road itself and its alternative route.
Renegotiation of contracts
In the long life of concession and finance agreements, it is normal for modifications to be renegotiated as a result of the changing needs of the public authorities, variations in the characteristics of the corridors, or the situation of the financial markets. In these cases, Cintra proposes solutions that improve the risk profile of the asset and/or its generation of cash flows for the shareholder.
High-complexity greenfield projects
Cintra focuses primarily on complex greenfield projects due to their high value creation potential (better rewarded for higher risks), their high pipeline potential (they are an economically efficient solution for congested corridors and

have a good political acceptance) and their great competitive advantages.

This is seen in the I-66 toll road (Virginia, USA) a highly technical Managed Lanes project with a high concession value, whose financing was recently closed with a total debt of more than 2,000 million dollars, with average maturity close to 40 years and average cost of around 3.2%.

Turnover of mature assets

After reducing risks, the value created is materialized with the sale of mature projects, using the income obtained to invest in new assets with a higher potential for profitability.

In 2017, Cintra closed the transmission of 49% of the Via do Infante toll road and 51% of Norte Litoral, both in Portugal, with the Dutch infrastructure fund DIF, for 161 million euro. As a result, Cintra has become the owner of 48% and 49% respectively, remaining as a reference industrial partner.

Company: socially responsible infrastructures

Due to their high level of complexity, innovation and efficiency, the projects developed by Cintra offer sustainable solutions that improve congestion in big cities, reduce pollution, decrease the number of accidents, raise user satisfaction and contribute substantially to improve people's quality of life.

In Dallas, Texas (USA), Ferrovial successfully took on several

83%. This earned its call center the World Class Call Center in 2017 awarded by the SQM agency.
Employees: supporting merit
Cintra promotes a culture of merit both in the internal professional or geographical mobility of employees and in their professional development. In 2017, 12% of the workforce structure was able to change position or location, and one out of every five people from the team are currently working on an international assignment. Additionally, 34% of employees have had an international assignment during their professional career in the company.

THE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES
Cintra is promoting three lines of research at the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Texas (Austin, USA). The aim is to analyze the potential impact of new transport technologies on the business and take better advantage of the opportunities they offer. These lines are: the ride-hailing and car sharing services; the adaptation of roads for the use of autonomous and connected vehicles; and the foreseeable impact on congestion, due to the coexistence of autonomous and conventional vehicles in upcoming decades.
FINANCIAL CLOSURE OF TOLL ROAD I-66
Cintra has reached the financial closure of the I-66 toll road (Virginia, USA), a concession awarded in 2016 of 35 kilometers of highly complex Managed Lanes with a high concessional value, with an investment of 3,550 million dollar. To finance the investment, Cintra has used an issue of 737 million dollar in Private Activity Bonds (PABs), with a return of 3.92% and maturities between 2047 and 2056. The issue was oversubscribed more than 4.9 times. In addition, Cintra closed a TIFIA loan for an initial amount of 1,229 million dollars maturing in 2057. The total debt (PABs and TIFIA) has obtained a BBB rating by Fitch Ratings and Baa3 by Moody's.

HEATHROW EXPANSION
In 2017, Heathrow Airport continued to work on the expansion project, having received the support of the Airports Commission and the British Government as the best alternative to increase airport capacity in the United Kingdom. In February, the British Government released the first draft of the National Policy Statement. After a consultation period, the final version of the plan that will be presented to the British Parliament for approval in the first half of 2018 will be agreed upon.

BACKGROUND
TThe upward trend in the number of public-private partnership projects (P3s) at US airports has
been one of the great milestones that have marked 2017. Ferrovial Airports has taken advantage of the new opportunities and will continue to strengthen its capabilities and positioning in the country to be able to win new projects that will foreseeably arise during the coming years.
Meanwhile, in 2017, it once again saw a positive trend in the growth of the number of passengers worldwide. To this day, the Brexit has not had a negative impact on the activity of British airports. Ferrovial Airports is closely following the progress of this process, with the aim of optimizing the possible impacts on the assets that the business has in the country.
MAIN ASSETS
Ferrovial Airports is the main shareholder of Heathrow Airport, the largest airport in Europe, with a 25% share. It also owns 50% of the Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports (grouped under the AGS brand). In total, these assets have served more than 93 million passengers this year. There are 81 airlines operating at Heathrow Airport that offer flights to 204 destinations.
The strategy in the asset portfolio is to maximize its value creation. In particular, since the acquisition of AGS, the focus has been on profitable growth, optimizing investment in airport capacity, increasing passengers with new routes and diversifying airlines and maintaining operational excellence and improving service quality.
VALUE CREATION
A comprehensive service
The integrated approach with the Group's Construction and Services, together with the experience in management and financing capacity of Ferrovial Airports, generate unique capabilities in tender processes. This has been one of the key elements for the award of the Great Hall project contract at Denver International Airport, which combines the construction experience of Ferrovial Agroman with the operational and financial capabilities of Ferrovial Airports.
Operational excellence
Ferrovial Airports aims for the highest efficiency in operating costs and the financial structure of its assets, together with commercial initiatives that imply an increase in revenues.
During 2017, a 3.1% growth in traffic at Heathrow, together with the expense control policy, allowed the gross operating result to increase by 4.6%. The renegotiation of contracts such as NATS, together with the efficiencies achieved in personnel expenses absorb the increase in expenses due to the growth of passengers while maintaining the high level of service. Likewise, the commercial revenue from the airport has benefited from the depreciation of the pound since 2016, and the impact of the renovation of the commercial area of terminals T4 and T5.
At AGS, the 10.7% improvement of the gross operating result in 2017 was possible thanks to the combination of traffic growth and the improvement of commercial revenue per passenger at the three airports. This improvement in profitability is mainly due to the refurbishment of the Aberdeen terminal, the new Glasgow passenger access fee and the renegotiation of the contract in the Glasgow parking lot.
AGS also completed the refinancing of the acquisition debt in the first quarter of 2017, two years after the acquisition process. The new debt optimizes the financial structure of the company and extends the terms. As a result of this refinancing, an extraordinary distribution of 75 million pounds was made to its shareholders.
Commitment to innovation and the environment
Innovation is one of the key elements of the value proposal. In the last year, Ferrovial Airports has launched a large number of innovative projects:

STRATEGY AND VALUE CREATION A

31

 Robird: a pioneering pilot project in the United Kingdom in which a drone in the shape of a bird, and which flies like a bird, scares off birds that fly over runways, reducing the risk of contact in the landing and takeoff of aircraft and in general operations on airport runways.
 Autonomous vehicle: at Heathrow Airport, pilot tests were carried out with autonomous vehicles for transporting passengers and employees in its terminals.
 Airport Centre of Excellence: in mid-2017, Ferrovial Airports signed a collaboration agreement as sole private operator of the first Airport Centre of Excellence, launched by Lion & Gazelle. The aim of the center is to identify trends in operations and technology applied to airports and develop innovative solutions and good practices in the processes.
Passengers: user experience
The quality of service and continuous improvement of operations are keys for Ferrovial Airports. This effort is reflected in the rating obtained in the Airports Council International (ACI) passenger satisfaction surveys and the numerous awards that recognize this focus.
The Transport News magazine has recognized Ferrovial Airports as "Best Airport Portfolio Manager in Europe" in its latest edition of the 2017 Air Transport Awards.
In Heathrow, 82% of passengers rate their experience at the four airports as either "very good" or "excellent", according to

the Independent Airport Service Quality Survey conducted by ACI. In addition, the airport continued to receive recognition for its high service standards ("Best Western European airport" for the third consecutive time and "Best airport to go shopping" for the eighth consecutive time in the Skytrax 2017 awards).
Employees: mobility and diversity
The company is committed to the professional development of its teams through training and functional and geographic mobility programs. In 2017, 15% of the teams worked on some type of mobility or temporary assignment. It is also a line of business that is committed to diversity, since 38% of employees are women.
Society: committed to the community
Ferrovial Airports has a firm commitment to the sustainable growth of its assets and with its local communities.
Heathrow Airport launched the "Heathrow 2.0" sustainability plan at the start of 2017 with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of aviation while optimizing growth opportunities in the United Kingdom.
In 2017 Heathrow launched the Green Car Scheme to encourage employees to change their car to a low-emission one, and became one of the first ten members of the EV100, a global initiative to bring together the companies most committed to the transition to electric vehicles.

GREAT HALL PROJECT (DENVER)
In 2017, the consortium led by Ferrovial Airports was awarded the Great Hall project to carry out the remodeling and commercial operations of the main terminal, Jeppesen Terminal, at Denver International Airport, for a period of 34 years. Ferrovial Agroman, together with Saunders, a local construction company, will be responsible for carrying out the refurbishment of more than 70,000 m2, which is a 650 million dollar investment.

4,600 km of highways), 5,300 km of railroads (including 1,000 km of high speed railroads) and more than 40 airports.
BACKGROUND
Ferrovial Agroman focuses its activity on the international market, which is characterized by a strong competition from global construction companies and local companies. Its differential strategic approach with other competitors concentrates the activity in large selected countries, with developed economies, a firm commitment to modernize their infrastructures and large projects that are technically and administratively complex. These countries offer a tangible and growing pipeline of more than 150,000 million euro.
In key markets in the USA and Canada, there will be a strong increase in investment in transport infrastructures, especially in privately financed projects where Ferrovial, with Ferrovial Agroman as the constructor, is one of the leaders. The support of the Federal Governments and the growing investment initiative of the states/provinces will give continuity to major awards such as I-66 Toll road (Virginia, USA) for 1,900 million euro, the largest of 2017 for Ferrovial Agroman.
Poland continues to present a favorable outlook, with the recovery of the civil works bid in 2017 and the Government's extension of the provision and execution period of the long-term investment plans in roads and railroads.
In Spain, although activity continues to slow down with only a certain improvement in private construction, the Government's launch of the Extraordinary Plan of Investment in Roads, with an expected investment of 5,000 million euro, means that the future can be faced in a more positive light.
VALUE CREATION
Exceptional and complex projects, with broad diversification between sectors. The company specializes in highly technical projects, standing out from its peers through the experience and international presence of its Technical Office, focused on the search for optimal engineering solutions for each client and project. Among other milestones, in 2017, the tunneling works were completed at the Northern Line Extension of the London Underground, for which the Ground Engineering Award for technical excellence has been received for the improvements in cost and safety compared to conventional methods.
The sectorial diversification of Ferrovial Agroman makes it possible to undertake very different types of civil, industrial and building projects, expanding the potential market. As shown, in 2017, Budimex, which was already the overall leader in road construction in the sector in Poland, managed to position itself among the main railroad contractors, with the award of six large contracts worth over 500 million euro.
Selective internationalization. The international focus is on increasing presence in markets of the USA, Poland, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as Spain, the home market, persevering with the strategy defined in recent years. It is also present in stable countries in Latin America such as Chile, Colombia and Peru, for large projects in which differential added value is generated.
Based on this strategy, bidding is avoided in new countries of lower interest, except for exceptional one-off cases in projects with limited competition and risks, together with local leaders and in OECD countries.
The strong investment in infrastructure and good profitability obtained by the company motivated Ferrovial Agroman to increase its commitment to the USA, doubling its order book in 2017. The

awarding of a section of the Grand Parkway bypass in Texas for almost 800 million euro, where Ferrovial Agroman and its subsidiary Webber are leaders in civil works; I-66 Toll road in Virginia, and the remodeling of the Denver Airport terminal in Colorado for more than 500 million euro are all noteworthy.

Risk management, financial discipline and cost control. The Construction business is characterized by high volumes and tight margins, so correct selection of projects and optimal risk management are key, both at the bidding and execution stages. In the first phase, countries with legal certainty are chosen, with projects where competitive advantages and expert partners can be a determining factor, limiting errors in price, deadlines and contractual conditions, which are difficult to mitigate subsequently in the execution phase.

LEADER IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIM TECHNOLOGY

Cost control and planning of the project is essential at Ferrovial Agroman. It has developed proprietary tools such as the InSite project management system, which provides quick and flexible control, with the necessary level of detail.

Ferrovial Agroman has implemented this work methodology in all the geographical areas in which it has a presence, applying it to different types of work, both in construction and civil works, enabeling the integral management of the life cicle of buldings and infrastuctures. Crossrail Farringdon, Northern Line Extension, Thames Tideway and the Harwood Bridge are good examples of the successful use of BIM

SERVICES
FERROVIAL SERVICES IS AN INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARK IN THE DESIGN AND PROVISION OF SERVICES THAT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY, FUNCTIONALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURES AND CITIES.

BACKGROUND
TThe operating environment in which Ferrovial Services carries
out its activities shows its particularities according to the geographical area in which it works.
The United Kingdom reduced its rate of growth in 2017, even though the labor market has recorded close to full employment. In this context, the ability of Public Administrations to increase their spending levels remains limited, so the pressure is maintained on margins and the limited number of opportunities available in the market.
In the case of Australia and New Zealand, their favorable economic situation continues to drive the growth of the market of services related to infrastructures, whose attractiveness explains the recent strengthening of the sector. Australia has announced plans to boost investment in transport infrastructure, government/defense and renewable energy. The prospects of the oil, gas and mining sectors are positive because of the upward trend in the prices of natural resources.
Spain has confirmed its macroeconomic improvement, although the continuation of fiscal consolidation policies and political uncertainty have led to lower bidding activity in the public sector.Ferrovial Services Spain has continued to strengthen its profitable development through programs for the continuous improvement of its operations, optimizing processes and integrating technology. With regard to growth, the company expects to capture the greatest dynamism of new customer profiles such as the industrial sector (for example, high added value logistics services) and the offer of services to citizens (for example, shared vehicles).

This is achieved through collaboration with clients, the integral vision of the life cycle of infrastructures, the intelligent application of technology and the transfer of knowledge developed in its geographical areas and sectors of activity. This value proposal fits in perfectly with the growing demand for more efficient and sustainable infrastructures and cities.
Ferrovial Services bases its strategy on the following pillars:
 Continuous improvement of profitability and cash generation to provide attractive returns to shareholders and support the financing of capital intensive businesses. The main levers to achieve this objective are the restructuring of or exit from unprofitable contracts, operational excellence and focusing on the most attractive tenders in terms of profitability and risk.
Thus, in 2017 the first phase of the "Fit 4 the Future" cost reduction program in Amey was completed, including the reduction of the workforce of more than 850 people and the rationalization of the contract portfolio, leaving contracts as in the case of Liverpool City Council or Affinity Water, with the purpose of reaching the target margins.
Also Broadspectrum, which in October 2017 finished the contracts in the immigration centers according to the plans announced at the time of their acquisition,
OPTIMIZATION OF WASTE COLLECTION ROUTES
In 2017, Ferrovial Services intensified the integration of new technologies in its operations to optimize its economic, environmental and social contribution for the benefit of clients, employees and society in general. A good example is the application of data analytics to urban services, put into practice in the collection service of recyclable materials in Granada, in collaboration with the City Council and Cisco. Using an infrastructure based on the Internet of Things (IoT), with sensors installed in more than 400 containers, an analytical platform optimizes the cost and environmental footprint of the fleet through the dynamic design of routes based on variables such as container filling or weather conditions.

STRATEGY AND VALUE CREATION A

has optimized its cost structure including a reduction in personnel, has undertaken the restructuring of contracts with low profitability and is positioning itself to take advantage of opportunities in its priority markets: transport, administration / defense, urban infrastructures and natural resources.
 Concentration in current geographical areas to achieve and consolidate leadership positions in services and sectors of activity with greater opportunities for differentiation. The markets in which Ferrovial Services currently operates are an optimal platform to offer stateof-the-art solutions while acquiring new capabilities. A good example of growth in a strategic country, capitalizing on differential capabilities such as local knowledge and experience in managing the life cycle of assets is the OSARs West contract for 20 years maintenance of the road network in the western area of Melbourne, Australia, resulting from the collaboration between Cintra and Ferrovial Services, which includes a significant portfolio of services for Broadspectrum and for Amey.
 Innovation, through which the company pursues the development of service models that improve the efficiency and quality of life of citizens. With the aim of implementing its business model in line with a new global scale after the acquisition of Broadspectrum, Ferrovial Services has created a new Innovation and Change Division, responsible for the innovation strategy, the coordination of the activities of Competence Centers and the identification and management of transversal initiatives for operational improvement and capability transfer.

An example of an innovation program initiated in 2017 is the development in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, of a prototype of autonomous vehicle with sensors designed to support activities in the urban environment such as asset inspections, waste collection or road maintenance.
 Replicate best practices to offer the best offer of services to the client. To move forward with this objective, Ferrovial Services has identified its differential capabilities, has enabled the geographical mobility of more than 100 internal managers and experts and has promoted the development of the company's five Competence Centers (Asset management, Cities, Energy and Facility Management, Environment and Natural Resources). This contribution of skills is especially relevant in new geographical areas such as North America, where resources and specialized knowledge in road maintenance have been transferred.
 Zero operating accidents to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and the communities in which it carries out its activities. To do so, programs of awareness and exchange of best practices have been implemented and new technologies applied in operations. For example, in 2017 workers at Amey environmental services in Wolverhampton participated in a program to measure physiological parameters with devices integrated into smart vests. The conclusions made it possible to identify actions to reduce stress and make the development of work healthier.

LAUNCH OF THE ZITY CAR SHARING SERVICE (MADRID)
The transformation of urban mobility opens up opportunities for Ferrovial Services to promote new business models, technologically focused and interactive with citizens, which improve the efficiency and sustainability of cities. Ferrovial Services is developing these new capabilities through practical experimental methodologies, knowledge of other Ferrovial divisions and alliances with external agents with complementary capabilities. A good example of Ferrovial Services' commitment to urban mobility is Zity, a carsharing service that operates in Madrid in collaboration with Renault. Zity was launched in December 2017 with an initial fleet of 500 electric vehicles fully recharged with renewable energy and zero emissions.

MANAGED LANES AGAINST URBAN CONGESTION
By 2050, it is anticipated that around 6,000 million people will live in urban environments, with dozens of cities having populations of more than 10 million inhabitants. The traffic jams are already, and will be even more of a problem regarding loss of time, environment and deterioration of quality of life. Ferrovial, with Cintra, has found a new, sustainable and efficient solution. They are Managed Lanes, already implemented in Texas and soon in Virginia. Based on barrier-free tolls with dynamic charging, they guarantee speed, safety and an improvement for the environment for drivers.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

OOperating Cash Flow excluding infrastructure projects reached
EUR999mn in 2017, with a balanced contribution from infrastructure dividends (49%) and non-infrastructure operating cash flow (51%).
The net cash position, excluding infrastructure projects, stood at EUR1,341mn at year-end 2017 (EUR697mn at year-end 2016). This figure includes the cash obtained from the hybrid subordinated bond issuance, treated as an equity instrument. Net project debt stood at EUR4,804mn (vs. EUR4,963mn in December 2016). Net consolidated debt reached EUR3,463mn (vs. EUR4,266mn in December 2016).
In the results for 2017, infrastructure assets continued to perform well (407 ETR, Managed Lanes, HAH and AGS), with solid growth in traffic volumes and greater contribution from dividends (EUR553mn vs. EUR477mn in 2016).
The combined Construction and Services order book, above EUR32bn (including JVs), fell by -4.3% vs. 2016, affected by the decline in the Amey order book (-17.0%), where tender control and gaining improved margins are being prioritised.
Consolidated results in 2017, showed revenues up (+13.5%) impacted by the contribution from Broadspectrum, which has consolidated since June 2016 and EBITDA (-1.2%), due to poorer performance from Construction. In comparable terms, revenues grew +7.2% and EBITDA decreased -4.2% vs. 2016. Net profit stood at EUR454mn at year-end 2017 (EUR376mn in 2016).
MAIN INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS:
Robust operating growth: EBITDA grew in local currency: +12.1% at the 407 ETR, +4.6% at Heathrow airport and +10.7% at the regional UK airports (AGS). All of these assets are accounted for by the equity method. There was also strong growth in Managed Lanes in the USA (Global consolidation) with EBITDA growth in local currency of +32.6% for NTE and +37.4% for LBJ.
Greater distribution of funds in the main assets:
· 407 ETR distributed dividends of CAD845mn in 2017, +7% vs. 2016. The dividends distributed to Ferrovial amounted to EUR262mn.
· Heathrow paid out GBP525mn compared to GBP325mn in 2016, thanks to good operating performance (traffic and cost management) and the impact from a recovery in inflation. The dividends distributed to Ferrovial amounted to EUR153mn.
· AGS paid out GBP146mn (including GBP75mn in extraordinary dividends after its refinancing). Ferrovial received EUR84mn in 2017.
MAIN CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS IN 2017:
· In September 2017, Cintra, along with the other Managed Lanes partners (Meridiam and APG), acquired the Dallas Fire & Police Pension Scheme's stake in NTE (10%) and LBJ (7%). Cintra acquired 6.3% in NTE and 3.6% in LBJ, and now holds 62.97% in NTE and 54.6% in LBJ. Cintra paid USD107mn for the stake (NTE USD65mn and LBJ USD42mn).

· In June 2016, Ferrovial agreed the sale of 51% of the Norte Litoral toll road and 49% of the Algarve toll road, retaining a respective 49% and 48% stake. The sale of Norte Litoral was completed on 21 April 2017 (EUR104mn) and Algarve on 26 September 2017 (EUR58mn).
· On 31 March 2017, 1 million shares in Budimex were sold (3.9% of its share capital), which had no impact on Ferrovial's profit and loss account, as it retains a controlling share (55.1%). The transaction was completed for +EUR59mn (PLN252mn).
MAIN FINANCIAL EVENTS:
· At corporate level, in November, a EUR500mn hybrid subordinated bond issuance was completed, with an annual coupon of 2.125%, in order to capitalise on the favourable market climate, and thereby increase the Company's ability to invest in infrastructure projects, given the prospect of an increase in tenders in the main countries where Ferrovial operates. These bonds are considered to be an equity instrument.
· In March 2017, Ferrovial issued EUR500mn, 8 year corporate bond with an annual coupon of 1.375%.
· 407 ETR made various bond issues in 2017: in March, it carried out a CAD250mn senior bond issuance (maturing in 2033 and with an annual coupon of 3.43%) and in September, two bond issues for a total of CAD800mn (CAD500mn at 27 years and a coupon of 3.65% and CAD300mn at five years and a coupon of 2.47%).
· The first quarter of 2017 saw the completion of the refinancing of AGS, which led to the improvement of its financing structure, the extension of deadlines, partial repayment of shareholder debt and an increase in the amounts distributed among shareholders (GBP146mn distributed in 2017).
RESULTS BY DIVISION
Toll roads: significant improvement in traffic on the main toll roads, helped by the economic recovery in the countries where the main assets are located. 407 ETR, the Group's most important asset, maintained its operating strength, with traffic growth of +2.6%, supported by the opening of the 407Ext I, which was toll-free up to 1 February 2017. The Managed Lanes in Texas continued to post strong EBITDA growth (NTE +32.6% and LBJ +37.4% in local currency) on the back of robust traffic and tariff growth.
Airports: in 2017, Heathrow airport registered 78 million passengers, +3.1% vs. 2016, achieving record monthly growth for the past 14 consecutive months. Traffic at AGS rose +4.9% (Glasgow +5.7%, Southampton +6.1%, Aberdeen +1.9%). As a result, the airports posted EBITDA growth of +4.6% (HAH) and +10.7% (AGS).
Construction: Revenue growth (+11.0% LfL), with positive performance in all areas. However, the return was down vs. 2016 due to the number of major projects in their initial phases and the lower proportion of toll road concession contracts in the projects currently in progress. In addition, in 2017, relevant losses have been recorded in two completed contracts, one in Colombia (due to an unfavourable ruling) and one in the United Kingdom. The order book reached a record figure of EUR11,145mn (88%

40  MANAGEMENT REPORT 2017. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES A

international) equating to an LfL increase of +26.7%, following the incorporation of major projects such as I-66, Houston Grand Parkway and Denver, all in the USA. Contract awards exceeding EUR1bn are not included, notable among which are the Budimex contracts.
Services: reported revenues (+16.3%) were positively impacted by the integration of Broadspectrum (contributing EUR2,512mn in revenue in 2017, of which EUR2,206mn were obtained in Australia and New Zealand and EUR306mn in America and Chile) and adversely affected by the

weakness of the pound sterling and budgetary cuts in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, Amey posted a significant increase in profitability, thanks to the measures adopted by the company in order to adapt to the new environment (EBITDA margin 3.5% vs. 1.5% in 2016).

RRevenues at the division grew +15.7% in comparable terms in 2017,
bolstered by the higher contribution from the Managed Lanes toll roads in the USA, traffic growth in the majority of assets and due to the payment of success fees (+EUR19mn). In comparable terms, the division posted EBITDA growth of +23.8% in 2017.

The USA accounted for 37.5% of revenue and 42.8% of EBITDA in 2017.

The comparable figures stripped out the FX effect and the changes to the consolidation perimeter in 2016 and 2017. Notably from the disposals of:

· Chicago Skyway: sale to a consortium of Canadian pension funds of Cintra's 55% stake in this asset, for EUR230mn. The sale was completed in February 2016 (two months' contribution in 2016).

· Irish Toll Roads: sale of 46% of M4 and 75% of M3 to the Dutch fund DIF for EUR59mn. Ferrovial retains 20% in each, and they are now consolidated using the equity method. The sale was completed in February 2016 (two months' contribution in 2016).

· Norte Litoral and Algarve: in June 2016, Ferrovial reached an agreement with the Dutch fund DIF to sell a 51% stake in the Norte Litoral toll road and a 49% stake in the Algarve toll road (both contributed 12 months in 2016). In April 2017, the sale of the Norte Litoral stake was completed (aprox. four months contribution in 2017) for EUR104mn; and in September the sale of the Algarve stake was completed (nine months contribution in 2017) for EUR58mn. Both were

consolidated through equity method following the completion of the transactions.
Assets in operation
Traffic performance during 2017 was very positive on Ferrovial's main toll roads, both in terms of light and heavy traffic.
Canada: traffic on the 407 ETR increased by +2.6% in the period (light traffic +2.3% and heavy traffic +6.3%), bolstered by the positive impact of the opening of the 407 East Extension Phase I toll road (open to traffic in June 2016, toll free until February 2017) and by the calendar effect and stronger economic growth in the Ontario region.
USA: traffic growth was driven by the very positive performance of the Managed Lanes toll roads (NTE +10.9% and LBJ +9.3%), which are still in the ramp up phase.
Spain: traffic trended upwards, boosted by the country's economic growth. Traffic at Ausol I grew by +10.3% in 2017 and Ausol II by +5.7%.
Portugal: performance has been positive in 2017, aided by the economic recovery and, in Azores (+6.7%), due to the increase of tourism on the back of the airline market liberalisation. In Algarve (+17.0%), traffic was positively affected by works on the alternative route.
Ireland: continued positive performance thanks to the upturn in employment. 2017 ended with similar growth to 2015 and 2016, around +6% at M4 and close to +9% at M3.
Greece: lower Ionian Roads ADT (-29.3%) due to the opening of new segments in 2017, which has distorted the average daily traffic calculation. Excluding this impact, IMD variation would have been +5.6%.

Note: following Ferrovial's disposal of 10% in 2010, the toll road switched to being accounted for by the equity method, in line with the percentage stake controlled by Ferrovial (43.23%).

Revenues at 407 ETR increased by +11.7% in local currency in 2017.

· Toll revenues (93% of the total): grew by +11.6% to CAD1,178mn, mainly due to the tariff increases applied since February 2017 and the improvement in traffic.

· Fee revenues (6.5% of the total): reached CAD82mn (+20.1%), mainly due to starting to manage the 407 East Ext Phase I toll road, coupled with an increase in the number of transponders and higher tariffs.

Average revenues per journey rose +10.4% (CAD9.96 vs. CAD9.02 in 2016).

The toll road also recorded an increase in EBITDA of +12.1% in 2017, with an EBITDA margin of 87.1% vs. 86.8% in 2016.

Financial result: -CAD358mn, CAD14mn fewer expenses vs. 2016 (+3.9%). Main components:

· Interest expenses: -CAD364mn. CAD14mn higher than in 2016, largely due to the increase in debt, after the recent issuance of CAD800mn in senior bonds in September 2017 and CAD250mn in March 2017.

· Non-cash financial expenses linked to inflation: -CAD9mn vs. CAD34mn expenses in 2016 (up by +CAD25mn), due mainly to the positive impact of falling inflation over 2017, partially compensating for the negative impact resulting from the decrease in the discount rate.

· Other financial income: CAD16mn (vs. CAD11mn in 2016) due to greater returns on investment and higher average cash balance.

407 ETR contributed EUR125mn to Ferrovial's equity-accounted results (+27.8% vs. 2016), after the annual amortization of the goodwill following the sale of 10% in 2010, which is being written down over the life of the asset on the basis of the traffic forecast.

407 ETR dividends

In 2017, 407 ETR distributed dividends of CAD845mn, +7.0% vs. 2016. Of these, EUR262mn were distributed to Ferrovial (EUR244mn in 2016). At the February Board meeting, the 1Q 2018 dividend payment was approved in the amount of CAD226.25mn (+9.0% vs. 1Q 2017).

407 ETR traffic

Traffic (kilometers travelled) rose by +2.6%, with an increase in the number of journeys (+1.0%) and an increase in the average distance travelled (+1.6%). Traffic has been bolstered by the positive impact of the opening of the 407 East Extension Phase I toll road (open to traffic in June 2016, toll free up to February 2017) and by the calendar effect and stronger economic growth in the Ontario region.

In 2017, Ferrovial increased its stake in NTE by +6.3%, reaching 62.97% (see Other Events chapter)

During 2017, revenue rose by +26.8% compared to the year before, on the back of traffic growth and higher tariffs.

EBITDA reached USD75mn (+32.6% vs. 2016). EBITDA margin reached 80.8% during 2017 (+360 basis points), as a result of the growth in revenues and operational cost management.

Toll road traffic continues to increase its market share of traffic on the corridor. The average toll rate per transaction has also risen during the year (+9.9%). Construction progress on the I35W corridor is helping to draw traffic back onto the corridor (that connects to NTE1-2), and the opening of Segment 3B in July 2017 has also benefitted NTE users, by increasing the length of the Managed Lanes network. Finally, the connectivity improvements implemented at Segment 2 of NTE since 2Q 2017, have also had a positive effect on growth.

NTE Quarterly Traffic and EBITDA

In terms of traffic: in 4Q 2017, NTE recorded 6.9 million transactions, +14.2% more than in 4Q 2016 (6.0 million transactions).

Very positive EBITDA performance, with growth of +25.3% between 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2016, as a result of good revenue performance and operating expense management.

In 2017, Ferrovial increased its stake in LBJ by +3.6%, reaching 54.6% (see Other Events chapter).

During 2017, the toll road generated revenues of USD101mn (+33.0% compared with the same period in 2016), as a result of both the continued growth in traffic during the ramp-up phase and higher tariffs.

EBITDA reached USD80mn (+37.4% vs. 2016) helped by a strong surge in traffic. The EBITDA margin reached 79.6%, aided by the significant growth in revenues.

Toll road traffic continued to register robust growth, as did the corridor, which continues to be in its growth phase, exceeding the existing volumes prior to construction of the project. At the same time, the average toll rate per transaction has significantly increased compared to the previous year. Completion of works on the I35E corridor, incorporating the new Managed Lanes operated by TxDOT, has led to a gradual increase in traffic on this corridor that connects directly to LBJ, above the average for other toll roads in the area.

LBJ Quarterly Traffic and EBITDA

In terms of traffic, a total of 10.6 million transactions took place during the fourth quarter of 2017, +5.2% in comparison with 4Q 2016 (10.1 million transactions).

EBITDA in 4Q 2017 reached USD21.4mn, a significant increase compared to 4Q 2016 (+29.8%):

FINANCIAL ASSETS

Under the terms of IFRIC 12, concession contracts are classified as intangible and financial assets. Intangible assets (where the operator assumes the traffic risk) are those for which remuneration is earned from charging the corresponding rates depending on level of use. Financial assets (no traffic risk for the concession holder) in which payment consists of an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets, either because the body awarding the concession guarantees the payment of specific sums, or because it guarantees the recovery of any shortfall between the sums received from users of the public service and the aforementioned specific sums.

The financial assets in operation are: Autema, 407 East Ext Phase I, M8, Algarve, A66, Norte Litoral and Eurolink M3 (except for Autema, all of them are equity-accounted).

NTE 35W: financing close was reached in September 2013. Work is proceeding on schedule (98.9% of design and construction works were completed at December 2017, with the full opening scheduled for the second half of 2018).

I-77: construction works began in November 2015. In December 2017 the design and construction works were 49% complete, and the toll road is expected to open at the end of 2018.

407 East Extension Phase II: At end-December 2017, the design and construction works were 67% complete.

I-66: in October 2016, Cintra won the Transform I-66 Project (Virginia, USA), the commercial negotiations of which were completed on 8 December 2016 and includes the construction of 35 km along the I-66 corridor (between Route 29, close to Gainesville, and the Washington DC Beltway, the I-495, in Fairfax County).

Financial close was completed in November 2017 with the issue of PAB bonds for an amount of USD800mn. The committed capital for this project is estimated at EUR633mn (for Cintra's stake).The term allocated for construction of the project runs until 2022, while the concession is granted for 50 years since the commercial close, which took place in 2016.

Awarding of the "Western Roads Upgrade" contract, Melbourne
In Australia, in October 2017, Cintra was awarded the "Western Roads Upgrade" project (OSARs), an availability payment project with a concession term of 22 and a half years, which consists of the improvement and maintenance of the Melbourne toll road and inter-city motorway network. The commercial agreement was completed on 11 December and the financial agreement on 19 December 2017.
TENDERS PENDING
In the USA, Ferrovial continues to pay close attention to private initiatives.
· In September, the Maryland Department of Transport (MDOT), issued a Request For Information (RFI) for the I-495/I-95 (Capital Beltway) and I-270 Congestion Relief Improvements projects. The MDOT is considering a design, construction, financing, operation and/or maintenance project for both projects, which would take the form of Managed Lanes. These projects fit perfectly with the Cintra strategy, as they are High Complexity Concessions, which Cintra has been extremely competitive on in the past.
· The pre-qualification of the I-10 Mobile River Bridge in Alabama, was presented on 17 November 2017. Cintra was pre-qualified on this project on 2 February 2018.
· We also continue to follow various processes in different states (primarily in Illinois, Maryland, Virginia and Texas).
In Canada, Cintra has been pre-qualified for the Hurontario LTR (Ontario) project, which consists of 20 kilometres of light railway under an availability payment system.
In other markets, Cintra has been pre-qualified for the Silvertown Tunnel project in London (United Kingdom), with an estimated investment of EUR1,230mn.
PROJECT DIVESTMENTS
Norte Litoral & Algarve Toll Roads
In June 2016, Ferrovial, through its toll roads subsidiary Cintra, reached an agreement with the Dutch infrastructure fund DIF to sell 51% of the

Norte Litoral and 49% of the Algarve toll roads. After this transaction, Ferrovial will continue to hold 49% of the Norte Litoral and 48% of the Algarve, as well as its position as the principal industrial partner in both assets.
On 21 April 2017, the sale of a 51% stake in Norte Litoral was approved, for which EUR104mn was received. On 26 September 2017, the sale of the stake in Algarve (49%) was approved, for which EUR58mn was received.
OTHER EVENTS
Acquisition of the Dallas Fire & Police Pension Scheme stake for Managed Lanes
Cintra, along with the other Managed Lanes partners (Meridiam and APG), acquired the Dallas Fire & Police Pension Scheme's stake in NTE (10%) and LBJ (7%) in September 2017. Cintra acquired 6.3% in NTE and 3.6% in LBJ, and now holds 62.97% in NTE and 54.6% in LBJ. The total amount paid by Cintra for the stakes stands at USD107mn (NTE 65mn and LBJ 42mn).
Autema
In July 2015, the official journal of the regional government of Catalonia (Diario Oficial de la Generalitat de Cataluña) published Decree 161/2015, which unilaterally approved changes to the administrative concession for the Tarrasa-Manresa toll road. The new tariffs (discounts) included in this Decree were first applied in January 2016. In October 2016, the concession holder Autopista Tarrasa-Manresa filed a legal challenge to this Decree with the Catalan High Court (TSJC).
A further Decree was published in the official journal of the regional government of Catalonia on 30 December 2016 (337/2016). This was once again unilateral, and it basically amended and extended the discounts contained in the earlier Decree. The concession holder, Autopista Tarrasa-Manresa, also filed a legal challenge to this decree on 20 July 2017.
Both of these legal actions have been adjoined in one single action by the TSJC. The co-defendants (Generalitat de Catalunya and the Consell Comarcal de Bagés) have already submitted their briefs in response to the demands and the procedure is awaiting the start of the test phase.

AIRPORTS

TThe Airports division contributed EUR89mn to Ferrovial's equity-
accounted results during 2017 (vs. -EUR46mn in 2016).
· HAH: EUR87mn in 2017 (-EUR57mn in 2016), was due mainly to the positive mark to market performance of the hedging instruments in 2017, as compared with the negative impact seen in 2016, as a result of an uptick in the expected inflation figure and the cut in interest rates.

· AGS: EUR2mn in 2017 (EUR12mn in 2016) primarily due to the positive non-recurrent non-cash item in 2016, due to changes in the pension plan conditions (EUR7mn) and the two percentage point drop in tax rate to 17% (EUR6mn).

In terms of distributions to shareholders:

· Heathrow paid out GBP525mn (100%), which is significantly more than in 2016 (GBP325mn) and the figure forecasted at the start of the year (GBP375mn). This extraordinary increase was due to the good operating performance and the uptick in inflation. In 2017 Ferrovial received EUR153mn for its stake.
· AGS distributed GBP146mn (100%), of which GBP75mn resulted from an extraordinary distribution following the refinancing carried out in 1Q 2017, which led to optimisation of the financing structure, the extension of maturity terms and the partial repayment of shareholder debt. Ferrovial received EUR84mn in 2017.

CORPORATE OPERATIONS

On 24 August 2017, Great Hall Partners, the consortium led by Ferrovial Airports, signed a contract for the redesign and retail operation of the main terminal at the Denver International Airport for an investment of USD650mn and a term of 34 years.

HEATHROW

Heathrow Traffic

Heathrow achieved a new record in traffic in 2017: 78 million passengers (+3.1%) with 471,082 passenger flights (470,764 in 2016), which reflects the plan launched in 4Q 2017 to increase the use of limited free capacity, which resulted in more than 1,300 additional flights in 4Q.

The higher occupancy levels registered (78% vs. 76% in 2016) represent an increase in inbound demand to United Kingdom, particularly from the Middle East and Asia Pacific. The average number of seats per aircraft increased +0.4% to 212.3 (2016: 211.5).

Intercontinental traffic (+3.6%) has headed up growth thanks to improved occupancy levels. Traffic was particularly robust on the Middle East routes (+9.5%), with larger aircraft and more flights to the Asia Pacific region (+4.5%), introduced as a result of higher occupancy levels on existing routes to Malaysia and new or more services to Thailand,

Philippines and Vietnam. In North America (+1.1%) cargo traffic played a greater role. Latin American traffic rose by +5.5%, due to more flights and higher occupancy levels on the planes.

European traffic increased (+2.4%) as a result of larger aircraft and higher occupancy levels, with notable growth on the routes to Italy, Russia, Belgium, Denmark, Holland and Portugal, with more than 70,000 additional passengers on each route and market. Domestic traffic grew by +3.3%, including the new Flybe services to Scotland.

More than 30% (in value) of non-EU exports from the United Kingdom currently pass through Heathrow. In 2017, cargo volumes at Heathrow increased by +10.2%, making it one of the strongest periods in the last five years, with notable increases in North America and the Middle East.

Heathrow SP Revenue and EBITDA

Revenue grew by +2.7%, thanks to growth in retail revenue (+7.7%), aeronautical revenues (+1.0%) and others (+2.6%).

Average aeronautical revenue per passenger decreased -2.0% to GBP22.00 (GBP22.45 in 2016), but was offset by the increase in traffic (+3.1%), which generated additional revenues by GBP51mn.

Retail revenue (+7.7%), was aided by greater traffic and growth in retail concessions (+10.5%) reflecting the improvement in Duty Free stores and specialist stores, due to the depreciation of sterling after the referendum to leave the EU at the end of June 2016, although this trend has subsided slightly. The remodelling of the luxury goods stores at T4, which was completed at the end of 2016, also contributed to this growth. Restaurant income also registered strong growth, due to the increase in traffic and the refurbishment of restaurants in T5. Net retail revenues per passenger reached GBP8.45, +4.5% compared to 2016.

Heathrow SP's EBITDA increased by +4.6% in 2017 vs. sales growth of +2.7%. The EBITDA margin reached 61.4% (59.9% in 2016). In addition, greater cost control has also helped to reduce operating costs per passenger by -3.1%. Amortization grew by +3.3% vs. 2016.

User satisfaction

Customer satisfaction remained at record highs in 2017, with the airport achieving a scoring of 4.16 out of 5. According to Airport Service Quality (ASQ), 82% of the passengers surveyed classified their experience in the airport as "excellent" or "very good". Heathrow ranked first out of European airports in this service quality survey for the past 13 consecutive quarters. In 2017, Heathrow was nominated "Best Airport in Western Europe" for the third time running by Skytrax World Airport Awards. As well as this award, which was voted for by passengers all around the world, Heathrow as also recognised was the "Best Shopping Airport" for the eighth year running. Heathrow also improved its punctuality and luggage management, reducing the number of suitcases lost to 10 out of 1,000 passengers (14 in 2016).

Regulatory aspects

Regulatory Asset Base (RAB): At 31 December 2017, the RAB reached GBP15,786mn (GBP15,237mn in December 2016).
Regulatory period: in December 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed the extension of the current regulatory period (Q6) until 31 December 2019, maintaining the annual maximum tariff increase per passenger: RPI-1.5%. The latest consultation states that a further extension of Q6 to at least the end of 2020 is expected to be needed, with the CAA emphasising the need for flexibility to better align the start of H7 with commencement of the expansion construction programme.

In 2017, the CAA stated the importance of the regulatory framework of the expansion being based on a system developed over the past 30 years; including the RAB and the single till scheme. We expect to have greater clarity on these matters in April and September 2018, when the CAA publishes its next update.

Expansion: in October 2016, the British Government selected a third runway at Heathrow to increase airport capacity in the South East of England. The expansion requires parliamentary approval of the NPS (National Policy Statement) and the DCO (Development Consent Order) by the Secretary of State, respectively expected between 1H 2018 and 2021. In January 2018, Heathrow launched a consultation on expansion options, which would help to design a plan of action, which help define a preferred masterplan that will be presented in a second consultation in 2019. In December, Heathrow confirmed the possibility of an expansion plan that would be GBP2,5bn less than the one presented to the Airport Commission. The total cost would therefore stand at GBP14bn, which would help to reach the government's proposed target of maintaining airport charges close to current levels.

Glasgow: 9.9 million passengers (+5.7%). Domestic traffic (-1.1%) reflected fewer routes to Stansted and more regional routes on Flybe and Loganair. International traffic grew (+11.5%) via European traffic with new Ryanair routes to Lisbon, Valencia, Palanga and Frankfurt, Jet2's new service to Dubrovnik and more capacity to the Canary Islands, Alicante, Cyprus and Malaga. Long-distance traffic volumes demonstrate the strength of Emirates and the new Delta service to New York.

Aberdeen: 3.1 million passengers (+1.9%). Domestic traffic (+1.3%), mainly reflected the London Heathrow route operated by Flybe. International traffic volumes increased (+3.2%) due to new Ryanair routes to Alicante, Malaga and Faro, the new Wizz services to Warsaw and Air Baltic services to Riga. The increase was partially offset by less routes to international airports (Paris CDG and Amsterdam) and lower Scandinavian passenger numbers.

Southampton: 2.1 million passengers (+6.1%) with greater domestic traffic (+3.7%) and more Flybe flights to Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle, partly compensating for the fewer routes to Guernsey in 1Q; and international growth (+9.8%) due to greater capacity on routes to Amsterdam, Munich, Malaga and Cork.
AGS Revenue and EBITDA
In 2017, EBITDA improved by +10.7%, primarily due to a +6.3% increase in revenue, due to higher traffic, and good retail and parking revenue performance, coupled with the +3.0% increase in operating costs.

AGS net bank debt

At 31 December 2017, the airports' net bank debt stood at GBP656mn.

Profitability declined compared to 2016 (EBIT margin 3.5% vs. 7.5%), due to large projects in their preliminary stages and a lower proportion of toll road concession contracts in the portfolio of projects currently in progress. In 2017, relevant losses were incurred primarily, as the result of an unfavourable ruling on a project carried out in Colombia in 2012/2013 and losses from an already completed contract in the United Kingdom.

In 2017, 3.9% stake in Budimex was sold, which did not impact Ferrovial's P&L (as it retained its controlling 55.1% share), it did have an impact on cash flow, which was up by +EUR59mn.
The same positive trend as previous years continues to be displayed. Revenues in comparable terms increased by +11.8%, with growth in all business segments, with the faster completion of Industrial projects and Residential and Non-Residential construction being particularly notable. Profitability increased (+14.4% of EBITDA in LfL terms), primarily due to final payment on the infrastructure projects that have been completed.
The order book reached an all-time record high (EUR2,467mn) up by +15.3% in comparable terms as compared with December 2016. In 2017, new contracts reached more than EUR1,754mn, of which approximately 62% relate to the signing of Civil Works contracts awarded under the 2014-20 New Highway Plan. We would highlight the awarding of the Ricibórz Dam (EUR160mn), the Lagiewnicka Highway in Krakow (EUR154mn), the S3 Mikowo-Brzozów Beltway (EUR70mn) and rail works for approximately EUR310mn. Budimex also has contracts that are currently pending signing or have been signed since 31 December 2017 worth a total of more than EUR500mn.

Revenues were up +18.5%, thanks to the incorporation of Pepper Lawson for the full year, a company that specialises in water projects and nonresidential construction and which was acquired in March 2016, and whose revenues in 2017 increased by EUR82mn for a contribution of EUR179mn in 2017. The fall in the EBIT margin to 3.4% was due to the lower proportion of toll road concession contracts in the portfolio of projects currently in progress.

New contracts in 2017 exceeded EUR980mn, more than double the amount contracted in 2016. We highlight the 30% stake in the Houston beltway (EUR235mn, Ferrovial Agroman holds 40%), as well as a section of the US 281 toll road in San Antonio for EUR181mn. The higher number of contracts has meant an increase in the order book of +23.2% LfL.

Revenues increased (+8.3% in Like for Like terms), driven by the awarding of new projects, though profitability decreased in 2017 (EBITDA margin 1.3%), mainly as the result of relevant losses resulting from an unfavourable ruling on a project carried out in Colombia in 2012/2013 and those incurred in an already completed contract in the United Kingdom, due to tight completion deadlines and failure to reach an agreement with the client on the implementation of alternative technical solutions. In addition, profitability was affected by several projects in initial phases of execution, with lesser level of complexity.

The order book reached a record figure (EUR11,145mn), with comparable growth of +26.7% compared to December 2016. This growth is primarily due to the introduction to the order book, after the financial close, of the I-66 (EUR1,9bn), the Denver Airport (EUR541mn) and the Houston Grand Parkway beltway in the USA (EUR784mn) projects.

The civil works segment remains the largest segment (at 77%). The international order book amounted to EUR9,836mn, far more than the domestic order book (EUR1,309mn), and represented 88% of the total.

The order book figure at December 2017 does not include pre-awarded contracts or contracts for which commercial or financial agreement has not been finalised. These amount to over EUR1bn, notable among which are the aforementioned Budimex contracts, as well as the construction of a Toll road in Colombia (Bucaramanga-Barrancabermeja-Yondó) and another in Chile (Rutas del Loa).

IIn 2017, Services revenues reached EUR7,069mn, +16.3% vs. 2016.
In 2017, Broadspectrum was included for the whole year, compared to the consolidated 7 months in 2016 (from 31 May 2016).

From January 2017, and with the aim of optimising business opportunities in the different geographical territories, the Continental American businesses were separated from Broadspectrum's other activities and included under International Services.

In comparable terms, excluding the exchange rate impact and Broadspectrum, revenue rose by +1.9% compared to 2016. In Spain, revenue increased by +7.7%, in the UK -2.7% and International +13.6% (LfL). EBIT increased by +29.5% vs 2016.

EBITDA margin stood at 6.0%, above the 5.4% reported in December 2016, mainly as a consequence of the positive performance in the UK.

In December 2017, the order book reached EUR20,918mn, -14.4% down vs. December 2016 (-11.3% LfL). In general, the reduction in the order book has been in the UK (-17.0%).

Revenues in Spain grew by +7.7% compared with 2016, although there continues to be a background of fewer public tendering processes. Revenue growth stems from the extension of contracts and higher volumes of waste treatment, which have partly offset the delayed awarding of contracts by Local Authorities. In addition, the incorporation of several acquisitions in the industrial maintenance sector, which account for 5.3% of revenues. These activities usually offer lower returns than the average. EBIT grew in line with revenue growth.

The order book volume stood at EUR5,260mn in December 2017 (-8.4% compared with December 2016). The reduced size of the order book is directly related to the slowdown in competitive tendering processes, whose impact in revenues is offset with contract extensions. Particularly notable among the contracts awarded during 2017 were the renewal of on board customer services contract for Renfe (2 years EUR134mn), the contract to provide cleaning services at the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena Hospitals in Seville (2 years, EUR38mn), and the contract to manage the health transport service in La Rioja (4 years EUR27mn).

The business climate in the United Kingdom continues to be affected by the budgetary restrictions imposed on public sector clients, which has had an impact on the number of opportunities that come on to the market. In turn, from a commercial point of view, the company continues to apply a strict selection policy regarding the opportunities for which bids are to be submitted. As a result, revenues have fallen by -8.5% (-2.7% LfL by exchange rate).

EBITDA reached EUR86mn in 2017, reaching a margin of 3.5%. EBITDA Growth in LfL terms compared to the previous year was +49.6%. This improvement is due to measures implementes to adapt the Company to the complicated market situation in UK. The company continues to focus on improving contracts with low rates of return, or withdrawing from unprofitable contracts where relevant (ASC 6&8 in Highways or Affinity Water).

In 2017, the Birmingham contract contributed losses (-EUR10mn) which have been virtually fully offset by part of the provision set aside in 2015. On February 22nd 2018, the appeals court in UK has ruled in favour of the Birmingham City Council, cancelling the High Court's previous sentence in favor of Amey from September of 2016. Amey is considering the possibility of appealing the resolution before the Supreme Court. At the same time, and following the Court's mandate, in the following weeks, Amey and Birmingham City Council will negotiate the best way to make this sentence effective. Currently, Amey counts with a provision of GBP74.4mn, of which GBP37.9mn correspond to the balance from the provision registered for this litigation in 2015 and GBP36.5mn correspond to the adjustment from the application of IFRS 15.

In December, the order book stood at EUR9,878mn (-13.6% LfL compared with December 2016). The trend in this area was marked by the stricter project selection process mentioned above, and by consumption in the business portfolio for utilities that will be offered for tender in 2019 and 2020, coinciding with the regulatory periods imposed by clients. The most significant contracts awarded this year are the waste collection contract in Surrey (EUR131mn, ten years) and the contract to maintain the Manchester light railway (EUR181mn, seven years). The latter of these two amounts corresponds to Amey's 40% share in the joint venture that will perform the contract.

As previously mentioned, Broadspectrum's financial statements have been consolidated since 31 May 2016. Thus, the P&L to December 2016 includes a seven-month contribution from the company, compared to 12 months in 2017. As mentioned above, since 1 January 2017, the Company's business activity in Continental America has also been separated off into a separate management unit and now forms part of Ferrovial International Services (headquartered in Austin, Texas).

The EBITDA figure includes EUR6mn of restructuring costs in Australia, the bulk of which are related to personnel reduction.

The Broadspectrum account includes an expense of -EUR72mn relating to the amortization of the intangible fixed asset created by the acquisition (EUR60mn in 2016). Excluding this impact, EBIT would stand at EUR75mn with a 3.4% EBIT margin compared to 4.5% in 2016 (where the EUR6mn acquisition costs were included). In December 2017, the net intangible reached EUR94mn; its amortization will be progressively reduced over the coming 8 years.

The integration of Broadspectrum was carried out in line with the proposed plan. Its integration into Ferrovial, now provides Broadspectrum with greater investment capacity and complementary competences and credentials with other business activities within the Group, which should aid future growth. To take advantage of these opportunities, the Company has reorganised itself around four sectors in Australia and New Zealand, where activity was as follows.

· Government (EUR1,197mn): includes all the current contracts with regional and central governments.

· Urban Infrastructure (EUR441mn): includes activities in the water, electricity, energy and telecommunications sectors.

· Natural Resources (EUR352mn): focused on the maintenance and operation of wells and oil, gas, mining and agricultural installations, as well as on solutions for industrial clients.

· Transport (EUR221mn): includes activities related to the highway, railway and public transport networks.

In line with previous statements made by Ferrovial, since the end of October 2017, the Company has not serviced the contracts with the Australian Department of Immigration and these contracts and all relations therewith have now ended.

The order book amounts to EUR4,246mn compared to EUR4,624mn in 2016. Notable are the maintenance contract awards for the Melbourne highway network (EUR340mn, 23 years) and the extension of the National Defence facilities management contract (EUR304mn, one year).

Since January 2017, International business has included Broadspectrum's business activity in Continental America (primarily USA, Canada and Chile). This activity has contributed a total of EUR306mn in revenues and an EBITDA of EUR8mn.

Transformers, a waste treatment company based in Poland, was incorporated in the second half of 2017 for EUR36mn, which has now been fully integrated. Revenues increased by EUR16mn, as a result of this incorporation.

In 2017, excluding the changes for perimeter variations, revenue grew by +13.6%, whilst EBITDA fell EUR2mn, primarily weighed down by Chile, associated with the extra costs created by factory stoppages and other operating issues.

As regards the order book, this stood at EUR1,533mn vs. EUR675mn in 2016. Notable are the incorporation of Transformers (EUR67mn), the awarding of the Washington DC tunnel maintenance contract (EUR22mn, five years) and the full maintenance of the S7 toll road in Kielce (EUR18mn, five years).

This figure stood at +EUR324mn in 2016, as it was affected by the capital gains relating to the disposals in Chicago Skyway and the Irish toll roads.

Financial expenses in 2017 were lower in EUR80mn vs. 2016, as a combination of the following impacts:

· Financing result: EUR70mn drop in expenses to -EUR284mn. The change compared with 2016 was primarily due to changes in the consolidation perimeter in the infrastructure projects:
Deconsolidated assets in 2016: · Deconsolidation of Chicago Skyway (two months' contribution in
2016, generating EUR21mn in costs).
· Deconsolidation of the SH-130 toll road (deconsolidated at the close of 2016, contributed EUR13mn in costs that year).
· Deconsolidation of debt in Irish toll roads (two months' global consolidation in 2016, generating EUR3mn in costs).
Deconsolidated assets in 2017:
· Deconsolidation of debt in Norte Litoral (four months' global consolidation in 2017 vs. 12 months contribution in 2016, generating EUR7mn lower financial expenses).
· Deconsolidation of debt in Algarve (nine months' global consolidation in 2017 vs. 12 months contribution in 2016, generating EUR4mn lower financial expenses).
· Result from derivatives and others: EUR10mn drop in financial expenses to -EUR27mn in 2017 vs. -EUR37mn in financial expenses in 2016, comprised of:

· As regards infrastructure projects, EUR14mn less in financial expenses due mainly to the extraordinary negative impact caused in 2016 by the cancellation of the Ausol derivative, the result of the refinancing carried out in respect of this asset.
· In the ex-infrastructure projects related category, -EUR4mn in costs, mainly resulting from financial restructuring processes, notable among which are the cancellation of the Broadspectrum high yield bonds (with an annual cost of 8.375%). Following the restructuring, the average cost of Broadspectrum stood below 6%.

EQUITY-ACCOUNTED RESULTS

At the net profit level, the equity-accounted consolidated assets contributed EUR251mn after tax (EUR82mn in 2016).

This improvement was due to the recovery of Heathrow's contribution (+EUR87mn as compared with -EUR57mn in 2016, due to the negative impact of the fair value of the derivatives) and the positive performance of Toll Roads (net profit at 407 ETR rose by +26.1%). AGS's contribution decreased compared to 2016 (EUR2mn vs. EUR12mn in 2016), primarily due to the positive non-recurrent non-cash item in 2016, due to the changes in the pension plan conditions (EUR7mn) and the two percentage point drop in tax rate to 17% (EUR6mn).
TAXES
Corporate Income Tax amounted to ­EUR71mn in 2017 compared with -EUR233mn in 2016, the latter having been impacted principally by the extraordinary impact of the Chicago Skyway and the Irish toll roads divestments, figure which:
· Does not include the tax expenses corresponding to the companies accounted for using the equity method which, pursuant to accounting legislation, are presented net of its related tax effect.
· Includes a corporate tax income corresponding to previous years of EUR16mn (vs a EUR5mn expense in 2016), mainly as a consequence of the lower corporate tax rate in USA from 35% to 21%.
Excluding the result of these entities integrated through equity consolidation (net income of EUR251mn), and considering the income tax expense accrued in 2017 (-EUR87mn), the effective tax rate would reach 26.7%.
MINORITIES
The minorities figure in 2017 amounted to -EUR53mn vs. -EUR7mn in 2016. The main impacts causing this difference are:
· Greater profit at Budimex (-EUR11mn vs. 2016)
· Fewer losses at toll roads (-EUR33mn vs. 2016), as a result of the deconsolidations of SH-130 and Chicago Skyway and the improved results from Managed Lanes.
NET PROFIT
Net profit stood at EUR454mn at year-end 2017 (EUR376mn in 2016). This result includes a series of extraordinary impacts, notable among which were:
· Fair value adjustments for derivatives: +EUR69mn (this item resulted in a negative impact of ­EUR150mn in 2016), primarily impacted by derivatives from HAH, as previously mentioned.
· Capital gain after tax on the sale of Norte Litoral and Algarve: +EUR98mn (+EUR124mn were earned in 2016 from the sale of the Chicago Skyway and Irish toll roads).
· Impairment at Autema: -EUR29mn (-EUR21mn in 2016).

NET DEBT AND CORPORATE CREDIT RATING

54  MANAGEMENT REPORT 2017. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES A

NET DEBT
TThe net cash position, excluding infrastructure projects, stood at
EUR1,341mn at 31 December 2017 vs. EUR697mn in December 2016.
The main drivers of this change in the net cash position ex-infrastructure projects included the following:
· Cash flow obtained from the issuance of hybrid subordinated bond (EUR500mn), treated as an equity instrument.
· Dividends received from projects (+EUR553mn): this figure increased by +16.0% compared to the dividends received in 2016 (EUR477mn). Notable this year was the contribution of EUR237mn made by Airports (as compared with EUR134mn in 2016), affected by the greater dividend paid out by HAH, supported by higher inflation and the good operating performance and the extraordinary dividend payout by AGS following its refinancing (AGS's total contribution amounted to EUR84mn, of which EUR43mn was an extraordinary amount).
· Cash flow from divestments amounting to +EUR253mn, of which EUR59mn come from sale of a stake in Budimex (sale of 1 million shares equivalent to a holding of 3.9%) and EUR104mn obtained after the sale of 51% of Norte Litoral and EUR58mn for the sale of 49% of Algarve.
· Working capital performance was negative in the period standing at ­EUR38mn compared to the previous year.
· Total investments of -EUR355mn, which includes the investment to acquire the minority stakes in NTE and LBJ for -EUR94mn.
· Ferrovial shareholder remuneration in the amount of -EUR520mn. In addition, -EUR48mn was distributed to minorities in subsidiaries.
Net project debt stood at EUR4,804mn (EUR4,963mn in December 2016). This net debt includes EUR826mn that relates to toll roads under construction (NTE 35W and I-77).

The Group's consolidated net debt at 31 December 2017 stood at EUR3,463mn (compared with EUR4,266mn in December 2016).

Cash flow from ex-infrastructure operations

At end-December 2017, cash flow from ex-infrastructure project operations reached EUR999mn (pre-tax), improving on 2016 of EUR995mn, impacted by the significant increase in dividends received from the main infrastructure projects: 407 ETR (EUR262mn, +7.6% vs. 2016), HAH (EUR153mn, +59.6%) and AGS (EUR84mn vs EUR38mn 2016, after the refinancing carried out in 1Q 2017).

Breakdown of cash flow from Toll Roads and Airports:

The dividends from Toll Roads operations amounted to EUR277mn in 2017, resulting from dividends and repaid shareholder equity from companies owning toll road infrastructure projects. The 2017 figure (EUR277mn) was less than the amount received in 2016 (EUR290mn) due to the sale of stakes in the Portuguese toll roads (EUR9mn in 2017 vs. EUR37mn in 2016), although this was partially offset by the higher dividend from 407 ETR (EUR262mn vs. EUR244mn in 2016).

· Net interest payments for the year (-EUR32mn).

· FX impact (-EUR43mn), which originates from the operating cash for the businesses outside the Eurozone and the positions held in currencies, mainly in American and Canadian dollars (-EUR147mn), offset by exchange rate derivatives (+EUR103mn).

· Other non-cash flow related movements (+EUR506mn), which includes book debt movements that do not affect cash flow, such as interest that has been accrued and remains unpaid, mainly resulting from interest accrued from corporate bonds. This entry also includes the cash flow obtained from the hybrid subordinated bond issue (+EUR500mn), treated as an equity instrument.

Infrastructure projects financing cash flow
Projects financing cash flow includes the payment of dividends and the repayment of equity by concessionary companies to their shareholders, along with the payments for share capital increases received by these companies. In the case of concession holders which are fully integrated within Ferrovial, these amounts represent 100% of the amounts paid out and received by the concession-holding companies, regardless of the percentage share that the Company holds in such concessions. No dividend or equity repayment is included for companies accounted for by the equity method.
The interest cash flow refers to the interest paid by the concessionholding companies, together with other fees and costs closely related to the acquisition of financing. The cash flow for these items relates to interest costs for the period, along with any other item that represents a direct change in the net debt amount for the period.

The financing cash flow also includes the impact that changes in the interest rate have had on the debt held in foreign currency, which in 2017 was a positive impact in the amount of EUR398mn, mainly as the result of the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, a circumstance that had a significant effect on the net debt figure for the American toll roads.

SHAREHOLDER REMUNERATION

TThe company held its AGM on 5 April 2017. The AGM approved two capital
increases, by means of the issuance of new ordinary shares, with no issue premium, of the same class and series as those at present in circulation, charged to reserves.

These increases form part of the shareholder remuneration system known as the "Ferrovial Scrip Dividend", which the company introduced in 2014, to replace the traditional complementary dividend payment for 2016 and the 2017 interim dividend.

The purpose of this programme is to offer Ferrovial's shareholders the option, at their choice, of receiving free new shares in Ferrovial, though without altering cash payments to its shareholders, as they can alternatively opt to receive a cash payment by means of selling the free rights that they receive against the shares they already own to Ferrovial (or selling them in the market).

The share capital comprises 732,265,472 ordinary shares of one single class, each with a par value of twenty euro cents, (the share capital as of 31 December 2017 was EUR146,453,094.40).
SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE
Significant holdings in the share capital of Ferrovial S.A., as detailed by the Spanish Stock Market Commission (CNMV):
· Rijn Capital BV, (a company controlled by Rafael del Pino y CalvoSotelo): 20.2%
· Menosmares, S.L.U., (a company controlled by María del Pino y CalvoSotelo): 8.1%
· Siemprelara S.L.U., (a company controlled by Leopoldo del Pino y Calvo-Sotelo): 5.0% .
· Blackrock, held 3.021% at the end of 2017.
.

SHARE BUY-BACK AND CANCELLATION
The buy-back programme ended, on 31 October 2017, after the company acquired 14,593,242 of its own shares (which therefore did not exceed the limit of EUR275mn or 19 million shares). The share capital was subsequently reduced by EUR3,400,038.40 by means of the cancellation of 17,000,192 company shares held in the company's own portfolio, including 2,406,950 shares held prior to the Board of Directors' proposal, approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, to reduce the company's capital.

· On February 22nd 2018, the appeals court in UK has ruled in favour of the Birmingham City Council, cancelling the High Court's previous sentence in favor of Amey from September of 2016. Amey is considering the possibility of appealing the resolution before the Supreme Court. The impact of this ruling has been considered when preparing these financial accounts as it corresponds to a litigation which was pending resolution at the date of the close of the financial year. In note 6.5.1 of the Consolidated Annual Accounts, relative to litigations, there is a more detailed explanation of the litigation and the provisions registered at the close of 2017 to cover the risks relative to it.
· On February 27th 2018, the Spanish National High Court notified Cespa of a ruling by which it fully accepts the appeal that the latter had brought against a ruling from the National Competition Commission in which a EUR14mn sanction was imposed. The ruling is not firm and the State Attorney can prepare a cassation appeal in the following 30 days. Ferrovial had decided not to register any provision relating to this litigation, so the result of the ruling has no impact on the financial accounts (see note 6.5.1 of Consolidated Annual Accounts).

In compliance with the obligation to disclose the average period of payment to suppliers provided for in Article 539 and Additional Provision Eight of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law (in accordance with the new wording of Final Provision Two of Law 31/2014 reforming the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law), the Company hereby states that the average period of payment to the suppliers of all the Group companies domiciled in Spain in 2016 was 49 days.

The following table shows, as required under Act 6 of the Ruling of 29 January 2016 by the Institute for Accounting and Accounts Auditing, the information relating to the average periods for making payments to suppliers in 2017 and 2016:

The mutual intra-group commercial transactions between companies belonging to Ferrovial are not included in the consolidation process, meaning the consolidated balance sheet contains no outstanding balances to Ferrovial companies. Thus, the information detailed in the previous table refers solely to suppliers outside of the Company, noting for information purposes that the average payment period between Ferrovial companies is generally 30 days.

At the forefront of Ferrovial is the idea of promoting projects that change cities and countries. Museums and airports have been built, toll roads have been developed, tunnels and railroads have been designed and cities have been managed. Guggenheim, Heathrow, 407 ETR, M30 and the Alta Velocidad are already in the history books. But the world keeps turning. And Ferrovial has transformative projects in its portfolio such as the modernization of Denver Airport, Managed Lanes I-66 in Virginia, the ITER in Cadarache and the management of the roads of West Melbourne. Projects named to mean a today and a tomorrow in their communities.

EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT AND EXPERIENCE

 The company's Flexible Remuneration Plan allows employees to amend their remuneration packages on a voluntary basis and according to their personal needs, replacing part of their remuneration for specific products in order to optimize available cash flows.
 The Share-Based Remuneration Plans, through which 1,954 employees opted for payment of part of the remuneration in company shares.
 The Long-Term Variable Remuneration System, based on signing over shares to 330 executives and managers in the company.

AAttracting and hiring the best talent to become a reference employer in the markets in which
the company is present is one of the strategic priorities in terms of people management that allows Ferrovial to be prepared for the future.
In 2017, an Employee Experience Survey was sent to 8,652 employees from Spain, the United Kingdom, Poland, the United States and Canada, to find out their preferences and analyze which elements are most important for employees. Traditional elements such as remuneration (salary and benefits) and other elements related to work experience were evaluated (corporate culture, flexibility, working conditions and training). The three most valued aspects were the brand and reputation (86%); soundness and solvency (74%); and Corporate Responsibility, together with safety at work (69%).
In relation to the remuneration policies, an essential part of employee commitment, established according to criteria based on competitiveness in the reference markets, the following programs are included:

TALENT
The talent management at Ferrovial aims to help each employee to reach their maximum potential while promoting the best professional opportunities.
Training development is undergoing a huge change due to, among other factors, the digital transformation in all areas of the business. The joint action between talent, innovation and technology are an opportunity to search for competitive advantages and positioning as a company recognized for its innovation and constant improvement. For this reason, different initiatives have been launched with the aim of providing tools for professionals to be able to work in a streamlined and efficient manner in a digital world:

 The Variable Remuneration System, which covers 18% of the staff, 17,184 employees, based on targets.

 Play the Future Project: includes six training itineraries linked to new technologies (Big Data, IoT and drones)

available to all employees with the aim of increasing their current capabilities, as well as their future employability.  Awareness Sessions Cycle: these are conferences focused on emerging technologies and innovation methodologies to learn about the existing business models and the opportunities they can offer to Ferrovial's different business units.  Executive Forums: similar to the Awareness Sessions, they are completed with teamwork to describe the critical capabilities that must be reinforced or created to position the company as a key player in that activity.
In this sense, the Corporate University, which in 2017 has celebrated its tenth anniversary, has evolved adopting a more international approach with the organization of itinerant programs in the United Kingdom, North America and Latin America, although its mission remains unchanged as a place to learn and reflect, share and create, gathering the knowledge, values and common culture of Ferrovial.
The professional development model is based on the following programs:
 Evaluation and Development Process, through which 29,973 people have passed, 100% target group. In 2017, under the slogan "Conversations for development" we worked on making conversations more flexible, focused on the future, with better user experience and with new tools such as a chatbot (Qo). This is a robot trained to advise on the best way to develop skills following the 70/20/10 model that has been recommended to 713 users by more than 1,000 learning resources. In 2017, 84% of the employees indicated that they had a quality conversation with their manager and their general level of satisfaction was 3.54 out of 5.

 Reviewing critical talent programs, improving the process to ensure that vacancies are covered by the best candidate available within the organization and promoting the targeted mobility of key professionals.This process also identifies professionals who may have a faster development, in order to make it compatible with the business growth needs. The revision of the Succession Plans has identified 363 possible candidates (short, medium and long-term) for the 144 most critical positions identified in Ferrovial.
INCLUSIVE CULTURE
Ferrovial, with more than 110 nationalities in its workforce, shows a firm commitment to effective equality of opportunities. This is reflected in its Strategic Diversity Plan, which focuses on three areas: gender, generational and multicultural.
In terms of gender equality, mechanisms have been established to bring out female talent inside and outside the organization. The specific training programs for women managers promoted in the United Kingdom and Australia are noteworthy. In Spain, since 2014, the adoption of measures to increase the presence of women in management positions and steering committees has been actively promoted through the Voluntary Collaboration Agreement with the Ministry of Health, Social Affairs and Equality . Also in Spain, the Business Equality Badge was renewed in 2017.
It should be noted that 15 Ferrovial engineers were finalists in the 2017 European Women in Construction and Engineering Awards, with two of them winning.

STEM Program
The initiative aims to promote STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) and to guide young people toward their professional future in the different countries in which Ferrovial operates. This commitment is in line with the policies and internal processes regarding equal opportunities within the diversity and inclusion strategy and with the Strategic CR Plan. It seeks to improve the employability of new generations together with the reduction of the digital gender gap. The following initiatives are noteworthy:
 In Spain, the "Orienta-T" Program was launched in collaboration with the Junior Achievement Foundation, which aims to awaken STEM vocations among students between 14 and 16 years old. In 2017, it affected more than 1,000 students.
 In the United Kingdom, 135 women from different projects have signed up as ambassadors of the program to inspire young people to opt for a STEM career.
 The Discovery Place Education Studio project was funded in the USA, which promotes the continuous professional development of high school teachers.
 In Australia, the scholarship program for university students from the Monash University and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) engineering schools was supported.

COMMITMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT
FFerrovial's Health and Safety strategy, together with the firm commitment from the manage-
ment and all employees, have improved the company's accident rates.
Health and Safety is a Senior Management priority, and it is fully committed.
In 2015, the Board of Directors of Ferrovial approved a new Health and Safety Policy for the whole company, establishing the objective of developing risk-free working environments, based on the conviction that any accident is avoidable.
The maximum executive level of Ferrovial supervises the functions and responsibilities in Health and Safety. Thus the CEO reports the information related to this matter periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, in all the areas the person responsible for Health and Safety is part of the Business Committee.
The annual Managers' meeting, which brings together the 300 company managers, begins with a Health and Safety presentation to report and raise awareness of this issue.

HEALTH AND SAFETY STRATEGY
In October 2017, Ferrovial held the second edition of the H&S Global Meeting at the headquarters of its Corporate University, which brought together employees from the different business areas around the world with responsibilities in Health and Safety management. The meeting served to discuss the Health and Safety strategy for the next two years, pooling the projects being developed, highlighting examples of good practice and analyzing the measurement of results.

Ferrovial's Health and Safety strategy, which is currently being updated, is based on the principles of action included in its policy:

(1) Year-on-year change in the index giving the number of accidents occurring during working hours that lead to days lost, for every million hours worked. Subcontractors not included. (2) Year-on-year change in the index giving the number of days lost as a result of occupational accidents for every thousand hours worked.

BRS: RISK CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS (RCE)

Risk evaluation and planning. A reliable risk and hazard evaluation process has been implemented in all work centers to establish the organization, planning and control systems needed to facilitate a safe work environment. To confirm that these control systems are implemented and effective, different initiatives are carried out in Ferrovial's subsidiaries, including RCE in Broadspectrum.
Compliance with legislation and other standards in force in each of the countries where the company operates, paying attention to best practices when they are reasonably viable.
Effective and consistent communication, facilitating communication channels to encourage all employees to contribute to a positive performance in matters of Occupational Health and Safety, promoting a safety culture throughout the company.

Broadspectrum has conducted a review to ensure the operation and effectiveness of safety controls in their processes. This analysis concluded that a large number of controls and verifications were being conducted, focused on low-risk activities and not high-risk activities.
The Risk Control Effectiveness (RCE) Program served to redirect the focus toward risks with greater potential risk, thus ensuring effective prevention and a focus on hazards that can cause potentially serious damages, enabling the implementation of better controls in activities with more risk.
Thanks to the RCE initiative, Broadspectrum eliminated 18 low-level controls and replaced them with new or updated controls. 59% fewer "first aid" controls were carried out and the critical controls on the highest risks increased by 45%.
This has led to a reduction in accident rates and breaches of the mandatory safety rules defined in Broadspectrum.

To promote a positive culture, different internal campaigns have been designed, including The Safety Week H&S Internal Campaign, carried out in Amey's environmental services business, awarded with the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, and finalist in the Chartered Institute of Waste Management awards within its industry.
Training and involving workers. Ferrovial has spent years increasing its training efforts to involve workers increasingly in the common goal of creating risk-free workplaces. Since 2015, more than 2.4 million hours of training have been given, encouraging the participation of all workers in the detection of unsafe acts and situations.
All sessions and campaigns aim to create a strong Health and Safety culture, driven by employees, the working environment and

the behaviors they demonstrate in the workplace.
Measuring and monitoring performance. To promote a consistent and positive work safety culture, a reporting system is needed that gives promotes the identification of unsafe situations or actions before they occur and implement the necessary preventive measures to avoid any type of accident. In 2017, 79,058 Health and Safety visits and audits were conducted at the different Ferrovial centers.
All these measures, together with the preventive actions that have been implemented, have led to a notable improvement in the frequency index, which has reduced by 42% since 2014.
Ferrovial monitors health and safety performance, seeking continuous improvement. To do so, specific Health and Safety targets have been set.
Innovation. New standards of performance, technology and safety measures can be developed through innovation, contributing to the achievement of the Target Zero goal.
The action plan for innovation includes:
 Wearables in road maintenance. Use of sensor equipment to detect signs of drowsiness, stress and fatigue, as well as monitoring, which includes a warning button to know the exact location of the worker in case he/she needs assistance.
 R2. Kit containing beacons and wristbands that implements security protocols to manage control and access to worksites, delimit risks and help in emergency situations by means of a panic button.
 Big Data. Use of the DriveSmart mobile application to promote road safety for drivers, both on the Autema toll road and in its areas of influence. The application analyzes the driver's behavior at the wheel to detect their bad habits, promoting better driving and rewarding their good driving.

AMEY: SAFETY WEEK
Campaign carried out by Amey in 2017 to reinforce safety messages and involve workers regarding the risks they are exposed to on a daily basis. Includes training on how to avoid or minimize risks. This initiative is part of a more extensive Health and Safety program aimed at Target Zero. It takes on the following challenges:  Increase awareness and knowledge of the main risks.  Reduce the number of incidents.  Encourage close call reporting, enabling problems to be addressed before they become
potential incidents.  Commitment and involving workers. The campaign included the creation and publication of videos and posters, talks with superiors and the launch of a new advice book.
PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING
In recent years, Ferrovial has launched numerous initiatives aimed at improving the occupational health of its employees. The aim is to improve the working environment, reduce absenteeism, and increase productivity, among others. Numerous initiatives have been implemented to promote healthy habits, including:
 The HASAVI program, an innovative health and wellness project with the aim of promoting healthy habits and lifestyles among employees, based on three fundamental pillars (nutrition, physical activity and health - people), using the work environment as a lever.
 The Ferrovial Olympics,has an average of 1,200 participants per year.  The Well-being Week,at the Construction headquarters.  The Ferrovital initiative,at Corporation,which includes workshops,health talks and the phys-
iotherapy service, among others.  The mindfulness workshops taught at the Corporate University.
All these initiatives aim to help employees to achieve a better quality of life, which contributes not only to feeling better but to the development of their personal and social skills. They are also in line with the guidelines from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, which promotes healthy work at every age and diversity policies toward anti-aging in working life.

INNOVATION
FERROVIAL FOCUSES ITS INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY ON STRATEGIC AND TRANSFORMATIONAL PROJECTS THAT GENERATE NEW SOLUTIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND ACCELERATE THE DESIGN AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW BUSINESS MODELS THAT BRING GREATER VALUE TO THE COMPANY.

NNew technologies (robotics, artificial intelligence, IoT and
Big Data) are having a significant and fast impact on all sectors. The transformative capacity they generate derives in an environment with threats but also great opportunities. To respond to the challenges, Ferrovial is accelerating its process of implementing innovative solutions, within its open innovation strategy.
OPEN INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM
Collaboration with startups
An essential part of this strategy focuses on collaboration with startups, which complement the company's capabilities, providing flexibility, agility and capacity for disruption, facilitating the joint market launch of new products, processes and business models. 30 projects were executed in collaboration with startups in 2017.
Under this scope, BuildUp! has been presented (www. ferrovialbuildup.com) a program to seek the collaboration of startups to resolve different business challenges. Given the importance of the safety of its workers, the first challenge was how to guarantee the safety of operators working in road maintenance. The selected startup will carry out a four-month pilot project in one of Ferrovial's infrastructures or contracts, and will have the possibility of becoming a supplier of the company and internationalizing its product or service.
Ferrovial is also participating as a partner in three European acceleration projects for startups approved by the European program H2020, Impact Growth in the Internet of the future area, Impact Connected Car in the connected vehicles area and Systems for Robotics in the robotics area.
Collaboration with research centers and universities
Within the current Ferrovial open innovation model, relationships with universities and research centers continue to be fostered and maintained with the aim of establishing medium and long-term collaboration agreements. At present, there are 13 medium to long-term collaboration agreements.
Due to its relevance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has a prominent role. The agreement was renewed in 2016 until 2020 to develop research proj-

ects in different innovation areas of Ferrovial: construction, cities, infrastructures, water treatment, waste management and energy efficiency. It also participates as an associate member of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), an initiative to develop projects aimed at transforming the cities and infrastructure of the future.

Ferrovial is an active member and promoter of the team constituted by the Government of the Community of Madrid, representatives of large companies, universities, venture capital funds and startup accelerator.
In 2017, Ferrovial became a partner of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), through two knowledge and innovation communities, the Digital Community (Digital-KIC) and the Community on Climate Change (Climate-KIC). The EIT integrates the three areas of the triangle of knowledge, education, entrepreneurship and innovation, to promote the transformation of ideas and knowledge into new business opportunities. Digital-KIC aims to accelerate the absorption of digital technologies in the market, in a way that attracts business talent and leadership in Europe. Meanwhile, Climate-KIC seeks to help build a carbon-free economy to address climate change, working around four thematic areas: promoting sustainability in urban areas, production, land management and financial parameters and decision making.
To continue expanding the partner ecosystem in 2017, Ferrovial has continued carrying out exploration tasks in different Asian countries.
INNOVATION CULTURE
The innovation strategy not only seeks to collaborate with others, but also to develop the entrepreneurial spirit existing in the company. To this end, the second edition of the ShuttleX intrapreneurship program seeks to respond to internal challenges of the Services business. Through the creation of multidisciplinary teams, and with the support of experts in the lean startup methodology and different mentors, the entire innovation process has been worked on, from the generation of ideas to the obtaining of validated prototypes for their subsequent activation.
The company has also organized the second edition of the Innovation Community Summit, an internal conference that brings together the innovation leaders from all Ferrovial's business units to strengthening innovation and create contact networks to share knowledge and ideas that respond to existing challenges.
To reflect on the state of the latest technologies, generate debate and analyze the possibilities of application in Ferrovial, different awareness sessions have been organized, aimed at senior executive representatives, covering blockchain, machine learning, autonomous vehicles and cognitive computing.

QUALITY
PROVIDING CUSTOMERS AND USERS WITH SERVICES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF QUALITY IS ONE OF FERROVIAL'S PRIORITIES. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED SPECIFIC MECHANISMS TO DETERMINE ITS LEVEL OF SATISFACTION AND HAS ASSOCIATED PLANS AIMED AT INCREASING THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDED.

CLIENT AND USER SATISFACTION
AAll of Ferrovial's business areas carry out periodic surveys of
the expectations and satisfaction of customers and users, understanding how all the people who interact directly or indirectly with the services and infrastructures that Ferrovial offers, but who are not bound by a contractual agreement.
In 2017, Ferrovial initiated a project in collaboration with the Digital Hub to focus on users, with the aim of inferring their perception regarding the services and infrastructures provided by the company on a global scale, identifying the strengths and weaknesses in the performance of the company in order to establish improvement actions.
The project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2018, will provide a new tool to systematically capture all external information that is relevant to measure the perception of users, incorporate this information to the existing information in different business areas, and establish a simple reporting model for decision making.
All Ferrovial businesses have internal procedures for detecting, identifying, recording and monitoring complaints submitted by customers and users of products or services provided by the company. Complaints on record are processed and analyzed to offer the most suitable response and establish actions for improvement.
The Quality, Prevention & Environment Division handles complaints submitted by customers requesting a solution from Ferrovial, since they had not been satisfactorily addressed by the business areas. In 2017, Ferrovial companies as a whole received 2,047 complaints from customers and users, of which 99.31% were closed within the year.
INFRASTRUCTURE USERS
On Toll Roads, Cintra offers its users innovative solutions that improve traffic flow and mobility in highly congested roads, reducing travel times and emissions of greenhouse gases.
The company is committed to public-private partnerships as a model for improving the transport infrastructure of a country. In an era of limited public resources, P3s provides innovation, efficiency and the capital needed to meet the growing demand for transportation infrastructure in the US.
The surveys reflect citizens' acceptance of the Managed Lanes model adopted by Ferrovial. Thus, the traveler gets a 75% improvement in travel times and a 26% reduction in fuel consumption.

* Airport Service Quality survey (ASQ): An independent survey, carried out the last quarter of 2016, by Airports Council International that rates the level of overall satisfaction of passengers with an airport on a scale of 0 to 5.

The quality of the service is measured through user surveys. The surveys conducted in 2017 revealed the favorable opinions of users regarding the toll roads in Texas (NTE and LBJ). 85% of respondents said they had a favorable opinion about the Managed Lane NTE and 90% about the LBJ.
Additionally, with a view to analyzing user behaviors on the NTE and LBJ toll roads (origin-destination, declared preferences, etc.), telephone surveys were designed for traffic teams, and over 1,200 are conducted yearly. The focus groups created for these toll roads are also salient in that they invite a group of users to share their experiences and expectation with company personnel.
Solutions and replies are also given to any correspondence received by e-mail, telephone or letter.
Ferrovial Airports is committed to quality service and the continuous improvement of operations, leading to higher levels of passenger satisfaction.
New technologies allow airports to be more efficient, safer and more comfortable for passengers.
In recent years, a lot has been invested in the automation of processes available to passengers, such as boarding pass, baggage check, access control, security, passport control and other processes beyond their reach, such as the baggage system, guidance systems from the time the plane touches the ground until the plane arrives at the stand.
An example of the improvement in the quality of passenger service is the development of the Heathrow app. This application gives information about flights, but also allows users to make purchases, rent a car, reserve a parking space, order a taxi or buy a ticket from the Heathrow Express.
The advances made by the company change the way of behaving and increase the expectations of the passengers.
Along this line, in 2017, Ferrovial Airports signed a collaboration agreement with Airports Center of Excellence for the development and deployment of best practices in operational and service performance, improving the experience of passengers based on the Six Sigma methodology.
The latest edition of the Air Transport Awards recognized Ferrovial Airports as Best Airport Portfolio Manager in Europe.

The purpose of the policy is to (i) to provide all Ferrovial administrators, directors and employees with a general framework of action to which they must abide when doing their job based on the highest standards of integrity, transparency, respect for legality and human rights; (ii) to establish a common and homogeneous procedure for monitoring, controlling and managing the risks of legislative or regulatory compliance, especially those aimed at the prevention of criminal behavior; and (iii) to foster a culture of business ethics in the organization and in the decision-making and training processes of the will of administrators, managers and employees.
The Compliance Model is structured around the following phases:
 Identification of compliance risks based on the company's activities.
 Assessment of risks based on their impact and the probability of their occurrence.
 Identification of the surveillance and control measures implemented to avoid or mitigate the occurrence of risks.
 Training for company employees and executives in the principles and commitments included in the Code of Ethics, in the Compliance Policy and the other policies that support the model.
 Periodic evaluation of control measures to detect possible shortfalls or areas of improvement that require specific action plans.

 Supervision of the model by an independent body.
The Compliance Model includes a Crime Prevention Model designed to prevent or significantly reduce the risk of committing criminal acts, especially those that entail the criminal liability of the legal entity.
Anti-Corruption Policy
Ferrovial has an Anti-Corruption Policy that governs the behavior of all administrators, managers and employees, and their collaborators in the development of the business, bearing in mind that a "zero tolerance" policy has been implemented with any practice that could be qualified as active or passive corruption or bribery.
The policy imposes compliance with Anticorruption Acts throughout the world, including the Spanish Criminal Code and that of the other jurisdictions in which Ferrovial works, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Law and the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
On January 15, the Provincial Court of Barcelona issued a ruling on the Palau Case, not condemning the two directors related to Ferrovial Agroman. From the full respect of the judgment, Ferrovial Agroman reiterates its conviction that the adjudications of works in which it participated were always carried out correctly and to the offer with the best financial valuation. The company was oblivious to the final destination of the funds given to the Palau de la Música through sponsorship contracts.
ETHICAL INTEGRITY OF PARTNERS

Control and Risk Management policy
The aim is to provide all employees of Ferrovial, S.A. and its group of companies with an action framework for the control and management of the risks to which it is exposed in the fulfillment of its business targets. To this end, the Board of Directors establishes the acceptable risk and the admissible tolerance level for risk areas, included those related to ethics.

Ferrovial has an Ethics Channel as a complement to other internal channels. Its purpose is to facilitate the reporting of any possible irregularity, non-compliance or behavior contrary to the ethics, legality and policies that govern Ferrovial. The channel is accessible to employees through the intranet and for any interested counterpart through the website, and allows communications to be made confidentially. In 2017, 78 complaints were filed, 35 of which were anonymous and 43 made by name.
All complaints give rise to an investigation by the Management Committee, guaranteeing confidentiality and anonymity (if applicable), the rights of those involved and the absence of reprisals of any kind.
The Management Committee regularly informs the Audit and Control Committee of the communications received and the steps taken.

This procedure, approved at the end of 2017, establishes the obligation to perform a due diligence process of ethical integrity out when choosing partners, before reaching a business relationship of any kind (group, consortium, joint venture or business partnership of any kind), with Ferrovial, S.A. or any of the companies in its Group of companies.
It involves extending Ferrovial's values, included in its Code of Business Ethics, to all its business, to be developed in accordance with the current applicable national and international laws, and in particular, anti-corruption laws that prohibit active or passive bribery.
A series of warning signs and good ethical practices to be taken into account when selecting potential Ferrovial partners, as well as limitations on the association. It also contains the process for the authorization, formalization and ethical monitoring of the association.

Passengers and drivers are the protagonists of transport infrastructure, as are citizens in the municipalities. Their ability to express their opinion and to rate the service they receive and the satisfaction they express is Ferrovial's main concern. They are also increasingly more represented by their ability to make criticisms and propose improvements. More than 80% of Heathrow passengers value their experience as very good or excellent, while around 70% of Managed Lanes Texan drivers have had a "good experience".

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

HUMAN RIGHTS
THE PRINCIPLES EMANATED FROM THE GLOBAL COMPACT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SUPPORT FERROVIAL'S HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIONS, BEING RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND THROUGHOUT ITS SUPPLY CHAIN.

CORPORATE POLICY IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
TThe Ferrovial Human Rights Policy, approved in 2014, is
aligned with the Code of Business Ethics, the principles of the Global Compact, the Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Declaration on Multinational Enterprises of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The company's commitment extends to all its employees, clients, suppliers and contractors with whom it works through a procedure that is focused on respecting, supporting, promoting and guaranteeing Human Rights and rejecting any type of discrimination.

With the aim of identifying, preventing, mitigating and

responding to the risks associated with Human Rights, Ferro-

vial carries out a due diligence process in its main activities.

It is supported by the risk identification and assessment process called Ferrovial Risk Management.

FERROVIAL ASSESSES THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

The social and environmental impact on communities affected by infrastructure projects in sensitive contexts is analyzed. First, an initial diagnostic analysis is carried

IMPACT OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

out on social issues, and then contingency

plans are designed proposing measures to

mitigate and/or offset the impact.

In 2017, the company's Ethical Channel incorporated Human Rights as a specific item, to better identify this matter, facilitating the communication of incidents and irregularities in relation to their provisions. By means of monitoring, Ferrovial aims to ensure compliance and respect for Human Rights across the whole value chain in all the countries where it operates.

Spain

In Spain, Ferrovial is committed to the 31 principles in the National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights developed by the Government of Spain, approved in July 2017. This plan responds to the recommendations made within the framework of the European Union through the Renewed Strategy of the European Union for 2011-2014 on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the 20152019 European Union Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.

In 2015, the company updated the Procedure for the Prevention of Employment and Sexual Harassment, whilst promoting its 2nd Ferrovial Equality Plan, whose goal is based on guaranteeing the principle of equality of treatment and opportunity between men and women. Since 2013, Ferrovial has adhered to the Companies for a Society Free of Gender Violence project promoted by the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality to raise awareness in society of equality between men and women and respect for fundamental rights.
Australia
On October 31, 2017 Broadspectrum completed its contracts for the provision of maintenance, social care and security services to asylum seekers and refugees in the Regional Processing Centers of Manus and Nauru. As a result, Ferrovial kept its word, when in May 2016 it acquired the aforementioned Australian company, at which time it announced its decision to not apply for renewal.
All the acquisitions that Ferrovial has made to date, and those that it will make in the future, have been and will be framed in a comprehensive analysis process that guarantees that they are in line with the corporate policies of Human Rights, Corporate Responsibility and the Code of Business Ethics.
United Kingdom
The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 is a law from the UK Parliament designed to deal with slavery in the UK and consolidate crimes related to human trafficking and slavery.
Within the framework of this law, Ferrovial Agroman UK, Amey, AGS and Heathrow Airport have commitments that guarantee the prevention of acts related to slavery in all its forms and the trafficking of people, both in their own activities and in their supply chain.
PROMOTION AND DISSEMINATION
Ferrovial promotes respect for Human Rights and fosters a respectful and dignified work environment for all people. The Code of Ethics course has been completed by 2,085 employees, accumulating a total of 11,956 hours since 2010.
Ferrovial has a firm commitment to the effective equality of opportunities, as set out in its Strategic Diversity Plan. Within the framework of this initiative is the Inclusive Leadership Program, through which more than 400 managers in Australia and

FERROVIAL IN 2017 I SOCIETY A

79

1,300 managers in the United Kingdom have already passed. The scope of the program is to be expanded to other locations.
The company capitalizes on its involvement in international forums and training programs to raise awareness of the need for the private sector to take a role in the protection of human rights. In fact, Ferrovial has been chosen to be Secretary of the Executive Committee of Forética and it participates as a member of the Executive Committee of the Global Compact Network and Fundación Seres, all of them pioneering associations for boosting Corporate Responsibility in Spain.
In relation to employment rights, Ferrovial guarantees the right to strike, freedom of association and the right to collective

bargaining by appointed workers' representatives and unions. Ferrovial employees are protected by collective employment regulations in each of the different countries. 73% of the workforce is adhered to collective bargaining agreements.
Ferrovial promotes initiatives that encourage listening and a more flexible way of working that allows a better balance of personal and professional life, as well as a healthy environment. The communication channels, such as the internal social networks and the corporate intranet, Ferronet, facilitate the creation of collaborative, dynamic and flexible work environments. In 2017, Ferronet registered 2,911,857 sessions and 5,231,933 page views.

INTEGRATION OF THE ABORIGINAL POPULATION IN AUSTRALIA
One of the main initiatives in Human Rights is developed by Broadspectrum in Australia, through its programs linked to the Reconciliation Action Plan promoted by the government for the integration of the aboriginal population in society. The company has a plan to increase the presence of this important group through a supply of sustainable employment, training, education and long-term business opportunities for Aboriginal peoples and their communities. Therefore, the Broadspectrum Reconciliation Action Plan includes measures such as to increase indigenous employment to 6% in 2018, and increase contracts with suppliers and subcontractors with this condition to 3% in 2020. It also facilitates the incorporation of young aboriginal professionals.
The program is developed through:
 Respecting the values and beliefs of aboriginal peoples.  Generating employment,education and training opportunities.  Understand the potential impact that business activity can have on abori-
ginal communities.  Increase the participation of aboriginal communities in business success.  Support programs that strengthen and promote the interests of aboriginal
people.  Encourage all employees to develop awareness of aboriginal cultures.  Establish procedures for listening to aboriginal peoples.

FERROVIAL CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO OFFER SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES THAT RESPOND TO CHALLENGES SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, WATER FOOTPRINT MANAGEMENT, THE ENERGY CRISIS, THE REUSE OF WASTE AND THE LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY, TO CREATE VALUE BY REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND DISCOVER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

TThe ratification of the universal agreement against climate
change, the Paris Agreement, confirms the commitment of governments to limit the increase in global warming to below 2 °C at the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels. Most of the countries where Ferrovial operates have ratified their emission reduction commitments, which is why an acceleration of the process for the decarbonization of their economies is expected, which will generate new opportunities.
CLIMATE STRATEGY
The strategy and climate governance is integrated into Ferrovial's business strategy. Technological advances, a commitment to innovation, to energy efficiency, the source of energy from renewable sources and an increase in their weight in electric mixes to the detriment of fossil fuels are essential elements to take on the environmental commitment to reduce own emissions and those of customers and users of products and services.
In this sense, Ferrovial has become a strategic partner in achieving the targets of mitigating emissions and adapting

to the effects of climate change by providing solutions through its low carbon business models: mobility of people (Managed Lanes on toll roads and car sharing), energy services, smart cities, water, circular economy and adaptation of infrastructures.
Ferrovial's climate strategy has been awarded once again by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), when it was included in the "Climate A List" leadership category in the Climate Change edition and recognized by the international consultancy Carbon Clear as one of the leading companies among the Ibex 35 companies.
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
Ferrovial is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
Currently, Ferrovial's corporate risk system covers both physical, operational, regulatory, financial and reputational climate risks. This analysis provides useful and relevant information to plan the corporate strategy and take

advantage of the business opportunities derived from the mitigation and adaptation measures.
These recommendations are considered a turning point that will accelerate the economy with low emissions.
Collaboration with stakeholders
Ferrovial maintains an active position with the most relevant stakeholders, highlighting those that are or may be involved in the main climatic risks of the company's activities throughout the world.
To facilitate this, the company is involved in several think tanks and influence groups at European level to discuss the future of the economic and environmental agenda for the 2030 and 2050 horizons. These include the Corporate Leaders Group (University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership) and the EU Green Growth Group (platform formed by representatives of the business world, members of the European Parliament, governments and commissioners).
In the field of climate innovation, since 2017, Ferrovial has been a co-partner of the Climate-KIC, the largest European public-private innovation initiative created by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) focused on mitigation and adaptation to climate change, either by carrying out innovation projects or by accessing the network of entrepreneurs articulated by the Climate-KIC.
In Spain, Ferrovial chairs the Spanish Green Growth Group (GECV) that promotes public-private collaboration to advance in mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the decarbonization of the economy and the promotion of a circular economy.
Along the same lines, the company is a member of the Fundación Empresa y Clima, a strategic partner in the #PorElClima Community, which promotes the Spanish Platform for Climate Action for public-private collaboration, presented in the framework of the Bonn COP, supports the Marrakech Alliance to contribute to a green and decarbonized economy, and participant in the Cluster of Climate Change promoted by Forética.
Circular economy
The circular economy is an important element as a new economic model in the fight against climate change. Therefore, Ferrovial has supported the Pact for the Circular Economy promoted by the Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment and Economy, Industry and Competitiveness that mainly promotes the reduction of the use of non-renewable natural resources, reuse of waste as raw materials, recycling, incorporating ecodesign criteria and public awareness.
Under this scope, a Circular Economy Working Group has been set up internally to identify and promote opportunities to transform the waste generated and managed into raw materials or secondary fuels that can be used in works and infrastructures designed, constructed and operated by Ferrovial.

CARBON FOOTPRINT. REDUCTION TARGETS
The calculation and reporting of the carbon footprint is applicable to the entire company and covers all business areas and subsidiaries. The calculation method is based chiefly on the GHG Protocol (WRI&WBCSD), which is the most internationally accepted approach, while also adhering to ISO14064-1 standards. The market based method was used to calculate scope 2.
The company has ambitious goals in this matter. By 2020, it has been proposed to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions in terms of intensity (tCO2eq / million euro of turnover) by 35.4% compared to the baseline year, 2009. By 2030, the target approved and endorsed by SBTi is to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions in absolute terms by 32% and in terms of intensity by 42.9%. The reduction target for 2017 in terms of intensity with respect to the baseline year is 25.75%.
After calculating the 2017 carbon footprint, scope 1 & 2 emissions have been reduced by 28.4% in terms of intensity (2.65% above the target) with respect to the base year. In absolute terms, emissions have been reduced by 10.2%, despite the 25.4% increase in turnover since that year. For more information see the Appendix.
The fulfillment of the proposed target is being carried out based on the implementation of actions to improve energy efficiency in buildings and processes, in the incorporation of sustainable criteria in purchases, in leasing of vehicles and machinery, in the design of sustainable mobility plans, and in the promotion of the purchase of electricity from certified renewable sources. Along these lines, in 2017, 36.04% of the total electricity consumed came from renewable sources, with 94.08% purchased and 5.92% from self-consumption.
Emissions avoided
Since 2009, and thanks to internal plans, scope 1 & 2 emissions have been reduced by 1,202,451 tCO2eq, a figure similar to the annual emissions of a city of 174,136 inhabitants. In 2017, the consumption of renewable electricity prevented the emission of 39,247 tCO2eq, and the emissions avoided thanks to the sorting and capturing of biogas in landfills amounted to 1,389,171 tCO2eq.

BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL CAPITAL
Through the "Ferrovial, Natural Capital" program, Ferrovial carries out several biodiversity projects for not only assessing and mitigating the impact on natural spaces or ecosystems affected by its activity, but also anticipating market trends and, if applicable, making the most of any new opportunities in this field. At the end of 2016, the Natural Capital Protocol was made public, the first international standard that aims to make it easier for corporations to internalize risks and opportunities related to biodiversity and natural capital. Ferrovial had anticipated this process by incorporating the "No Net Loss of Biodiversity" criteria in its policy by developing tools to measure the company's impact on biodiversity, in collaboration with various scientific institutions (CSIC, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos of Madrid, University of Salamanca).

REDUCTION TARGETS CERTIFIED BY SCIENCE BASED TARGETS (SBTi)
Ferrovial has joined the SBTi initiative that promotes the action of the private sector toward a low emission economy. A proposal that follows the recommendations of scientists and aligns them with the targets to reduce emissions required in the different temporary timelines. Ferrovial is the first company in its sector and in the world to set reduction targets aligned and validated by this initiative. SBTi collaborates with the United Nations Global Compact, CDP, World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

The development of these tools was completed in 2017, and their reliability was validated in some infrastructure projects. This initiative has served as a case study and has accelerated the entry of Ferrovial into the Natural Capital Coalition, the promoting entity of the protocol.
Meanwhile, the company maintains its lines of collaboration with the Spanish Enterprise and Biodiversity Initiative (http:// ieeb.fundacion-biodiversidad.es/), and the Global Change Monitoring Network, of the Ministry of Environment (MAPAMA).
WATER FOOTPRINT

CARBON PRICING
In 2017, a tool was developed to implement a carbon price in the most relevant investments of Ferrovial in the shadow pricing modality with the aim of quantifying the associated risks and opportunities and guiding the asset portfolio to decarbonized business models. The methodology establishes the evolution of the long-term carbon price (from 2020 to 2050), in the main sectors and in the 15 most relevant geographies, making it possible to quantify the risks and opportunities of new investments. It also includes an analysis of the current carbon prices, the optimal prices to be able to meet the decarbonization target of the Paris Agreement and the path of compliance in each of the countries.

Ferrovial is the first company in its sector to establish a methodology to quantify its impact on water resources. It is based on the principles of The Water Footprint Assessment Manual (WFM), the Global Water Tool (GWT) and GRI-G4, and considers aspects such as the country's water stress, the impact on water resources (quantity and quality) and the

accessibility to water. More information on our water footprint at www.ferrovial.com.

SUPPLY CHAIN
FERROVIAL WORKS TO DEVELOP A SUPPLY CHAIN FORMED BY THE BEST PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS, PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING, COLLABORATION, EFFICIENCY AND INNOVATION.

FFerrovial integrates its corporate principles and values throughout the entire supply chain.
The company works with leading, socially responsible and collaborative organizations and partners.
The selection and contracting processes are objective and rigorous. Through the evaluation and monitoring of quality, the company seeks to increase the performance of the supply chain and facilitate solid and long-term business relationships.
STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES

NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS: 87,335

The Global Purchasing Policy, applicable to all Ferrovial companies and subsidiaries, includes the fundamental principles in terms of safety and sustainability that mark the relationship of the company with its suppliers. They are based on the company's Code of Business Ethics and the Corporate Responsibility Policies.

CADENA SUMINISTRO

This policy defines the bases and the basic operating procedure, and specific operating procedures are applied for each country/area to adapt them to the particularities of each market. It seeks to shore up the management adapted to the specific requirements of each project in accordance with the local supplier marketplace yet applying an international vision in relevant purchase with a view to benefiting synergies and the extensive knowledge of the global supplier marketplace.

BY BUSINESS

The overall coordination of the purchasing activity rests with the Global Procurement Committee, which, led by Ferrovial's Chief Information and Innovation Officer (CIIO) and formed by the chief procurement managers of the business areas, facilitates sharing good practices and improving the procurement function from a global point of view.

The strengthening of good purchasing governance is materialized with the reinforcement of the procedures control model using information obtained from the systems, developing certain sustainability plans, and establishing work groups to look into new approaches and specific solutions to mitigate risks.
Another of the targets pursued is the professionalization of the function through specific training programs, presence in events and the improvement of communication with businesses.This year,5,820 hours of training were given,mainly aimed at procurement managers, to find out the best practices and latest developments in the field of provisioning.
COMPREHENSIVE SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT
The relationship that Ferrovial maintains with its suppliers is based on transparency and mutual trust, with the clear objective of being able to guarantee an excellent, efficient and quality service provision. The relationship with suppliers and contractors is maintained through specific management, classification, approval, evaluation and risk control systems.

BY COUNTRY

Supplier selection is based on objective and rigorous criteria that guarantee independence and impartiality. The procedure for evaluating and monitoring the quality of suppliers and subcontractors includes an assessment of incidents in the event of any breach of the agreed requirements included in the contract or order that change the provision of the service. Incidents are classified as minor or serious and may lead to the blocking and/or exclusion of the supplier in future tenders.

It is also essential that suppliers ensure compliance with the Corporate Responsibility Policy, the Code of Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption and Compliance Policies in their applicable field. Along this line, contract and order models have been updated to align them with the new Corporate Compliance Policy, so that procurement managers convey to suppliers the
commitment to act in accordance with said policy.

SUPPLIERS EVALUATED IN 2017
13,129

In 2017, 13,129 suppliers were assessed, and less than 1% were rejected. 29,173 new suppliers were incorporated during the year. A total of 685 suppliers were considered critical, which accounted for 19.1% of the total supplier invoicing.

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
For Ferrovial, it is essential to continue being committed to innovation and using new technologies as key elements to improve procurement processes and available information. Continuous improvement is a priority, incorporating new ways of working, sharing knowledge and learning from best practices. Innovation is also sought in collaboration with suppliers, using their experience to offer products and services that add value, minimize risk and offer new opportunities.
In Construction, the use of InSite continues to be promoted as a tool to support procurement information and management, incorporating new information processing and analysis capabilities.
Meanwhile, Ferrovial Services launched an ambitious program to optimize the available information and share it with the other business activities. It includes punch-out catalogs for improved integration with critical suppliers; dashboards for procurement management (PIC BI) and fleet management (OMEGA BI), to take better advantage of available information; and the design and implementation of the OPTIMAS project, which consists of an improvement plan to optimize the backoffice functions of the business areas.
Regarding the management of information and data, the increase in the supply and fleet presence in innovation projects is noteworthy. The Smart Fleet project, an intelligent fleet and connectivity program that involves the implementation of technology in the fleet itself, is designed to obtain information aimed at improving efficiency, fuel consumption in fuel tanks, preventive and corrective maintenance, and workplace and road safety in the fleet and workshops.

OMEGA PROJECT
Ferrovial Services has been using the OMEGA tool (Optimization of Equipment Maintenance and Asset Management) software tool since March 2017 to gather all the equipment and vehicle information in its workshops, which enables greater control of the fleet and reduces the associated maintenance costs.
The objective of OMEGA is to obtain sufficient traceability to control expenses and efficiently allocate available resources such as labor, materials and subcontracting expenses. With the data obtained, and using Big Data, we expect to anticipate possible breakdowns and adapt preventive maintenance plans.
Considerable resources have been invested in designing the application to adjust it to the different technical profiles in the workshops. The main benefits of this new tool are:
 Having a unique management model unified in Ferrovial Services.
 Saving management costs thanks to improved planning.
 Improving fleet management,by having all the technical information of the equipment and vehicles.

SUSTAINABLE PURCHASES
The procurement area actively contributes to achieving the objectives of the Strategic Plan for Corporate Responsibility, the 20.19 Plan, by promoting the contracting of renewable energies, the reduction of fuel consumption and by purchasing electric and hybrid vehicles. Along this line Construction has a Catalog of Green Purchases conceived for shoring up acquisitions of products and services with environmental characteristics that enable a contribution to improving energy efficiency, environmental sustainability and assisting responsible decision-making for purchasing supplies and commissioning construction work and services.
When making a decision in procurement processes, energy consumption is considered among the factors that are analyzed in the products or services to be contracted, in procurements in which this factor is relevant. In 2017 a market study was carried out on hybrid and electric vehicles to determine the possible alternatives, as well as the advantages and disadvantages and/or limitations compared to conventional vehicles. Ferrovial Services is analyzing new methods of propulsion for heavy vehicles, especially for waste collection trucks (100% electric and hybrid in development).

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Competitive tension: the economic recovery slowdown in Europe and emerging countries negatively affects public sector investment capacity and could therefore affect the demand on infrastructures. This circumstance increases competitive tension in the international markets where Ferrovial operates with the resulting pressures on prices and profit margins in projects that, by their very nature, have significant execution risks, and on the technical references portfolio.
As a response to these risks, the company has an investment approval procedure in place for identifying and assessing the most relevant project risks, including risks generated by the competitive environment, and opts to tender projects for which it has the most appropriate risk management capacities that will yield a competitive advantage.
Brexit: after the United Kingdom Government submitted its formal intention to leave the European Union on June 19, 2016, the exit process was formally initiated and a two-year negotiation period began to determine the new terms of the UK's relationship with the European Union.
The final result of this negotiation process is subject to a high level of uncertainty that could adversely affect economic conditions in the United Kingdom and/or in the European market as a whole, as well as contributing to instability in financial markets and global currencies, including volatility in the value of the euro.
Ferrovial's assets in the United Kingdom (16% of the value of assets according to analysts' estimates), could affect its profitability and its ability to create value.
However, these estimates have been tweaked toward a more optimistic outlook. Heathrow airport is the largest asset in which Ferrovial participates in the United Kingdom but the forecast for a potential slowdown or standstill in the British economy is not expected to significantly affect its activity when compared to similar situations in the past in light of the relevance of the asset and its current full-capacity status. In addition, the decision of the British Government to move forward with the third runway project, pending final parliamentary approval, highlights the importance that the airport has for this country and, therefore, its lower exposure to this risk.
In the case of the Services business, which operates through Amey, the impact of budgetary restrictions of Public Administrations may continue to affect the business, although both Services and Construction may be positively impacted by the need to improve the transport network that entails more investment and maintenance tenders in the medium-term. Section 5.4 h of the Consolidated Annual Accounts shows how the Brexit has impacted on the main financial figures, contrasting the negative effect of the performance of the exchange rate with the positive effect of the increase in the inflation rate and the reduction of interest rates, and therefore, of the discount rate on the regulated assets of Heathrow airport.

Regulated assets indexed at inflation increase their value as inflation increases. In response to the risks that could emerge from Brexit, Ferrovial will continue monitoring the developments in negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, foster operating efficiency measures across its diverse business areas to adapt to arising market circumstances, and continue tracking the trends in the financial markets to take the appropriate coverage measures.
To hedge the foreign currency risk, Ferrovial has arranged hedges to cover the amount equivalent to approximately the dividends it expects to receive from UK assets over the next three years. See Note 5.4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Political and regulation factors: In general, most of Ferrovial's operations are in countries with a high level of legal certainty and where there is an expectation of socioeconomic stability and transparent tax regulations, as in the case of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Poland, Australia and Spain. Nevertheless, recent political events characterized by the exponential growth of protectionist policies and fiscal consolidation could affect the taxation, legal and regulatory environments in which the company operates, negatively affecting the targets of profitability and growth.
In this regard it can be mentioned that the expansion of Heathrow Airport is subject to the authorization of the British Government and Parliament. In the specific case of Spain, growth prospects may also be affected due to the uncertainties derived from political and social initiatives in Catalonia, calling for the separation of the region of Spain.
To mitigate this risk, Ferrovial permanently monitors the regulatory and legislative processes that may affect its activities, as well as the political movements that may occur, in order to anticipate possible changes in time for proper management.
Ethics and Integrity: While conducting its activities, Ferrovial is exposed to ethical risks. To mitigate these risks, Ferrovial has a Compliance Model that is developed under the principles of respect for current legislation, ethical integrity, transparency and Zero Tolerance toward criminal actions. The purposes of the model are: i) to provide all Ferrovial administrators, directors and employees with a general framework of action to which they must abide when doing their job based on the highest standards of integrity, transparency, respect for legality and human rights; ii) to establish a common and homogeneous framework for monitoring, controlling and managing compliance risks, especially those aimed at the prevention of criminal behavior; iii) to foster a culture of business ethics in the organization and in the decision-making and training processes of the will of administrators, managers and employees.
On October 31, 2017, the Broadspectrum contracts with the Australian Government's Department of Immigration and Border Protection to provide welfare, maintenance

and security services at the Regional Processing Centers of Manus (Papua New Guinea) and Nauru simultaneously ended. As a result, Ferrovial fulfilled its commitment in May 2016 when it acquired Broadspectrum, to not continue with these contracts once they expire, given that these activities were not included in its portfolio of services. During these months, Broadspectrum has prioritized the safety and welfare of these refugees and asylum seekers, while working very closely with the new suppliers to ensure the best transition in both Nauru and Manus.
In January 2018, the Provincial Court of Barcelona notified the judgment of the Palau Case, not condemning the two directors related to Ferrovial Agroman who were accused.
Ferrovial encourages compliance with the principles of ethics and transparency and the responsible behavior of all employees, regardless of their hierarchical level and the country in which they work, and ensures that other individuals or groups that carry out activities on behalf of Ferrovial, including contractors, agents, consultants and other business partners, do so as well.
Cyber-attacks: Ferrovial's infrastructures are exposed to cyber attacks with the consequent impact on people and on their own infrastructures, which may even lead to them coming to a standstill. Those most exposed to this type of risk are the airport and road infrastructures.
In this regard, Ferrovial collaborates with security authorities to implement the most appropriate security measures and systems to prevent attacks on its infrastructures. Furthermore, the implementation of cybersecurity measures reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the company's information and operating systems.
- Emerging risks: Ferrovial assesses and monitors the status of emerging risks that could negatively affect its ability to meet strategic targets or risks that, despite their low likelihood of occurrence, could nevertheless have negative effects on its business targets. Some of the more prominent risks include natural disasters or risks caused by human action, humanitarian crises, anti-globalization and protectionist political movements to reduce international investment and jeopardize free competition, the disruption and/or technological obsolescence and impact on technology innovation in managing infrastructures. Likewise, environmental risks are monitored, mainly those related to the effects of climate change (the "environment" section of this report, explains Ferrovial's strategy in relation to this matter). The company seeks to anticipate the occurrence of these risks to adapt its strategy sufficiently in advance.
-Financial risks: the company actively assesses and manages the risk exposure of the main financial variables: interest rate, exchange rate, share price, liquidity and credit. The analysis makes a distinction between the policies applied in infrastructure project companies and the rest of companies, in those cases where such a difference is relevant. The financial risks and applied management measures are described in section 5.4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT. FERROVIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Ferrovial has a Risk Control and Management Policy that was approved by the Board of Directors to establish the acceptable risk and tolerance level per risk factor. These policies sets the general engagement framework for controlling and managing risks of diverse sorts that the managing team could encounter when attempting to attain business objectives.
The Ferrovial Risk Management (FRM) is the company's risk identification and assessment process, which is supervised by the Board of Directors and Management Committee, and implemented in all business areas.
This process was created for the early detection and assessment of risk events based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on strategic objectives, including corporate reputation. This enables Ferrovial to roll out the most suitable management and protective measures according to the nature and location of the risk.
The identified risk events are assessed using common metrics: one inherent, before the specific control implemented to mitigate the risk, whether impact or likelihood, and one residual, considering specific control measures. Furthermore, both assessments make it possible to determine the relative importance of each risk event in the risk matrix, assessing the effectiveness of the implemented measures for managing them.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Fixed components
TThe fixed remuneration of the Executive Directors is calculated on the basis of market benchmarks
from a comparison group comprising 24 national and international companies in their reference benchmarks.
Variable components
Only Executive Directors have variable component elements in their remuneration. It comprises an Annual Variable Remuneration and Long-Term Incentive Plans.
a) Annual Variable Remuneration
It is linked to individual performance and the attainment of specific economic-financial, industrial and operational targets, which are pre-established, quantifiable and coherent with the social interest, and contemplated in the Strategic Plans. They could be quantitative or qualitative objectives.
The target amount of the annual variable remuneration for Executive Directors, i.e., the remuneration corresponding to a standard level of achievement insofar as objectives is equivalent to 125% of the Fixed Remuneration for the Chairman and CEO. The quantitative targets have an associated

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by an assignment (fixed plus complementary) and food allowances.
Their remuneration is in the median of the remuneration of Ibex-35 non-executive directors.
Ferrovial's internal regulations states that remuneration for External Directors will be determined so as to adequately compensate for the responsibility and dedication required by the position without compromising their independence.
Remuneration formulas involving the delivery of shares, options, share-linked instruments or instruments linked to the Company's performance will only apply to Executive Directors.
Further information on the remuneration of the Board of Directors and Senior Management, and on the Remuneration Policy is available at the Ferrovial website: www.ferrovial.com.

scale for compensating overachieved targets up to a certain limit, hence the annual variable remuneration has a ceiling of 225% on the Fixed Remuneration for Executive Directors.
b) Long-Term Incentive Plans
Executive Directors participate in a long-term variable remuneration system consisting of share-based remuneration plans. They are structured on overlapping multi-year cycles (currently at 3 years) with yearly unit assignments, which are converted into shares at the end of the cycle (currently 3 years).
For the valid plan (2016 ­ 2018), they are determined with the relative weighting of the following metrics:

EXPECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE A

107

EXPECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
FERROVIAL FORECASTS THE EVOLUTION OF ITS BUSINESSES FOR 2018, AS WELL AS THE MAIN MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THIS FORECAST IS MADE BY DEVELOPING THE STRATEGY, OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS ANALYSED IN CHAPTER 1.2 OF THIS INTEGRATED REPORT.

TOLL ROADS
TThe predictable behavior of the toll roads in operation during
2018 will depend on macroeconomic developments in the countries or states where the assets are located and their impact on traffic volumes and revenues. The company will continue to focus its efforts on maximizing revenues within the framework allowed by the concession rights, as well as in fulfilling its contractual obligations by optimizing costs.
 In Canada, the 407 ETR will continue to develop its Strategic Plan in 2018, increasing knowledge about user behavior through Big Data techniques. This increased knowledge will lead to greater pricing sophistication and price plans to continue optimizing the company's income. This pricing policy will continue to be supported by excellent customer service, for which the company will continue to invest in new systems in order to maintain and improve the high levels of user satisfaction reached in 2017.
 In the USA, the positive economic outlook in Texas for 2018, as well as the behavior to date of the assets, allow us to trust that NTE and LBJ will have growth in traffic and revenues that help meet the forecasts while complying with the user satisfaction objective. Additionally, the opening of segments 3A and 3B of toll road 35W in Fort Worth will consolidate Cintra as the operator of Managed Lanes in the Dallas-Fort Worth region. In North Carolina, the opening of toll road I-77, the first Managed Lanes toll road in this state, will validate this concept as a solution to the problems of congestion in urban corridors.
 In Australia, work is planned to start in 2018 on the recently awarded Western Roads Upgrade project in Melbourne, as well as continuing with the Toowoomba works.
 In other markets Cintra will continue to operate the assets that are already in the operation phase and will continue with the execution of several projects in the construction phase: 407 Extension II, in Canada; Ruta del Cacao, in Colombia; and D4R7, in Slovakia.
In addition, Cintra will continue its bidding activity in the company's target regions (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, Chile and Peru), focusing primarily on complex greenfield projects, given their high potential for value creation.

AIRPORTS
Over the next year, Ferrovial Airports will continue to focus its efforts on its bidding activity and maximize the performance of its assets:
 Heathrow will continue with the construction process of the third runway, which should be approved by British Parliament, together with different stakeholders (airlines, regulators and communities) in such a decisive contribution for the British economy. Regarding the next H7 regulatory period, the Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed that a RAB-based remuneration model and single till will continue to be used, and the consultative process on capital cost, inflation indexation or cost of debt will continue, among other issues.
 AGS will continue to invest in increasing the profitability of airports by expanding and improving the shopping area in Glasgow and Aberdeen, stimulating passenger growth through new routes and commercial revenues, as well as continuing to improve operating costs.
 Denver, whose remodeling works at the Jeppesen terminal will begin in the second half of the year.
The bidding activity at airports in 2018 will focus mainly on the North American market, with the opening of a new commercial office in Austin to improve the knowledge and needs of this market and strengthening the competitive advantages of the company. The bidding activity for electricity transmission will focus on Chile and other countries in South America.
CONSTRUCTION
Perspectives for 2018, by markets, are as follows:
In Spain, despite the economic improvement, it is not expected that sales in 2018 will grow due to stagnation in public tender and high competition, not offset by the improvement in private construction. The order book in 2017 has fallen due to a selective contracting approach of the company, prioritizing profitability over volume. Future improvements are focused on the tendering of concessions from the Extraordinary Plan of Investment in Roads of the Ministry of Public Works in 2018.
In international markets, expectations are positive due to the high pipeline and the different technical and manage-

108

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

ment capacities in large contracts, despite the growing competition from global and local constructors:
 In the USA and Canada, investment in transport infrastructures with federal support is significantly increasing, including the P3 / Design-Build-Finance projects in which Ferrovial, and Ferrovial Agroman as a constructor, are leaders. The approval of the USA Fast Act in 2015 and the Canadian Federal Infrastructure Plan in 2016, as well as the increasing budgetary contribution of states and provinces, will continue with large recent awards to Ferrovial Agroman for both P3 projects (e.g. toll road I-66 in Virginia) and with public financing (e.g. toll road SH-99 Grand Parkway, Texas). The positive execution rate of the order book and the high level of contracts in 2017 will allow sales to increase in 2018.
 In Poland, the public tender has returned to a good level in roads and railroads associated with the European Funds 2014-20 framework, and an extension in the provision and term of the long-term plans in these sectors has also been announced. It is expected that in 2018 Budimex will continue its growth due to its high order book at the end of 2017, with large contracts such as the Lagiewnicka toll road and six railroad works.
 In the United Kingdom, despite the uncertainties of the Brexit, political willingness continues to promote large works from the infrastructure plan, including several P3s in 2018.
 Likewise, in Australia, the strong pipeline promoted by the Government's Infrastructure Plan is maintained. Despite the above, sales for 2018 in these markets will not grow compared to previous years due to lower contracting in 2017.
 The company has an important future pipeline in Latin America (Chile, Colombia and Peru) and in certain one-off OECD countries with projects of interest and leading local partners.
In summary, a growth in sales is expected for 2018 thanks to the international area, with good contracting opportunities. Finally, profit margins are expected to remain stable, in line with those of 2017, thanks to a selective portfolio with globally controlled risks and continuity in the strategic discipline of project and country selection.

SERVICES
Ferrovial Services anticipates a year of profitable growth once the integration of Broadspectrum is completed, its organizational model has been consolidated, and cost rationalization measures have been identified. The perspectives for geographical locations are as follows:
 In the United Kingdom, it is foreseeable that the uncertainty about the pace of economic growth and investment in the country will continue as the Brexit implementation scenario becomes clearer. In this transition context, Amey will continue to work on improving its cost structure and its operational model. Additionally, with respect to the Birmingham City Council litigation, the company will negotiate with the city council on how best to enforce the judgment and will evaluate how to affect the solution to the future profitability of the contract.
 Macroeconomic prospects in Australia and New Zealand, reinforced by the increase in commodity prices, are positive. The portfolio of service projects identified in Broadspectrum's activity scope exceeds 30,000 million AUD. Broadspectrum has begun a new stage of growth in its activity sectors (transport, government/defense, urban infrastructure and natural resources) supported by the launch of new projects such as OSARS West. Regarding margins, 2018 will be a year of transition, not having the contribution of the Manus and Nauru contracts and implementing the rationalization measures for structure and contracts defined in 2017.
 Spain will continue its improvement in terms of growth and employment. Within this stable framework of activity, Ferrovial Services will continue to combine the optimization of its operations with the development of a range of high added value services by integrating technology and innovative business models in fields such as urban mobility.
 In the other countries, Ferrovial Services Internacional will consolidate its new organization and geographical presence with expected growth in all its markets. In the United States and Canada, the start-up of its strategy to develop its target sectors such as the maintenance of transport and energy infrastructures will begin.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APM)

TThe company presents its results in accordance with gener-
ally accepted accounting standards (IFRS). Management also provides other financial measures not regulated in the IFRS, called APM's, (Alternative Performance Measures) in both the Management Report and the Consolidated Annual Accounts, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Guidelines. Management uses these APMs in decision-making and to evaluate the performance of the company. Below are the breakdowns required by the ESMA for each APM on definition, reconciliation, explanation of use, comparison and coherence. More detailed information on the reconciliation with the financial statements is provided on the corporate website: https://www.ferrovial.com/en/ir-shareholders/financial-information/quarterly-financial-information/.
EBITDA = GROSS OPERATING PROFIT (GOP)
 Definition: operating result before provisions to fixed asset depreciation.
 Reconciliation: the company presents the EBITDA calculation in the Consolidated Income Statement (refer to the Consolidated Income Statement in section 1.3 of the Management Report and the Financial Statements included in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statement) as: EBITDA = Total Operating Income - Total operating expenditure (excluding expenditures related to depreciation provisions, which are separately reported on another line).
 Explanation of the use: EBITDA provides an analysis of the operating results excluding depreciation and amortization, as they are non-cash variables which can vary substantially from company to company depending on accounting policies and the accounting value of the assets. EBITDA is the best approximation to pre-tax operating cash flow and reflects cash generation before working capital variation. EBITDA is used as a starting point to calculate cash flow, adding the variation of the working capital. Finally, it is an APM indicator widely used by investors when evaluating businesses (multiples valuation), rating agencies and creditors to evaluate the level of debt, comparing EBITDA with net debt.
 Comparison: the Company presents comparative reports from previous years.
 Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating EBITDA is the same as the previous year.
COMPARISON ("LIKE FOR LIKE GROWTH")
 Definition: relative year-on-year variation in comparable terms of the figures for revenues, EBITDA/GOP, operating results and the portfolio. The comparison is calculated by adjusting the present year and the previous one, in accordance with the following rules:  Elimination of the exchange-rate effect, calculating the results of both periods at the rate in the current period.  Elimination from the EBIT of both periods of the impact of fixed asset impairments and results from company disposals (corresponding to the figure reported in the line " Impairments and disposals of fixed assets").  In the case of company disposals and loss of control, the homogenization of the operating result is undertaken by eliminating the operating results of the sold company

when the impact occurred in the previous year, or if it occurred in the year under analysis, considering the same amount of months in both periods.  Eliminating restructuring costs in both periods.  In acquisitions of new companies that are considered to be material, elimination in the current period of the operating results derived from those companies, except in the case where this elimination is not possible due to the high level of integration with other reporting units (material companies have revenues representing 5% of the reporting unit's revenues before the acquisition).  Elimination in both periods of other non-recurrent impacts (mainly related to tax and human resources) considered relevant to better understand the company's underlying results.  Note: new contracts in the Toll Roads business coming into operation are not considered acquisitions and thus are not adjusted in the comparison.
 Reconciliation: comparable growth is presented in separate columns under Business Performance in section 1.3 of the Management Report.
 Explanation of the use: the comparison provide a more homogeneous measure of the underlying profitability of the businesses, excluding non recurrent elements that could lead to a misinterpretation of the reported growth, impacts such as exchange-rate variations or changes in the consolidation perimeter that distort the comparability of the information. It also enables the presentation of homogenous information, thus ensuring uniformity and providing a better understanding of the performance of each one of our businesses.
 Comparisons: the comparison is itemized only for the current period compared with the previous period.
 Coherence:thecriteriaemployedforcalculatingtheComparisonisthesameasthepreviousyear.
ADJUSTMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE
 Definition: the adjustments to the Consolidated Income Statement relating to results from changes in the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities, impairment of assets and the impact of the two previous elements on "profit sharing of companies accounted for using the equity method".
 Reconciliation: a detailed itemization of the Adjustments for Fair Value is included in the Consolidated Income Statement (see the Consolidated Income Statement in section 1.3 of the Management Report and the Financial Statements included in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statement).
 Explanation of the use: Adjustments for Fair Value could be useful for investors and financial analysts when assessing the underlying profitability of the Company, as they are capable of excluding elements that do not generate cash and could vary substantially from one year to another because of the accounting method used to calculate the fair value.
 Comparisons: the company presents comparisons of previous years.  Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating Adjustments for Fair Value is the same
as the previous year.
CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT
 Definition: this is the net Treasury balance and equivalents (including short and long-term restricted cash), less short and long-term financial debt (bank debt and bonds) including the balance relating to exchange rate derivatives that cover debt issuance in currency different from the currency of the issuing company and cash positions with exchange rate risk.
 Reconciliation: the detailed reconciliation is itemized in Note 5.2. Consolidated Net Debt in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and in the section Net Debt and Corporate Reporting in the Management Report.
 Explanation of the use: financial indicator used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies, creditors and other parties to ascertain a company's debt position. Net Debt is also broken down into two categories:  Net Debt of Infrastructure Projects.Ring-fenced debt with no recourse for shareholder or with a recourse limited to the granted guarantees.Debt corresponding to the companies considered as a Project.  Net Debt (ex Projects).Net debt of the other businesses,including group holding companies and other businesses not considered to be Project companies. The debt included in this calculation is with recourse, and is therefore the measure used by investors, financial analysts and rating agencies to appraise the leverage, financial strength, flexibility and risks of the Company.

112

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

 Comparisons: the Company presents comparative reports from previous years.
 Coherence: the criteria used to calculate the net debt is different from last year due to the incorporation in the calculation of the effect of the derivatives by exchange rate related to cash positions.
PORTFOLIO
 Definition: the income pending execution corresponding to contracts that the Company has entered into on the date and regarding which there is a certainty concerning their future performance. The total income from a contract corresponds to the agreed price or rate corresponding to the delivery of goods and/or the rendering of the contemplated services. If the execution of a contract is pending the closure of financing, the income from said contract will not be added to the portfolio until financing is closed. The portfolio is calculated by adding the contracts of the actual year to the balance of the contract portfolio at the end of the previous year, less the income recognized in the current year.
 Reconciliation: the portfolio is presented under "Key figures" and under Services and Construction in the December Management Report. There is no comparable financial measure in IFRS. However, a breakdown of reconciliation with Construction and Services sales figures is provided in note "2.1. Operating Income" of the Financial Statements. This reconciliation is based on the portfolio value of a specific construction being comprised of its contracting value less the construction work completed, which is the main component of the sales figure. The difference between the construction work completed and the Construction and Services sales figure reported in Ferrovial's Financial Statements is attributable to the fact that consolidation adjustments, compensations, the sale of machinery, confirming income and other adjustments are made to the latter. In addition to contracts awarded and the construction work completed, the exchange rate of contracts awarded in foreign currency, rescissions (when a contract is terminated early) or changes to the scope are all aspects that also have an impact on the movement between the original portfolio (corresponding to the previous year) and the end portfolio (for the year in question), as shown in the Appendices available on the corporate website. Management believes that the portfolio is a useful indicator in terms of the future income of the company, as the portfolio for a specific construction will be comprised of the final sale of said construction less the net construction work undertaken.
 Explanition of use:The Management believes that the portfolio is a useful indicator with respect to the future income of the Company, due to the portfolio for a specific work will be the final sale of said work less the work executed net at source.
 Comparisons: the Company presents comparisons with the previous year.
 Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating the portfolio is the same as the previous year.
WORKING CAPITAL VARIATION
 Definition: measurement that explains the reconciliation between the GOP and the operating cash flow before taxes. It is the result of the non-cash-convertible gross income primarily from changes in debt balance and commercial liabilities.

 Reconciliation: in Note 5.3. Cash flow of the Consolidated Annual Accounts, the company provides a reconciliation between the variation of the working capital in the Balance Sheet (see description in Section 4 Working Capital of the Consolidated Annual Accounts) and the variation of the operating fund shown in the Cash Flows Statement.
 Explanation of the use: The working capital variation reflects the Company's ability to convert GOP into cash. It is the result of Company activities related with inventory management, collection from customers and payments to suppliers. It is useful for users and investors because it allows a measurement on the efficiency and short-term financial situation of the company.
 Comparisons: the company presents comparative reports from previous years.  Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating the working capital variation is the same
as the previous year.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
 Definition: sum of the dividends received by shareholders, revaluation/depreciation of the shares and other payments such as the delivery of shares or buy-back plans.
 Reconciliation: the total shareholder return is presented under the share part of section 1.1 of the Management Report. There is a breakdown of the reconciliation with the shareholder return in the financial statements.
 Explanition of use: it is a financial indicator used by investors and financial analysts, to evaluate the performance that shareholders have received throughout the year in exchange for their contribution in capital of the Company.
 Comparisons: the company presents comparative reports from previous years.  Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating shareholder return is the same as the
previous year.
MANAGED INVESTMENT
 Definition: managed investment is presented under Toll Roads in section 1.2 of the Management Report. During the construction phase, it is the total investment to make. During the operating phase, this amount is increased by the additional investment. Projects are included after signing the contract with the corresponding administration (commercial close), on which date the provisional financing terms and conditions, which will be confirmed after the financial closing, are normally available. 100% of investment is considered for all projects, including those that are integrated by the equity method, regardless of Ferrovial's participation. Projects are excluded with criteria in line with the exit from the consolidation scope.
 Reconciliation: Managed investments at the end of December 2017 came to 19.590 billion euros and are made up of 26 concessions in 10 countries. The composition of managed investments by asset type is as follows: (1) Model projects Intangible Assets IFRIC 12 (in operation), 4.833 billion euros. The managed investment coincides with the gross investment balance in these projects included in the table in section 3.3.1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements: 734 million euros from Ausol included in Spain Highways, 3.713 billion euros from NTE and LBJ included in USA Highways and 386 million euros from the Azores, included in Other Highways. (2) Model projects Intangible Assets IFRIC 12 (under construction), 1.375 billion euros. Includes American highways NTE35W and I-77 (918 and 457 million euros of management investment, respectively). As they are under construction, the balance at year-end only reflects the assets in construction as part of these projects, which comes to 912 and 217 million euros, respectively, included in the table in section 3.3.1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in USA Highways, excluding future investment commitments. (3) Model projects Accounts Receivable IFRIC 12 (in operation), 232 million euros. Includes the managed investment in Autema. The balance at year-end comes to 659 million euros, including the long term and short term (see section 3.3.2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and, amongst others, financial remuneration of the accounts receivable, which is not considered an increase in the managed investment in the asset. (4) Consolidation using the equity method, 13.150 billion euros. Includes both projects in operation and under construction that are consolidated using the equity method, such as 407ETR (3.128 billion euros of managed investment, 100%) or I-66 (2.517 billion euros, 100%). In the consolidated statement of financial position, these projects are included under Investments in associates, meaning the investment cannot be reconciled with the balance sheet.
 Explanation of use: data useful by Management to indicate the size of the portfolio of managed assets.
 Comparisons: no comparisons with previous years are itemized, though it is nevertheless a figure provided annually.
 Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating the managed investment is the same as the previous year.

MANAGEMENT OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CORPORATE POLICY
FFerrovial understands Corporate Responsibility to mean a voluntary commitment to driving the economic, social and environmental development of communities in which it operates. The Corporate Responsibility Policy is founded on the principles of the Global Compact and internationally accepted agreements and resolutions, the content of which covers CR-related matters.

APPENDIX A

113

STRATEGIC CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PLAN (2017-2019)
In 2016, the Corporate Responsibility Committee defined Plan 20.19, valid for the period 2017-2019. A series of qualitative and quantitative annualized indicators were determined for each of the proposed progress actions to take stock of the performance and level of compliance of each of them. To this end, the company has a scorecard through which it monitors its performance. In 2017, the first year of application of the plan, the company made numerous advances, including a new course on the Code of Business Ethics, the approval of an Ethical Integrity Partner Procedure, the promotion of the presence of women in the Board of Directors, the improvement of accident rates, the reduction of GHG emissions, and the increase in investment in innovation.
Plan 20.19 is part of the concept that is a Ferrovial strategic duty related to the company's sustainability, competitiveness and reputation for the sake of generating long-term value for all stakeholders and society as a whole. It is also an essential tool for developing business, building the trust of stakeholders and fulfilling medium and long-term objectives.
The 20.19 Plan positions Ferrovial as an economic, social and environmental leading company, consolidating the progress made in the field of corporate responsibility and was conceived to make Ferrovial a benchmark in the field, particularly regarding the attainment of UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which the company is aligned, primarily with goals 6 (clean water and sanitation), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).
The objectives are also aligned with the business objectives, making it possible to extend them to the Ferrovial chain of value, from customers to suppliers.
The 20.19 Plan is configured on the basis six areas, each one in engagement lines broken down in turn into specific, measurable and quantifiable objectives. They are the following:
 Ethics and integrity.  Corporate Governance.  People.  Environment.  Society.  Innovation.

114

REPORTING PRINCIPLES
SCOPE OF THE INFORMATION
FFerrovial comprises the parent company Ferrovial, S.A. and its
subsidiaries and associated companies. For detailed information on the companies included, see the scope in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.
2017 saw operations that involved changes to the scope, due to the acquisition of companies and the awarding of new contracts. Company restructuring also took place. For further detalis see pages 39-51 at the chapter Business Performance.
CONSOLIDATION PROCESS
Non-financial information reporting includes all companies in which Ferrovial has economic control, construed as a stake of greater than 50% in them. In these cases, 100% of the information is reported.
Likewise, following the indications of the GRI G4 Guidelines, Ferrovial provides information on the indicators and material aspects "outside the organization" so long as the data are of sufficient quality and always separately. Ferrovial considers that the most significant impacts are those relating to the 407 ETR toll road in Canada and the airports in the United Kingdom.
TRACEABILITY
Ferrovial guarantees the traceability of information related to the field of Corporate Responsibility thanks to a reporting system, which it has had since 2007, to obtain detailed information to company level, facilitating partial consolidation by geographical location or business. Each year, before the launch of the information collection campaign, the system is fully revised to adapt it to the needs of the company and its stakeholders.
In 2017, the reporting system made it possible to gather 391 quantitative and qualitative indicators, in 116 companies, through 202 users.
REFORMULATION OF THE INFORMATION
In 2017 there were a number of company perimeter changes that could affect the comparability of data contained in the Report, although they are not particularly relevant. To guarantee the maximum transparency and comparability of the data, the body of the report indicates when an indicator from previous years has been modified or presents significant changes that affect the comparability of information.

APPENDIX A

STAKEHOLDERS
Ferrovial is committed to transparency in the information reported to the market and thus implements continuous improvements to its communication channels with all stakeholders on the basis of innovative corporate information that not only includes financial aspects but also considers environmental and social variables.
The company considers stakeholders to be any individuals or social groups with a legitimate interest and who are affected by the company's current or future activities. This definition includes both stakeholders that form part of the company's value chain (shareholders, employees, investors, clients and suppliers) who are considered partners in the development of businesses, and external stakeholders (governments and public authorities, the media, analysts, the business sector, labor unions, the third sector and society in general), starting with the local communities in which the company operates.
This relationship is dynamic, because the climate in which the company operates is changing more rapidly than ever. Ferrovial's business is highly dependent on relationships with the public authorities of the countries in which it operates. Ferrovial holds decision-making positions in organizations that boost corporate responsibility in Spain and abroad, such as Fundación SERES, Forética, the Spanish Global Compact Network, and the Spanish Quality Association (AEC). In 2017, Ferrovial formed part of the United Nations SDG Fund Advisory Group to promote the new UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as holding the chair of the Spanish Green Growth Group. Its relations with each stakeholder group are detailed in www.ferrovial.com
Ferrovial's consideration of the principles related to the content of the report is developed in the specific section on materiality. For more information on the AA1000 and GRI standards, see page 122 of GRI indicators.
MATERIAL ISSUES
Ferrovial considers relevant any issue that could have a substantial influence on the evaluations and decisions of stakeholders, affecting its ability to address existing needs without compromising future generations.
The company has established a biennial process to carry out its materiality study. In 2017, the issues that were most relevant for the company and its stakeholders during the year were analyzed, using the base of the previous year. As a result, the report offers a balanced and objective view of the issues that, by their nature, have significantly affected the company.

2017 MANAGEMENT REPORT. FERROVIAL S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

ALIGNMENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFDI) AND THE CLIMATE DISCLOSURE STANDARDS BOARD (CDSB)

ROver the course of the Integrated Annual Report, explanation
are provided as to how the customer addresses aspects such as Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Indicators and Objectives. All these aspects are influenced by Climate Change. However, emphasizing and providing more details about the Risks and Opportunities with regards to Climate Change and the evolution of emissions has been considered appropriate.
Strategy
Company's climate strategy is integrated into the company's strategy. In fact, the emerging policy related to Climate Change and the mobilization of the economy toward a low emission economy is directing investment and financing towards businesses that help meet the mitigation and adaptation objectives of the Paris Agreement.
These factors are the pillars of business and new business opportunities. New lines of business that provide low carbon solutions that help our clients and users to reduce energy consumption and emissions of the products and services offered by the company have assumed greater relevance in recent years.
In this sense, aspects such as energy efficiency in buildings and processes, the integral management of cities, efficient mobility of people, water management and the conservation of biodiversity make Ferrovial an excellent strategic partner to achieve global environmental objectives.
The current commitment with the SBTi initiative to establish reduction targets by 2030 will require a revision of our 2020 2030 strategy next year.
Climate Change-related Risks and Opportunities
To analyze the impact that Climate Change has on the business targets, Ferrovial carried out an internal project called "Ferrovial 2020" to identify and evaluate risks and business opportunities related to climate change and the new associated regulatory framework.The risk assessment is carried out based on its potential impact on business targets, financial, reputational and sustainability, and their probability of occurrence. From this review and analysis project, the company set the global reduction targets for 2020, as well as the strategic path to achieve them.

 Regulatory: risk of non-compliance with the regulatory framework applicable to the company's activities.
 Financial: Economic impact of the new regulation on climate change, due to the increase in operating costs as a result of the increase in rates on fossil fuels and the appearance of new markets for emission rights. Implementation of energy efficiency measures and the electrification of demand reduce exposure to this risk. In terms of the potential financial impact on the different climate scenarios, it is considered that the diversification of our activities toward "low carbon" activities will make it easier to attract new sources of financing.
 Operational: Catastrophic events derived from weather changes that may cause damage to the company's infrastructure and operation, causing temporary loss of income.
 Reputational: Loss of credibility due to the non-compliance of the objectives established and communicated to the stakeholders.

Management and reduction measures are associated with all risks.

Furthermore, a methodology has been developed to assess the price of carbon shadow pricing, used in the process to analyze and authorize new acquisitions and investments, making it possible to identify and evaluate the risks and opportunities associated with new investment projects.

Ferrovial's new business opportunities place a focus on a low-emission economy and adapting infrastructures to the impact of climate change, as mentioned in the Strategy section. Opportunities arise to respond to:

 The needs of cities. Cities represent a big management challenge that will require innovative and efficient solutions. Ferrovial is implementing service business models that help to reduce energy consumption, emissions and offer large-scale management savings. In 2017, a car sharing service was launched in Madrid with an initial fleet of 500 electric vehicles, fully charged with renewable energy. Energy efficiency agreements in buildings or lighting, optimization of waste collection routes, valuing or increasing the collection of biogas from landfills are all examples.
 Water. Problems relating to the quality and quantity (surplus and shortage) of water and the investment required to respond to these problems will gain more weight. In this regard, we can provide innovative solutions as water treatment plant managers and as a construction company to adapt infrastructures and make them more resistant.
 Infrastructures. There is a growing demand to reduce transport emissions. In the US, Ferrovial operates the first "carbon neutral" highway (NTE) given its dynamic management of traffic and Heathrow Airport is committed to being a "Zero Carbon Airport" by 2050.

The identified risks are classified into groups according to their nature in order to facilitate their control, monitoring and assurance. Thus, the main groups are:

Toll roads
In 2017, the absolute emissions from toll roads decreased by 35.66% since the baseline year, despite 48.1% increase in activity. These results are reflected in the evolution of intensity emissions

APPENDIX A

(tCO2eq / M ), which dropped to 56.56% in 2017 compared to the base year, reflecting the decoupling between growth and emissions. These data are the result of energy efficiency measures in lighting highways, the main source of consumption.
Services (Ferrovial Services, Amey and Broadspectrum)
In 2017, Services dropped by 15.29% in absolute terms and 45.39% in intensity, also showing the decoupling between emissions and growth. This evolution is the result of the imple-

mentation of energy efficiency measures, the increase in the fleet of electric or alternative vehicles, the purchase of electricity from renewable sources and the increase in the collection of diffuse landfill emissions. The main cause of the increase in emissions compared to 2016 is the increase in waste received in landfills, as a consequence of the greater economic activity and repair works to some cells, which made it impossible to capture all the expected biogas.
Construction (Ferrovial-Agromán, Budimex, Webber, Cadagua and PWL)
In Construction,the emissions increase annually in line with the turnover.In 2017,emissions increased by 5.16% compared to 2016. However, a decoupling between emissions and turnover has been detected.

G4-12. DESCRIBE THE ORGANIZATION'S SUPPLY CHAIN
Due to the diverse nature of Ferrovial's activities, the supply chains are different for each. Around 97% of suppliers are concentrated in Construction and Services, registering the largest volumes of orders. The Global Purchase Committee, composed of the highest representatives of business purchases, coordinates this activity, looking for possible synergies and sharing best practices.
In the Construction area, the vast majority of purchases are destined for works in progress at any time. A small part goes to the offices, departments and services that support the execution of the same. The supply chain is made up of suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and subcontractors. The specific characteristics of the construction supply chain are: high number of suppliers; degree of significant subcontracting, which varies depending on the type and size of the work and the country in which it is carried out; high percentage of local suppliers, since the sector is closely linked to the country / area in which each work is executed; very diverse supplier typology, from large multinationals with global implantation and highly technified, to small local suppliers (mainly subcontractors) for less qualified jobs; and need to adapt to the requirements of each local market.
In the Services business, the supply chain includes all the main and secondary suppliers (suppliers of raw materials, industrial supplies or energy, suppliers of capital goods, machinery and finished product) as well as the subcontractors and service providers involved in the company's activities, evaluating them to ensure adequate training. In Spain, from the Procurement and Fleet department, guidelines are drawn up for the different business areas regarding contracting with third parties and all the critical suppliers involved in the provision of services and supply of products for the company are managed. In the international part, each country has its procurement procedure, based on the Global Procurement Procedure defined by the Global Procurement Committee. In the United Kingdom, the typology of the supply chain is very diverse due to the wide range of activities that are carried out.

G4-EN17. OTHER INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS (SCOPE 3)
Below are the activities, products and services subject to scope 3 calculations:
· Purchased goods and services: Includes emissions related to the life cycle of materials bought by Ferrovial that have been used in products or services offered by the company. This includes emissions derived from the purchase of paper, wood, water and other significant materials (concrete and asphalt). · Capital goods: Includes all upstream emissions (i.e. cradle-to-gate) from the production of capital goods bought or acquired by the company in the year, according to information included Consolidated Financial Statements. Fuel and energy related activities: This section includes the energy required for producing the fuel and electricity consumed by the company and electricity lost during transport. · Upstream transportation and distribution: Includes emissions from the transport and distribution of the main products acquired over the year. · Waste generated in operations: Emissions under this heading are linked to waste generated by the company's activities reported in 2017. · Business travel: Includes emissions associated with business travel: train, plane and taxi, reported by the main travel agency that the group works with in Spain. · Employee commuting: This includes emissions from journeys made by employees commuting from their homes to central offices in Spain. · Investments:This calculates emissions linked to investments in British airports. Data for 2017 is not available as of the report release date, and therefore emission figures for 2016 are used. · Use of sold products: Ferrovial calculates emissions generated by use of land transport infrastructure managed by Cintra. · End of life treatment of sold products: This category includes emissions from the elimination of waste generated at the end of the useful lives of products sold by Ferrovial in the reporting year. Only emissions derived from products reported in the "purchased goods and services" category are taken into account. · Upstream leased assets: Includes emissions related to the consumption of electricity at client buildings where maintenance and cleaning services, as well as consumption anagement, are provided by Amey.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

Translation of consolidated financial statements originally issued in Spanish and prepared in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain (see Notes 1.1 and 7.1). In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.
F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2017

SECTION 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

This section presents the information considered important to know prior to reading the consolidated financial statements of Ferrovial.
Basis of presentation and new accounting standards
The consolidated financial statements of Ferrovial were prepared in accordance with the IFRSs adopted by the European Union. The accounting policies applied are disclosed in Note 1.3 of this section.
In 2017 the change in accounting policies with the greatest impact was the early adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Although this standard is not mandatorily applicable until 2018, the Company decided to apply it in 2017. The most noteworthy impacts relate to the definition of distinct performance obligations in long-term services contracts and the allocation of a price to each obligation; the change in the method for recognising revenue from contract modifications and transactions subject to variable consideration; and the establishment of a consistent revenue recognition method for contracts with similar characteristics. This change in standards gave rise to an impact of EUR -272 million on equity attributable to the Parent (Note 1.3.1 contains a more in-depth explanation of the impacts of application of IFRS 15). In addition, an analysis is provided of the possible impact of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and IFRS 16, Leases.
Company activities
The disclosures presented in these consolidated financial statements include most notably, due to their importance, those relating to the distinction between infrastructure project companies and noninfrastructure project companies (see Note 1.1.2 for a definition). Also noteworthy are the disclosures relating to two of the Group's main assets, the 25% ownership interest in Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH), the company that owns Heathrow Airport, and the 43.23% ownership

interest in the concession operator of the ETR 407 toll road in Toronto (Canada).
Changes in the scope of consolidation and assets and liabilities held for sale:
Note 1.1.3 provides detailed information on the main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2017, including primarily the partial sale of the investment in the Portuguese toll roads Norte Litoral and Autoestrada do Algarve, which are now accounted for using the equity method.
Use of judgements and estimates
This section includes the main estimates made by Ferrovial when measuring its assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations (see Note 1.3.4).
Exchange rates
Although Ferrovial's functional currency is the euro, a significant portion of its activities is carried on in countries outside the eurozone, its exposure including most notably that to the pound sterling, the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty. The evolution of these currencies vis-à-vis the euro is shown in Note 1.4.
The main changes in the closing exchange rates for 2017 were the depreciation of the US dollar (-14%) and that of the Canadian dollar (6%). The Australian dollar, the Chilean peso and the pound sterling also underwent significant declines in value, whereas the Polish zloty performed positively. The impact recognised in equity attributable to the Parent was EUR -318 million (see Note 5.1.1, Changes in equity).

1.1. Basis of presentation, Company activities, scope of consolidation and adjustment
1.1.1. Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group and, accordingly, present fairly the Group's equity, financial position and results. The regulatory framework consists of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as established by Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002.
1.1.2. Company activities
Ferrovial comprises the Parent, Ferrovial, S.A., and its subsidiaries, which are detailed in Appendix II. Its registered office is in Madrid, at calle Príncipe de Vergara 135.

Through these companies, Ferrovial engages in the following lines of business, which are its reporting segments pursuant to IFRS 8:
· Construction: design and performance of all manner of public and private works, including most notably the construction of public infrastructure.
· Services: maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure, facilities and buildings; waste collection and treatment; maintenance of energy and industrial facilities and rendering of other kinds of public services.
· Toll roads: development, financing and operation of toll roads.
· Airports: development, financing and operation of airports.
For a more detailed description of the various areas of activity in which the consolidated Group conducts its business operations, please consult the Group's website: www.ferrovial.com.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  145

For the purpose of understanding these consolidated financial statements, it should be noted that a part of the activity carried on by the Group's business divisions consists of the performance of infrastructure projects, primarily in the toll road and airport areas, but also in the construction and services fields.
These projects are conducted through long-term arrangements with public authorities under which the concession operator, in which the Group generally has an ownership interest together with other shareholders, finances the construction or upgrade of public infrastructure, mainly with borrowings secured by the cash flows from the project and with the shareholders' capital contributions, and subsequently maintains the infrastructure. The investment is recovered by means of the collection of tolls or regulated charges for the use of the infrastructure or through amounts paid by the grantor public authority based on the availability for use of the related asset. In most cases the construction and subsequent maintenance of the infrastructure is subcontracted by the concession operators to the Group's Construction and Services Divisions.
From the accounting standpoint, most of these arrangements fall within the scope of application of IFRIC 12.
Accordingly, and in order to aid understanding of the Group inancial performance, these consolidated financial statements present the
intangible asset model is applied and those to which the financial asset model is applied), in non-current financial assets and, mainly, in the net cash position and the cash flow disclosures, in which the cash flows called
the Construction and Services businesses, the dividends from the capital invested in infrastructure projects and investments in or divestments of the share capital of these projects, are presented separately from the cash flows of the infrastructure projects, which include the flows generated by the related concession operators. In addition, a list of the companies regarded as infrastructure project companies can be consulted in Appendix II.
It is also important to highlight that two of the Group's main assets are its 25% ownership interest in Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH), the company that owns Heathrow Airport in London (UK), and its 43.23% ownership interest in ETR 407, the concession operator of the ETR 407 toll road in Toronto (Canada), which have been accounted for using the equity method since 2011 and 2010, respectively. In order to provide detailed information on the two companies, Note 3.5 on investments in companies accounted for using the equity method includes information relating to the changes in the two companies' balance sheets and statements of profit or loss, and this information is completed in other Notes with data considered to be of interest.
1.1.3. Changes in the scope of consolidation
Set forth below is a description of the most significant changes in the scope of consolidation in 2017. The information was prepared taking into account IFRS 3, and the other disclosures required by the standard that do not appear in this Note are included in the Note on goodwill arising on consolidation (see Note 3.1).

Toll roads
Sale of Portuguese toll roads Norte-Litoral and Autoestrada do Algarve
In 2017 the two agreements for the sale of the Portuguese toll roads were completed. On the one hand, the Norte-Litoral agreement, whereby Ferrovial reduced its ownership interest to 49%. Following the review of the shareholders agreement entered into and the conclusion that control has been lost, this ownership interest has been accounted for using the equity method since the date of the sale (21 April). The sale price of the transaction amounted to EUR 104 million and the transaction gave rise to a net gain of EUR 56 million (see Note 2.5).
Also, on 26 September 2017, 49% of Autoestrada do Algarve was definitively sold, after which the ownership interest in this toll road stood at 48%. As was the case with Norte-Litoral, control was lost and, therefore, this investment is now accounted for using the equity method. The sale price of this transaction amounted to EUR 58 million, giving rise to a net gain of EUR 42 million (see Note 2.5).
Acquisition of 6.3% of NTE and 3.6% of LBJ
On 2 August 2017, the agreement was executed for the acquisition of 6.3% and 3.6% of the US toll roads NTE Mobility Partners, LLC and LBJ Infrastructure Group Holding, LLC, respectively. Following the transaction, Ferrovial held ownership interests of 62.9% in NTE and 54.6% in LBJ. The total payment made to complete the two transactions was USD 107 million (approximately EUR 94 million). The transaction had an impact of EUR -68 million on reserves of the Parent and EUR -27 million on non-controlling interests (see Note 5.1.1).
Sale of 10% of Zero Bypass (Slovakia)
In July 2017 the sale of 10% of the Slovakian toll road Zero Bypass took place, for EUR 3 thousand, reducing the ownership interest held to 35%. The net loss on the transaction was EUR -0.1 million. This company continues to be accounted for using the equity method, as it was in 2016.
Award of Outer Suburban Arterial Roads (OSARs) contract (Australia)
In November 2017 Ferrovial, through the Netflow joint venture formed with the Australian company Plenary, was awarded the contract for the construction, financing and maintenance of the upgrades to the road network in western Melbourne (Australia), with a value of AUD 1,800 million (approximately EUR 1,150 million). The concession has a term of 20 years from completion of the construction work.
The project financing is made up 60% of senior bonds issued through a US private placement and 40% of bank borrowings. The equity financing is provided by the Netflow consortium (50% Cintra and 50% Plenary), in line with its goals to invest in, develop and manage major concession projects. At 31 December 2017, no capital disbursement had been made. The company will be accounted for using the equity method.
Services
Acquisition of Trans-Formers Group and Grupo Maviva
In June 2017 the Services Division, through the subsidiary FBSerwis, completed the purchase of all the shares of the Polish company, which engages in waste collection and treatment. The value of the transaction amounted to PLN 129 million (approximately EUR 31 million). The agreement encompasses the acquisition of the following

companies: Trans-Formers Group, Trans-Formers Wroclaw and Trans-Formers Karpatia.
At 31 December 2017, seven months of Trans-Formers Group's results were included in the consolidated financial statements of the Ferrovial Group; its sales amounted to EUR 16 million (EUR 27 million for 2017 as a whole) and it contributed a net profit of EUR 2 million (EUR 4 million for 2017 as a whole).
Also, in July 2017 Ferrovial Servicios acquired, for EUR 18 million, all the shares of Grupo Maviva, a company specialising in high value-added logistics operations, quality control and pre-assembly of components for the automotive industry. Its sales volume amounted to EUR 10 million (EUR 24 million for 2017 as a whole) and its net profit in both cases was EUR 0 million.

share capital) were sold, with no impact on the consolidated statement of profit or loss because a controlling interest is still held in the company (55.1%). The cash impact of the transaction amounted to EUR 59 million (PLN 252 million). The difference between the price of the transaction and the carrying amount of the ownership interest sold (EUR 48 million) was recognised as reserves attributable to non-controlling interests.
Airports
Award of Denver Great Hall contract
In August 2017 the agreement for the redevelopment and commercial operation of the Jeppesen Terminal at Denver International Airport was entered into between the Great Hall Partners consortium, led by Ferrovial Aeropuertos, and the City and County of Denver. The concession operator under the contract is Denver Great Hall LLC, which is 80% owned by Ferrovial and is fully consolidated.
This project is a 34-year administrative concession arrangement, and is accounted for using the financial asset model under IFRIC 12.
The financial close was reached in December 2017. The total investment will be financed through a combination of payments by Denver City and County government, capital commitments made by the consortium partners (USD 68 million) and a USD 189 million bond issue.
The construction and redevelopment work will be carried out by Ferrovial Agroman (70%) and Saunders Construction at a cost of USD 650 million.
1.1.4. Adjustment of the comparable consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016
As discussed in Note 3.1, Goodwill, the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016 has been adjusted, although this did not have any material impacts on the other financial statements. The allocation of the purchase price of Broadspectrum includes the impact of new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date relating to the duration of the existing contracts and the probability of renewal. The aforementioned adjustment was made within twelve months from the acquisition date, as required by IFRS 3.45.

The adjustment resulted in the recognition of a reduction of EUR -15 million in goodwill, with a EUR 41 million increase in intangible assets, an increase of EUR 13 in provisions and impacts on other line items (receivables/payables) amounting to EUR -7 million, as well as the related deferred tax liabilities of EUR -6 million.
1.2. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
In 2017 the agreement initiated in 2016 for the sale of the Portuguese toll roads Norte Litoral (51%) and Autoestrada do Algarve (49%), for a total price of EUR 162 million, was completed. The two transactions gave rise to a net gain of EUR 98 million. Following the sale of these holdings, non-controlling interests of 49% and 48%, respectively, have been retained.

1.3 Accounting policies

1.3.1. New accounting standards

1.3.1.a) Early application of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Although the new standard is not mandatorily applicable until 1 January 2018, as stated in the consolidated financial statements for 2016, Ferrovial decided, making use of the option included in IFRS 15, to early apply the standard effective 1 January 2017. As a result of this decision, Ferrovial has changed its accounting policies and updated its internal processes and controls relating to revenue recognition.

IFRS 15 was applied retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard as an adjustment to the opening balances for 2017 of the consolidated statement of financial position, calculated only for those contracts that were not completed contracts at 1 January 2017. Therefore, the comparative information for 2016 was not restated and continues to be presented in accordance with IAS 11 and IAS 18.

The impact, by line item, on the consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2017 was as follows:

The main impact of the application of this new standard was to reduce the equity attributable to shareholders by EUR -272 million, the main balancing entries being a reduction of EUR -304 million in the balance of trade and other receivables, basically amounts to be billed for work performed, and the tax effect of these adjustments, which was recognised for EUR 60 million in deferred taxes.

The main changes in accounting policies giving rise to these impacts relate mainly to the following three issues:

(i) Definition of distinct performance obligations in long-term services contracts and allocation of a price to each obligation. This relates mainly to long-term contracts (more than ten years) in the Services Division in which Ferrovial carries out various different activities throughout the life of the infrastructure (Capex, Opex and Lifecycle). Under the previous standards, these contracts were regarded as having a single performance obligation, the outcome of which was recognised by reference to the overall revenue from the contract. Under the new standard, unlike the above-mentioned criterion, several performance obligations are recognised (IFRS 15.27), to which the prices established in the contract, provided they are deemed to be market prices, are allocated (IFRS 15.73-80). The effect of this new criterion is to delay the recognition of revenue, insofar as the expected margin on the performance obligations already satisfied is generally lower than that forecast for the contract as a whole. The negative impact of this adjustment on equity attributable to the shareholders amounted to EUR 70 million.
(ii) Change in the method of recognising revenue from contract modifications and transactions subject to variable consideration. In the case of revenue arising from contract modifications, IFRS 15 requires customer approval (IFRS 15.18), a stricter criterion than the probability requirement in the current standards (IAS 11.13 and IAS 18.18).
In the case of transactions subject to variable consideration, the new standard establishes that revenue from the transaction is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved (IFRS 15.56-58). The transactions subject to variable consideration include most notably revenue from claims submitted to customers and contractual incentive payments, which were recognised using a probability criterion under the previous standard (IAS 11.14 and 15). This change gives rise to a delay in the recognition of revenue as the new standard establishes stricter criteria.
The negative impact on equity attributable to the shareholders in this connection amounted to EUR 168 million.
(iii) Establishment of a consistent revenue recognition method for contracts with similar characteristics. The new standard requires a consistent revenue recognition method to be used for contracts and performance obligations with similar characteristics (IFRS 15.40). The Group has chosen the output method for measuring the value of assets or services for which control is transferred to the customer over time, provided that the progress of the work performed can be measured on the basis of the contract and during its performance (IFRS 15.B17). In contracts to provide different highly interrelated goods or services in order to produce a combined output, which is habitually the case in contracts with a construction component, the applicable output method is that of surveys of performance completed to date, according to which the revenue recognised corresponds to the units of work performed, based on the price allocated thereto. Also, in routine service contracts in which the goods or services are substantially the same and are transferred with the same pattern of consumption, in such a way that the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the goods or services as the entity provides them, the method selected by the Group to recognise
recognised on an accrual basis. On the basis of the foregoing, the input method (based on resources consumed) will only be used when the progress of the work cannot be measured reliably by an output method. Application of this rule gives rise to a change of recognition method for certain contracts, and the negative impact on equity attributable to the shareholders is EUR 34 million.

148  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

1.3.1.b) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union mandatorily applicable for the first time in 2017
On 1 January 2017, the following standards which might have an impact on the consolidated financial statements came into force in the European Union: Amendments to IAS 7, Disclosure Initiative, Annual Improvements to IFRSs, 2014-2016 Cycle and Amendments to IAS 12, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses. With regard to IAS 7, a new disclosure has been added to Note 5.2, Consolidated net debt, including a reconciliation of net debt to the financing cash flows shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows; this reconciliation is only provided for the current year, since the amendment does not require disclosure of comparative information for the period preceding the date of adoption. No significant impact on the Group statements has been identified as a result of the amendments to IAS 12.
1.3.1.c) New standards, amendments and interpretations mandatorily applicable in annual reporting periods subsequent to 2017:
The new standards, amendments and interpretations approved by the IASB but not mandatorily applicable at 31 December 2017 that might have an effect on the Group are as follows:
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments:
The impacts identified are less important than those of IFRS 15, since the entities most affected by IFRS 9 are financial institutions. The mandatory application date is 1 January 2018.
Set forth below is a summary of the main impacts, following an analysis of the three phases of the standard:
i) Hedge accounting. The standard attempts to align hedge accounting more closely with risk management, and the new requirements establish a principle-based approach. IFRS 9 generally permits the designation of specific components of non-financial items and of financial instruments as hedged items, provided that they are separately identifiable and reliably measurable and that there is a liquid market for the items concerned (IFRS 9 B.6.3.8 et seq), and, in certain cases, it specifically permits the hedging of the inflation component of certain financial instruments (IFRS 9 B6.3.13 to 6.3.15). In this connection, the Group has identified as a possible impact that relating to the index-linked derivatives arranged at HAH, which, as indicated above, could meet the requirements for hedge accounting from 2018 onwards. The analysis of this impact has not yet been completed. The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 must be applied prospectively and, therefore, there will be no adjustment on initial application and the impact of adopting this standard will be disclosed in the Group's consolidated financial statements for 2018. This impact will depend both on the financial instruments held in 2018, on the changes in the economic conditions affecting the valuation of those instruments, and on the specific results relating to the effectiveness of the future hedging relationships and, therefore, at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, it cannot be estimated reliably.
ii) Impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model of IAS 39 with a model based on expected credit losses. Under the new standard, the loss allowance for a financial instrument will be calculated at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, or lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in the credit risk on the instrument. The Group

intends to avail itself of the simplified approach (measuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses) for its accounts receivable relating to contracts with customers. To this end, in order to implement this approach the Group has established a procedure which not only provides for the write-down of accounts receivable when they are no longer recoverable (incurred losses), but also takes into consideration possible expected losses, based on the evolution of the specific credit risk of the customer, its industry and its country. The estimated negative impact on equity attributable to the shareholders as a result of the impairment of financial assets amounts to EUR 10 million.
iii) Classification and measurement of financial assets. A new classification is introduced that reflects the business model within which financial assets are held by the company. No significant impacts are expected to arise as a result of this new classification. The only potential impact for the Group relates to equity instruments, which by defect must be measured at fair value through profit or loss, since at initial recognition it may elect to present subsequent changes in the fair value of these instruments in other comprehensive income. This election is irrevocable and is made for each asset on an individual basis. Assets of this kind amounted to EUR 34 million at 31 December 2017. With regard to financial liabilities, IFRS 9 does not introduce any changes with respect to IAS 39, except for the change in the treatment of renegotiations of financial liabilities that did not result in the derecognition of those liabilities. Nevertheless, no significant impact is expected, since most of the Group's financial assets and liabilities will continue to be measured at amortised cost.
IFRS 16, Leases:
The analysis of the impact of IFRS 16 is at an earlier stage than that of the aforementioned standards. IFRS 16 is mandatorily applicable in 2019 and the Group does not intend to apply the standard early.
The impact is no different to that at other companies, where the amounts in the statement of financial position will be increased due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and financial liabilities for future payment obligations relating to leases classified to date as operating leases. The Group expects to adopt the recognition exemptions permitted for short-term leases (less than twelve months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The detail of operating leases is included in Note 6.5.3 to the consolidated financial statements and the related expense amounts to approximately EUR 523 million (detail of commitments under operating leases in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017). In addition, the aforementioned note includes a detail, by maturity and business line, of the amount of the future minimum lease payments for non-cancellable operating leases. From its preliminary analysis of the operating leases at the end of the reporting period, the Group identified EUR 350 million relating to the non-cancellable future minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in each lease considering the type of underlying asset and the country concerned, which could be comparable to the right-of-use asset and the financial liability that would have to be recognised in the statement of financial position. This estimate was made by reference to the lease portfolio and market conditions existing at 31 December 2018, although it could change as a result of variations in the two variables until the standard is effectively applied at 1 January 2019.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  149

None of these standards is expected to have a significant impact for Ferrovial.

1.3.2. Basis of consolidation

In 2017 and 2016 the reporting dates of the separate financial statements of all the companies included in the scope of consolidation were either the same as, or were temporarily brought into line with, that of the Parent.

As indicated above, the consolidated Group applied consolidation criteria in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRSs). In this regard, in order to determine whether it has control, joint control or significant influence over each Group company, the Group reviews whether the shareholding owned is consistent with the voting control held over the company by virtue of the relevant bylaws and shareholder agreements.

Companies over which it is determined that the Group exercises joint control are generally accounted for using the equity method.

In relation to these jointly controlled businesses, apart from the situations in which there are two venturers, each with a 50% ownership interest, the cases requiring a more in-depth analysis are those relating to infrastructure projects in which Ferrovial is the shareholder with the largest ownership interest (less than or equal to 50%) and has the right to propose the Chief Executive Officer or other executives of the investee, while the other shareholders, mainly infrastructure funds, have a direct participation in the Board of Directors. In all these cases, it was concluded that the projects must be accounted for using the equity method because Ferrovial does not have the right to appoint the majority of the Board of Directors of the companies concerned, the Board decisions require a simple or qualified majority in all cases, including for the appointment of the main executives, and, in the event of a stalemate on a given decision, Ferrovial does not have the capacity to break the deadlock on its own. The most noteworthy examples of such cases are the investments in the concession operators of the following toll road projects (showing the respective percentages of ownership in

brackets): I-66 (50%), 407 ETR (43.2%), Slovakia (35%), Toowoomba (40%) and OSARS (50%).

Contracts undertaken through unincorporated temporary joint ventures (UTEs) or similar entities that meet the IFRS 11 requirements to be
rtionately consolidated. In these cases of joint control, the venturers are considered to have direct control over the assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and to have joint and several liability for the obligations, of the venture. Operations of this nature contributed to the consolidated Group assets, profit or loss and sales of EUR 913 million, EUR -19 million and EUR 1,406 million, respectively (EUR 829 million, EUR 55 million and EUR 1,380 million in 2016). Particularly worthy of note due to their materiality (sales representing more than 0.5% of consolidated sales) are the following companies relating to construction projects:

The companies over which Ferrovial, S.A. exercises significant influence or joint control and which do not meet the requirements in IFRS 11 to be

method. A detail of the companies accounted for using this method can be found in Note 3.5. and in Appendix II.

With regard to the companies over which it is considered that the Group has significant influence, it should be noted that certain companies in which an ownership interest of less than 20% is held (directly or indirectly) are accounted for using the equity method, provided that Ferrovial can appoint a member of their Boards of Directors.

Intra-Group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. However, the transactions recognised in the statement of profit or loss in relation to construction contracts performed by the Construction Division for infrastructure project concession operators are not eliminated on consolidation, since contracts of this kind are treated as construction contracts under which the Group performs work for the concession grantor or regulator in exchange for the right to operate the infrastructure under the terms pre-established by the grantor or regulator. The grantor or regulator thus controls the asset from inception and grants the above-mentioned right in exchange for the work performed, and, therefore, the conclusion may be reached that at Group level the work has been performed for third parties. This is in line with IFRIC 12. The non-elimination of these transactions had an impact of EUR 18 million on the consolidated statement of profit or loss, after

150  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

taxes and non-controlling interests (2016: EUR 35 million). The detail of the transactions not eliminated on the basis of the foregoing is shown in Note 6.8, Related party transactions.

Appendix II contains a list of subsidiaries and associates.

Lastly, in acquisitions or disposals of ownership interests that do not result in a change in control, the non-controlling (minority) interest may be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

The general method applied by the Group shall be that which avoids the

early recognition of gains in the C

-

controlling interest is recognised at its fair value in the case of the sale of

ownership interests for more than their carrying amount or the purchase

of ownership interests for less than their carrying amount. Similarly, the

related losses are recognised in the C

in the case of the

sale of ownership interests for less than their carrying amount or the

purchase of ownership interests for more than their carrying amount.

1.3.3. Accounting policies applied to items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit or loss

Set forth below is a detail of only those accounting policies that were adopted by the consolidated Group in preparing these consolidated financial statements either as an option permitted by IFRSs or, as the case may be, due to the specific nature of the industry in which it operates or the materiality of the policy concerned.

1.3.3.1. Property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets

· Subsequent to initial recognition, the items included u

are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

· The Group uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation

except in the case of certain machinery in the construction business, which is depreciated using the diminishing balance method.

The consolidated companies depreciate their various items of property, plant and equipment basically within the following ranges of years of useful life:

Buildings and other structures Machinery, fixtures and tools Furniture
Transport equipment Other items of property, plant and equipment

YEARS OF USEFUL LIFE 10-50 2-25 2-15 3-20
2-20

1.3.3.2. Investments in infrastructure projects

This line item includes the investments made in infrastructure by infrastructure concession operators within the scope of IFRIC 12 (mainly toll roads), the remuneration for which consists of an unconditional right to receive cash or another asset or the right to collect the related charges based on the level of usage of the public service.

The assets acquired by the concession operator to provide the concession services but which do not form part of the infrastructure (vehicles, furniture, computer hardware, etc.) are not included in this line item because they are not returned to the concession grantor. Assets of this nature are classified
useful life, using a method that reflects the pattern of consumption of their future economic benefits.
IFRIC 12 intangible asset model
All initial investments relating to the infrastructure that is subsequently returned to the grantor, including compulsory purchase costs and borrowing costs capitalised during construction, are amortised on the basis of the expected pattern of consumption applicable in each case (normally forecast vehicle numbers in the case of toll roads) over the term of the concession.
The investments contractually agreed on at the start of the concession on a final and irrevocable basis to be made at a later date during the term of the concession, and provided they are not investments made to upgrade infrastructure, are considered to be initial investments. For investments of this nature, an asset and an initial provision are recognised for the present value of the future investment, applying a discount rate to calculate the present value that is equal to the cost of the borrowings associated with the project. The asset is amortised based on the pattern of consumption over the entire term of the concession and the provision is increased by the related interest cost during the period until the investment is made.
Where a payment is made to the grantor to obtain the right to operate the concession, this amount is also amortised based on the pattern of consumption over the concession term.
A provision is recognised systematically for replacement investments over the period in which the related obligations accrue, and it must be set up in full by the time the replacement becomes operational. The provision is recognised on the basis of the pattern of consumption over the period in which the obligation arises, on a time proportion basis.
Infrastructure upgrade investments are those that increase the infrastructure's capacity to generate revenue or reduce its costs. In the case of investments that will be recovered over the concession term, since the upgrade investments increase the capacity of the infrastructure, they are treated as an extension of the right granted and, therefore, they are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when they come into service. They are amortised as from the date on which they come into service based on the difference in the pattern of consumption arising from the increase in capacity. However, if, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the concession, these investments will not be offset by the possibility of obtaining increased revenue from the date on which they are made, a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the present value of the cash outflow required to settle the obligations related to the investments that will not be offset by the possibility of obtaining increased revenue from the date on which the investments are made. The balancing item is an addition to the acquisition cost of the intangible asset.
In the case of the proportional part of the upgrade or increase in capacity that is expected to be recovered through the generation of increased future revenue, the general accounting treatment used for investments that will be recovered in the concession term will be applied.
The main assumptions used in relation to these arrangements correspond to vehicle number and replacement investment estimates, which are updated each year by technical departments.

IFRIC 12 financial asset model (Note 12)

-

ludes

the service concession arrangements related to infrastructure in which

the consideration consists of an unconditional contractual right to

receive cash or another financial asset, either because the grantor

guarantees to pay the operator specified or determinable amounts or

because it guarantees to pay the operator the shortfall between

amounts received from users of the public service and specified or

determinable amounts. Therefore, these are concession arrangements

in which demand risk is borne in full by the grantor. In these cases, the

amount due from the grantor is accounted for as a loan or receivable in

assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.

To calculate the amount due from the grantor, the value of the construction, operation and/or maintenance services provided and the interest implicit in arrangements of this nature are taken into consideration.

Revenue from the services (mainly construction and maintenance) provided in each period increases the amount of the related receivables with a credit to sales. The interest on the consideration for the services provided also increases the amount of the receivables with a credit to sales. Amounts received from the grantor reduce the total receivable with a charge to cash.

The aforementioned interest in concession arrangements of this type is classified as revenue, since it forms part of the ordinary concession activity and is earned on a regular and periodic basis.

At 31 December 2017, the interest recognised as revenue amounted to EUR 153 million (31 December 2016: EUR 189 million). Also, the borrowing costs associated with the financing of concessions to which the financial asset model is applied amounted to EUR 52 million in 2017 (2016: EUR 72 million). The decrease in the two items is due mainly to the Portuguese toll roads Norte Litoral and Algarve, which are now accounted for using the equity method (see Note 1.1.3).

Set forth below is a detail of the main toll road concessions in force to which the financial asset model is applied, showing their duration, their status and the accounting method applied:

1.3.3.3. Other items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit or loss

Cash and cash equivalents of infrastructure project companies: Restricted cash (Note 5.2)
- Infrastructure Projects includes short-term, highly liquid investments assigned to the financing of certain infrastructure projects, the availability of which is restricted under the financing contracts as security for certain obligations relating to the payment of debt principal and interest and to the maintenance and operation of the infrastructure.
Fair value measurement
The Group only uses fair value measurements in the case of derivative financial instruments. In such measurements, the credit risk of the parties to the related agreement is taken into account. The impact of credit risk is recognised in profit or loss, except when the derivatives qualify as effective hedges, in which case it is recognised in reserves. The Group uses appropriate measurement techniques based on the circumstances and on the volume of inputs available for each item, attempting to maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and avoiding the use of unobservable inputs. The Group establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three levels:

· Level 1: quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities.

· Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

· Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

As indicated in Note 5.5, Derivative financial instruments at fair value, all the Group's derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.
Other equity instruments
These relate to perpetual bonds for which payment of the related coupon is at the discretion of the issuer and which do not satisfy the condition to be accounted for as financial liabilities, since they do not include a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or an obligation to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities. Accordingly, they are recognised und

Non-refundable grants related to assets
Non-refundable grants related to assets are recognised at the amount granted under "Deferred Income" (see Note 6.1) in the consolidated statement of financial position, and are taken to profit or loss gradually in proportion to the period depreciation on the assets financed with these grants and are allocated to the same line as those assets under
standpoint, the amount of the grants collected in the year is presented as a reduction of the amount of the investments made.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  153

Trade payables
reverse factoring arrangements with banks.
These balances are classified as trade payables and the payments relating thereto as cash flows from operating activities, since payment is made to the banks under the same terms and conditions as those agreed upon with the supplier, and the company that has the obligation to pay the latter does not obtain from the banks any extension to the due dates agreed with the supplier; the cost of the reverse factoring arrangement is borne by the supplier and no special guarantees have been provided as security for the payments to be made.
1.3.3.4 Revenue recognition
As indicated in Note 1.3.1 on the first-time application of IFRS 15, the Company changed its revenue recognition policies to adapt them to the provisions of this standard, which was applied early effective 1 January 2017. In order to ensure a uniform application across the various business areas, Ferrovial has developed a common policy. Set forth below are specific details of the methods applied as part of this policy, which affect mainly the Construction and Services businesses. Certain specific aspects
are summarised in the last section.
i) General revenue recognition criterion
The first step for revenue recognition purposes is to identify the contracts and the performance obligations contained therein. The number of performance obligations that a contract has will depend on the type of
business segments.
In general, the performance obligations in the Construction and Services businesses that Ferrovial engages in are satisfied over time and not at a specific point in time, since the customer simultaneously receives and
ance as the service is performed.
With respect to the method for recognising revenue over time (i.e. the method for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation), Ferrovial has established certain criteria that are applied consistently for similar performance obligations.
In this regard, the method chosen by the Group to measure the value of goods or services for which control is transferred to the customer over time is the output method; this method is applied provided that the progress of the work performed can be measured on the basis of the contract and during its performance.
In contracts to provide different highly interrelated goods or services in order to produce a combined output, which is habitually the case in contracts with a construction activity, the applicable output method is that of surveys of performance completed to date (or measured unit of work), according to which revenue is recognised corresponding to the units of work performed and on the basis of the price allocated thereto. Under this method, on a regular basis, the units of work completed under each contract are measured and the corresponding output is recognised as revenue. Costs of work or services projects performed are recognised on an accrual basis, and the costs actually incurred in completing the units performed are recognised as an expense, together with those which, even though they are expected to be incurred in the future, have to be allocated to the units of work completed to date.

Also, in routine or recurring service contracts (in which the services are substantially the same), such as maintenance and cleaning services, which are transferred with the same pattern of consumption over time and whose remuneration consists of a recurring fixed amount over the term of the contract (e.g. monthly or annual payment), in such a way that the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the services as the entity provides them, the method selected by the Group to recognise revenue is the time elapsed output method. Under this method, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and costs are recognised on an accrual basis.
Lastly, only in those contracts that are not for routine or recurring services and for which the unitary price of the units to be performed cannot be determined, use of the of the stage of completion measured in terms of the costs incurred (input method) is permitted. Under this method, the entity recognises revenue based on the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the total costs expected to be incurred to complete the work, taking into account the expected margins of the whole project per the latest updated budget. This method involves measuring the proportion of the costs incurred in the work completed to date to the total costs envisaged, and recognising revenue in proportion to total expected revenue. Under this method, the proportion that contract costs incurred bear to the estimated total contract costs is used to determine the revenue to be recognised, by reference to the estimated margin for the entire term of the contract. As indicated above, this method is only applied to complex construction or service contracts with
own the units produced and measure them.
ii) Recognition of revenue from contract modifications, claims and disputes
Contract modifications are defined as changes in the scope of the work, other than changes envisaged in the original contract, that may result in a change in the revenue associated with that contract. Modifications to
approval before billings can be issued and the amounts relating to the additional work can be collected. The Group does not recognise the revenue from such additional work until the customer's approval has been obtained. In cases where the additional work has been approved but the corresponding change in price has not been determined, the requirement described below for variable consideration is applied: namely, to recognise revenue for an amount with respect to which it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The costs associated with these additional units or services performed are recognised when incurred, irrespective of whether or not the modification has been approved.
A claim is a request for payment or compensation from the customer (for example, for compensation, reimbursement of costs, or a legally compulsory inflation review) that is made directly to the customer. The method followed by the Group with respect to claims is to apply the method described above for modifications, when the claims are not covered by the contract, or the method used for variable consideration, when the claims are covered by the contract but need to be quantified.
A dispute is the result of a disconformity or rejection following a claim made to the customer under the contract, the resolution of which is dependent on a procedure conducted directly with the customer or a court or arbitration proceeding. Per the criteria followed by the Group, revenue relating to disputes in which the enforceability of the amount claimed is questioned is not recognised, and previously recognised revenue is derecognised, since the dispute demonstrates the absence of

154  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

questions the price, revenue recognition is based on the criterion applied in cases of variable consideration discussed below.
Only in those cases in which there is a legal report confirming that the rights under dispute are clearly due and enforceable and that, therefore, at least the costs directly associated with the related service will be recovered, may revenue be recognised up to the limit of the amount of the costs incurred.
iii) Variable consideration
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, this amount is recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
iv) Statement of financial position balances relating to revenue recognition
Amounts to be billed for work performed/amounts billed in advance for construction work
Unlike the method used to recognise contract revenue, the amounts billed to the customer are based on achievement of the various milestones established in the contract and on acknowledgement thereof by the customer, which takes the form of a contractual
amounts recognised as revenue for a given year do not necessarily coincide with the amounts billed to or certified by the customer. In the case of contracts in which the goods or services transferred to the customer exceed the related amount billed or certified, the difference
and Servi transferred are lower than the amount billed to or certified by the customer, the difference is recognised (as a contract liability) in a
truction
Bid costs and mobilisation costs
In addition to the aforementioned statement of financial position balances, the Group also recognises assets relating to the costs of obtaining a contract (bid costs) and to the costs incurred to fulfil a contract or setup costs (mobilisation costs) that are directly related to the principal contract, provided they will be recovered through performance of the contract. These balances are presented in a separate account
financial position (see Note 4.1).
Bid costs are only capitalised when they are directly related to a contract and it is probable that they will be recovered in the future and the contract has been awarded to the company or the company has been selected as the preferred bidder. Costs incurred that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are recognised as an expense, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer in any case (whether or not the contract is obtained). The capitalised costs are amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.
Costs required to set up the contract, mobilisation costs, are capitalised provided that it is probable that they will be recovered in the future and

that they do not include expenses that would normally have been incurred by the company if the contract had not been obtained. They are gradually recognised as an expense on the basis of the proportion of actual output to estimated output under each contract. If the above conditions are not met, these costs are taken directly to profit or loss.
v) Provisions relating to contracts with customers
The main provisions relating to contracts with customers are provisions for deferred expenses and for budgeted losses
· Provisions for deferred expenses. These provisions cover the expenses that will foreseeably arise on completion of a contract, such as those for the removal of construction machinery or dismantling costs, as well as the estimated repairs to be carried out within the guarantee period. These provisions relate to a present obligation stipulated in the contract that is based on the fact that in order to settle the obligation there will probably be an outflow of resources from the company the amount of which can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised on the basis of the best possible estimates of the total expenditure required to settle the obligations. They can be determined as a percentage of the total expected revenue from the contract if historical information on similar contracts is available.
The guarantee obligations included in this type of provisions are not considered to be a separate performance obligation unless the customer has the option of arranging the guarantee separately, and, accordingly, they are recognised as indicated in IAS 37 on provisions and contingent assets and liabilities.
· Provisions for budgeted losses. These provisions are recognised as soon as it becomes evident that the total costs expected to be incurred in a contract exceed the total expected revenue from that contract. For the purpose of determining , if appropriate, the amount of the related provision, the criterion established in IAS 37.14 (b) is applied. Thus, the estimate of the total budget for the contract includes the expected revenue that is considered to be probable. This criterion is different from that established in IFRS 15, discussed above in Note 1.3.3.4, Revenue recognition, on the basis of which such revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is deemed to be highly probable. Also, if the total expected profit on a contract is less than that recognised under the aforementioned revenue recognition rules, the difference is recognised as a provision for losses.
vi) Financing component
In general, in order to calculate the price of a performance obligation, an implicit financing component is calculated, in those cases in which the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer will foreseeably pay for that good or service is more than one year. This component is accounted for as finance income.
With respect to performance obligations for which the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service is less than one year, the Group applies the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 15 and does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component.
In those cases in which there is a contractual or legal right to charge latepayment interest owing to the delay in collection with respect to the contractually established periods, such interest is only recognised when it is highly probable that it will actually be collected.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  155

vii) Specific revenue recognition criteria by segment
Construction business
As a general rule, a single performance obligation is identified for construction contracts owing to the high degree of integration and customisation of the various goods and services to provide a combined output that is transferred to the customer over time.
As discussed above, the Group has chosen as its preference the measured unit of work method (output method), which is applied provided that the progress of the work completed can be measured during the performance of the contract and that a price can be allocated to each unit of work.
Only in those contracts for which the unitary price of the units to be performed cannot be determined is it permitted to use the input method (stage of completion measured in terms of costs incurred).
Services business
There is no single contract type in the case of the Services business due to the considerable diversity of the services rendered. In general, the contracts involve various tasks and unit prices and the related revenue is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as the services are provided, based on the time elapsed, i.e. when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the
example in routine or recurring services such as facility management, street cleaning or waste collection services.
Certain contracts include different types of activities that are subject to fixed unit price tables for the services provided and which form part of the contract as a whole. In such contracts the customer requests each of the services by means of a work order, which is considered to be a separate performance obligation, and the associated revenue is recognised depending on the specific requirements established in the contract for the approval of the service.
In the case of complex long-term contracts involving the provision of several services that constitute separate performance obligations (construction, maintenance, operation, etc.), payment for which is made on a periodic basis and in which the price for those performance obligations is indicated in the contract or can be determined, revenue is recognised using the time elapsed method for the recurring services, whereas the stage of completion method is used for those more complex performance obligations for which it is not possible to allocate a price to each of the units of work performed.
Lastly, it should be noted that the revenue from certain contracts that fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 is recognised as described in Note 1.3.3.2.

Toll Road business
The arrangements included in this line of business are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 12, which provides for the classification of the assets assigned to such arrangements on the basis of the intangible asset model and the financial asset model (bifurcated arrangements can also exist) (see Note 1.3.3.2).
The new IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers does not give rise to a change with respect to the revenue recognition method used to date. In the case of concession arrangements accounted for using the intangible asset model, the customer is the user of the infrastructure and, therefore, each use made of the infrastructure by users is considered a performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognised at a point in time. In the case of concession arrangements accounted for using the financial asset model, in which the customer is the concession grantor, revenue recognition depends on the various services provided (e.g. operation or maintenance), which will be accounted for as different performance obligations, to which market prices have to be allocated. In those cases in which a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, it is estimated on the basis of the best possible estimate, using the expected margin for that activity.
Airports business
In general, the services provided in this business are short-term services to customers (airline or airport users) for which regulated revenue is recognised at a point in time; therefore, there are no changes with respect to revenue recognition for this business. It should be noted that the revenue from certain contracts that fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 is recognised as described in Note 1.3.3.2.
Real estate business
The revenue from this business relates mainly to the sale of apartments, commercial premises and garage spaces, and is recognised when the buyer receives legal title to, and takes physical possession of, the asset. Each unit (apartment, etc.) is considered to be a separate performance obligation and the related revenue is recognised when the asset is legally and economically transferred to the buyer; this does not constitute any change in the revenue recognition method currently applied.
Energy distribution business
The contracts in this business involve a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. The monthly rate reflects the value of the services provided. Contracts of this kind have a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time and the related revenue is recognised by applying the output method.

1.3.4. Accounting estimates and judgements
In the consolidated financial statements for 2017 estimates were made to measure certain of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations reported herein. These estimates relate basically to the following:
i) Estimates taken into consideration for the purpose of recognising revenue from contracts with customers (see Note 1.3.3.4), including most notably those associated with:
· determining whether enforceable rights exist, in order to recognise revenue;
· determining whether a contract modification has been approved;
· establishing whether the conditions for recognising revenue for variable consideration are met;
· recognising revenue in relation to a claim or a dispute;
· establishing whether the contract includes one or several performance obligations, and determining the price allocable to each of them;

· defining for each performance obligation the applicable method for recognising revenue over time, taking into account that, based on the accounting policy established by the Company, the preferred

method (schedule of values or based on time elapsed), and the stage of completion measured in terms of the costs incurred input model is applied in those cases in which the services provided are not routine and recurring services and in which the unit price of the units of work to be performed cannot be determined;

· in the case of contracts recognised using the survey of performance completed to date method, measuring the units completed and the price that can be allocated thereto;

·

percentage of

completion method

e costs incurred

relative to total contract costs, and the expected profit margin for

the contract;

· determining whether to capitalise bid costs and mobilisation costs;

· making estimates relating to the calculation of the provision for expected losses and deferred expenses.

ii) The assessment of possible legal contingencies (see Note 6.5, Contingent liabilities, contingent assets, obligations and commitments and Note 6.3, Provisions).
iii) The recognition for accounting purposes of the subordinated guaranteed hybrid bond (see disclosure on equity instruments in Note 5.1.2.).
iv) The estimates for the selection of the accounting method to be applied in relation to the loss of control, as in the case of the Portuguese toll roads (see Note 1.3.2, Basis of consolidation).
v) Estimates regarding the valuation of derivatives and the expected flows associated with them in order to determine the existence of hedging relationships (see Note 5.5, Derivative financial instruments at fair value).
vi) The assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets (see Note 3.1, Goodwill and acquisitions, and Note 3.5, Investments in associates).
vii) Business performance projections that affect the estimates of the recoverability of tax assets (see Note 2.8 on tax matters).
viii) Estimates relating to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the business combinations detailed in Note 1.1.3, Changes in the scope of consolidation.
ix) Estimates taking into account the future vehicle numbers on toll roads for the purpose of preparing financial information for toll roads pursuant to IFRIC 12 (see Note 3.3, Investments in infrastructure projects and Note 6.3, Provisions).
x) The assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of pension and other obligations to employees (see Note 6.2, Pension plan deficit).
xi) The measurement of share award plans (see Note 6.7, Sharebased payment).
Although these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at 31 December 2017 on the events analysed, events that take place in the future might make it necessary to change these estimates. Changes in accounting estimates would be applied prospectively in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8.
1.3.5. Disclosures
It should also be noted that in preparing these consolidated financial statements the Group omitted any information or disclosures which, not requiring disclosure due to their qualitative importance, were considered not to be material in accordance with the concept of materiality defined in the IFRS Conceptual Framework.

(*) A negative change represents a depreciation of the euro against the reference currency and a positive change represents an appreciation.

The main changes in the closing exchange rates vis-à-vis the euro were the depreciation of the pound sterling and the Chilean peso, as well as that of the US dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. By contrast, the Polish zloty appreciated against the euro. The impact in this connection recognised in equity attributable to the Parent was EUR -318 million (see Note 5.1.1, Changes in equity).
Note 5.4 provides an explanation of foreign currency risk management. It also contains an analysis of the impact that Brexit has had or might have in the future vis-à-vis the different financial risks affecting Ferrovial. This perspective is supplemented by a global analysis of Brexit in the Risks section of the directors' report.
In addition, a detail is provided of the exchange rate effect in those notes in which this effect is material.

This section comprises the Notes relating to the profit for the year.
Net profit for the year amounted to EUR 454 million, an improvement of 20.6% on 2016 (EUR 376 million).
This increase is affected by a series of non-recurring results related mainly to divestments, derivatives and taxes, per the following breakdown, and which are explained in more detail in the Notes indicated in the table:

Notwithstanding these non-recurring impacts, revenue grew by 13.5%, due mainly to the inclusion of a whole year of Broadspectrum (compared with seven months in 2016). However, profit from operations was down 7.4% on 2016, due mainly to the worsening of the margin of the Construction business. In like-for-like terms (see definition in the section on alternative performance measures), the aforementioned changes were growth of 7.2% and a fall of -8.6%, respectively (see the directors' report for a detailed explanation of the changes by business division).

The increase in the average number of employees, as in the case of staff costs, is explained by the inclusion of Broadspectrum throughout 2017.

The 22% increase in staff costs in 2017 is related mainly to the acquisition of Broadspectrum, which was included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in every month in 2017, compared to seven months in 2016.

160  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

2.4. Gross profit from operations (EBITDA) and profit from operations before impairment and disposals of non-current assets
EBITDA at December 2017 amounted to EUR 932 million (December 2016: EUR 944 million), representing a decrease of 1.2% with respect to 2016.
The depreciation and amortisation charge for 2017 is EUR 375 million, compared to EUR 342 million in 2016.
Thus, profit from operations before impairment and disposals of noncurrent assets at December 2017 amounted to EUR 557 million (December 2016: EUR 602 million), representing a fall of 7.4% with respect to 2016, due mainly to the worsening of the margin of the Construction business.
The directors' report provides a detailed analysis of the changes in these headings by business.
2.5. Impairment and disposals of non-current assets
The detail of the main gains and losses relating to impairment and disposals is as follows:
Gains and losses recognised in 2017:
The net gains corresponding to impairment and disposals in 2017 amounted to EUR 81 million and relate mainly to the following:
· Gain on the partial disposal of the Portuguese Norte Litoral toll road amounting to EUR 48 million (EUR 56 million in net profit). This impact includes EUR 24 million relating to the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained following loss of control (49.54%). This transaction is described in Note 1.1.3, Changes in the scope of consolidation.
· Gain on the partial disposal of the Portuguese Algarve toll road amounting to EUR 42 million (EUR 42 million in net profit). This impact includes EUR 21 million relating to the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained following loss of control (49%). This transaction is described in Note 1.1.3, Changes in the scope of consolidation.
· Impairment of the goodwill allocated to the Terrasa Manresa toll road (AUTEMA) amounting to EUR -29 million (see Note 3.1.). This amount is taken to income in full as it is not tax deductible.
· Reversal of impairment of EUR 25 million (EUR 17 million in net profit) at the Euroscut Azores toll road concession operator as a result of improvement in the projections for the toll road due to the increase in traffic (see Note 3.3.1).
Recognition of other impairment losses of EUR -10 million (EUR -7 million in net profit), mainly at the Services Division, relating to several waste treatment plants and landfills.

2.6. Financial result

The table below shows the detail of the changes in the financial result from 2016 to 2017. The result of infrastructure projects is presented separately from the result of non-infrastructure project companies (see Note 1.1.2 for the definition) and in each of them a further distinction is made between the financial result on financing -which includes the finance costs on bank borrowings and bonds, and the returns on financial assets and loans granted- and the financial result on derivatives and other items, which includes the impact of the fair value measurement of ineffective hedges and other income and expenses not directly related to financing.

the consolidated statement of profit or loss for a total amount of EUR 35 million (2016: EUR 26 million).

· The financial result on the financing of the infrastructure project companies: amounted to EUR -254 million in 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR -305 million). Of this result, EUR -256 million relate to these costs. The following table shows a detail of these borrowing costs, which include the capitalised costs of toll roads under construction:

Finance costs recognised in profit or loss

2017 -298

-256

2016 -342

-306

The improved financial result on financing is due mainly to the changes in the scope of consolidation in 2016 (sale of the Chicago Skyway toll road and the Irish M3 and M4/M6 toll roads and the filing for Chapter 11 insolvency of the SH-130 toll road); in 2016 these companies contributed a financial result on financing of EUR -36 million. In addition to the above impact, it should be noted that in 2017 partial divestments, with the consequent loss of control, were made of the Portuguese Norte Litoral (April) and Algarve (September) toll roads, as a result of which a finance cost of only EUR -12 million accrued, compared with EUR -22 million in 2016.

· Other financial results of infrastructure projects: include mainly other financial results, which include exchange differences and other results considered to be of a financial nature but not directly related to financing. The change compared to 2016 (EUR 14 million) is due mainly to the impact in 2016 of the result on derivatives (EUR -12 million), most notably Autopista del Sol (EUR -11 million) as a result of the termination of the interest rate swap held by it, as part of the refinancing of its debt, which did not take place in 2017.

· The financial result on financing excluding infrastructure projects in 2017 amounted to EUR -29 million (31 December 2016: EUR -49 million), corresponding to borrowing costs (EUR -83 million) net of the interest obtained mainly from financial investments (EUR 54 million). The improvement compared with 2016 is due mainly to the higher returns on available cash than in 2016 (larger position in Canadian

dollars, which is remunerated at better rates than the eurozone) and the reduction of debt in 2017 (mainly the repayment of the High Yield Bonds at Broadspectrum in April 2017 for AUD 325 million -EUR 243 million-), the net amount of the cross-currency swap.

· Other financial results excluding infrastructure projects include the impact of derivatives and other fair value adjustments relating mainly to the impact of the derivatives not designated as hedges, including most notably Canadian dollar-denominated options amounting to EUR 22 million, aimed at hedging the cash balances the Group holds in that currency, and the equity swaps arranged by the Group to hedge the impact on equity of share-based variable remuneration schemes (see Note 6.7) with a positive impact in 2017 of EUR 5 million due to the positive performance of the share price in 2017.

Excluding the impact of derivatives, the detail of other financial results excluding infrastructure projects is as follows:

pension plans and interest on tax assessments. The other items in 2017

include basically the impact of EUR -15 million relating to the

repayment of the High Yield Bonds at Broadspectrum (see Note 5.2.2).

These borrowings bore very high finance costs (8.38%) and, therefore,

the repayment

infrastructure project finance costs.

The same line item also includes the costs relating to the penalty incurred for the delay in delivering a waste treatment plant in the UK (EUR -10 million), which was calculated as a specific rate of interest on the amount of the borrowings of the concession operator.

· Impact on cash flows: As can be observed in the following table, the difference between the financial result on financing and the interest cash flows reported in the statement of cash flows is EUR -90 million.

as a result of which the interest is added to the principal and does not represent a cash outflow in the year (EUR -83 million).

2.7. Share of profits of companies accounted for using the equity method

The share of the net profit of companies accounted for using the equity method in 2017 amounted to EUR 251 million (2016: EUR 82 million). The detail of the most significant companies is as follows:

In 2017 HAH's results include most notably non-recurring impacts totalling EUR 48 million, due to the effect of fair value adjustments, relating mainly to the measurement of index-linked derivatives (EUR 33 million). The difference compared to 2016 is because HAH's loss for 2016 included non-recurring losses of EUR -105 million relating to derivatives and taxes.

Note 3.5 provides greater detail on the results of these companies.

2.8. Income tax and deferred taxes

2.8.1. Explanation of the income tax expense for the year and the applicable tax rate

The income tax expense for 2017 amounted to EUR 71 million (2016: EUR 233 million), a figure which:

· Does not include the income tax expense relating to the companies accounted for using the equity method (see Notes 2.7 and 3.5), since, in
accordance with accounting legislation, their results are presented net of the related tax effect.

· Includes income tax benefit amounting to EUR 17 million relating to prior years' income tax, mainly as a result of the reduction in the US tax
rate from 35% to 21% (EUR 31 million) and other regularizations (EUR -14 million).

Excluding the result of these companies accounted for using the equity method (profit after tax of EUR 251 million), permanent differences (EUR -32 million), results arising from consolidation with no tax impact ((EUR 4 million) and taking into consideration the income tax expense incurred in 2017 (EUR 88 million), the resulting effective income tax rate is 25%, as evidenced in the table below.

This effective tax rate is in line with the rates applicable in the main countries in which Ferrovial has a presence.

(*) This relates to Australia and the activity of Broadspectrum on other Pacific islands. The effective income tax rate of the country is obtained by combining the tax rates of the various countries. (**) "Other Countries" includes mainly the profit generated in Portugal.

Following is an explanation of the various items that must be adjusted in order to calculate the effective tax rate:

Permanent differences. This item relates to period expenses or income which, pursuant to the tax legislation applicable in each of the countries, are not deductible (expenses) or taxable (income) in the year, and are not expected to be deductible or taxable in future years. The cumulative balance in this connection is an expense of EUR 32 million. The detail of the most significant of these adjustments is as follows:

· Gains on the sale of the Portuguese toll roads (EUR 46 million), which are exempt from taxation.

· Losses on specific construction and services projects performed outside Spain that do not give rise to a tax asset (EUR -86 million).

· Recovery for tax purposes, pursuant to Royal Decree 3/2016, of the impairment losses on investments, which increase the taxable profit by
EUR 14 million. The recovery is made within five years, with last year application in 2020.

Results arising from consolidation with no tax impact. This item relates to results derived from accounting consolidation criteria which do not have any tax implications. The cumulative balance in this connection is income of EUR 4 million. The detail of the most significant of these adjustments is as follows:

· Losses of infrastructure project companies in the US in which other companies have ownership interests and which are fully consolidated. The tax asset is recognised solely at Ferrovial's percentage of ownership as these companies are taxed under the pass-through tax rules; the shareholders of these companies are the taxpayers, at the percentage of ownership that they hold therein. The adjustment in this connection amounts to EUR -15 million and relates to the tax asset allocable to the other shareholders.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  163

· Impairment of EUR -29 million of the goodwill of the Autema toll road, with no tax impact (see Note 2.5).

· Gain arising from the revaluation of the ownership interest in the Portuguese toll roads (EUR 45 million), which under current legislation is not subject to taxation.

The changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities include most notably the impact recognised as a result of the early application of IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers (see Note 1.3.1-a), totalling EUR 60 million (net of deferred assets and liabilities).
The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 December 2017 arose mainly from:
a) Tax assets
These relate to tax assets which have not yet been deducted by the Group companies. This item does not include all the existing tax assets, but rather only those that, based on the Group's projections, are expected to be able to be used before they expire. The balance recognised totalled EUR 353 million, of which EUR 298 million related to recognised tax losses and the remainder to unused double taxation, reinvestment and other tax credits totalling EUR 228 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: EUR 207 million), of which EUR 55 million have been recognised.

Spanish consolidated tax group:

The tax loss carryforwards of the consolidated tax group in Spain at 2017 year-end totalled EUR 190 million. For the purpose of ascertaining the recoverability of these assets, a model was designed that takes into account the changes introduced by Royal Decree 3/2016 and uses the Group companies' latest available earnings projections. Based on this model, the Group will recover all the tax loss carryforwards, since profits will be generated on a recurring basis in the projected period, as well as the tax credits already recognised (EUR 41 million), and, accordingly, they have been retained in the consolidated statement of financial position.

US consolidated tax group:

At 31 December 2017, the balance of tax loss carryforwards of the consolidated tax group in the US totalled EUR 82 million, of which EUR 17 million had been recognised in prior years. In a similar fashion to the consolidated tax group in Spain, a model was designed that uses the latest available earnings projections of the US consolidated tax group companies. In line with the approach adopted in previous years, it was decided to not to recognise the full amount of the tax assets since profit is not expected to be reported until 2024 and the projections could vary significantly depending on the new infrastructure projects that may be awarded.

Australian consolidated tax group:

Following the acquisition of Broadspectrum, Ferrovial established a consolidated tax group with all of its Australian companies. The tax losses recognised relate mainly to historical losses incurred by Broadspectrum (EUR 63 million) and the Construction Division (EUR 10 million). As in the foregoing cases, a projections model was prepared in which it is concluded that the group will generate taxable profits on a systematic basis in the coming years. On the basis of this conclusion, a decision was made to continue to recognise the tax losses.

UK:

The new UK tax regime came into effect on 1 April 2017 and gave rise to new regulations with an impact on the UK consolidated tax group. The main changes relate to the limitation of the use of tax loss carryforwards; the possibility of using them to offset 100% of taxable profit of up to GBP 5 million and 50% of the remaining amount of taxable profit, with no time limit and irrespective of whether the losses were generated before or after the entry into force of the reform. Also, tax loss carryforwards can be used by any company in the consolidated tax group. Under the new regime, in 2017 tax losses totalling EUR 8 million were recognised in the UK.

b) Assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the accounting and tax income and expense recognition methods
This item relates to the tax impact resulting from the fact that the timing of recognition of certain expenses or depreciation and amortisation charges is different for accounting and tax purposes.
The recognition of a tax asset in this connection means that certain expenses have been recognised for accounting purposes before their recognition for tax purposes and, therefore, the Company will recover these expenses for tax purposes in future years. Conversely, a liability in this connection represents an expense that is recognised for tax purposes before its recognition for accounting purposes.
The deferred tax assets include most notably:
· Provisions recognised for accounting purposes which do not have a tax effect until they are materialised (EUR 200 million).
· Deferred tax assets of EUR 132 million arising as a result of differences between the tax and accounting methods used to recognise income, mainly in the Construction Division.
· Differences relating to borrowing costs at concession operators in Spain, which for tax purposes are recognised as an asset and subsequently amortised whereas for accounting purposes they are expensed currently (EUR 84 million).
· Accelerated depreciation and amortisation for accounting purposes (EUR 44 million).
Within liabilities, the balance is related mainly to:
· Differences between tax and accounting criteria in relation to the recognition of provisions (EUR 353 million).
· Deferred tax liabilities of EUR 40 million arising as a result of differences between the tax and accounting methods used to recognise income in conformity with IFRIC 12, mainly in the Toll Road Division.
c) Deferred taxes arising from valuation adjustments
This reflects the cumulative tax impact resulting from valuation adjustments recognised in reserves. This impact appears as an asset or liability since there is generally no direct tax effect until this amount in reserves is transferred to profit or loss.
The asset balance relates to accumulated losses in reserves that will have a tax impact when they are recognised in profit or loss. Conversely, the liability balance relates to gains not yet recognised for tax purposes. Noteworthy are the deferred tax asset and liability relating to financial derivatives amounting to EUR 101 million and EUR 81 million, respectively.
d) Deferred taxes relating to goodwill
These correspond to deferred tax liabilities relating to the tax credit for goodwill amounting to EUR 223 million, which mainly include those related to the amortisation of the of Amey and Swissport goodwill, as discussed in Note 6.5.1.b.
The detail of the changes in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in 2016 is as follows:

2.8.4. Years open to tax audit

With respect to Ferrovial S.A. and its consolidated tax group, on 19 July 2017 the Large Taxpayers Central Office of the State Tax Agency announced the commencement of a tax audit of Ferrovial S.A., Ferrovial Agroman and Ferrovial Servicios S.A. in relation to the following taxes:

· Income tax for 2012 to 2014.

· VAT for tax periods from June 2013 to December 2015.

· Tax withholdings and pre-payments relating to salary income for tax periods from June 2013 to December 2015.

· Non-resident income tax withholdings for tax periods from June 2013 to December 2015.

The tax audit is currently at the documentation submission stage. The criteria that the tax authorities might adopt in relation to the years open for review could give rise to contingent tax liabilities which cannot be objectively quantified. It is considered that any possible material tax contingencies were adequately provisioned at year-end.

2.8.5. Tax regime applicable to Ferrovial S.A.

Ferrovial, S.A. has filed consolidated tax returns since 2002. The companies composing the consolidated tax group together with Ferrovial, S.A. in 2017 are shown in Appendix II. Also, in 2014 the Company opted to be taxed under the tax regime provided for in Articles 107 and 108 of Spanish Income Tax Law 27/2014, of 27 November. Since the application of that tax regime affects the taxation of possible dividends or gains obtained by the Company's shareholders, attached as Appendix I to these consolidated

financial statements is a note describing the tax treatment applicable to the shareholders, together with information on the taxable profits obtained by Ferrovial, S.A. that the shareholders should be aware of for the purpose of applying that regime.

2.8.6. Change in the tax legislation in the US

In December 2017 the US administration approved a change in the tax regime involving new adjustments with an impact on the US consolidated tax group. The most far-reaching impacts, inter alia, are the change in the income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the use of tax loss carryforwards of up to 80% without any time limit and the limitation on the deductibility of finance costs to 30% of EBITDA (2018-2021) or EBIT (from 2022).

From the accounting standpoint these changes had a positive impact on the deferred taxes recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of profit or loss of EUR 31 million, and did not affect cash flow.

From a business standpoint, this reform would give rise to lower tax
the timing effect that the other two measures discussed might have would not offset the positive impact of the reduction in the tax rate.

2.9. PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS

In 2017 the profit attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to EUR -53 million (December 2016: loss of EUR -7 million).

This figure relates to profits obtained by Group companies that are attributable to the other shareholders that hold interests in these companies. The figures are shown in such a way that if the investee has reported a profit, the profit attributable to non-controlling interests is presented with a negative sign, and if it has reported a loss, the loss attributable to non-controlling interests is shown with a positive sign.

Diluted earnings per share. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group did not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares, since no convertible debt instruments were issued and the share-based remuneration schemes described in Note 6.7 will not give rise to any capital increases at the Group, as explained in that Note. Consequently, no dilutive impact is envisaged when employee rights under the plans are exercised.

3.1.1. Changes in 2017
Following is a description of the main changes by type of change:
Definitive accounting for the acquisition of Broadspectrum:
In 2017 additional information was obtained -not available at the date of preparation of the 2016 consolidated financial statements- in relation to the financial statements of Broadspectrum at the date of its inclusion in the scope of consolidation of the Group. This additional information gave rise to the modification (EUR -15 million) of the goodwill arising on this acquisition. Pursuant to IFRS 3.45, this adjustment was made within the measurement period of one year from the acquisition date, which ended in May 2017.

Based on the foregoing, the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016 was adjusted. The table below details the effect of these changes on the main affected line items in the Group's consolidated statement of financial position.

Accordingly, in 2017 the Group re-estimated the value of the intangible assets corresponding to the contracts entered into with Broadspectrum's customers and the contractual relationship with them, which was calculated on the basis of a new, more precise estimate of the cash flows that will be generated by the contracts based on their expected duration and a forecast of the future cash flows in the event of renewal adjusted on the basis of the estimated probability of the renewal taking place. Following this analysis, the measurement of the intangible assets was increased by AUD 60 million (EUR 41 million) and contingencies relating to the performance of certain contracts were re-estimated for AUD 29 million (EUR 20 million). These contingencies are recognised in provisions (EUR 13 million), amounts billed in advance for construction work (EUR 2 million) and amounts to be billed for work performed (EUR -6 million). The overall impact of these effects, net of the related tax effect, was to reduce goodwill by AUD 22 million (EUR 15 million).
Definitive accounting for the acquisition of Pepper Lawson (Webber)
As with the case described above, in 2017 additional information was obtained that was not available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2016, which gave rise to an increase in the provisions associated with certain contracts, due to events already existing at the date of acquisition of the company, amounting to

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  169

EUR -2 million (net of the related taxes) and the consequent increase in the goodwill recognised. Since the impacts were not material, in this case the comparable information for 2016 was not adjusted and the changes
column.
Also, Pepper Lawson was integrated in the business structure of Webber in 2017, and, accordingly, the two companies will be treated as a single cash-generating unit for the purposes of monitoring goodwill

Changes in the scope of consolidation

Trans-Formers Group

· On 1 June 2017, the acquisition of all the shares of the Polish waste collection and treatment company Trans-Formers Group for EUR 31 million was completed (see Note 1.1, Basis of presentation, Company activities, changes in the scope of consolidation and adjustment). An intangible asset related to the customer portfolio was identified and recognised for EUR 17 million, as were property, plant and equipment for EUR 2 million and deferred taxes for EUR 3 million; which gave rise to goodwill on consolidation of EUR 5 million. In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group has one year from the acquisition date to review the purchase price allocation process.

Grupo Maviva

On 18 July, Ferrovial acquired, for EUR 18 million, all the shares of this Spanish company specialising in high value-added logistics operations, quality control and pre-assembly of components for the automotive industry. An intangible asset related to the customer portfolio was identified and recognised for EUR 7 million, together with deferred taxes of EUR 2 million. This gave rise to goodwill on consolidation of EUR 7 million. The Group has one year from the acquisition date to review the purchase price allocation process.

The provisional allocation of the purchase prices of these acquisitions can be consulted in the following table:

Impairment losses

The only impairment loss recognised in the year, amounting to EUR 29 million, relates to the goodwill on consolidation allocated to Autema (see Note 3.1.2).

Exchange rate effect
As regards the changes caused by the exchange rate effect, the appreciation of the euro against most of the currencies in which the Group companies operate (with the exception of the Polish zloty) had a negative impact of EUR 79 million on goodwill, including most notably the change in this item in the Services Division, where the goodwill decreased by EUR 59 million, due mainly to Amey (EUR -34 million) and Broadspectrum (EUR -24 million). In the Construction Division, the main change due to the exchange rate effect arose at Webber (EUR -18 million).
3.1.2. Goodwill impairment tests
A. Services Division goodwill:
Methodology and discount rate
The goodwill of Amey (UK), Ferrovial Services Spain, Broadspectrum and Steel (Chile), amounting to EUR 843 million, EUR 442 million, EUR 358 million and EUR 28 million, respectively, at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 877 million, EUR 435 million, EUR 382 million and EUR 29 million in the case of Amey, Ferrovial Services Spain, Broadspectrum and Steel, respectively), is tested for impairment by using cash flow projections for a five-year period, except in the case of Broadspectrum, for which a ten-year period was used, since this coincides with the projection period used to value the company at the time of its acquisition and is consistent with the model used to value the contracts and the contractual relationship for the purposes of valuing the intangible asset in the acquisition process. The residual value is based on the cash flow for the last year projected, provided this represents a cash flow with no exceptional factors, and the growth rate applied in no case exceeds the estimated long-term growth rate for the market in which each company operates.
Cash flows are discounted using a rate based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for assets of this nature. In order to value companies, Ferrovial uses a risk-free rate usually taking as a reference a ten-year sovereign bond based on the location of the company in question and a market premium of 6.0% (in line with 2016), based on studies of historical long-term and current market premiums demanded (mainly Dimson, Marsh & Staunton, Damodaran, etc.). As regards the risk-free interest rate, it should be noted that the Company considers that the current rate for sovereign bonds in some countries may be artificially low. For the impairment tests the risk-free interest rate used is a normalised rate of 2.0% for the UK (Amey) and 2.5% for Spain (Ferrovial Services Spain), which entails an upward adjustment with respect to the rate for sovereign bonds at 31 December 2017 of 79 basis points in the UK and 94 basis points in Spain. The risk-free interest rate used at Broadspectrum is 3.0% (26 basis points above the ten-year Australian sovereign bond) and the risk-free interest rate used in Chile is 4.4% (the same as the rate for the Chilean ten-year sovereign bond). Additional comparable companies were selected to obtain unlevered betas. The betas obtained were compared with other sources habitually used by analysts and investment banks (Barra Beta, Bloomberg, etc.).

2017 7.6% 8.9% 10.7% 11.3%

2016 7.9% 9.0% 10.2% 12.6%

Main factors that affect the valuation and performance compared with 2016 and budget

The projected flows are based on the latest estimates approved by the Company, which take into account recent historical data. The main factors that affect the cash flow projections of the Services Division are revenue forecasts and the projected revenue margins. These projections are based on four basic components:

· The existing backlog, which offers certainty of a high percentage of revenue in the coming years. In 2017 the backlog was reduced across the board; the hardest hit area was Amey, with a fall of -13.6%, followed by Spain and Broadspectrum with falls of -8.4% and -8.2% respectively.

· Winning new contracts, which is calculated by applying a success rate (based on historical company data and market prospects) to the estimate of the contracts for which bids will be submitted in the coming years.

· The estimate of future margins, which are based on the company's historical margins adjusted by certain factors that might affect the markets in the future.

· Amey, which had an EBITDA margin of 3.5% in 2017 (compared to 1.5% in 2016), has maintained its strategy for monitoring competitive tendering processes, focusing on operating improvements by withdrawing from contracts with low profitability and implementing the restructuring plan that commenced in 2016, with the aim of recovering historic profitability. The short-term revenue projections used in the 2017 impairment test of Amey were adjusted downwards in comparison to 2016, due to the outlook for 2018, which is marked by Brexit and a competitive environment affected by the precarious situation of its main operators. Current sales volume will not foreseeably be recovered until 2021. The projections envisage EBIT margin remaining stable in the short term and a gradual improvement in the long term up to levels close to 6%, margins that are lower than they were in the years before 2014.

· budget, with an EBITDA margin slightly lower than that of 2016 (10.4% compared to 10.7%). The projections envisage a continuation of the improvement in the EBITDA margin of recent years up to levels close to 12%, which is lower than the margins obtained in the years prior to 2013.

·

et in both

revenue (+15%) and EBITDA margin (5.5% compared to 3.6% in the

budget). In the future the company expects to gradually recover from

the withdrawal from the immigration contracts.

· Accordingly, the projections were adjusted downwards.

·

which is based on the prospects of the

markets and industries in which the Company operates. The rates used

are: 2% at Amey, 1.75% at Ferrovial Services Spain, 2.4% at

Broadspectrum and 2.5% at Steel. These perpetuity growth rates are

in line with the long-term inflation estimates in the UK, Spain,

Australia and Chile, respectively. These perpetuity growth rates are in

line with the long-term consensus estimates of inflation in the UK,

Spain, Australia and Chile, respectively (sources used: IMF, Bloomberg,

Economist Intelligence Unit, European Central Bank, etc.).

Impairment test results

The value of Amey resulting from application of this impairment test model is 225% higher than its carrying amount (2016: 231%). In the case of Ferrovial Services Spain, the buffer is 66% (2016: 49%). The value of Broadspectrum is 78% higher than its carrying amount.

The value of Steel resulting from application of this impairment test model is 6% higher than its carrying amount (2016: 146%). The reduction in the size of the buffer is due mainly to a downward adjustment of the projections owing to the fact that operating margins were lower than expected in 2017.

The residual value after the projection period represents approximately 83% of the total value at Amey, 71% at Ferrovial Services Spain, 81% at Steel and 62% at Broadspectrum.

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses are performed on this goodwill, mainly in relation to the EBITDA margin, the perpetuity growth rate and the discount rate, so as to ensure that possible changes in the estimate do not affect the recovery of the goodwill recognised.

The main sensitivity factor in these impairment tests is the EBITDA margin. Accordingly, the carrying amount would equal the valuation disclosed if the EBITDA margin projected on the residual value were reduced by 314 basis points at Amey, 382 basis points at Ferrovial Services Spain and 179 basis points at Broadspectrum, thereby leaving the

Another relevant sensitivity factor is the perpetuity growth included in the residual value. In this regard, Amey, Ferrovial Services Spain and Broadspectrum, in a scenario in which the projected margins remain the same and assuming a zero-perpetuity growth rate, there would be no impairment.

Lastly, a pessimistic scenario combining the two factors was taken into consideration, with a perpetuity growth rate of 1% and a reduction in the EBITDA margin included in the residual value of 100 basis points compared to the base case. The valuation disclosed in this scenario evidences a buffer over the carrying amount of 123% in the case of Amey, 40% in the case of Ferrovial Services Spain, and 23% in the case of Broadspectrum.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  171

The valuation of Steel disclosed a smaller buffer and, accordingly, a small variance in the projections could give rise to impairment.
B. Construction Division goodwill (Webber and Budimex):
Methodology and discount rate
The goodwill of Webber (US) and Budimex (Poland) amounted to EUR 127 million and EUR 70 million, respectively, at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 143 million and EUR 67 million, respectively).
The impairment test methodology used for Webber was similar to that described above for the Services companies and included a discount rate (WACC) after tax of 8.9% (compared to 8.7% in 2016) and a perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% (same rate as in 2016). The risk-free interest rate used to calculate the WACC was 2.4%, the same as the rate of the tenyear US bond at 31 December 2017.
The approximate discount rate (WACC) before tax was 10.6% in 2017 (compared to 12.1% in 2016). It is important to bear in mind the reduction in the federal tax rate in the US from 35% to 21% approved in December.
In the case of Budimex, since it is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the goodwill was tested for impairment by ascertaining whether the closing market price at 31 December 2017 of Budimex shares was higher than its carrying amount plus the allocated goodwill. The test did not evidence the existence of any impairment.
Main factors that affect the valuation and performance compared with 2016 and budget
The projected free cash flows are based on the latest estimates approved by the Company, which take into account recent historical data. The main factors that affect the cash flow projections of Webber are revenue forecasts and the projected operating margins. These projections are based on four basic components, similar to those described in the preceding section on Services (the existing backlog, the obtainment of new contracts, the estimate of future margins and the perpetuity growth rate). It should be noted that the projected operating margins are lower than the historical margins of recent years, in line with average margins in the industry. The perpetuity growth rate used was 2%, which is similar to long-term inflation forecasts for the US without considering actual economic growth.
Impairment test results
The value of Webber resulting from application of this impairment test model is 59% higher than its carrying amount (compared to 23% in 2016).
The residual value of Webber represents 40% of the total value after the explicit projection period.
The quoted market price of the Budimex share at 31 December 2017 was 491% higher than its carrying amount (compared to 321% in 2016).
Sensitivity analysis
particularly in relation to the profit from operations, the discount rate and the perpetuity growth rate, so as to ensure that possible changes in the estimate do not have an impact on the possible recovery of the goodwill recognised.

Specifically, a pessimistic scenario was taken into consideration with a perpetuity growth rate of 1% and a reduction in the profit from operations of 50 basis points. The value disclosed in this scenario evidences a buffer of 40% over the carrying amount.

On this basis, the valuation disclosed would equal the carrying amount if the reduction in the margin with respect to the projection was of 265

at 1%.

Lastly, it should be stated that in a scenario in which the margins remain the same but assuming a zero perpetuity-growth rate (compared to 2.0%), there would be no impairment.

At Budimex, due to the significant buffer of the quoted market price over the carrying amount, the company believes that there is no evidence of impairment.

C. Toll Road Division goodwill:

Methodology and discount rate

The goodwill of the Toll Road business at 31 December 2017 amounted to EUR 141 million (31 December 2016: EUR 170 million). This goodwill arose on the merger transaction performed in 2009 by Ferrovial, S.A. and Cintra, S.A., and corresponds to the acquisition of the percentage of ownership of the non-controlling shareholders of Cintra. The goodwill arising on the difference between the acquisition price of the ownership interest and the carrying amount thereof was allocated by calculating the difference between the fair value of the main shareholdings in concession operators held by Cintra, S.A. at that time and the carrying amount thereof, adjusted by the percentage acquired.

The recoverable amount of the toll roads was calculated as the higher of fair value less estimated costs to sell and value in use. The recoverable amount of concession operators with an independent financial structure and limited duration was calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to be received by shareholders until the end of the concession term. The Group considers that value in use must be obtained using models that cover the entire concession term, as the assets are in different phases of investment and growth and there is sufficient visibility to use a specific economic and financial plan for each phase during the concession term. Therefore, no residual value is considered to exist in these valuations. The projections were updated based on the historical evolution and specific features of each asset, using long-term modelling tools to estimate traffic, extraordinary maintenance, etc.

To calculate the discount rates shown in the table below, the cost of equity was estimated using the CAPM model. For this purpose, a normalised risk-free rate usually referenced to a 30-year bond, taking into account the location of each concession operator, a beta coefficient reflecting the company's leverage and risk, and a market premium of 6.0% (the same as in 2016) are used. The table below shows the discount rate after tax used for each asset in 2017 and 2016.

DISCOUNT RATE (COST OF EQUITY OR KE)
Autema Ausol

2017
8.9% 9.7%

2016
8.4% 10.0%

The approximate discount rates (WACC) before tax in 2017 were 12.3% at Autema (2016: 12.7%) and 12.0% at Ausol (2016: 12.6%).

172  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

Main factors that affect the valuation and performance compared with 2016 and budget
The main factor affecting cash flow projections of the toll roads are the revenue projections, which differ depending on whether the operator bears the demand risk (in which case the intangible asset model is used) or whether the grantor bears the demand risk and makes payments for capacity availability (in which case the financial asset model is used).
If the operator bears the demand risk, its revenue depends on traffic volumes and toll prices, which are generally updated with inflation. Of the two toll roads with goodwill, the intangible asset model is applied at Ausol, while the financial asset model is used at Autema, since the demand risk is assumed by the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government.
Traffic projections are prepared using long-term modelling tools that use data from public (or external) sources to estimate traffic in the corridor (which depends mainly on the growth in the population and car ownership) and the level of toll road capture.
Valuation projections and models begin with the budget for the following year approved by management. Any variances in traffic volumes in the year under way are taken into consideration when the initial budget and the long-term projections are reviewed. In 2017 Ausol's revenue grew by 8.5% compared with 2016 and 2.2% compared with the budget.
In the case of Autema, a project classified as a financial asset, the uncertainties relate to counterparty credit risk and possible penalties arising from the service.
Impairment test results
In the case of Ausol, the valuation evidences a buffer of 334% over carrying amount (compared with 250% in 2016).
In 2017 Autema recognised impairment of goodwill amounting to EUR 29 million. The economic and financial model used for the impairment test is based on a scenario in which the lawsuit against the Autonomous Community Government of Catalonia is won and the Economic and Financial Plan of the concession approved by the Autonomous Community Government of Catalonia in Decree 137/1999, of 18 May, is applied. This model envisages a delay in the collection of the collection flows from the Autonomous Community Government of Catalonia until the resolution of the lawsuit, and this is the reason for the aforementioned impairment.
Sensitivity analysis
In the case of Ausol, a more pessimistic scenario was built, taking into consideration a revenue 10% below budget. The value disclosed in this scenario evidences a buffer of 220% over the carrying amount.

3.2. Intangible assets

At 2017 year-end, the balance of intangible assets other than infrastructure projects amounted to EUR 431 million (2016 year-end: EUR 544 statement of financial position were as follows:

the Services industry in Spain that are not classified as projects (see definition in Note 1.1.2), amounting to EUR 22 million (31 December 2016: EUR 28 million).
The carrying amount of software was EUR 128 million (31 December 2016: EUR 145 million).
On the other hand, in relation to the "Customer contracts and commercial relationships", the net value of the commercial portfolio, customer databases and other intangible assets associated with various acquisition processes, carried out mainly in the Services Division, is included for a net value of EUR 282 million (31 December 2016: EUR 372 million). The most significant balance corresponds to Broadspectrum for EUR 108 million (31 December 2016: EUR 191 million).
Also, FBSerwis acquired Trans-Formers Wroclaw and Trans-Formers Kapatia, companies belonging to the Trans-Formers TFH Sp. z.o.o. Group, and this transaction gave rise to an increase in the balance of this line item of EUR 17 million, see concession arrangements amounted to EUR 32 million (31 December 2016: EUR 17 million).
Furthermore, acquisition of Grupo Maviva had a net value impact on the commercial portfolio of EUR 7 million, see Note 3.1.
In 2017, fully amortised intangible assets were derecognised for a total of EUR 126 million, of which EUR 87 million related to the Tubelines Secondment concession and EUR 21 million to concession arrangements in Australia.
The cash flow impact of the additions to intangible assets amounted to EUR -3 million (see Note 5.3), an amount lower than the additions recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, due mainly to investments made in computer software which have not been paid in full.

The most significant changes in 2017 were as follows:

· Exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a reduction of EUR -650 million (2016: increase of EUR 195 million) in the balance of these assets, the full amount of which was attributable to the change in the euro/US dollar exchange rate at the US toll roads (see Note 1.4).

· The assets relating to the US toll roads increased by EUR 477 million. The most significant of these increases in assets centred on the extension of the North Tarrant Express toll road (EUR 262 million 2016: EUR 281 million-) and the I-77 Mobility Partners LLC toll road (EUR 165 million -2016: EUR 67 million-), which are currently in the construction phase. The total investment in these toll roads includes a balance at 31 December 2017 of EUR 1,129 million (2016: EUR 807 million) relating to property, plant and equipment in the course of construction (see Note 5.3).

· arrangements to which no goodwill has been allocated. These possible impairment losses were calculated using the same method as that indicated in Section 3.1. In 2017 the impairment loss recognised on the Euroscut Azores toll road was reversed (EUR 25 million) as a result of the improved projections for the toll road due to an increase in vehicle numbers (see Note 2.5).

· arrangements awarded to the Services Division that are classified as intangible assets under IFRIC 12, basically those relating to Autovía de Aragón Sociedad Concesionaria, S.A., with a net investment of EUR 115 million (2016: EUR 127 million) and various integral waste treatment plants located in Spain, mainly in Barcelona, Toledo and

Murcia (Ecoparc de Can Mata, S.L.U., Gestión Medioambiental de Toledo, S.A. and Servicios Urbanos de Murcia, S.A.) among others, for a net amount of EUR 159 million (2016: EUR 162 million).

In the case of the infrastructure project companies, all their concession assets have been pledged as security for the existing borrowings (see Note 5.2). The borrowing costs capitalised in this connection in 2017 are detailed in Note 2.6.

As indicated in 6.5.1-a, the Company considers that there are very sound legal arguments to win the appeal and, therefore, it was resolved to continue to recognise the project as a financial asset.

3.3.3 Cash flow impact
The total cash flow impact of the additions to projects accounted for using the intangible asset and financial asset models amounted to EUR -371 million (see Note 5.3), which differs from the additions recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position primarily due to the following reasons:
· In projects in which the intangible asset model is applied, due to differences between the accrual basis and cash basis of accounting, as well as the capitalisation of the borrowing costs attributable to projects under construction, which do not generate cash outflows.
· In projects in which the financial asset model is applied, due to the increases in the account receivable as a balancing entry to income for services rendered, which do not generate cash outflows either.

Of the total additions, amounting to EUR 142 million, the most significant arose at the Services Division EUR 83 million in relation to the investments made in the expansion of the capacity of landfills, the installation of new waste transfer and treatment facilities, and the renewal of cleaning and transport equipment and luminaires associated with contracts in force. Also, in the Construction Division, acquisitions totalling EUR 49 million were made in relation to specific construction machinery.

In addition, in 2017 the changes in value of the euro against the Australian and US dollars, the Chilean peso and the pound sterling gave rise to a net reduction of EUR 59 million in the balance of property, plant and equipment.

The detail, by business segment, of the additions to property, plant and equipment is as follows:

Impact on cash flows: The impact on cash flows arising from additions to property, plant and equipment amounted to EUR -132 million (see Note 5.3).

Disposals or reductions:

The property, plant and equipment disposals and reductions amounted to EUR 119 million, due largely to the write-off of fully depreciated or obsolete items, although this did not have a material effect on the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Specifically, EUR 25 million were

derecognised at the Construction Division and EUR 80 million at the Services Division.

Other disclosures relating to property, plant and equipment:

The property, plant and equipment not used in operations are not material with respect to the ending consolidated balances. Impairment losses on other items of property, plant and equipment total EUR 70 million (2016: EUR 68 million), associated mainly with the Services Division.

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which its property, plant and equipment are subject and the claims that might be filed against it for carrying on its business activities. These policies are considered to adequately cover the related risks.

The property, plant and equipment in the course of construction amount to EUR 58 million (2016: EUR 58 million), corresponding basically to the Services Division (EUR 44 million). The changes relate mainly to Cespa Gestión de Residuos and Broadspectrum Australia.

3.5. Investments in associates

The detail of the investments in companies accounted for using the equity method at 2017 year-end and of the changes therein in 2017 is shown in the table below. Due to their significance, the investments in 407 ETR (43.23%) and Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH) (25%) are presented separately.

Changes: The changes in "Investments in Associates" were due mainly to the distribution of dividends of EUR 423 million, partially offset by the share of results for the year (EUR 251 million), and the appreciation in value of the euro, mainly against the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, which had a negative effect of EUR -143 million. Also worthy of note is the positive impact of the inclusion in this line item of the Portuguese Norte Litoral and Algarve toll roads (EUR 148 million) following the partial divestments that took place in 2017 and are described in Note 1.1.3, Changes in the scope of consolidation.

Impact on cash flows: The difference between the dividends of EUR 423 million in the foregoing table and the EUR 543 million disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows (see Note 5.3) relates mainly to interest received on loans granted to companies accounted for using the equity method classified under "Non-Current Financial Assets" in the consolidated statement of financial position (see Note 3.6) and the effect of the certain foreign currency hedges related to dividends received.

In view of the importance of the investments in HAH and 407 ETR, set forth below is a detail of the balance sheets and statements of profit or loss of these two companies, adjusted to bring them into line with Ferrovial's accounting policies, together with comments on the changes therein in 2017.

Also, since the two ownership interests were remeasured when control was lost, giving rise to the recognition of goodwill, in accordance with IAS 28.40 et seq the possible existence of indications of impairment is assessed on an annual basis.

3.5.1. Information relating to HAH

a. Impairment test

Based on the valuations and sensitivity analyses performed, on the references to transactions performed with third parties and on the positive evolution of the asset in the year, it was concluded that no impairment existed.

The highlight of the positive trend in 2017 was the improvement in gross profit from operations, up 4.6% on the figure for 2016, and 6.0% compared with the 2017 budget used as the first year of projection in the 2016 impairment test. RAB grew by 3.6% in the year to stand at GBP 15,786 million. Also, traffic figures were 3.1% above those for 2016 and 3.9% higher than the 2017 budget.

The main assumptions used to measure this asset for impairment testing purposes were as follows:

· The most recent business plan approved by the company was considered. This plan is based on the 5.35% return on assets established by the regulator for the current five-year period (Q6: 2014-2019), representing an annual price reduction of factor) + inflation (RPI) until December 2019.

· In compliance with IAS 36.44, possible plans to increase the capacity of Heathrow airport (third runway project) were not taken into account. However, it should be stated that on 25 October 2016 the UK government announced its decision to select the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport in order to increase airport capacity in the southeast of England. The Davies Commission, which was created to study the various capacity expansion options, had already unanimously recommended this as the best option in July 2015. However, this decision requires parliamentary approval of the National Policy Statement and subsequently the grant of a Development Consent Order by the Secretary of State, which are expected to be obtained between 2018 and 2021.

· The value of the investment was calculated by discounting the future cash flows per the business plan, using the adjusted present value

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  177

(APV) method until 2050 and an exit multiple for that year of 1.15 x RAB. The unlevered equity discount rate (Ku) is 7.5% and the tax shield generated by the debt is discounted at the cost of the debt.
The result of the valuation is 78% higher than the carrying amount. Also, sensitivity analyses were performed on the main variables (remuneration of the RAB, discount rate, long-term inflation and exit multiple) and in all cases the amount of the valuation exceeds the carrying amount. It should be noted that this valuation was made from a conservative perspective for the purpose of the impairment test.

b. Changes in the balance sheet and statement of profit or loss 2017-2016

In view of the importance of this investment, following is a detail of the balance sheet and statement of profit or loss for this Group of companies, adjusted to bring them into line with Ferrovial's accounting policies, together with comments on the changes therein in 2017.

The balance sheet figures shown relate to the full balances of HAH and are presented in pounds sterling. The exchange rates used in 2017 are EUR 1=GBP 0.88893 (2016: GBP 0.85448) for the balance sheet figures and EUR 1=GBP 0.87506 (2016: GBP 0.82301) for the statement of profit or loss.

· Equity
At 31 December 2017, equity amounted to GBP 297 million, down GBP -243 million from the year ended 31 December 2016. In addition to the profit for the year of GBP 303 million, the main noteworthy changes

are the dividends paid to shareholders amounting to GBP -525 million and the impact of GBP -52 million recognised in reserves in relation to pension plans. These negative impacts are partially offset by the impact of GBP 28 million resulting from hedging derivatives.
25% of the equity of the investee does not correspond to the carrying amount of the investment, since the carrying amount also includes the amount of the gain arising from the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained following the sale of a 5.88% ownership interest in HAH in October 2011. The gain was recognised as an addition to goodwill. Therefore, in order to obtain the carrying amount at Ferrovial, it would be necessary to increase the 25% of the shareholders' equity presented above (GBP 74 million) by the amount of the aforementioned gain (GBP 581 million), giving a total of GBP 655 million which, translated at the year-end exchange rate (EUR 1 = GBP 0.88893), is equivalent to the investment of EUR 737 million.
· Borrowings
The borrowings of HAH (current and non-current) amounted to GBP 14,471 million at 31 December 2017, a decrease of GBP 155 million with respect to 2016 (31 December 2016: GBP 14,626 million). This decrease was due mainly to the effect of:
· Redemption and issue of bonds amounting to GBP -1,122 million and GBP 718 million, respectively, and a net increase of GBP 372 million in bank borrowings.
· Decrease of GBP 104 million as a result of the fair value adjustments made to bonds issued in foreign currencies and of the related exchange rate effect. This impact is offset by the changes in value of the cross-currency swaps arranged to hedge this debt (EUR -144 million).
· Other changes of EUR -19 million (mainly accrued interest payable and fees and commissions).
· Derivative financial instruments at fair value
The notional principal amount of HAH's derivatives portfolio at 31 December 2017 totalled GBP 12,014 million, including interest rate derivatives (IRSs) with a notional amount of GBP 2,914 million (hedging floating-rate borrowings), cross-currency swaps (hedging bonds issued in foreign currencies) with a notional amount of GBP 3,884 million, and index-linked swaps (ILSs) (notional amount of GBP 5,216 million). The purpose of the index-linked swaps is to offset the imbalance that can arise between the business revenue and the regulated asset base, which are indexed to inflation, and the interest payments on fixed-rate borrowings, which do not fluctuate in response to changes in inflation.
The net change in the value (asset/liability position) of these financial instruments gave rise to a GBP 184 million increase in liabilities in the year. The main impacts relate to:
· Cash settlements (net payments) of GBP -68 million.
· Accrual of borrowing costs (result on financing) of GBP -195 million.
· Effect on reserves of the change in value of hedging derivatives of GBP 34 million.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

· Fair value adjustments to these instruments (fair value-related result) of GBP 44 million, due mainly to the index linked swaps (GBP +137 million), interest rate swaps (GBP +51 million) and crosscurrency swaps (GBP -144 million, although these are partially offset by the fair value adjustments of the bonds issued in foreign currency and hedged by these instruments).

Operating income improved mainly as a result of the good performance of commercial and aeronautical revenues, which was due basically to the increase in passenger numbers. Costs were in line with 2016. These effects are reflected in the 4.6% rise in gross profit from operations.

The most significant improvement, however, was that in the financial result, which was affected by the fair value adjustments to derivatives and liabilities at fair value (mainly index-linked swaps and interest-rate swaps), totalling GBP +203 million (EUR +48 million net attributable to Ferrovial), caused mainly by the inflation and interest rate forecasts. At 31 December 2016, these adjustments totalled GBP -479 million (effect of EUR -121 million on the net profit of Ferrovial).

3.5.2. Information relating to 407 ETR
remeasured when control was lost and implicit goodwill was considered to exist, pursuant to IAS 28.40 et seq, the possible existence of indications of impairment is assessed on an annual basis.
a. Impairment test
Based on the valuation of this concession conducted by Ferrovial, the positive evolution of the asset in recent years and the sensitivity analyses performed, it was concluded that no impairment existed.
The evolution of this asset over the last ten years has been very positive, with average annual growth of 10% in revenue, 12% in EBITDA and 23% in dividends. In 2017 the 407 ETR toll road revenue outperformed by 2.9%, in local currency terms, the estimates in the budget used as the starting point for the impairment test in the previous year. On a year-onyear basis revenue increased by 11.7% due to the 8.9% increase in tolls and a 2.3% increase in traffic. Along similar lines, EBITDA increased by 12.1% with respect to 2016 and was 3.4% higher than budgeted.
The valuation of this concession performed by Ferrovial evidences a buffer over the carrying amount of 400%. Sensibility analyses have been performed of the growth in revenue and the discount rate and the buffer continues to be ample.
The valuation methodology followed is similar to the one described for the other toll roads (see Note 3.1.2-c, Toll road division goodwill). To calculate the discount rates, a normalised risk-free rate referenced to the Canadian 30-year bond, a beta coefficient reflecting the company's leverage and risk, and a market premium of 6.0% (the same as in 2016) were used. The result is a discount rate (cost of equity or Ke) after tax of 6.5% (8.2% before tax).
Based on the valuation and the positive evolution of the asset in recent years, no indications of impairment were identified.
b. Changes in the balance sheet and statement of profit or loss for 2017-2016 relating to this Group of companies at 31 December 2017 and 2016
These figures relate to the full balances of 407 ETR and are presented in millions of Canadian dollars. The exchange rates used in 2017 are EUR 1=CAD 1.5059 (2016: CAD 1.4185) for the balance sheet figures and EUR 1=CAD 1.4755 (2016: CAD 1.4590) for the statement of profit or loss.

Set forth below is a description of the main changes in the balance sheet of 407 ETR at 31 December 2017 with respect to the end of the preceding year:

· Equity

Equity fell by CAD 376 million with respect to 2016, as a result of the inclusion of the profit for the year of CAD 470 million and the reduction of CAD 845 million due to the payment of a dividend to shareholders.

43.23% of the equity of the investee does not correspond to the consolidated carrying amount of the investment, since the carrying amount also includes the amount of the gain arising from the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained following the sale of a 10% ownership interest in this company in 2010, recognised as an addition to the value of the concession, and the goodwill that arose in 2009 as a result of the merger of Grupo Ferrovial, S.A. and Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transportes, S.A. Therefore, in order to obtain the consolidated carrying amount at Ferrovial, it is

above (CAD -1,485 million) by the amount of the aforementioned gain and of the goodwill (CAD 2,654 million and CAD 1,319 million, respectively), giving a total of CAD 2,488 million which, translated at the year-end exchange rate (EUR 1 = CAD 1.5059), is equivalent to the investment of EUR 1,652 million.

· Borrowings

Borrowings as a whole (current and non-current) increased by CAD 573 million with respect to December 2016, due mainly to a bond issue in March with a face value of CAD 250 million (Series 17-A1 maturing in 2033) and other series issued in September with a face value of CAD 800 million (Series 17-D1 and 17-A2) maturing in 2022 and 2044. These increases were offset by the repayment of Series 10 D-1 bonds in September 2017 for CAD -300 million and that of credit facilities for CAD -180 million.

In net debt terms the change is smaller, since, parallel to the increase in borrowings, there was also an increase in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of CAD 220 million.

Statement of profit or loss 2017-2016

The following table shows the changes in the statement of profit or loss of 407 ETR in the year ended 31 December 2017 with respect to 2016:

The main change in the statement of profit or loss relates to "Operating Income" (CAD +133 million) as a result of the increase in tolls and the increase in toll road traffic.
It should be noted that the profit attributable to Ferrovial also includes the amortisation over the concession term of the remeasurement recognised following the loss of control of the company as a result of the above-mentioned sale in 2010. Thus, EUR -19 million of amortisation would have to be deducted from the 43.23% of the local profit (CAD 203 million). Translating the resulting CAD 184 million at the average exchange rate (EUR 1 = CAD 1.4755) gives the EUR 125 million allocable to Ferrovial in 2017.

3.5.3. Other disclosures relating to associates

a) Changes in other associates

See Appendix II for a detail of the associates accounted for using the equity method including their carrying amount and their main aggregates.

The changes in 2017 in the investments in these companies were as follows:

OTHER 156 39 -28 -3 3 148 -17 298

The share of results includes most notably the contributions of the joint ventures of the Services Division (EUR 26 million), AGS Airports Holding (EUR 2 million), 407 East Development (EUR 1 million) and other associates (EUR 10 million).

The dividends received relate to the Services Division (EUR 19 million, arising mainly from the joint ventures of Amey, FMM Company -Doha airport maintenance agreement- and EMESA-Calle 30) and to the Toll Roads Division (EUR 9 million, mainly Algarve and Norte Litoral).

180  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

The changes in the scope of consolidation, as indicated above, include the reclassification to this line item of the Portuguese toll roads Norte Litoral and Algarve (EUR 148 million).
b) Other disclosures relating to companies accounted for using the equity method
b.1) Investment in AGS
The companies accounted for using the equity method include most notably AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports. Since goodwill was generated on the acquisition date, an impairment test was performed. The carrying amount of AGS is EUR 180 million, the aggregate of the investment of EUR 5 million and the value of the participating loan recognised at EUR 175 million (see Note 3.6, Non-current financial assets). AGS was valued using a discount rate (Ke) of around 7.5% (approximately 8.5% before tax) and evidences a buffer of 381% over its carrying amount. In addition, the analysts' average
amount. It must be stated that this asset performed well in 2017, with increases in the number of passengers and in EBITDA over 2016 of 4.9% and 10.7%, respectively, in like-for-like terms.
b.2) I-66 toll road
In November 2017 the financial close of the project for the I-66 toll road in Virginia took place. The Group has a 50% ownership interest in the concession operator, which is accounted for using the equity method.
Although at 2017 year-end the investment in the capital of this company was not material, there is a commitment to invest an additional EUR 633 million in the next five years. b.3) Other disclosures
In addition, there are other associates with a carrying amount of zero. s or
exceeds its interest in the associate, the investor discontinues recognising its share of further losses, unless the investor has incurred legal or constructive obligations that make it necessary to recognise a liability for additional
There are no significant restrictions on the capacity of associates to transfer funds to the Parent in the form of dividends, debt repayments or advances other than such restrictions as might arise from the financing agreements of those associates or from their own financial situation, and there are no contingent liabilities relating to associates that might ultimately be assumed by the Group.

The most significant companies accounted for using the equity method in which the ownership interest is below 20% are Madrid Calle 30 and Amey Ventures Investment Limited (AVIL). The equity method is used because, although Ferrovial only has an indirect ownership interest of 10% and has the power to appoint one member of the Board of Directors in the two cases, it retains the capacity to block important decisions in matters that are not of a protective nature.

There are no significant companies in which the ownership interest exceeds 20% that are not accounted for using the equity method.

The guarantees granted by Group companies to companies accounted for using the equity method are detailed in Note 6.5.

The early application of IFRS 15 (see Note 4.4) was the main reason for the change in working capital, especially with respect to trade and other receivables, which decreased by EUR 304 million.
Excluding the impact of IFRS 15, the exchange rate effect and the changes in the scope of consolidation, the most noteworthy change is the increase in Current trade and other payables, which is due mainly to the rise in the balance of advances received from customers in the Construction business in 2017.
Section 4.4 includes a more detailed analysis of the items in the consolidated statement of financial position relating to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in the Construction and Services businesses, and includes the disclosures required by IFRS 15 in relation to such contracts.

Of the commercial inventories recognised at 31 December 2017, EUR 286 million (EUR 239 million in 2016) relate to the Real Estate business in Poland, of which EUR 128 million (EUR 100 million in 2016) relate to land and building lots and EUR 158 million (EUR 139 million in 2016) relate to property developments at different stages of completion.

EUR 126 million of raw materials and other supplies relate to the Construction Division, mainly at its subsidiaries in the US and Canada, amounting to EUR 53 million (EUR 49 million in 2016), and Budimex, amounting to EUR 54 million (EUR 32 million in 2016). In addition, at the end of 2017 EUR 17 million had been recognised in relation to the Services Division, mainly at its subsidiary Amey amounting to EUR 13 million (EUR 22 million in 2016).

Lastly, bid and mobilisation costs includes contract costs for EUR 124 million (EUR 69 million in 2016). As explained in Note 1.3.3.4, Revenue recognition, assets related to the costs of obtaining a contract (bid costs) and to the costs incurred to fulfil a contract (mobilisation costs) are recognised. As regards bid costs, the Group recognised EUR 23 million (EUR 9 million in 2016) corresponding to construction contracts.

Additionally, there are mobilisation costs amounting to EUR 101 million (EUR 60 million in 2016), of which EUR 27 million relate to service contracts and EUR 74 million to construction contracts. The change of EUR 25 million under this heading is due to the application of IFRS 15 (see Note 1.3.1.1) and corresponds to a reclassification from the Receivables heading, since certain mobilisation costs had been recognised under that heading.

Both for bid and mobilisation costs, amortisation is carried out systematically, in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to which the asset

corresponds. In 2017, EUR 1 million of bid costs and EUR 31 million of mobilisation costs were amortised.

from EUR 2,193 million at 31 December 2016 to EUR 2,032 million at 31 December 2017. This change is explained fundamentally by:

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  183

· The early application of IFRS 15 (see Note 1.3, Accounting policies), which gave rise to a reduction in the balance of "Trade Receivables for Sales and Services" of EUR 292 million.

· The exchange rate effect, which reduced the balance of this line item by EUR 53 million. This reduction is a result mainly of the fall in value
of the main currencies in which the Group operates (except for the Polish zloty, which had a positive impact of EUR 10 million).

· The remainder of the change is explained mainly by the increase in this line item in Construction Poland (EUR +79 million) and Services UK
(EUR +58 million).

Also, at 31 December 2017 a total of EUR 88 million had been deducted from "Trade Receivables for Sales and Services" relating to assets derecognised as a result of factoring arrangements, since it was considered that they met the conditions stipulated in IAS 39.20 regarding the derecognition of financial assets (31 December 2016: EUR 84 million).

Following is a detail, by type of debtor, of the main trade receivables:

This detail shows that 60% of the Group's customers are public authorities and the rest are private sector customers.

In order to manage credit risk relating to private sector customers, the Group has implemented pre- and post-contracting measures. Precontracting measures include the consultation of debtor registers, ratings and solvency studies, while post-contracting measures during the execution of construction work include the follow-up of contractual incidents, non-payment events, etc.

Also, "Accounts Receivable Relating to Infrastructure Projects" includes current financial assets arising from the application of IFRIC 12 relating mainly to amounts receivable from public authorities in return for services rendered or investments made under a concession arrangement, as detailed in Note 3.3. The main change in this heading arose as a result of the payments made by public authorities of balances payable to Autema of EUR 52 million.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

to the balance recognised at 31 December 2016, mainly as the result of the appreciation of the euro against the other foreign currencies in which the Group operates.

This line item includes the balances payable to suppliers sent for reverse factoring (see Note 1.3.3.4 in Accounting policies) amounting to EUR 286 million (31 December 2016: EUR 253 million).

Group management considers that the carrying amount of the trade payables approximates their fair value.

b) Disclosure obligation in relation to payments to suppliers provided for in Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010

In compliance with the obligation to disclose the average period of payment to suppliers provided for in Article 539 and Additional Provision Eight of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law (in accordance with the new wording of Final Provision Two of Law 31/2014 reforming the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law), the Company hereby states that the average period of payment to the suppliers of all the Group companies domiciled in Spain in 2017 was 49 days.

Set forth below is the detail required by Article 6 of the Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute Resolution of 29 January 2016 in relation to the disclosures to be provided on the average period of payment to suppliers in 2016 and 2017:

Reciprocal trade receivables and payables between Ferrovial Group companies are eliminated on consolidation and, accordingly, no balances payable to Group companies are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. Therefore, the information shown in the foregoing table refers only to the Group's external suppliers, although it is hereby stated for information purposes that the average payment period between Group companies is normally 30 days.

c) Amounts billed in advance for construction work and customer advances

These line items relate to:

· The amounts billed in advance by various companies in the Services and Construction Divisions in relation to contracts the revenue from which is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as described in Notes 1.3.3.4 and 4.4.

· Advances received from customers, amounting to EUR 652 million (31 December 2016: EUR 424 million), of which EUR 158 million (31 December 2016: EUR 133 million) relate to advances received by the Real Estate business in Poland; and EUR 493 million (31 December 2016: EUR 291 million) relate to advances received by companies in the Construction and Services Divisions in relation to contracts the revenue from which is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as described in Note 4.4. This last variation is due mainly

to changes in the Construction division in the US (EUR 132 million) and Poland (EUR 71 million).

Statement of financial position balances relating to contracts with customers
As indicated in Note 1.3.3.4, Revenue recognition (IFRS 15), in those contracts in which performance obligations are measured over time, the difference between the revenue recognised for services rendered and the amounts actually billed to the customer is analysed systematically on a contract-by-contract basis. If the amount billed is lower than the revenue recognised, the difference is recognised as an asset under
- Amounts to Be Billed for
recognised is lower than the amount billed, a liability is recognised under Other Payables - Amounts Billed in Advance for

Also, in certain construction or services contracts advances are agreed upon that are paid by the customer when work commences on the contract, the balance of which is offset against the various progress billings as the contract work is performed. These balances are recognised under "Trade Payables" on the liability side of the consolidated statement of financial position (see Note 4.3-a).
In contrast to the advances, in certain contracts the customer retains a portion of the price to be paid in each progress billing to guarantee the fulfilment of certain obligations under the contract. These retentions are not reimbursed until the contract is definitively settled. These balances are recognised under "Trade Receivables for Sales and Services" on the asset side of the consolidated statement of financial position (see Note 4.2).

balances that will have an impact on future cash flows, since in the case
advances are discounted from the progress billings, whereas the
customer will reimburse the related amounts as and when the contract work is settled.

Revenue not yet recognised relating to performance obligations not satisfied at the end of 2017 corresponds to what is usually known as backlog (see definition in the Alternative Performance Measures section in the Management report). This figure is broken down by business area in the following table and includes an estimate of the years in which the

Substantially all of the balance of amounts to be billed for work performed at 31 December 2017 corresponds to figures relating to revenue from the principal contract entered into with the customer since the Group generally only recognises revenue that is due and payable, i.e.
includes those cases in which it is considered highly probable that the related revenue will not reverse in the future.
As mentioned in Note 1.3.3.1, there are various methods for calculating revenue based on the nature of the contract. In general, performance obligations in the Construction and Services businesses are satisfied over time and, accordingly, in the case of those contracts to which the output method is applied, and since the amounts relating to contract modifications and claims are not material, the balance recognised corresponds mainly to the amounts to be billed for work performed under the principal contract resulting from the mismatch between the date the work is performed and the date the customer is billed.

The disclosures relating to the description of when performance obligations are satisfied in the various contracts, the existence of a

significant financing component, how the variable consideration is recognised, including the conditions that must be satisfied to recognise the revenue in this connection, and the concept of guarantees are included in Note 1.3.3.4. Also, the main judgements and estimates used to recognise revenue are disclosed in Note 1.3.4.
As to assets relating to bid costs and to mobilisation costs corresponding to contracts with customers, the balances recognised in the consolidated statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017 are disclosed in Note 4.1, Inventories.

SECTION 5: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING

The Notes in this section describe the changes in the financial structure of Ferrovial as a result of changes in equity (see Note 5.1) and in its consolidated net debt (see Note 5.2), taken to be the balance of cash and cash equivalents net of the financial debt, bank borrowings and debt securities, making a distinction between non-infrastructure project companies and infrastructure projects. They also describe the Group's exposure to the main financial risks and the policies for managing them (see Note 5.4), as well as the derivatives arranged in connection with those policies (see Note 5.5).

The equity attributable to the shareholders (see Note 5.1) decreased with respect to 2016, due to the impact of the early application of IFRS 15 (discussed in Note 1.3.1), the expense recognised directly in equity (arising from the exchange rate effect, pensions and derivatives) and to shareholder remuneration, which was offset in part by the increase in the consolidated net profit and the subordinated hybrid bond issue.

At 31 December 2015, the consolidated net debt of Ferrovial's non-

infrastructure project companies was a positive net cash position of EUR

1,341 million, higher than that at December 2016 (EUR 697 million). This

amount includes the cash obtained through the subordinated hybrid

bond issue, which is treated as an equity instrument. Excluding this effect,

mention should be made of the positive cash flows from activity

generated in the year (EUR 896 million), offset by the payment of

dividends (EUR -520 million). The other changes are analysed through

cash

.

NET CASH POSITION EX INFRAESTRUCTURES PROJECT:

553

The consolidated net debt continues to make it possible to amply achieve the objective of maintaining an investment grade rating, where the Company considers a relevant metric a ratio, for non-infrastructure projects, of net debt (gross debt less cash) to gross profit from operations (EBITDA) plus dividends from projects of no more than 2:1. Ferrovial's rating remains unchanged at BBB.
The borrowings of infrastructure projects remained at similar levels to those of 2016 (EUR 5,570 million in December 2017 compared to EUR 5,510 million in December 2016), most noteworthy being the impact of the net drawdowns (EUR 501 million), partially offset by the positive exchange rate effect (EUR 441 million), due mainly to the increase in value of the US dollar.

-272 million.
The consolidated profit for the year attributable to the Parent totalled EUR 454 million
T The income and expense recognised directly in equity relate to:
· Hedging instruments: recognition of the changes in value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting (see Note 5.5), the impact of which was EUR 76 million.

· Defined benefit plans: this item includes the impact on equity of actuarial gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes to the Group 6.2, which had an impact for the Parent of EUR 51 million net of taxes (EUR 63 million at fully consolidated companies (Amey) and EUR -12 million at the companies accounted for using the equity method (HAH/AGS)).
· Translation differences: the currencies to which Ferrovial has the greatest exposure in terms of its equity (mainly the Canadian dollar, the US dollar and the pound sterling), as detailed in Note 5.4, giving rise to translation differences of EUR -318 million attributable to the Parent. Specifically, the depreciation of the Canadian dollar gave rise to translation losses of EUR -124 million. In turn, the depreciation of the US dollar and the pound sterling gave rise to translation losses of EUR -84 million and EUR -49 million, respectively. The impact of the other currencies was EUR -61 million, mainly due to the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Chilean peso.
Amounts transferred to profit or loss:
· This relates mainly to the transfer to profit or loss of fair value changes in derivatives relating to the sale of the 51% ownership interest in Norte Litoral (see Note 1.1.3, Changes in the scope of consolidation).
Shareholder remuneration:
· Scrip dividend: for the third successive year, the Annual General Meeting of Ferrovial, S.A. held on 5 April 2017 approved a flexible shareholder remuneration scheme, whereby the shareholders can freely choose to receive newly issued shares of the Company by subscribing a capital increase with a charge to reserves or an amount in cash through the transfer to the Company (if they have not already done so in the market) of the bonus issue rights corresponding to the shares held by them. As a result of this resolution, in 2017 two capital increases were performed with the following characteristics:
· In May 2017 6,971,168 new shares were issued with a charge to reserves at a par value of EUR 0.20 per share, representing a capital increase of EUR 1 million, and EUR 97 million of bonus shares were purchased, representing a payment per share of EUR 0.315.
· In October 2017 9,746,022 new shares were issued with a charge to reserves at a par value of EUR 0.20 per share, representing a capital increase of EUR 2 million, and EUR 121 million of bonus shares were purchased, representing a payment per share of EUR 0.404.
· EUR -218 million are included in this connection in the foregoing table.
· Acquisition of treasury shares: the Annual General Meeting of Ferrovial, S.A. held on 5 April 2017 approved a treasury share purchase plan the objective of which was a subsequent capital reduction through the retirement of the shares purchased. This transaction is described in Note 5.1.2-c below.
· As can be observed in the preceding table, the cash flow impact of the remuneration of shareholders in 2017 amounted to EUR 520 million (see Note 5.3), of which EUR 218 million related to the scrip dividend and EUR 302 million to treasury share transactions.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  189

Other transactions:

· Capital increases corresponding to non-controlling interests: increase of EUR 33 million in the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests, principally at the US North Tarrant Express Segments 3 toll road.

· Share-based remuneration schemes: in 2017 a total of 830,371 treasury shares were acquired, representing 0.11% of the share capital of Ferrovial and with a total par value of EUR 0.2 million, which were subsequently delivered, together with the treasury shares existing at the beginning of the year, to beneficiaries under sharebased remuneration schemes. The total cost of acquisition of these shares was EUR 15 million and the result recognised on these transactions in the Company's equity amounts to EUR 1 million.

· It should be noted, as discussed in Note 5.5, that the Company has arranged equity swaps in order to hedge against the possible impact on equity resulting from the exercise of the share-based remuneration schemes. These instruments gave rise to cash inflows of EUR 3 million and the changes in the fair value thereof had an impact on the financial result of EUR 5 million.

· Subordinated hybrid bond: increase in equity was recognised as a result of the issue of this perpetual bond for EUR 500 million, as described in Note 5.1.2-d) on other equity instruments.

· Other changes: this includes mainly an impact of EUR -68 million on equity attributable to the Parent resulting from the acquisition of 6.3% and 3.6% of the US toll roads NTE Mobility Partners, LLC and LBJ Infrastructure Group, respectively, as described in Note 1.3. This transaction also entailed an impact of EUR -27 million on equity attributable to nonNon-Controlling Interests companies in Note 5.1.2-h), giving rise to a total impact on consolidated equity of EUR -95 million.

The Annual General Meeting of Ferrovial, S.A. held on 5 April 2017 approved a treasury share purchase plan for a maximum amount of EUR 275 million the objective of which was a subsequent capital reduction through the retirement thereof. As a result of this resolution, in 2017 14,593,242 shares were acquired at an average price of EUR 18.8 per share, giving rise to a payment totalling EUR 275 million. Subsequently, it was resolved to reduce capital by 17,000,192 shares, giving rise to a capital reduction of EUR 3 million and an impact of EUR -298 million, which was recognised against unrestricted reserves (merger premium) and related to the difference between the acquisition price and the par value of the retired shares. 1,569,148 treasury shares with a value of EUR 29 million were also acquired. Thus, treasury shares totalling EUR 302 million were acquired.

The fair value of the treasury shares held by Ferrovial at 31 December 2017 (2,167,237 shares) was EUR 41 million.

d) Other equity instruments

The Group, through its subsidiary Ferrovial Netherlands BV and with Ferrovial, S.A. acting as guarantor, issued in December 2017 subordinated perpetual bonds for a nominal amount of EUR 500 million with an annual coupon of 2.124% up to the first recalculation date (May 2023). The coupon will be changed after the first recalculation date to a rate equal to the five-year swap rate at that date plus 2.127%. The same calculation will be performed in May 2043; however, in this case, the fiveyear swap rate at that date will be increased by 2.877%.

in five and a half years (2023) from the issue date (from 14 February 2023 to 14 May 2023, inclusive) and, subsequently, on each coupon payment date. Ferrovial also has the power to delay the timing of the coupon payment, which cannot be claimed by the bondholders.

5.2. Consolidated net debt
In order to present an analysis of the Group's net debt position, the following table contains a breakdown of the net cash position, distinguishing between infrastructure project companies and the other companies. The net cash position is understood to be the balance of the items included under "Cash and Cash Equivalents", together with restricted cash classified at long term relating to the infrastructure projects, less financial debt (bank borrowings and debt securities) at short and long term.
Also, the net cash position includes forwards totalling EUR 18 million that hedge the cash held by the Group in US and Canadian dollars, as well as cross-currency swaps, with a value of EUR -17 million, associated with the borrowings denominated in US dollars. The derivatives are accounted for in this way because they are associated in full with the aforementioned borrowings/cash and the related exchange rate effect is netted off therefrom.
Although in general the method used to define the Group's net cash position coincides with that used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2016, in 2017 certain Canadian dollar and US dollar forwards hedging deposits in those currencies, which are recognised und

192  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

Restricted cash is classified as short-term or long-term depending on whether it must remain restricted for less than or more than one year. In any event, these funds are invested in highly-liquid financial products earning floating interest. The type of financial product in which the funds may be invested is also restricted by the financing agreements or, where no restrictions are stipulated, the decision is

cash surpluses.

Short-term balances, which amount to EUR 58 million (31 December d Cash

whereas long-term balances, of EUR 285 million (31 December 2016: EUR 249 million), are classified as financial assets. Therefore, the restricted cash at 31 December 2017 amounted to EUR 343 million (December 2016: EUR 311 million), including both long- and shortterm amounts. Accordingly, there was a net change of EUR 32 million, due to:

· An increase therein of EUR 63 million (excluding the exchange rate effect), mainly at the NTE and LBJ toll roads (EUR 35 million and EUR

Autopistas del Sol C.E.A.S.A., amounting to EUR 7 million, in relation to debt servicing and future investments.

· The exchange rate effect, which had a negative impact of EUR -31 million, arose mainly due to fluctuations in the US dollar (see Note 1.4).

The other cash and cash equivalents relate to bank accounts and highly-liquid investments subject to interest rate risk.

Other infrastructure project borrowings increased by EUR 153 million with respect to December 2016 due mainly to the financing of the project for the remodelling and commercial operation of the Jeppesen Terminal of Denver airport (see Note 1.1.3). This financing was realised through the issue, on 21 December 2017, of a bond for USD 189 million with 5% fixed interest and final maturity in 2049.

The differences between the total maturities of the bank borrowings (EUR 5,615 million) and the carrying amounts thereof at 31 December 2017 (EUR 5,570 million) are explained mainly by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the debts, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation. Thus, the accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method represent an impact of EUR 45 million, taking into account that the maturities of the borrowings do not include interest.
The fair value reflected in the table above is calculated as follows:
· For fixed-rate bonds, subject to changes in value due to fluctuations in market interest rates: since they are quoted in an active market, the related market value is used.
· For fixed-interest bank borrowings, also subject to changes in value due to fluctuations in rates: future cash flows are discounted using a market interest rate, calculated using an internal valuation model.
· Lastly, for floating-rate bank borrowings: no significant differences are deemed to exist between the fair value of the borrowings and their carrying amount and, therefore, the carrying amount is used.

The differences between the total bank borrowings drawn down and the carrying amount of the related debt at 31 December 2017 are explained mainly by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the debts, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation (basically accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method, which are detailed in point b.2 above).

Of the EUR 116 million drawable (31 December 2016: EUR 430 million), EUR 84 million relate mainly to amounts not drawn down against borrowings that were obtained to finance toll roads under construction in the US. It should be noted that this drawable amount

is associated exclusively with the projects, based on the nature and performance thereof, as discussed below.
b.4) Guarantees and covenants for project borrowings
The borrowings classified as project borrowings are without recourse to the shareholders of the projects or with recourse limited to the guarantees provided. The guarantees provided by subsidiaries of Ferrovial in connection with the borrowings of these projects are described in Note 6.5, Contingent liabilities.
At 31 December 2017, all the concession operators were achieving the significant covenants in force. However, it should be noted that at AmeyCespa (MK) SPV Limited, concession operator of a waste plant in the United Kingdom, there was a delay in the repayment of the debt (EUR 145 million at the end of 2017) due to the delay in collection by the client. It is estimated that the debt will finally be repaid in March 2018.

a.1.1) Corporate debt:

The corporate debt comprises the following debt instruments:

· On the one hand, the debt consists of five corporate bonds the carrying amount of which totals EUR 2,323 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 1,824 million). The characteristics of these bonds are as follows:

ANNUAL COUPON 3.375% 3.375% 2.500% 0.375% 1.375%

The bonds issued in 2013 are traded on the secondary market of the London Stock Exchange, while those issued in 2014, 2016 and 2017 are admitted to trading on the Spanish AIAF fixed-income market. All these issues are guaranteed by Ferrovial S.A., the Parent of the Group. It should be noted that the Group has interest rate derivatives associated with the corporate bonds, with a notional amount of EUR 250 million; these derivatives convert the fixed interest rate into a floating one, see Note 5.5.

· On the other hand, the Group has a liquidity facility, negotiated in 2014 with a series of creditor banks, with a current limit of EUR 1,250 million (31 December 2016: EUR 1,250 million), against which EUR 232 million have been drawn down, which matures in March 2022. The foreign currency and interest rate risks on these borrowings were hedged using the cross currency swaps described in Note 5.5, guaranteeing a hedged notional amount of EUR 250 million at a fixed interest rate of 0.4390%, thus giving rise to income for the Group.

Also, the Group has other facilities negotiated in 2017 with a current limit of EUR 175 million (31 December 2016: EUR 20 million) against which EUR 18 million have been drawn down.

The interest rate negotiated is tied to EURIBOR plus a spread based on the average rating assigned to the borrowings of Ferrovial S.A., the Parent of the Group.

Corporate credit rating

The credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch maintained their opinions on the credit rating of Ferrovial's corporate debt at December 2017, which was assigned ratings of BBB and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, and, therefore, came under the

a.1.2) Broadspectrum borrowings

(2016: EUR 475 million). This decrease is due to the partial repayment in 2017 of the debt assumed in the purchase of Broadspectrum in 2016. In particular, in May the Company repaid its high yield bonds amounting to USD 325 million (net amount of the cross-currency swap). This transaction helped to optimise the

The differences between the total maturities of borrowings and the carrying amounts of the debt at 31 December 2017 are explained mainly by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the debts, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation (basically accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method).
The fair value of bank borrowings excluding infrastructure projects coincides with the related carrying amount because the borrowings are tied to floating market interest rates and, therefore, changes in the benchmark interest rates do not affect their fair value.
As regards corporate bonds: since they are quoted in an active market, the related market value is used.
Based on the aforementioned criteria, the estimated total fair value of bank borrowings and bonds excluding infrastructure projects was EUR 2,632 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 2,735 million).
The 2018 maturities amount to EUR 541 million and relate mainly to the maturity of the first corporate bond for EUR 500 million and borrowings associated with Broadspectrum, of EUR 34 million, and Inagra, S.A., totalling EUR 6 million. The debt maturities do not include interest.
b) Cash and cash equivalents of other companies
Although in general the method used to classify the cash and cash equivalents at short- and long-term coincides with that used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2016, in 2017 certain Canadian dollar and US dollar forwards hedging

5.3. Cash flow
The consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared in accordance with IAS 7. This Note provides an additional breakdown in this connection based on internal criteria established by the Company for business performance purposes, which in certain cases differ from the provisions of IAS 7. The main criteria applied are as follows:
· In order to provide a clearer explanation of the cash generated, the Group
treated as financial assets and the investments in the capital of these companies are therefore included in cash flows from investing activities and the yields from the investments (dividends and capital reimbursements) are included in cash flows from operating activities,
from the operating and financing activities of infrastructure project concession operators.
· The treatment given to interest received on cash and cash equivalents differs from that in the statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with IAS 7, since this interest is included in cash flows from financing activities as a reduction of the amount recognised under "Interest Cash Flows".
· Lastly, the statement of cash flows endeavours to present the changes in the net cash position as the net amount of borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. This method also departs from that established in IAS 7, which explains the changes in cash and cash equivalents.

addition to the net cash position.
Also, at 31 December there were certain restricted accounts totalling EUR 31 million (31 December 2016: EUR 37 million) associated mainly with the developments in progress of Budimex.

Change in working capital:

The change in working capital disclosed in the foregoing table is the measure that explains the difference between the Group's EBITDA (Gross profit from operations) and its cash flows from operating activities before tax; it arises from the difference between the accrual of revenue and expenses for accounting purposes and the time when such revenue and expenses are transformed into cash, and relates mainly to changes in the balances of trade receivables and payables to suppliers or other items in the consolidated statement of financial position. Thus, a reduction in the balance of trade receivables will give rise to an improvement in working capital and a reduction in the balance of payables to suppliers will give rise to a worsening of working capital.

The changes in this item do not exactly coincide with the changes in working capital reported in Section 4 of the consolidated financial statements for the following reasons:

The positive impact of the changes in working capital in the consolidated statement of financial position (EUR +130 million) is explained by the increase in Trade receivables, due mainly to the collection of advances received in the Construction business (especially the I-66) and amounts received from infrastructure projects to which the financial asset model is applied, most noteworthy being Autema (see the detail in Section 4). This positive impact is offset by the changes in provisions (EUR -111 million), the most noteworthy of which is the net effect of the recognition/reversal of provisions with an impact on EBITDA (EUR 70 million), that do not give rise to cash outflows, in addition to the use of provisions with a balancing entry in working capital accounts (EUR -181 million), which do give rise to a cash outflow. Also, various items included in operating cash flows with an impact on other items in the consolidated statement of financial position must be borne in mind, such as pension plans and share-based remuneration schemes, as well as the effect of other financial results, (unrelated to financing) such as late-payment interest and guarantees. Taking into account all these changes, the working capital reported in cash flow amounts to EUR -53 million.
The differences mentioned above relate to the following items:
· Changes in working capital with an impact on other cash flow line items. The working capital accounts reported in Section 4, especially the payables to suppliers, can relate to transactions that do not affect cash flows from operating activities, such as non-current asset purchases.
· Changes in provisions with an impact on gross profit from operations or on working capital. These relate to the recognition/reversal of provisions with an impact on gross profit from operations, which does not have an impact on cash, or provisions used with a balancing entry in working capital accounts (see Note 6. 3).

· Changes in other statement of financial position items with an impact on cash flows from operating activities. The changes in working capital reported in Section 4 reflect only movements in items included under
Payab expenses relate not only to items shown in working capital (current

items) but also to certain items recognised as non-current assets and liabilities, such as non-current trade receivables and non-current payables to suppliers, or even to items in equity accounts such as transactions relating to share-based remuneration schemes. Also, this line item includes other financial result items not directly related to financing, such as late-payment interest and guarantee expenses.

5.4. Management of financial risks and capital
s activities are exposed to changes in the financial variables affecting their accounts, particularly interest rate, foreign currency, credit, liquidity and equity risk. The policies adopted by the Group in managing these risks are explained in detail in the directors' report.
Following are specific data on the Group's exposure to each of these risks and an analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the various variables, together with a brief description of the management of each risk.
In addition, in view of the economic and political importance of the UK's decision to leave withdraw from the European Union (Brexit), this Note includes a separate in-depth analysis of the impact it has had for Ferrovial with respect to the various financial risks and how these risks are being managed.

a. Exposure to interest rate risk
Ferrovial's businesses are subject to changes in the economic cycles and interest rate risk management takes this into consideration, modelling interest rate settings against financial instrument liquidity management. When interest rates are low, the Group seeks to fix future levels at noninfrastructure project level, although such hedging can affect liquidity in the event of cancellation. At infrastructure project level, the banks and rating agencies require a higher percentage of fixed-rate debt. These strategies are achieved by issuing fixed-rate debt or by arranging hedging financial derivatives, a detail of which is provided in Note 5.5, Derivative financial instruments at fair value. The aim of these hedges is to optimise the finance costs borne by the Group.
indicating the percentage of the debt that is considered to be hedged (either by a fixed rate or by derivatives).

Also, it must be borne in mind that the results relating to companies accounted for using the equity method include the results corresponding to the 25% ownership interest in HAH and the ownership interest of 43.23% in 407 ETR. As indicated in Note 3.5, the two companies have a significant volume of debt, of which 93% (HAH) and 100% (407 ETR) is hedged against interest rate risk.

Based on the foregoing, at the fully consolidated companies, a linear increase of 100 basis points in the market yield curves at 31 December 2017 would increase the finance costs in the statement of profit or loss by an estimated EUR 6 million, of which EUR 3 million relate to infrastructure projects and EUR 4 million to non-infrastructure project companies, with a net impact on the profit of Ferrovial of EUR -5 million.

It is also necessary to take into account changes in the fair value of the financial derivatives arranged, which are indicated in Note 5.5.

As regards these interest rate hedging instruments, a linear increase of 100 basis points in the market yield curves at 31 December 2017 would, in the case of the effective hedges, have a net positive impact of EUR 205 million on the equity attributable to the Parent (EUR 111 million at companies accounted for using the equity method, EUR 94 million at fully consolidated companies).

b. Exposure to foreign currency risk

Ferrovial monitors regularly the planned net exposure per currency for the coming years both for dividends receivable, investments in new projects and possible divestments.

Ferrovial establishes its hedging strategy by analysing past changes in both short- and long-term exchanges rates, establishing monitoring mechanisms such as future projections and long-term equilibrium exchange rates. These hedges are established by using foreign currency deposits or arranging derivatives (see Note 11 for more details).

The following tables show, by type of currency, the values of assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and equity attributable to the Parent at December 2017, adjusted by the aforementioned currency forwards corresponding to each currency:

Note 1.4 contains a detail of the changes in the year in the closing exchange rates. As a result of these changes, the impact of translation differences on equity at 31 December 2017 was EUR -318 million for the Parent and EUR -60 million for non-controlling interests. Of the aforementioned EUR -318 million, EUR -124 million correspond to changes in the Canadian dollar, EUR -49 million to changes in the pound sterling, EUR -84 million to changes in the US dollar and EUR -61 million to changes in other currencies.
After analysing the sensitivity to changes in exchange rates, Ferrovial has estimated that a possible 10% appreciation of the euro at year-end against the main currencies in which the Group has investments would
43% would relate to the effect of the pound sterling and 39% to that of the Canadian dollar. This fluctuation in the value of the euro would give rise to a change in total assets of EUR 1,638 million, of which 45% would relate to the investments in US dollars, 22% to the investments in pounds sterling and 19% to the investments in Canadian dollars.
Also, the detail of the net profit attributable to the Parent by type of currency for 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

CHANGE 17/16 192 92 -69

Ferrovial actively monitors its risk exposure to its various counterparties:

· Banks: Ferrovial constantly analyses changes in the short- and longterm public ratings issued by the three main agencies (S&P, Fitch and

regulations for the management of surpluses govern maximum investment limits with each counterparty using objective criteria: these regulations establish minimum rating requirements to be able to invest cash surpluses and establishes certain limits on such investments based on the rating of each bank. Also, the Financial Risk department monitors the evolution of various counterparties and proposes the appropriate corrective and preventive measures in each particular case.

· Geographical areas: Ferrovial monitors the evolution of the (geographical) markets in which it has a presence, and in its target markets. The Financial Risk department proposes potential actions for occasions when changes in specific geographical areas/markets are expected.

· Customers: and the Group has a uniform methodology for assigning credit ratings to customers.

d. Exposure to liquidity risk

The Group has established the mechanisms necessary to preserve the level of liquidity that reflect the cash generation and need projections, in relation to both short-term collections and payments and obligations to be met at long term.

Non-infrastructure project companies

At 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 4,137 million (2016: EUR 3,301 million). Also, at that date undrawn credit lines totalled EUR 1,641 million (2016: EUR 1,471 million).

Infrastructure projects

At 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents (including short-term restricted cash) amounted to EUR 463 million (2016: EUR 277 million). Also, at that date undrawn credit lines amounted to EUR 116 million (2016: EUR 430 million), which were arranged mainly to cover committed investment needs.

e. Exposure to equity risk

Ferrovial is also exposed to the risk relating to the fluctuation of its share price. This exposure arises specifically in equity swaps used to hedge against risks of appreciation of share-based remuneration schemes, the detail of which is shown in Note 5.5 to these consolidated financial statements.

Since these equity swaps are not classified as hedging derivatives, their market value has an impact on profit or loss and, accordingly, a EUR 1 increase/decrease in the Ferrovial share price would have a positive/negative impact of EUR 2 million on the net profit of Ferrovial.
f. Exposure to inflation risk
Most of the revenue from infrastructure projects is associated with prices tied directly to inflation. This is the case of the prices of both the toll road concession contracts and those of HAH, which are accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, a scenario of rising inflation would result in an increase the cash flow from assets of this nature. Also, the defined benefit pension plans in the UK have obligations tied to inflation, which are covered on an individualised basis, since they are not included in consolidation at Ferrovial.
Unlike the Company's other assets, from the accounting standpoint the derivatives arranged at HAH the objective of which is to convert fixedrate borrowings into index-linked debt are measured at fair value through profit or loss, since hitherto they have been considered to be ineffective derivatives. HAH is assessing whether or not to classify them as hedge accounting under the new standards (IFRS 9). The accounting impact to date is that an increase of 100 b.p. throughout the inflation curve would have an effect on the net profit attributable to Ferrovial (in proportion to its percentage of ownership) of EUR -162 million.
Also, in the case of the toll road concession operator Autema, there is a derivative tied to inflation that is deemed to qualify for hedge accounting, in which an increase of 100 b.p. throughout the inflation curve would have a negative effect on reserves of EUR -110 million.
g. Capital management
The Group aims to achieve a debt-equity ratio that makes it possible to optimise costs while safeguarding its capacity to continue managing its recurring activities and the capacity to continue to grow through new projects in order to create shareholder value.
Ferrovial's objective with regard to financial debt is to maintain a low level of indebtedness, excluding infrastructure project debt, such that it can retain its investment grade credit rating. In order to achieve this target it has established a clear and adequate financial policy in which a relevant metric refers to a maximum ratio, for non-infrastructure projects, of net debt (gross debt less cash) to gross profit from operations plus dividends from projects of 2:1.
At 31 December 2017, the net cash position was positive (assets exceeded liabilities) and, therefore, the difference with respect to the maximum debt-equity ratio established is very significant. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, "net debt excluding infrastructure projects" is defined in Note 5.2 and "gross profit from operations plus dividends" is the profit from operations before impairment losses, disposals and depreciation and amortisation of the Group companies other than infrastructure concession operators, plus the dividends received from infrastructure projects.
h. Impact of Brexit on financial risks
This section includes an analysis of the impact that Brexit is having for Ferrovial with respect to financial risks and how these risks are being managed. The risk section of the directors' report contains a comprehensive analysis of Brexit and how it may affect the Group's various business areas.

Exchange rate

In 2017 and in the midst of the negotiations between the UK and the European Union, the pound sterling continued its trend of weakness

against the euro, although to a much lesser extent than in 2016 when Brexit was announced. At 31 December 2017, the pound sterling had fallen by 4% compared with the year-ago exchange rate. In order to hedge its foreign currency risk, Ferrovial has arranged hedges with a notional amount of GBP 437 million, which approximately cover the dividends it expects to receive on its UK assets over the next three years.
Inflation and interest rates
The market has lowered its expectations with respect to the future RPI Retail Price Index by an average of 0.20%, with a level of 3.3% and a lower actual rate, with interest rates remaining at similar levels.
Once again the market expectation is for current levels to be maintained, although a negative impact on Brexit would push inflation up and adversely affect the value of pension las obligations and the nominal interest rate, increasing the cost of financing.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  205

Following is a description of the main types of derivatives and of the most significant changes therein in 2017:
Toll Road Division derivatives
Interest rate swaps, Toll Roads
In order to hedge the interest rate risk in toll road infrastructure projects, the concession holders have arranged interest rate hedges on the
notional amount of EUR 883 million at 31 December 2017. Overall, the fair value of these hedges increased from EUR -399 million at 31 December 2016 to EUR -357 million at 31 December 2017.
In general, since these derivatives are considered to be effective, the changes in their fair value are recognised in reserves, with an impact of EUR 42 million (EUR 31 million attributable to the Parent, after tax and non-controlling interests).
The changes in settlements and accruals gave rise to an impact on the financial result of EUR -45 million and of EUR -46 million in cash.
Index-linked swaps, Toll Roads
This item relates exclusively to Autema, which in 2008 arranged an index linked swap to hedge income variability, by means of which an annual CPI of 2.50% was fixed. This hedge, which was considered effective, had an impact of EUR -5 million on reserves (EUR -3 million after tax attributable to the Parent).

Corporate derivatives
Interest rate swaps, Corporate
In relation to the bond issues launched in 2013, the Group arranged interest rate derivatives for a notional amount of EUR 250 million expiring in 2021. Since they convert a portion of the fixed interest rate on the bonds into a floating interest rate, these derivatives constitute a partial fair value economic hedge of the aforementioned bond issues and they all qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value impact of these bonds on the financial result amounted to EUR 0.4 million.
Cross-currency swaps, Corporate
In September 2016 Ferrovial arranged cross-currency swaps to hedge a drawdown of borrowings in US dollars (see Note 5.2.2). The notional amount of these instruments is USD 279 million (EUR 232 million) and they expire in 2019. The changes in value thereof are recognised in reserves (EUR 0.1 million in 2017), for the interest rate component, and Result on exchange differences, for the foreign currency hedge component (EUR -32 million in 2017).
Equity swaps
Ferrovial has arranged equity swaps in order to hedge against the possible impact on equity resulting from the exercise of the share-based remuneration schemes granted to its employees.

206  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

The modus operandi of these equity swap contracts is as follows:
· The calculation base is a given number of Ferrovial shares and a reference price, which is normally the market price of the share on the grant date.
· For the duration of the contract, Ferrovial pays interest equivalent to a given interest rate (EURIBOR plus a spread, to be applied to the result of multiplying the number of shares by the exercise price) and receives remuneration equal to the dividends corresponding to those shares.
· When the swap expires, if the share price has increased, Ferrovial will receive the difference between the market price and the reference price. If the share price has fallen, Ferrovial will pay the difference to the bank.
At 2017 year-end, these derivatives had a notional amount equivalent to 2.7 million shares, which, based on the exercise price of the equity swaps (the price at which they must be settled with the banks), represented a total notional amount of EUR 50 million.
Exchange rate derivatives, Corporate
These derivatives relate to Corporate hedges of foreign currency risk, the main aim of which is to protect against the volatility of future cash

flows in foreign currencies (basically the pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the US dollar, and the Canadian dollar). Their notional value amounted to EUR 2,335 million at 31 December 2017, of which EUR 976 million relate to the Canadian dollar, EUR 552 million relate to the US dollar, EUR 596 million to the Australian dollar, EUR 190 million to the pound sterling and EUR 21 million to the New Zealand dollar. They expire at short term. The changes in their value are recognised as translation differences and amounted to EUR 77 million in 2017 (for effective derivatives). Options, which are not classified as accounting hedges, are recognised in financial results at fair value and in 2017 represented an expense of EUR -16 million.
Derivatives, Services Division
Cross-currency swaps, Broadspectrum
The cross-currency swaps arranged at 2016 year-end hedged mainly fluctuations in the fair value of the High Yield Bonds issued in US dollars by converting this debt into Australian dollars at floating rate. Since this debt was repurchased in May 2017, this derivative was derecognised, giving rise to a variation of EUR 82 million in 2017. In addition, there was a liability balance of another EUR 3 million at December 2016 hedging debt issues denominated in Chilean pesos, which were also derecognised in 2017.

Derivatives are recognised at market value at the arrangement date and at fair value at subsequent dates. Changes in the value of these derivatives are recognised for accounting purposes as follows:
· The changes in the year in the fair value of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves (column I).
· The changes in fair value of the derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that are considered to be held for speculative purposes are recognised as a fair value adjustment in Group profit or loss (column II) and are reflected separately in the statement of profit or loss.

c) Derivative measurement methods
instruments carried at fair value are included in LEVEL 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, since although they are not quoted on regulated markets, the inputs on which their fair values are based are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Although the fair value measurements are performed by the Company using an internally developed valuation tool based on best market practices, they are in any event compared with the valuations received from the counterparty banks on a monthly basis.
Equity swaps are measured as the difference between the market price of the share on the calculation date and the unit settlement (strike) price agreed at inception, multiplied by the number of shares under the contract.
The other instruments are measured by quantifying the net future cash inflows and outflows, discounted to present value, with the following specific features:
· Interest rate swaps: the future cash flows with floating reference rates are estimated by using current market projections at the measurement date for each currency and settlement frequency; and each flow is updated using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the measurement date.
· Index-linked swaps: the future cash flows are estimated by projecting the future behaviour implicit in the market curves on the measurement date for each currency and settlement frequency, for both reference interest rates and reference inflation rates. As in the cases described above, the flows are discounted using the discount rates obtained at the measurement date for each flow settlement period and currency.
· Cross-currency swaps: the future cash flows with floating reference rates are estimated by using current market projections at the measurement date for each currency and settlement frequency; and

each flow is updated using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the measurement date, including the cross-currency basis spreads. The present value of the flows in a currency other than the measurement currency is translated at the spot exchange rate prevailing at the measurement date.
· Foreign currency derivatives: as a general rule, the future cash flows are estimated by using the exchange rates and market curves associated with each currency pair (forward points curve), and each flow is updated using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the measurement date. For other more complex instruments (options, etc.), the valuation models appropriate for each instrument are employed, taking into consideration the necessary market data (volatilities, etc.).
Lastly, credit risk, which is included in the measurement of derivatives pursuant to IFRS 13, is estimated as follows:
· in order to calculate the adjustments associated with own and counterparty credit risk (CVAs/DVAs), Ferrovial applies a methodology based on calculating the future exposure of the various financial products using Monte Carlo simulations. To this potential exposure, a probability of default and a loss given y are applied, as well as a discount factor based on the currency and applicable maturity at the measurement date.
· In order to calculate the probabilities of default of the Ferrovial Group companies, the Credit Risk Management department assesses the rating of the counterparty (company, project, etc.) using a proprietary, rating agency-based methodology. This rating is used to obtain market spread curves according to the currency and term in question (generic curves by rating level).
· In order to calculate the probabilities of default of the counterparties, the CDS curves of those companies are used, if available; otherwise, the CDS curves of a similar entity (proxy) or a generic spread curve (by rating level) are used.

208 I 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

SECTION 6: OTHER DISCLOSURES

This section includes other Notes required under the applicable legislation.
Of particular note due to its importance is Note 6.5, Contingent liabilities and investment commitments, in which the main lawsuits that affect the Group companies are described, with particular emphasis on the guarantees provided by non-infrastructure project companies on behalf of infrastructure project companies.

The changes in liabilities other than current liabilities and borrowings, such as pension obligations (see Note 6.2) and provisions (see Note 6.3), are also analysed.

6.1. Deferred income
million at the end of 2017 (2016: EUR 1,118 million), of which EUR 1,033 million correspond to grants related to assets received from the infrastructure concession grantors, primarily in the Toll Roads Division (EUR 1,012 million) and in the Services Division (EUR 8 million).
Within the Toll Roads Division, these grants are mainly broken down into the following projects: LBJ Infrastructure Group (EUR 399 million); NTE Mobility Partners (EUR 487 million); NTE Mobility Partners Segments 3 LLC (EUR 81 million); and, lastly, I-77 Mobility Partners (EUR 45 million).
The main change in 2017 took place at NTE Mobility Partners Segments 3 and I-77 Mobility Partners, subsidiaries of Cintra in the US, which received additional grants in 2017 amounting to EUR 24 million and EUR 33 million, respectively, offset by a decrease of EUR 74 million and EUR 60 million as a result of the grants being taken to profit or loss in the framework of the NTE Mobility Partners and LBJ Infrastructures projects.
There was also a decrease of EUR 137 million at the US companies due to the depreciation of the US dollar with respect to the euro.
These grants related to assets are recognised in profit or loss over the periods and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those assets is recognised. The impact of these grants on cash flows is presented as a reduction of cash flows from investing activities.
6.2. Pension plan deficit
This line item reflects the deficit relating to pension and other employee retirement benefit plans, including both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The provision recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 amounted to EUR 66 million (31 December 2016: EUR 174 million). Of this amount, EUR 64 million (31 December 2016: EUR 172 million) relate to defined benefit plans of the Amey Group in the UK.
The accompanying table analyses the chang deficit. As the table shows, the main changes relate to the actuarial gains and losses (EUR 76 million) and the contributions made (EUR 39 million).

· An impact of EUR 76 million arising from actuarial gains and losses which reduced the contribution to the pension plan deficit (a decrease in the related liability) recognised in equity. This improvement of EUR 76 million is explained in part from the perspective of obligations (EUR 31 million), broken down into a change in the demographic assumptions (EUR 23 million) and an improvement in future expectations due to lower inflation projections (EUR 26 million) and partially reduced by the worsening in the actuarial assumptions used due to a decrease in the discount rate (EUR -18 million). The actuarial improvement relating to assets (EUR 45 million) was due to the positive performance of the markets associated therewith. More details are provided in section a) of this Note.

· Contributions of EUR 39 million made by the Company to the pension plans, which reduced the pension plan deficit (a decrease in the related liability). The ordinary contributions amounted to EUR 4 million, while the extraordinary contributions aimed at improving the pension plan deficit totalled EUR 35 million.

· A negative impact of EUR -11 million on profit or loss, which increased the pension plan deficit (an increase in the related liability), as detailed in section b) of this Note.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  209

· A positive impact of EUR 5 million due to the exchange rate effect, giving rise to a decrease in the deficit.

Also, although they did not have any effect on the pension plan deficit, there were curtailments and settlements as a result of the payment of obligations to employees, which therefore reduced the related obligation at year-end and gave rise to a reduction of the same amount in the plan assets. In 2017 these curtailments and settlements totalled EUR 37 million.

a) Actuarial gains and losses recognised in reserves

The effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions relating to the defined benefit pension plans of the Amey Group are recognised directly in equity and are summarised (before taxes) in the following table:

The table above shows the changes in the year by detailing separately, on the one hand, the charges for the year and reversals that had an impact on the different lines in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and, on the other, other changes which did not have an impact thereon, such as changes in the scope of consolidation and transfers, amounts used recognised in different headings in the consolidated statement of financial position and exchange rate effect.
In this regard, on analysing the effect on the consolidated statement of profit or loss, mention should be made of the net charge (expense) of EUR (70) million with an impact on gross profit from operations, as well as EUR 181 million relating to amounts used recognised in current assets or liabilities. The sum of both figures is consistent with the EUR 111 million allocated for the purpose of working capital in cash flows (see Note 5.3).
Also, as explained in Note 1.1.3, the impact of the transition to IFRS 15 gave rise to a EUR 26 million increase in the Group's provisions, relating mainly to the Services business.
Provision for landfills
and post-closure activities relating to the landfills operated by the Ferrovial Services business in Spain and UK. The provision is calculated based on a technical estimate of the consumption to date of the total capacity of the respective landfills. This provision is recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in provisions within gross profit from operations in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, as the costs required for closure of the landfill are incurred.

Provision for compulsory purchases
The provision for compulsory purchases recognised by the Spanish toll roads, totalling EUR 25 million (31 December 2016: EUR 29 million). This provision is charged against the concession infrastructure as the costs are incurred over the concession term.
Provision for replacements and upgrades pursuant to IFRIC 12
This line item includes the provisions for investments in replacements established by IFRIC 12 (see Note 1.3.3.2). The balance of this heading increased by EUR 17 million from EUR 109 million at December 2016 to EUR 126 million at 31 December 2017. This provision is recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to the depreciation and amortisation charge over the period in which the obligations accrue, until the replacement becomes operational.
Provisions for litigation and tax claims
The provisions for litigation amount to EUR 443 million (31 December 2016: EUR 415 million). This line item includes:
· Provisions to cover the possible risks resulting from litigation in progress, amounting to EUR 189 million (31 December 2016: EUR 168 million), of which EUR 94 million (31 December 2016: EUR 121 million) relate to the construction business and EUR 91 million (31 December 2016: EUR 42 million) relate to litigation of the Services business, the details of which are provided in Note 6.5. to these consolidated financial statements. These provisions are recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in provisions within gross profit from operations.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  211

· Provisions for tax claims, amounting to EUR 254 million (31 December 2016: EUR 247 million), arising in relation to local or central government duties, income taxes and other taxes, as a result of the varying interpretations that can be made of the tax legislation in the various countries in which the Group operates.

· This provision is recognised and reversed with a charge/credit to gross profit from operations, financial result and/or income tax, depending on the nature of the tax for which the provision has been recognised (penalties, related interest, and/or tax deficiencies in assessments signed on a contested basis).

Provisions for other long-term risks

This line item includes the provisions recognised to cover certain longterm risks other than those attributable to litigation or tax claims, such as third-party liability resulting from the performance of contracts, guarantees provided with enforcement risk and other similar items, which amounted to EUR 84 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 79 million).

Short-term provisions

At 31 December 2017 short-term provisions totalled EUR 629 million (31

December 2016: EUR 702 million)

-

mainly the provisions relating to contracts with customers, such as the

provisions for deferred expenses (relating to construction work completion

and site removal under the related contract) and the provisions for

budgeted losses. In this respect, provisions of this type are concentrated

mainly in the Construction Division and amount to EUR 432 million (2016:

EUR 540 million) and in the Services Division where they amount to EUR

186 million (31 December 2016: EUR 152 million). These provisions are

recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in

provisions within gross profit from operations.

6.4. Other non-current liabilities

-Current Liabilities -

· The participating loans granted by the State to various infrastructure project concession operators amounting to EUR 156 million (31 December 2016: EUR 154 million), of which EUR 105 million relate to the Toll Roads division, EUR 41 million to the Services division and EUR 10 million to the Construction division.

· Long-term deposits and guarantees amounting to EUR 7 million (31 December 2016: EUR 8 million), of which EUR 5 million relate to the Services division and EUR 2 million to the Toll Roads division.

· Long-term trade payables of the Services division, amounting to EUR 3 million (31 December 2016: EUR 6 million).

6.5. Contingent liabilities, contingent assets, obligations and commitments
6.5.1. Litigation
In carrying on its activities, the Group is exposed to possible contingent liabilities of varying kinds. These contingent liabilities lead to lawsuits or litigation in relation to which a provision is recognised based on the best estimate of the foreseeable disbursements required to settle the obligation. These provisions are detailed in Note 6.3.

Therefore, no significant liabilities that might have a material adverse effect are expected to arise, other than those for which provisions have already been recognised.
The detail of the most significant litigation, in terms of amount, in the Group's various business divisions is as follows:
a) Litigation relating to the Toll Road business
Autopista Terrasa Manresa (Autema):
On 14 July 2015, the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government officially published Decree 161/2015 which included the amendment of the toll road concession arrangement, whereby the regime changed from a regime under which the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government undertook to pay the concession operator the difference between the tolls collected and the operating surplus established in the Economic and Financial Plan to a system whereby the remuneration earned by the concession operator will depend on the number of the infrastructure's users, with the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government subsidising a portion of the toll paid by the users.
After filing the claim in the proceeding against Decree 161/2015 in October 2016, in December 2016 Decree 337/2016, partially amending Decree 161/2015, was published. Consequently, Autema also challenged Decree 337/2016 and requested the joinder of the two claims into one proceeding given the direct connection between the two decrees challenged. In this connection, the company considers that there are sound arguments to conclude that the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government clearly exceeded the limits of the power to amend the arrangements. Accordingly, the company filed an appeal against the aforementioned Decrees at the High Court of Catalonia.
The joint defendants (the Autonomous Community Government of Catalonia and the Regional Council of Bages) and the phase to propose and take evidence has commenced, with a hearing in which the experts of both parties will reaffirm their reports set for 15 March 2018.
As a result of the amendment to the concession regime and taking into consideration the solid legal position against this amendment, classification of this concession as a financial asset has been maintained. However, the test for impairment on goodwill allocated to this asset has been revised and an impairment loss of EUR 29 million was recognised in 2017 (2016: EUR 21 million) on the basis of the assumptions described in Note 3.1.
M-203 toll road:
On 24 April 2014, the concession operator instigated a proceeding at the Madrid High Court of Justice requesting the termination of the concession arrangement due to a breach by the grantor and the annulment of the penalties imposed on the concession operator due to the halting of the construction work. On 12 February 2015, the concession operator was notified of the judgment handed down by the Madrid High Court of Justice upholding in full the appeal for judicial review. A cassation appeal against this judgment was filed at the Supreme Court by the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid and, lastly, on 22 December 2016, the
Following the decision in the concession operator's favour, it has requested through various channels that the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid issue a formal administrative decision terminating the concession arrangement and initiating a procedure to settle the arrangement.

212  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

Lastly, by means of the Order of the Regional Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Housing of the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid, the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid terminated the concession arrangement. The company is waiting for the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid to: (i) take possession of the construction work; (ii) return the bank guarantees provided as a definitive guarantee; (iii) be subrogated to the compulsory purchase proceedings; and (iv) pay the compensation for the investments made and the damage and losses suffered. This should take place within six months of the date of the aforementioned Order.
As a result of the termination of the concession arrangement, at 31 December 2017 the company reclassified the carrying amount of the asset (EUR 61 million) as an account receivable from the grantor (see Note 3.6).
AP 36 Ocaña - La Roda and Radial 4 toll roads
With respect to the insolvency proceeding of the AP 36 toll road, the company is currently being liquidated. On 14 December 2017, the insolvent parties were served the liquidation plans submitted by the insolvency managers to the judge overseeing the insolvency proceeding, which have not yet been approved.
The insolvency proceeding of the Radial 4 toll road has been in the liquidation phase since 10 May 2017. In September 2017 the insolvency managers filed the liquidation plans, which were approved in an order handed down on 24 October 2017. At the end of 2017 the grantor (Ministry of Public Works) commenced proceedings to terminate the two concession arrangements in relation to which both the insolvency managers and various creditors made submissions. With respect to the Radial 4 toll road, while the Ministry of Public Works is yet to issue a decision in relation to these submissions and definitively terminate the concession arrangement, provisional measures have been adopted that enabled SEITTSA, the public company that will take control of various toll road concession arrangements, to take control of the asset on 21 February 2018.
Furthermore, in relation to the Radial 4 toll road, the decision is yet to be handed down in a lawsuit at the Supreme Court brought by the lenders of the company against its shareholders relating to a guarantee amounting to EUR 14.9 million (in the portion attributable to Ferrovial). Although the decisions handed down previously at first instance and on appeal ruled in
contingency at 31 December 2017.
These companies were excluded from the scope of consolidation in 2015, since the circumstances indicating loss of control were evident: there is no exposure to variable returns from the involvement with the investees and there is no ability to direct the relevant activities of the investees. The performance since then has confirmed the policy applied at that time.
b) Litigation relating to the Construction business
The Group's Construction Division is involved in various lawsuits relating primarily to possible defects in the construction of completed projects and claims for third-party liability.
The provisions recognised in relation to these risks at 31 December 2017 totalled EUR 94 million (2016: EUR 121 million) and relate to a total of approximately 110 lawsuits. The most significant litigation, in terms of amount, in this business area is as follows:
· Muelle del Prat: this corresponds to a claim relating to the construction project for the new container terminal at the Port of Barcelona. The work was performed by Ferrovial Agroman as part of an

unincorporated temporary joint venture (UTE) with other companies. The claim -for an amount of EUR 97 million- was lodged by the Port of Barcelona in September 2011 against all the companies involved in the performance of the project and arose as a result of the damage caused by an accident during construction work. A judgment was handed down in 2013 partially upholding the claim filed by the customer, ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay EUR 20.9 million plus interest. In the first six months of 2014 the insurance companies partially covered the payment of the aforementioned judgment. On 16 March 2016, the Barcelona Provincial Appellate Court handed down a decision ruling in favour of the defendants and dismissing in full the claim lodged by the Barcelona Port Authority; the Port Authority has lodged a cassation appeal against this ruling, in relation to which a decision has not yet been handed down.
· Arbitration in relation to the construction project for Warsaw airport: This corresponds to a claim filed against the UTE formed by Ferrovial Agroman and Budimex in relation to the termination of the contract to construct Terminal 2 of Warsaw Airport. In 2007 the customer enforced a guarantee amounting to EUR 13.5 million and brought a claim against the construction joint venture. In turn, the construction joint venture brought a counterclaim against the customer in relation to the illegal enforcement of the guarantee and uncollected amounts; the net amount of these mutually submitted claims is EUR 18.9 million in favour of the construction joint venture. In September 2012, after the favourable award of the Arbitration Court (confirmed in 2013 by the Supreme Court), the customer returned the enforced guarantee and paid the interest accrued from when the guarantee was enforced.
The deadline established by the Arbitration Court for each party to submit pleadings to defend their claims and to assess the evidence taken to continue with the arbitration is February 2018. In this regard, the expert evidence taken addressed, on the one side, the technical
-Poland Port Authority- unilateral termination of the contract and, on the other, the evidence supporting the amounts claimed as amounts outstanding for work performed and damage and losses, which has yet to be taken.
The company expects the arbitration to be resolved in 2019, but does not rule out a partial arbitral award being issued in the interim. In any event, the account receivable has not been written down since the company considers that the resolution of the arbitration proceeding
claims.
· Construction work relating to the SH-130 toll road in Texas: The company operating segments 5 and 6 of the SH-130 toll road located between Austin and San Antonio in Texas (US) brought a claim to submit to arbitration a dispute with the Ferrovial Agroman investee Central Texas Highway Contractors, LLC, which built the toll road, and with Zachry Industrial, INC. and Ferrovial Agroman, S.A. as several guarantors on a pro rata basis of the former. The arbitration claim is related to the contract for the design and construction of segments 5 and 6 of the SH-130 toll road entered into in 2007. The concession
it considers to amount to at least USD 130 million, of which 50% (USD 65 million) would be attributable to the ownership interest of Ferrovial Agroman, which would not be jointly and severally liable for the ownership interest of the other shareholder.
Although the process is in an initial phase and the company has not had
advisers consider that the construction work on the toll road was

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  213

performed in accordance with the provisions of the contract and industry best practices and that, in any case, any potential liability arising from the litigation's resolution could be reduced by various facts, such as:
· The construction company is covered by an insurance contract;
· The liability for the alleged defects should fall to the companies subcontracted by the construction company for both the design and construction of the road surface; and
· The Texas Department of Transportation and the concession operator appear to have reached an agreement to perform the work to repair the defects for USD 60 million, which is less than 50% of the amount claimed.
· Based on the foregoing, it was concluded that at year-end it was not necessary to recognise a provision in addition to the USD 10 million that the company has already recognised in connection with deferred expenses relating to the guarantee of the construction work performed in this project.
· Arbitration relating to the Cerrejón project in Colombia: On 24 July 2017, Ferrovial Agroman was served notice of the arbitral award relating to a dispute concerning the construction work of a port for the mining company Cerrejón. The construction consortium in which Ferrovial Agroman held an ownership interest of 50% was ordered to pay compensation of EUR 31 million. Since the consortium was jointly and severally liable and the Colombian partner with which Ferrovial Agroman participated therein was involved in insolvency proceedings, Ferrovial Agroman had to pay all of the compensation and recognised a loss for the aforementioned amount that ultimately gave rise to an outflow of cash.
The arbitration was instigated as a result of the termination of the contract requested by the construction consortium in February 2013
on the legal reports available, it was initially considered that the construction consortium had a very sound case and, therefore, no provision was recognised in relation to the arbitration.
In the arbitral award, one of the arbitrators expressed a dissenting opinion and argued that the decision contravened Colombian law and the evidence submitted during the process. The construction consortium brought an appeal to set aside the arbitral award at the Supreme Court of Colombia in relation to which a decision has not yet been handed down.
c) Litigation relating to the Services business
The provisions relating to the Services division totalled EUR 91 million at 2017 year-end (2016 year-end: EUR 42 million). The main lawsuits in progress are as follows:
Regarding the Services business in the UK:
· The main lawsuit in which the company was involved at 31 December 2017 related to the long-term contract entered into by Amey and Birmingham City Council for the rehabilitation and subsequent maintenance and replacement of certain infrastructure in the city up to 2035. On 5 September 2016 a court decision was handed down
parties, although the other party requested permission for the case to be heard at the appeal court.

The disputed matters refer to the scope (Project Network Model and Pavement Management Model) of the construction work performed in
achievement of milestones 6 to 9 in the performance of the aforementioned work, which were initially approved by the City
certain amounts of consideration for achieving the aforementioned milestones.
During 2017 the company was involved in negotiations with Birmingham City Council to reach an out-of-court settlement, although the Council filed an appeal at the appeal court and the negotiations were finally suspended. On 22 February 2018, the appeal court found against Amey in relation to all the matters and the company intends to appeal against the decision at the Supreme Court.
At the reporting date the company was assessing the impact that might arise from the outcome of the judgment and had recognised provisions to cover the contingency of the project amounting to GBP 74.4 million, of which GBP 37.9 million relate to the provision recognised in relation to this lawsuit in 2016 and GBP 36.5 million to the portion of the adjustment due to first-time application of IFRS 15 as a result of considering that certain amounts relating to the achievement of milestones 6 to 9 (initially recognised as revenue) did not meet the requirements of that standard at 31 December 2016 since recognition was dependent on the appeal by Birmingham City Council against the judgment of September 2016.
· The Services business in the UK also received notification of claims by Aggregate Industries, the subcontractor in the Sheffield contract, amounting to GBP 32 million. Of this amount, GBP 21 million relate mainly to claims for delays and additional costs due to the sequence in which the works were executed, and GBP 11 million relate to the new estimates of the work performed. The Group considers that a significant portion of the claim made by the subcontractor, particularly in relation to the first items, has not been proven by Aggregate Industries, which has suspended the claim because it is recalculating the amounts, and it may reactivate it in the coming months. The Group considers that this contingency has been correctly provided for at year-end.
Regarding the Services business in Spain:
· The Group was involved in a lawsuit in December 2017 in relation to a resolution of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) imposing a penalty on the Group companies Cespa, S.A. and Cespa, G.R. and other companies from the waste management and urban cleaning industry for participating in a market share agreement. The penalty imposed on Cespa, S.A. and Cespa, G.R. amounted to EUR 14 million.
The National Appellate Court announced the judgment on 27 February which upheld in full the appeal lodged by Cespa, considering that there were no grounds for accusing it of participating in a cartel of this type. Since the appeal was upheld in full, the judgment imposed costs on the authorities. The judgment is not final and the Spanish government lawyers may prepare a cassation appeal against it within 30 days. The Group had decided not to recognise any type of provision in this connection since the company's legal advisers considered that there were robust arguments to challenge the resolution by the CNMC.
· In addition, through the company Empresa de Mantenimiento y Explotación M-30, S.A. (Emesa) in which it holds a 50% ownership interest, the Group executes the maintenance contract for the M-30 infrastructure and holds a 20% ownership interest in the semi-private

214  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

company, Madrid Calle 30, the concession operator for that infrastructure. In 2017 Madrid City Council, another shareholder of Madrid Calle 30, set up a municipal investigation committee, whose main recommendations affecting the Group are to reverse the management model of Madrid Calle 30 to the original model of a 100% municipal company, and request the competent Council bodies to study who should be responsible for paying the electricity supply,
opinion, there are arguments to justify that the electricity supply should be paid by Madrid Calle 30 and not by Emesa. In addition, if the concession arrangement is terminated early, under the arrangement's specifications, Emesa's shareholders would recover the value of the participating loans granted to this company and Emesa would recover the value of the ownership interest in Madrid Calle 30, together with the subordinated loan granted to this company. It should also be noted that Emesa has filed an appeal for judicial review against the resolution by the City Council that approved the investigation committee's report, and the appeal has been admitted for consideration. Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a provision in this connection.
· Also, through Ecoparc de Can Mata, S.L.U., the Group has a contract for the construction and operation of a waste treatment centre. In 2017 notification was received from the granting body of the initiation of a proceeding to claim EUR 15.6 million in payments and penalties due to discrepancies regarding the waste recovery percentages and refuse dumping and in relation to the regularisation of the payments made on the basis of the remuneration formulas provided for in the contract. The granting body has also issued a resolution that the billing method to be used from now on should meet the requirements used by it in the proceeding. The Group has filed an appeal against the payments and penalties as well as against the resolution obliging billing to be performed in accordance with the imposed criteria. In the opinion of
amounts will have to be paid is considered to be remote and, therefore, the Group decided not to recognise a provision in this connection.
d) Tax litigation
Ferrovial is involved in various tax-related claims, mainly in relation to tax audits in Spain. The most significant claims relate to income tax and VAT for 2002 to 2013 and amount to EUR 311 million. Although the company considers that it has sound arguments to defend its position, it has recognised provisions to partially cover the contingencies in this connection amounting to EUR 254 million, as indicated in Note 6.3.
These claims include the claim relating to the amortisation for tax purposes of financial goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign companies. Ferrovial has lodged an appeal against the European
ssifying this tax measure as state aid. Although the core issue has yet to be resolved, in 2017 the tax authorities ordered the recovery of the amortisation recognised between 2006 and 2015, and requested the payment of EUR 37 million which included EUR 8 million of late-payment interest. An account receivable from the tax authorities was recognised as a balancing entry to this payment since it was considered that these
handed down in relation to the appeal. It is important to note that the company has recognised deferred tax liabilities in relation to the goodwill forming the subject-matter of this lawsuit in order to pay a possible refund of the amounts deducted in this regard amounting to EUR 114 million (see Note 2.8.3).

e) Other litigation
In addition to the litigation discussed above, of particular note is the Group continuing to maintain its contractual position vis-à-vis certain tax claims that had been filed by Promociones Habitat, S.A., which was sold by Ferrovial Fisa, S.L. in 2016. These claims are currently pending resolution or payment and a provision for the amount thereof has been duly recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

6.5.2. Guarantees

a) Bank guarantees and other guarantees provided by insurance companies

In carrying on its activities the Group is subject to possible contingent liabilities -uncertain by nature- relating to the liability arising from the performance of the various contracts that constitute the activity of its business divisions.

In order to cover the aforementioned liability, the Group has bank guarantees and other guarantees issued by insurance companies. At 31 December 2017, the balance amounted to EUR 7,472 million (2016: EUR 5,944 million).

The following table contains a breakdown of the risk covered in each business area.

(Millions of euros) Construction Toll roads Services Airports Other TOTAL

2017 4,848 1,165 1,109
90 261 7,472

2016 4,006
498 1,180
7 253 5,944

The increase in these guarantees is due mainly to the guarantees to cover the capital commitments relating to the 166 toll road and to the guarantees granted by bonding agencies in construction contracts in the US.

The EUR 7,472 million, by type of instrument, relate to: i) EUR 3,677 million of bank guarantees; ii) EUR 977 million of guarantees provided by insurance companies; and iii) EUR 2,818 million of performance bonds provided by bonding agencies.

These guarantees cover the liability to customers for correct performance in construction or services contracts involving Group companies. Thus, if a project was not performed the customer would enforce the guarantee.

Despite the significant amount of these guarantees, the impact that might arise on the consolidated financial statements is very low, since the Group companies perform contracts in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon with the customers and recognise provisions within the results of each contract for risks that might arise from performance thereof (see Note 6.3).

Lastly, of the total amount of the Group's bank guarantees listed in the above table, EUR 948 million (see Note 6.5.3.) secure its commitments to invest in the capital of infrastructure projects.

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B  215

b) Guarantees provided by Group companies for other companies in the Group
As mentioned previously, in general there are guarantees provided among Group companies to cover third-party liability claims arising from contractual, commercial or financial relationships.
Although these guarantees do not have any effect at consolidated Group level, there are certain guarantees provided by non-infrastructure project companies to infrastructure project companies (see Note 1.1.2.) which, due to the classification of project borrowings as being without recourse, it is relevant to disclose (see b.1. on Contingent capital guarantees).
Other noteworthy guarantees have also been provided to companies accounted for using the equity method (see b.2. below).
b.1) Guarantees provided by non-infrastructure projects to infrastructure
additional capital disbursements if the events guaranteed take place (contingent capital guarantees)
Guarantees provided by non-infrastructure projects to infrastructure projects could be divided into the following two categories:
· Guarantees that address the correct performance in construction and service contracts which have been mentioned in Note 6.5.2-a).
· Guarantees related to risks other than the correct performance of construction and service contracts, which could give rise to future additional capital disbursements if the events guaranteed take place.
The latter guarantees are the ones that are going to be explained in further detail in this section since, as mentioned in Note 5.2., Net cash position, the borrowings for infrastructure projects are without recourse to the shareholders or with limited recourse to the guarantees provided and, therefore, it is relevant to distinguish those guarantees that if the guaranteed event occurs, could be executed and could result in disbursements to the infrastructure projects or holders of their debt other than the committed capital or investment mentioned in Note 6.5.3. Such guarantees are called contingent capital guarantees.
The detail, by beneficiary company, purpose and maximum amount, of the outstanding guarantees of this nature at 31 December 2017 relating to fully consolidated infrastructure project companies is as follows. It should be noted that the amounts below relate to Ferrovial:

Of the aforementioned guarantees detailed by fully consolidated infrastructure projects and infrastructure projects accounted for using the equity method, only bank guarantees are provided to Ausol.

In addition, the Company has provided a guarantee amounting to EUR 14.9 million in relation to the Radial 4 toll road, which was excluded from the scope of consolidation in 2015. This amount had been provided for in full at 31 December 2017 (see Note 6.5.1.a)).

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

b.2) Other guarantees provided to companies accounted for using the equity method other than infrastructure project companies
Certain construction and services contracts are performed by companies accounted for using the equity method often created specifically to perform contracts previously awarded to their shareholders. In these cases, the shareholders of those companies provide performance bonds relating to those contracts. The liability secured is similar to that indicated in Note 6.5.2.a.
Notable in this respect are the performance bonds provided by the Services Division for various companies accounted for using the equity method totalling EUR 1,417 million, of which the most significant are those relating to contracts for the UK Ministries of Defence and Justice. It should be noted that the aforementioned amount corresponds to the
percentage of ownership.
c) Assets pledged as collateral
The assets pledged as collateral are described in the Notes as follows:
· Pledges of property, plant and equipment, see Note 3.4.
· Pledges of deposits or restricted cash, see Note 5.2.
d) Guarantees received from third parties
At 31 December 2017, Ferrovial had received guarantees from third parties totalling EUR 1,049 million (31 December 2016: EUR 1,056 million), mainly in the Construction Division in the Ferrovial Agroman companies in the United States (EUR 836 million), the Budimex Group (EUR 114 million) and other construction companies (EUR 106 million).
These guarantees received from third parties relate to technical performance bonds whereby certain subcontractors or suppliers in the Construction business guarantee full performance of their contractual obligations relating to the construction work they are engaged to carry out, and cannot be sold or pledged.
6.5.3. Obligations and commitments
As described in Note 1.1, the infrastructure projects carried out by the Group are performed through long-term contracts where the concession operator is a company in which the Group has interests, either alone or together with other partners, and the borrowings necessary for financing the project are allocated to the project itself, without recourse to the shareholders or with recourse limited to the guarantees provided, under the terms set forth in Note 5.2. From the management viewpoint, therefore, Ferrovial takes into account only the investment commitments relating to the capital of the projects, since the investment in the assets is financed by the borrowings of the projects themselves.

The investment commitments of the Group in relation to the capital of its projects are as follows:

30 968

At 31 December 2017, the investment commitments amounted to EUR 968 million (2016: EUR 1,074 million). This decrease is due mainly to the investments made in US toll road projects in 2017 and the reduced investment commitments relating to the I66 toll road following the financial close (the capital committed to our ownership interest of 50% amounts to EUR 633 million compared to the EUR 723 million estimated in 2016 prior to the financial close).

As indicated in 6.5.2-a), a portion of these commitments, amounting to EUR 948 million, are secured by bank guarantees. The aforementioned amount includes EUR 34 million which are also included in the guarantees mentioned in 6.5.2.b.1), Contingent capital guarantees and which relate to Ausol. It should be noted that only these EUR 34 million were included as investment commitments because an outflow of resources of the other contingent capital relating to other projects as indicated in b.1 above was considered to be unlikely.

In relation to the I-77 toll road project, Ferrovial is guaranteeing the investment commitments of another shareholder amounting to EUR 61 million. In return for providing this guarantee, if the shareholder fails to make the related disbursements, its ownership interest will be diluted in proportion to the disbursements not made.

There are also property, plant and equipment purchase commitments in the Services Division totalling EUR 102 million (2016: EUR 121 million) which relate mainly to the acquisition of machinery or the construction of treatment plants, and EUR 15 million (2016: EUR 5 million) relating mainly to the purchase of two waste treatment companies in Poland and a logistics company in Spain. The schedule of the commitments of the Services Division is as follows:

The Group does not have any significant commitments as a lessor under operating leases.
c) Environmental commitments

Any operation designed mainly to prevent, reduce or repair damage to the environment is treated as an environmental activity.

Costs incurred to protect and improve the environment are taken to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred, irrespective of when the resulting monetary or financial flow takes place.

Provisions for probable or certain environmental liability, litigation in progress and indemnities or other outstanding obligations of undetermined amount not covered by insurance policies are recorded when the liability or obligation giving rise to the indemnity or payment arises. These provisions include most notably the provisions for landfill closure discussed in Note 6.3, the balance of which at 31 December 2017 was EUR 130 million (31 December 2016: EUR 124 million).

6.6. Remuneration of the board of directors and senior executives
6.6.1. Bylaw-
56 of its bylaws, the shareholders at the General Meeting determine the maximum annual remuneration for all the members of the Board of Directors, which is revised on the basis of the indices or aggregates defined by the General Meeting. This remuneration comprises (i) fixed remuneration and (ii) fees for actual attendance at Board and Committee meetings. Remuneration is linked to the functions and responsibilities assigned to each director, their membership of Board Committees and other objective circumstances that the Board of Directors deems relevant, thereby ensuring their independence and commitment in the long term.
On the same date as that on which these consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue, the Board of Directors prepared and made available to the shareholders the Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration referred to in Article 541 of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law. That Report describes in greater detail matters relating to the Company's remuneration policy applicable in the year and contains an overview of how the remuneration policy was applied in 2017 and a detail of the individual remuneration earned by each of the directors in 2017.
The table below shows the itemised bylaw-stipulated emoluments of the members of the Board of Directors earned in 2017 and 2016. It also includes the supplementary fixed remuneration relating to the bylawstipulated emolument. If because there are more meetings than initially envisaged or for any other reason the amount of the attendance fees added to that of the fixed components exceeds the total maximum amount of remuneration for Board membership established for the year in question, the difference is deducted from the amount of the supplementary fixed remuneration proportionally for each director on the basis of his or her position on the Board. At the Board of Directors meeting of 28 February 2018 it was decided, within the maximum limits approved by the General Meeting, to supplement the amount of supplementary fixed remuneration for 2017 for the entire Board by EUR 145,421, sharing the amount among the directors according to their time on the Board in 2017.

6.6.3. Remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors due to membership of other managing bodies of Group companies or associates
A director of the Company Joaquín Ayuso García, who is in turn a member of the managing body of another Group company, received EUR 31 thousand in this connection in 2017 (2016: EUR 36 thousand).
6.6.4. Pension funds and plans or life insurance premiums
As in 2016, no contributions were made in 2017 to pension plans or
Directors or for directors of the Company who are members of other Boards of Directors and/or senior executives of Group companies or associates. Similarly, no obligations were acquired in this connection in 2017.
As regards life insurance premiums, the Company has insurance policies covering death (for which premiums totalling EUR 13 thousand were paid in 2017; EUR 12 thousand in 2016), of which the executive directors are beneficiaries. No life insurance premiums were paid for the directors of the Company who are members of other Boards of Directors and/or senior executives of Group companies or associates.
Lastly, the Company has arranged a third-party liability insurance policy the insureds of which are the directors and executives of the Group companies the parent of which is the Company. Those insureds include
aforementioned insurance policy amounted to EUR 589 thousand.
6.6.5. Advances and loans
At 31 December 2017, no advances or loans had been granted by the Company to the directors in their capacity as such or as members of other Boards of Directors and/or as senior executives of Group companies or associates.
6.6.6. Remuneration of senior executives

2017 was as follows:

2016 5,094 4,994 7,053

The aforementioned remuneration corresponds to the following posts: General Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, General Director of HR, General Director of Construction, General Director of Real Estate, General Director of Services, General Director of Airports, General Director of Toll Roads, General Director of Information Systems and Innovation, Director of Internal Audit, Director of Communications and Corporate Responsibility and Director of Corporate Strategy. This does not include

remuneration for senior executives who were also executive directors, which was addressed in Note 6.6.2.
The Company has also introduced a flexible remuneration system called the Flexible Remuneration Plan, which provides employees with the possibility of voluntarily modifying their remuneration package based on their personal needs, replacing a portion of their remuneration with the award of certain payments in kind. These products include a Group life and retirement-related savings insurance plan. Participants may request that a portion of their gross annual remuneration be paid by the Company in the form of a premium for a Group life and retirement-related savings insurance policy. In this connection, the senior executives requested contributions of EUR 181 thousand from the Company, instead of the equivalent remuneration shown in the foregoing table (2016: EUR 83 thousand).
6.6.7. Other disclosures on remuneration
The agreements between the Company and senior executives, including one executive director, specifically provide for the right to receive the
of unjustified dismissal.
At 31 December 2017, additional rights had been established in the contract of one senior executive.
In order to encourage loyalty and long-service, a deferred remuneration scheme was recognised for eleven senior executives, including one executive director. The scheme consists of extraordinary remuneration that will only be paid when one of the following circumstances occurs:
· Removal of the senior executive by mutual agreement upon reaching a certain age.
· Unjustified dismissal or termination by the Company at its discretion without any justification for dismissal, prior to the senior executive reaching the age initially agreed upon, if the amount of this remuneration exceeds that resulting from applying the Workers' Statute.
· The death or disability of the senior executive.
These contributions are quantified on the basis of a certain percentage of the total monetary remuneration of each senior executive. To cover this incentive, each year the Company makes contributions to a Group savings insurance policy, of which the Company is both policy-holder and beneficiary. The contributions made in 2017 amounted to EUR 2,366 thousand (2016: EUR 2,342 thousand), of which EUR 542 thousand correspond to executive directors.
Individuals are occasionally hired to hold executive positions, mainly from abroad, in areas unrelated to senior management. The contracts of these individuals include certain clauses that provide for indemnities in the event of unjustified dismissal.
6.7. Share-based payment
Performance-based share award plan
At 2017 year-end, Ferrovial had two remuneration systems in place for directors, consisting of the performance-based award of shares:
· Three-year plan approved by the Board of Directors on 19 December 2012: this plan consists of the delivery of shares of the Company. The

220  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

F. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B

total number of shares that can be granted annually under the plan may not exceed 1,900,000, representing 0.26% of the Company's share capital, and eligibility for the plan is conditional upon employees having at least three years' service at the Company (barring special circumstances) and upon the achievement during this period of ratios calculated on the basis of EBITDA as a percentage of net productive assets, cash flows from operating and investing activities and total shareholder return with respect to a comparable Group.

· Three-year plan approved by the Board of Directors on 29 October 2015 consisting of the delivery of shares of the Company. The annual cost of the plan may not exceed EUR 22 million The terms and conditions concerning award and duration are similar to those of the plan explained above: this pl service at the Company (barring special circumstances) and to the achievement during this period of ratios calculated on the basis of EBITDA as a percentage of net productive assets and total shareholder return in relation to a comparable Group. The plan is intended for executive directors, senior executives and executives. The application of this plan to executive directors was authorised at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2016. Per the notification issued to the CNMV on 1 March 2017, the date of allocation of units for 2017 to the executive directors for the purpose of calculating the duration and terms and conditions of the aforementioned plan was 15 February 2017.

There were 3,212,739 shares outstanding at 31 December 2017 relating to these two plans.

The changes in the aforementioned remuneration schemes in 2017 and 2016 are summarised as follows:

Number of shares at beginning of year
Plans granted
Plans settled
Shares surrendered and other
Shares exercised
Number of shares at end of year

2017
3,266,221
1,155,685 -1,157,188

3,844,520
1,073,895 -1,489,856
-100,378 -61,960 3,266,221

These share award plans include the plans described above in Note 6.6. on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives.

In 2017 the staff costs recognised at the Group in relation to these remuneration schemes amounted to EUR 18 million (2016: EUR 17 million) with a charge to equity.
These plans were accounted for as futures and, therefore, the value of the foreseeable dividends up to the delivery date is discounted to the value of the shares at the grant date, using a rate of return equal to the average cost of borrowings over the share award period, and they are equity settled and, therefore, they are measured when granted and the initially calculated value thereof is not re-estimated.

Described below are transactions between the subsidiaries and the Company which, in all cases form part of their ordinary businesses as regards purpose and conditions and were not eliminated on consolidation for the following reason.
As explained in detail in Note 1.3.2, the balances and transactions relating to construction work performed by the Construction Division for the Group's infrastructure concession operators are not eliminated on consolidation

since, at consolidated level, contracts of this type are classed as construction contracts in which the work -to the extent that it is completed- is deemed to be performed for third parties, as the ultimate owner of the work is the grantor both from a financial and legal viewpoint.
for EUR 391,813 thousand (2016: EUR 112,252 thousand) for work performed and related advance payments and, in this respect, recognised sales totalling EUR 411,158 thousand (2016: EUR 397,122 thousand).

6.11. Events after the reporting period
On 22 February 2018, the UK Appeal Court found in favour of Birmingham City Council and rendered null and void the judgment previously handed down in favour of Amey in September 2016. Amey is considering the possibility of appealing against the ruling at the Supreme Court. The impact of this judgment has been considered for the purposes of preparing these consolidated financial statements since it relates to litigation that was pending resolution at the reporting date. Note 6.5.1 on litigation contains a more detailed explanation of the lawsuit in question and the provisions recognised at year-end to cover the related contingencies.
On 27 February 2018, the National Appellate Court (Spain) notified Cespa of a judgment upholding in full the appeal that the company had filed against a resolution by the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) imposing a penalty of EUR 14 million on it. The judgment is not final and the Spanish government lawyers may prepare a cassation appeal against it within 30 days. The Group had decided not to recognise any provision in relation to this lawsuit and therefore the judgment does not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2017 (see Note 6.5.1).
6.12. APPENDICES

APPENDIX I B  223

APPENDIX I. DISCLOSURES ON THE TAX REGIME ESTABLISHED IN ARTICLES 107 AND 108 OF LAW 27/2014

IIn 2014 Ferrovial opted to be taxed under the regime established
currently in Articles 107 and 108 of the Spanish Income Tax Law, of 27 November, which became applicable from 1 January 2014 and, consequently, applied to all of 2017. Under this tax regime:
1. Dividends and capital gains obtained by Ferrovial arising from ownership interests in non-resident operating companies (which represent at least 5% of the share capital of these companies or which were acquired for more than EUR 20 million) are exempt from income tax if the requirements provided for in Article 21 of the Spanish Income
2. The dividends paid by Ferrovial with a charge to the
permanent establishments abroad to which the exemption provided for in Article 22 of the Spanish Income Tax Law is applicable are treated as follows:
(i) Where the recipient is a non-resident shareholder in Spain (and does not operate through tax havens or by means of a permanent establishment in Spain), dividends are not subject to withholdings or taxation in Spain.
(ii) Where the recipient is an entity subject to Spanish income tax, the dividends received shall give rise to the exemption in order to avoid double taxation of dividends of resident entities included in Article 21
provided for in the aforementioned law are met.
(iii) Where the recipient is a natural person resident in Spain subject to personal income tax, the dividends received shall be considered savings income and the tax credit for the avoidance of double taxation in Spain may be taken in accordance with the terms of the Personal Income Tax Law, with respect to the taxes paid abroad by Ferrovial.
In 2017 all of the dividends paid by Ferrovial were paid out of "exempt income".
3. The capital gains obtained by the shareholders of Ferrovial arising from the transfer of their ownership interests in the Company are treated as follows:
(i) Where the shareholder is a non-resident in Spain (and does not operate through tax havens or a permanent establishment in Spain) the portion of the capital gain that relates to the reserves recognised
or to changes in value attributable to Ferrovial's investments in nonresident entities that meet the requirements to be able to apply the foreign income exemption established in Articles 21 and 22 of the Spanish Income Tax Law shall be deemed not subject to taxation in Spain.
(ii) Where the shareholder is an entity subject to Spanish income tax with an ownership interest in Ferrovial that meets the requirement (5% ownership interest in the share capital or that the acquisition cost of the ownership interest exceeds EUR 20 million and it has been held for one year), the exemption provided for in Article 21 of the Spanish Income Tax Law may be applied.
(iii) Where the shareholder is a natural person resident in Spain subject to personal income tax, it shall pay tax on the capital gain obtained in accordance with the standard income tax rules.
The amount of exempt income pursuant to Article 21 and 22 of the Spanish Income Tax Law obtained by Ferrovial in 2017 and the related tax paid abroad are as follows:

A.2 Exemption for income of permanent establishments abroad
No income was obtained from permanent establishments abroad in 2017.
B) EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN SOURCE CAPITAL GAINS:

No capital gains were obtained to which the exemption included in Article 21 of the Spanish Income Tax Law is applicable because (i) either the sales were made between Group companies and were eliminated on preparation of the consolidated tax return, (ii) or they were reported in corporate restructuring transactions which opted for the tax neutrality regime provided for in Article 76 et seq of the Spanish Income Tax Law. Nevertheless, the capital gains that would have been reported for tax purposes had these regimes not been not applicable (consolidated tax Group or tax neutrality) are as follows:

B.1 Elimination of capital gains for intra-Group sales of foreign companies:

None took place in 2017.

B.2 Deferred capital gains arising in corporate restructuring processes:

In order to enable the shareholders of Ferrovial to adopt the aforementioned tax regime, the Company performed a market assessment at the end of the year of its ownership interests (held directly and indirectly through investments in other entities that have adopted this special tax regime) in non-resident entities and permanent establishments abroad that meet the requirements to be able to apply

224  2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FERROVIAL, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

APPENDIX I B

the foreign source income exemption established in Articles 21 and 22 of the Spanish Income Tax Law.
The result of this assessment means that these assets represent 91% of the total market value of Ferrovial. At 31 December 2016, this percentage amounted to 92%.
In 2017 Ferrovial S.A. implemented two shareholder remuneration
receiving newly issued bonus shares of the Company; (ii) transferring in the market the bonus issue rights corresponding to the shares held by them; or (iii) receiving a cash amount through the transfer to Ferrovial of the aforementioned bonus issue rights.
Set forth below are the main tax implications of these schemes, based on the tax legislation in force in Spain except for Navarre and the Basque Country and on the interpretation made by the Spanish DirectorateGeneral of Taxes in its response to several requests for binding rulings.
Delivery of new shares: for tax purposes, the delivery of new shares is considered to be a delivery of bonus shares and, therefore, does not constitute income for the purposes of personal income tax, income tax or non-resident income tax, regardless of whether or not the recipients of these shares act through a permanent establishment in Spain. The delivery of new shares is not subject to withholdings or pre-payments. The acquisition cost, both of the new shares and the shares to which they correspond, will be the result of distributing the total cost of acquisition for tax purposes of the portfolio by the number of shares; both the original shares and the bonus shares that correspond to them. The age of the bonus shares will be the age that corresponds to the shares that gave rise to them. Consequently, in the event of their subsequent transfer, the income obtained will be calculated by reference to this new value.
Sale to the market of the bonus issue rights: If the shareholders sell their bonus issue rights to the market, the amount obtained will not be subject to withholdings or pre-payments and will be subject to the tax rules indicated below (applicable until the end of 2016(*)):
a) In the case of personal income tax and non-resident income tax applicable to shareholders without a permanent establishment in Spain, the amount obtained on the sale to the market of the bonus issue rights is subject to the same rules established in tax legislation for pre-emption rights. Consequently, the amount obtained on the sale of the bonus issue rights reduces the acquisition cost for tax purposes of the shares which give rise to such rights, pursuant to Article 37.1.a) of Personal Income Tax Law 35/2006, of 28 November, and pursuant to Final Provision Six of Law 26/2014, of 27 November, amending Personal Income Tax Law 35/2006, of 28 November, the Consolidated Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax Law approved by Legislative Royal Decree 5/2004, of 5 March, and other tax legislation. Therefore, if the amount obtained on the sale of the bonus issue rights is higher than the acquisition cost of the shares which gave rise to them, the difference is considered to be a capital gain for the seller in the tax period in which this occurs; all of the foregoing without prejudice to the potential application to non-resident income tax payers not operating through a permanent establishment in Spain of the tax treaties entered into by Spain to which they could be entitled or to the exemptions that may be applicable to them under Spanish domestic law.
a) In the case of income tax and non-resident income tax applicable to shareholders operating through a permanent establishment in Spain, to the extent that a full business cycle is completed, tax will be paid in

accordance with the applicable accounting standards and, if appropriate, with any special tax rules that may apply to the shareholders subject to the aforementioned taxes.
Sale to Ferrovial of the bonus issue rights: Lastly, if the holders of bonus issue rights decide to avail themselves of the Ferrovial Purchase Commitment, the tax regime applicable to the amount obtained on the sale to Ferrovial of the bonus issue rights received in their capacity as shareholders will be as follows:
(iv) If the shareholder is a natural person resident for tax purposes in Spain or a legal entity that does not satisfy the requirements to apply the exemption provided for in Article 21 of Spanish Income Tax Law 27/2014, the applicable tax regime shall be the regime which applies to the dividends paid directly in cash and, therefore, the amount obtained will be subject to the corresponding withholding tax;
(v) If the shareholder is a natural person or legal entity not resident for tax purposes in Spain or a tax haven, and does not operate through a permanent establishment in Spain, the amount obtained shall not be subject to taxation in Spain pursuant to Chapter XIII of Title VII of Spanish Income Tax Law 27/2014, and, therefore, shall not be subject to withholding tax. In these cases, for this regime to apply the shareholder shall be required to evidence its tax residence by providing the corresponding certificate issued by the tax authorities in question;
(vi) If the shareholder is a legal entity resident in Spain for tax purposes or, if it is not a tax resident but operates through a permanent establishment in Spain and satisfies the requirements for the application of the exemption provided for in Article 21 of Spanish Income Tax Law 27/2014, the amount obtained shall be exempt from taxation in Spain and, therefore, shall not be subject to withholding tax.
It should be borne in mind that the taxation scenarios of the various options relating to the scheme kno out above do not explain all the possible tax consequences. Accordingly, the shareholders should consult their tax advisers on the specific tax effect of the proposed scheme and pay attention to any changes that could take place, both in in-force legislation and in the criteria of the interpretation thereof, as well as the particular circumstances of each shareholder or holder of bonus issue rights.
(*) This tax regime was amended slightly in 2017.
