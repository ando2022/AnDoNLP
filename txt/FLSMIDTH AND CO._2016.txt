FLSMIDTH ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / 3

MAIN CONCLUSIONS
FINANCIAL RESULTS 2016

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

Following a slow start to the year, market activity resumed in the second half. Capital orders remained subdued throughout 2016, whereas service orders showed good momentum in the second half. Improved working capital and strong operating cash flow led to a significant debt reduction. Revenue was above and the EBITA margin was within 2016 guidance. A similar level of revenue and EBITA margin is expected in 2017.
GROWTH EFFICIENCY After a weak first half, activity picked up and finished the year on strong note. Rising commodity prices had an increasingly positive impact on sentiment in the mining industry in 2016, but has yet to translate into higher capital investments. The cement industry is showing early signs of recovery. Order intake increased 2% organically in 2016, while revenue declined 5%. The Customer Services and Product Companies divisions have been fairly resilient, though not immune to market headwinds, as both mining and cement companies have been holding back on discretionary spend and postponing investments in inventory and refurbishments.
PROFIT EFFICIENCY The EBITA margin was 7.1% in 2016 (2015: 8.0%), negatively impacted by lower revenue and under-absorption of costs. As a consequence, corrective actions were announced in August 2016 and the full year EBITA margin guidance was narrowed to 7-8% from originally 7-9% to account for one-off costs associated with the corrective actions. Adjusted for one-off costs, the EBITA margin was 8.0% in 2016.

MARKET TRENDS
Following a slow start to the year, market activity resumed over the summer. Capital orders remained subdued throughout 2016, whereas service orders showed good momentum in the second half, supported by increasing commodity prices.
MINERALS MARKET 2016 was another belt-tightening year for the mining industry. Demand for equipment, especially for larger projects, remained weak, as miners continued to strengthen their balance sheets through reduced investments and targeted procurement savings. Mining capital expenditures are down more than 60% from the peak level in 2012 and now appear to be stabilising. As miners have already fixed their budgets at stable to slightly declining levels for 2017 it is, however, unlikely that any significant increase in market activity will take place until the end of 2017 at the earliest, when the 2018 budgets are fixed.
Since 2012, miners have taken steps to reduce their cash cost of production and in combination with increasing commodity prices, operating cash flows are improving. As an example, more than 90% of global copper production is running at cash costs below the current copper price. Industry productivity is, however, still far below the level of the 1990's, and provided current commodity prices and cash generation can be sustained, customers are likely to turn their focus from cost cutting to asset management, especially in copper and gold which continue to lead FLSmidth's minerals activities. Whereas miners spent the highest proportion of expansion capex on iron ore in the past, they will, according to a study by Wood Mackenzie, allocate the highest share of expansion capex to copper and gold projects in the coming years.
The market for minerals-related services saw a weakening at the beginning of the year, as customers deferred maintenance and larger purchases, reducing demand for upgrade projects and parts for inventory. Sentiment improved in the second half of the year as commodity prices continued to increase. Copper and gold prices were up by 22% and 8% respectively in 2016. Thermal coal (used for power and heat generation) increased even further, and iron ore and coking coal (used for steel production) more than doubled

in price over the year. Although coal and iron ore account for a relatively low proportion of FLSmidth's minerals-related sales, the price increase of these commodities is still very important for the industry's overall cash generation and its ability to make investments in other commodities, such as copper and gold.
CEMENT MARKET The global market for new cement capacity was largely unchanged in 2016, although tendering activity picked up slightly in the second half of the year, owing to good local or regional opportunities. Cement demand continued to grow, although not by enough to outweigh supply additions, and after several years of overcapacity and relatively few orders available in the market, competition is strong and pricing is under pressure.
Overall, the market for cement related services was stable throughout the year, although, with some changing regional dynamics as a result of economic developments and politics. North America and parts of Asia saw stronger activity, whereas South America saw a weakening. Consequently, customers in South America are primarily focused on cost savings, whereas customers in North America and Asia are more focused on debottlenecking and maximising production which is an advantage to FLSmidth as a premium provider of productivity.
See page 34-41 for additional market information by division.
FACTS
FOCUS ON SIX KEY COMMODITIES FLSmidth is a leading provider of productivity-enhancing technologies within six key commodities: cement, copper, gold, coal, iron ore and fertiliser minerals. Adjacent commodities and industries are targeted as well, where existing technologies can be applied. Examples of adjacent industries are power, steel, aggregate, chemical and other commodities such as alumina, bauxite, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, zinc, silver and diamonds.

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

WE DRIVE SUCCESS THROUGH SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS

2016 was another year of market headwind but also a year of strengthened customer relationships. FLSmidth is known for its strong track record of reliability and project follow-through. Nevertheless, improvements are always possible and we are extremely focused on ensuring that our customers always get what they expect, when they expect it. In 2016, we took the step to start reporting externally on the development in our quality KPI, DIFOT, which is short for `Delivery in Full on Time'. For some time now, the entire FLSmidth organisation has been measured on all critical internal and external deliveries. Through individual commitment to deliver on time and on promises made downstream in the value chain, we improve the timeliness and completeness of our customer deliverables. We are pleased to note that DIFOT improved from 77% in 2015 to 84% in 2016.

Accommodating individual customer requests on time and as promised is vastly important, but FLSmidth's business model stretches far beyond the borders of individual successful deliveries. Our life-cycle approach is about enhancing customer productivity over the life cycle of their plant or equipment. Through a constant dialogue, we ensure focus on flow sheet performance and return on investment.
With limited demand for new equipment, our innovation is aimed at developing better alternative technologies and optimising the performance of existing plants and equipment. FLSmidth's recent landmark innovation on Rapid Oxidative Leach® (ROL) is just about that. ROL can leach 97-99% copper directly at site, from concentrates as low as 5% copper in less than 6 hours! In other words, it can process ore that cannot be economically processed with today's available technologies and it can do it faster and with a higher recovery. The significance of this innovation was cemented in 2016, as ROL was among the winners in the global Top100 R&D awards which rarely embrace the mining industry.

footprint and implementing a clear governance structure. We have strengthened our product line management and increased our focus on value engineering to offer higher quality products to our customers and to enable enforced strategic procurement. We have launched initiatives to take advantage of the evolving opportunities within automation and digitalisation, and we have established strategic partnerships where competencies outside our core are deemed valuable.
With a strengthened customer focus, and a solid framework in place, ensuring both internal and external productivity, FLSmidth stands well prepared to seize future growth opportunities.

Vagn Sørensen Board Chairman

Thomas Schulz Group CEO

Being the number one productivity provider for our customers requires that we always have internal productivity at the top of our agenda. Safety is key and for the fourth consecutive year in a row, our employees delivered improved safety performance. Another key priority for management in 2016 was to simplify the business even further. Whilst our offering to customers often has a high degree of complexity, our internal setup needs to be lean and simple. We have therefore continued the past few years' work of consolidating and optimising our global

FLSMIDTH'S STRATEGY IN 30 SECONDS As a leading supplier of sustainable productivity enhancing solutions to the global cement, mining and adjacent industries, FLSmidth constantly seeks to increase customer output and reduce their total cost of ownership. A full flow-sheet of premium technologies, embedded in a unique combination of leading products, process knowhow and services, enables FLSmidth to understand performance data and optimise customers' operations, while minimising environmental impact. The ability to offer performance guarantees, and operate customer plants, underlines that FLSmidth does not `just' sell equipment, plants or services ­ we sell productivity.
A LEADING SUPPLIER OF SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTIVITY The growth and economic development of societies all over the world is driving urbanisation, industrialisation and a need for infrastructure, which in turn is driving demand for

cement and minerals. FLSmidth has a sustainable business model which makes it well positioned to benefit from the mid- and long-term structural growth opportunities.
Customers in the mining and cement industries are increasingly focused on sustainability and their responsibilities towards the environment and society. They are faced with ever-stricter governmental regulations related in particular to the environment, including natural resources such as water and energy, and the environmental footprint associated with pollution and emissions. Greater scarcity of raw materials, water and energy is leading to more complex and costly operations. Successfully managing these responsibilities, as well as the obligations towards employing and developing a local workforce and providing a safe working environment, is vital to gaining local support to operate, and FLSmidth has both the experience and the technologies to help customers address that challenge.

STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

CUSTOMER BASE FLSmidth has a diversified customer base composed primarily of global and regional cement and mining companies that invest in new capacity or in expanding, upgrading, maintaining and servicing existing production capacity. FLSmidth has vast experience of working with a broad range of customers in almost any country in the world.
Mining customers consist of both major and mid-tier miners, the latter accounting for a relatively large amount of minerals-related project sales, whereas the former account for a considerable share of FLSmidth's minerals- related aftermarket business.
Both global cement majors and local or regional midsized players are typical customers of FLSmidth, though the latter account for most of cement-related project sales, whereas global cement majors account for a

considerable share of FLSmidth's cement-related aftermarket business.
CEMENT AND MINERALS SYNERGIES Though cement and mining are distinct industries, there are considerable commonalities and synergies between the two, and FLSmidth has the unique advantage of being able to share resources and best practices across its cement and minerals business.
Scale benefits and shared services In addition to the traditional scale benefits such as shared global infrastructure and supply chain, FLSmidth has a large shared services set-up in Chennai, India with more than 1,400 employees serving the global organisation with respect to Engineering, IT, HR and Finance. India, together with China, is also the location for the Group's shared assembly and production facilities.

Shared know-how In both cement and minerals, FLSmidth operates in cyclical industries and supplies premium equipment which is exposed to significant wear and tear. In both industries, FLSmidth has built up strong competencies within products, projects and services. As an example, the project management skills needed in minerals and cement business (process knowhow, risk management, project execution, etc.) are largely the same. To a great extent that is also true for the engineering capabilities needed for projects. The main part of a typical project is relatively standardised engineering where resources can be shared between the two businesses and only a relatively small part of a typical project requires specialist engineers. Similarly, FLSmidth's advanced automation and air pollution control systems are applied in both mining and cement, as well as adjacent industries.
A significant advantage of having cement and minerals business under the same roof is the technology overlap. Several of the products used in each of the industries are either identical or very similar, for example crushing, grinding and material handling equipment. This allows for co-innovation and shared strategic procurement.
When it comes to aftermarket services, FLSmidth's minerals and cement businesses can benefit from one another's e xperiences as customers in both industries increasingly look for productivity enhancing services. In some cases, the two businesses share footprint, for example local offices, workshops and warehouses. In other cases, they share similar business models, for example in connection with maintaining and operating a customer's plants or equipment.

Momentum Customer Services Product Companies Minerals Cement Colour code refers to momentum over the cycle

safely through the cycles. Furthermore, a growing service business (55% of today's business) reduces the cyclicality of the entire Group as the service business is more resilient and stable by nature.

The similarity of being a supplier to the cement and the mining industry, is also an advantage when it comes to managing the somewhat similar business cycles.
MANAGING CYCLES FLSmidth is well positioned to benefit from mid- and long-term structural growth opportunities in the cement and mining industry. However, both industries are cyclical by nature ­ particularly with regard to investments in new capacity ­ although they don't follow exactly the same cycle. Having a dynamic business model with outsourced manufacturing and a flexible cost structure, resulting in a high cash conversion, allows FLSmidth to manoeuvre

The business model and organisational structure enables FLSmidth to manage and leverage the full potential of the cycle. Each part of the cycle has a prime time for product business, project business or service business, and FLSmidth has a strong offering in each subpart of the cycle.

A BUSINESS-MODEL-DRIVEN ORGANISATION FLSmidth's business activities are managed in four divisions to ensure operational efficiency through homogeneous business models within each division and a segmented customer approach. The Cement Division embraces cement projects, large customised cement equipment as well as cement operation and maintenance. The Minerals Division comprises mining projects and large engineered mineral processing and handling equipment. The Customer Services Division services the installed base mainly delivered by the Cement and Minerals divisions, and finally, the Product Companies Division offers more standardised market-

leading products sold directly to end customers, peers and into FLSmidth Cement and Minerals projects. The Product Companies Division provides parts and other aftermarket services to its own installed base.
Customer Services The Customer Services Division provides a full suite of parts, services, and maintenance solutions to the global cement and mining industries. The go-to-market model is mainly local direct sales on the basis of more than 100 warehouses and service and support centres worldwide.

intimacy is a clearly a top priority. A global set up allows FLSmidth to target and address different geographies and customer needs with specific skills and best practices.
FLSmidth offers a full array of services before, during and after delivery of new plants and equipment. The composition of the business is roughly 75% parts, 15% services and 10% maintenance ­ with most manufacturing outsourced. The parts business consists mainly of customised spare parts but with an increasing focus on developing and growing the wear parts segment to more than 10% of division revenue. Although wear parts by nature are more exposed to competition, they have an attractive market potential as they can help improve customer productivity while at the same time providing an opportunity for more frequent customer interaction.

Of the division's 2,774 employees worldwide, most are located in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Poland, India and the USA. Most assembly and part of the manufacturing activities take place in-house with primary production sites located in China, India and Poland. The ambition is to expand the geographical footprint of all product companies and to expand into adjacent industries for those product companies that are already market leading.
Most of the product companies' business consists of original equipment, spare parts and related services, making it less cyclical than the project division and with higher, more stable margins. The ambition is to have service account for more than 50% of revenue throughout the cycle and to have a market leading position in all targeted segments.

The service business is characterised mainly by relatively small orders but the significance of the aftermarket is o bvious, considering the fact that it accounts for more than 80% of the total cost of ownership.
It is also a more resilient business with relatively stable high margins over the cycle, as orders are tied primarily to customer production volumes and less to new investment.
An important task in Customer Services is to run at an optimised level of net working capital. The net working capital must be low enough to ensure that the division supports the group target for return on capital employed but high enough to ensure quick delivery of critical parts and services. FLSmidth will continue to develop its excellence in logistics, inventory management and specialist support to maintain a strong competitive position versus other large suppliers and local workshops. The latter makes up around 80% of aftermarket competition whereas other original equipment manufactures account for around 20%.
Product Companies The Product Companies Division hosts a diverse portfolio of relatively standardised market-leading product brands, applied in the cement, mining and adjacent industries, each of which represents roughly one-third of sales. The division consists of nine product companies with individually integrated business models and products spanning from pumps, cyclones, feeders and sizers to heavy-duty gears and drives, weighing and dosing solutions, bagging, palletizing & dispatching equipment as well as automation systems, air pollution control systems and pneumatic conveying.

Product Companies sell mostly locally and directly to external customers and peers (~80% external sales in 2014-2016), whereas the remainder of the business is made up of internal sales to cement and mining projects. A few product companies have been developed organically while most have been acquired.
Although the nine product companies are diverse in some aspects, they share important characteristics, which make it ideal to host them in the same division. They have agile individually integrated business models with niche market leadership, integrated R&D and short time-to-market. They have high service content and generate most sales outside of FLSmidth. That said, they all possess key equipment for the flow-sheets in FLSmidth's two core industries, cement and mining. Finally, they share the same ambition and potential to grow in their core markets as well as adjacent industries where existing technologies can be applied.
Minerals The Minerals Division is a leading provider of mineral processing and material handling technology and systems to the global mining industry. The division's 1,081 employees are based predominantly at technology and project centres in USA, India, South Africa, Chile and Australia.
The Minerals Division delivers premium engineered and customised single products, processing island solutions, EPS (engineering, procurement, and supervision) projects, and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) projects to the global mining industry. As an original equipment manufacturer focused on large scale engineered

products and projects, the business model is structured around regional sales and execution hubs, and centralised product engineering, with most manufacturing being outsourced.
Projects are by nature a cyclical and low margin business, but with the potential for operating leverage when new projects are predominant in the business cycle. The ambition is to run the division with negative net working capital supporting a healthy return on capital employed. The Minerals Division should not be seen as a stand-alone business as it generates business for the Product Companies Division and provides an installed base for the Customer Services Division.

Cement is predominantly a local or regional business with customers scattered around the globe, but also a big project business which is reflected in the divisional setup with global direct sales, local support teams, and regional technology centres, predominantly in Denmark, USA and India. Engineering and R&D takes place in-house while most manufacturing is outsourced.
Large engineered cement projects are a cyclical and low margin business by nature, however with the ability to generate high returns as a result of negative net working capital. Additionally, the Cement Division generates business for the Product Companies Division and provides an installed base for the Customer Services Division.

For the mining industry, recovery of usable ore is becoming increasingly difficult as the quality of ore grade is decreasing. Especially for commodities such as copper, miners are faced with more complex extraction activities, often in remote locations and in challenging climates, all of which complicates operations. To facilitate our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, and to help them recover ore otherwise deemed unusable, the Minerals Division increasingly focuses on process expertise, increased water recovery, dry stacked tailings and waste handling systems, as well as innovations related to energy efficient comminution and flotation technologies.
Cement The Cement Division is the market leader of premium technology and process solutions to the global cement industry, and FLSmidth has delivered more cement plants in the world than anyone else. The division's 2,642 employees excel in sublime project execution and our customers also benefit from the most complete product offering in the market and high reliability.
Backed by the strongest brand in the industry, Cement sells everything from single engineered and customised equipment to complete plants on an EP (engineering, procurement) or EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) basis. Further, the Cement Division hosts the Operation & Maintenance business which, combined with EPC projects, constitute a key differentiator for the industry, referred to as the `Design-Build-Operate'- model (see the `Full-service provider' section on page 18 for additional information).

STRATEGIC FOCUS FLSmidth's business is founded on three fundamental values; cooperation, competence and responsibility, and is being developed around three strategic pillars: Life-cycle approach, full service provider, and full flow-sheet.

LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH
Based on a unique combination of projects, products, and a broad service offering, FLSmidth is ideally positioned to help customers enhance all dimensions of productivity.
FLSmidth's `life-cycle approach' is twofold. For the customer, it means that the focus is not just on the initial investment but also on the continued plant or equipment performance and the total cost of ownership. The model is to maximise productivity per dollar spent.

A full flow-sheet of premium products and technologies combined with a strong engineering heritage and wideranging service solutions, all combined by state-of-the-art automation & control systems, positions FLSmidth as a market leader in analysing and understanding performance data. The benefits for the customer are more reliable and optimised operations, proactive and predictive maintenance, as well as increased uptime and guaranteed performance. In addition to offering a warranty on a single piece of equipment, FLSmidth bundles equipment to offer performance guarantees on solutions or even complete plants. To the customer, this equals a guaranteed return on investment, and FLSmidth has an excellent track record of reliability and project follow-through.

FLSmidth helps customers increase their output, lower their operating costs and reduce their environmental impact.

FULL SERVICE PROVIDER
Being a `full-service provider' means supplying everything from single products and services to complete plants or production lines and full operation & maintenance solutions. This comes to life in the `Design-Build-Operate'- model, where FLSmidth offers to design, build and operate customers' plants. In essence, the customer is responsible for obtaining permits, access to raw materials, power supply and sales, whereas FLSmidth builds, operates and guarantees an agreed level of production and performance.

The process know-how from designing a vast number of plants is applied to ensure the most efficient plant operations, and the practical experiences from running the plants are fed straight back into FLSmidth's product innovation which helps shorten time-to-market and in turn optimise operations further.

FULL FLOW-SHEET
FLSmidth's `full flow-sheet' offering to the mining and cement industries is based on 135 years of engineering and technology leadership coupled with strategic acquisitions of key products and innovations.
In cement, FLSmidth supplies the most complete array of products, systems and services, ranging from single engineered and customised equipment, such as vertical mills, kiln systems and clinker coolers, to a complete cement plant coupled with a full-scale operation and maintenance contract. In mining, FLSmidth likewise supplies a complete array of products, systems and services, ranging from single engineered and customised equipment, such as ball mills, gravity concentrators, thickeners or flotation cells, to bundled equipment solutions, full production plants,

and maintenance solutions. Within the mining value chain, FLSmidth is primarily active in material handling, comminution (crushing, grinding & sizing) and separation, supplemented by state-of-the-art materials testing capabilities used to analyse ore samples from our customers' mines. This ensures an early dialogue with the customer and not least, an in-depth knowledge of their material, including the material hardness and the minerals concentration, which is used to determine the optimal grinding and separation process for the specific material.
FLSmidth is recognised as a supplier of premium technology to the global cement and mining industries. In mining, the Group has decided also to enter the mid-market segment through an FLSmidth-controlled joint venture with the Chinese mining equipment supplier, Northern Heavy Industries. Initially, the focus will be on design and supply of crushing equipment, specifically targeting the mid-market which is expected to outgrow the premium segment over the next 5-10 years. The products will be sold under the name NHI-Fuller.

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

Following a slow start to the year, market activity resumed over the summer. Capital orders remained subdued throughout 2016, whereas service orders showed good momentum in the second half. Improved working capital and strong operating cash flow led to a significant debt reduction. Revenue was above and the EBITA margin was within 2016 guidance. A similar level of revenue and EBITA margin is expected in 2017.
FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN Q4 2016 The fourth quarter saw the highest quarterly revenue in two years. Earnings were impacted by one-off costs of DKK -110m related to corrective actions. Strong free cash flow led to a further reduction in net interest bearing debt.
Quarterly order intake and order backlog Order intake in Q4 2016 amounted to DKK 4,544m, representing an increase of 23% (Q4 2015: DKK 3,691m).

The increase was predominantly driven by the Cement division due to receipt of a large DKK 525m order won from Bolivia. Order intake growth was also positive in the Product Companies and Minerals divisions.

The order backlog for the Group amounted to DKK 13,887m, down 7% compared to the same period last year (end of 2015: DKK 14,858m), and 8% lower than in the previous quarter (end of Q3 2016: DKK 15,174m). The decline in Q4 was primarily explained by high conversion of backlog to revenue, and by adjustments to the backlog.

Quarterly revenue and earnings Revenue increased by 4% to DKK 5,525m in Q4 2016 (Q4 2015: DKK 5,297m) as a result of a very high level of execution and revenue recognition in Minerals and Cement. Organic growth was 6%, particularly related to the Cement Division.

The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,301m (Q4 2015: DKK 1,255m), corresponding to a gross margin of 23.5% (Q4 2015: 23.7%). The Q4 gross profit was impacted by one-off costs of DKK -38m related to corrective actions (Q4 2015: DKK -64m). Adjusted for one-off costs, the gross margin was 24.2% (Q4 2015: 24.9%). The decline from last year was attributable to the Cement and the Minerals divisions due to lower margin orders in the backlog.
Q4 2016 saw total research and development expenditures of DKK 47m (Q4 2015: DKK 75m), representing 0.9% of revenue (Q4 2015: 1.4%), of which DKK 17m was capitalized (Q4 2015: DKK 7m), and the balance reported as production costs. In addition, project financed developments are taking place in cooperation with customers and reported as regular production costs.
Sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) amounted to DKK -786m (Q4 2015: DKK -792m) equivalent to 14.2% of revenue (Q4 2015: 15.0%). Adjusted for one-off costs, SG&A costs fell by 7% vs. the same quarter of last year.

GROWTH EFFICIENCY After a weak first half, activity picked up and finished the year on strong note. Rising commodity prices had an increasingly positive impact on sentiment in the mining industry in 2016, but has yet to translate into higher capital investments. The cement industry is showing early signs of recovery. Order intake increased 2% organically in 2016, while revenue declined 5%. The Customer Services and Product Companies divisions have been fairly resilient, though not immune to market headwinds, as both mining and cement companies have been holding back on discretionary spend and postponing investments in parts for inventory and refurbishments.
Developments in total service activities Total service activities in FLSmidth embrace the entire Customer Services Division, Operation & Maintenance contracts (part of the Cement Division) and the entire service and aftermarket part of the Product Companies Division. Order intake related to total service activities increased 4%, accounting for 55% of Group order intake (2015: 52%). Revenue related to total service activities decreased 6% in 2016, accounting for 55% of Group revenue (2015: 55%). Momentum in service-related order intake picked up in the second half of the year.
Order intake and order backlog The order intake edged down by 1% to DKK 18,303m (2015: DKK 18,490m) due to the negative impact of

currency translation of -3%. Organic growth was 2%, explained by a significant increase in the Cement Division's order intake due to three large orders won in Algeria, V ietnam and Colombia, respectively.

The value of orders below DKK 200m has been hovering around DKK 4bn per quarter during the last couple of years, mirroring the stability provided by the service activities.

The organic growth rate was -32% in Minerals in 2016, as no large orders were received in 2016, as opposed to about DKK 1bn in large orders in 2015.

Cement is still the most important industry for FLSmidth, accounting for 44% of Group order intake in 2016. Copper is the most important mineral, accounting for 15% of order intake. 25% of order intake came from adjacent industries, such as other base metals, power and steel.

The order backlog for the Group decreased 7% in 2016 to DKK 13,887m (end of 2015: DKK 14,858m). Based on

the anticipated maturity profile of the order backlog, 69% of the backlog is expected to convert to revenue in 2017, 17% in 2018, and 14% in 2019 and beyond. The conversion time from order intake to revenue is 12-18 months on average ­ ranging from over-the-counter sales of wear parts to capital projects with 2-3 years' execution time. As an increasing share of orders come from service and single equipment business, the conversion time from order intake to revenue is becoming shorter.
Revenue Revenue decreased 8% to DKK 18,192m in 2016 (2015: DKK 19,682m), as a consequence of a lower order backlog at the beginning of the year. Cement was the only division to show positive revenue growth in 2016. In 2016, revenue was generated in 157 different countries around the globe, of which 68% was related to emerging markets. Most revenue was generated in USA, Chile, India and Australia.

PROFIT EFFICIENCY The EBITA margin was 7.1% in 2016 (2015: 8.0%), negatively impacted by lower revenue and under-absorption of costs. As a consequence, corrective actions were announced in August 2016 and the full year EBITA margin guidance was narrowed to 7-8% from originally 7-9% to account for one-off costs associated with the corrective actions. Adjusted for one-off costs, the EBITA margin was 8.0% in 2016.
Gross profit amounted to DKK 4,581m (2015: DKK 4,946m), corresponding to a gross margin of 25.2%, which is on a par with last year (2015: 25.1%). The gross margin was negatively impacted by one-off costs of DKK -73m related to corrective actions (2015: DKK -201m). Adjusted for one-off costs, the gross margin was 25.6% (2015: 26.1%).

MANAGING CAPACITY COSTS Over the last couple of years, the structure, governance and management of costs at FLSmidth have undergone several structural changes.
"Following years of very high market activity and many acquisitions, we have been working hard to consolidate and optimise our global footprint. A lot of costs have been taken out, and we have implemented a clear governance structure defining how capacity costs are managed across the Group", comments CFO Lars Vestergaard.
The Group operates in a matrix of three major dimensions; divisions, countries and group. Over the last couple of years, more functions and resources have been consolidated at group or country level. As a consequence, more costs are now centrally controlled and allocated to divisions based on assessed usage.

Costs (SG&A costs), are managed at country level by the country managers and centrally by the heads of group functions.
Divisional SG&A costs Divisional SG&A costs are directly managed and controlled by the divisions and include sales, marketing, management and administration, etc. In 2016, divisional SG&A costs amounted to DKK 1,696m (2015: DKK 1,698m).
Shared SG&A costs Country SG&A costs comprise facility management, HR, Finance general and administrative costs that are shared by the local operating entities.
Group SG&A costs relate to shared services such as IT, Finance and HR as well as group functions such as Legal, Business development, IR, Communications, Treasury, Tax, Group Finance, etc.

Country Organisations Group Functions

Over the past three years, the Group's global footprint has been streamlined and simplified through consolidation and closure of sites and offices. At the same time, support functions, such as HR, IT and Finance have been consolidated at country level, allowing for economies of scale and enhancement of specialist competencies as well as off-shoring of standardised tasks to the Group's shared services center in India. In general, an increasing share of engineering has been off-shored to Chennai, India and more work has been moved to the Group's own workshops in Qingdao, China and Bawal, India.

Apart from the types of cost mentioned above, SG&A costs also include potential bad debt provisions and restructuring costs, impacting either divisional and/or shared SG&A costs.
In 2016, shared country and group SG&A costs amounted to DKK 1,304m (2015: DKK 1,396m).
In 2016, total SG&A costs amounted to DKK 2,993m (2015: DKK 3,068m), equivalent to an SG&A ratio of 16.5% (2015: 15.6%).
Implementation of corrective actions The corrective actions that were implemented in the autumn of 2016 targeted all three levels of cost; divisions, local and group. Cost reductions in the divisions were mainly related to the two project divisions, Cement and Minerals, where both revenue and margins have been under pressure. Additionally, SG&A costs in all four divisions were scrutinized, and complete management levels were taken out to eliminate duplication of functions in divisions and countries.

Simultaneously, the local country organisations have been strengthened via the appointment of country CEOs and CFOs with reinforced mandates and a clear responsibility for optimising and managing local shared costs and resources.
As a consequence, an increasing share of the Group's capacity costs, also referred to as Sales, General and Administrative

Group costs were also heavily impacted by the corrective actions, as the cost structure was adjusted to a lower level of activity than anticipated at the beginning of the year.
As a consequence of the corrective actions, country and group costs allocated to divisions will be reduced with full year effect in 2017.

The purpose of the corrective actions is to strengthen the entire cost base, consisting of both production costs and SG&A costs, by DKK 500m in 2017. The associated oneoff costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK -350m, of which DKK -147m has been booked in 2016, and the remaining approximately DKK 200m is expected to be booked in 2017.
Segment note adjusted to reflect how costs are managed To align the external reporting with how cost is managed internally, the segment note in this Annual Report has been adjusted to show costs that are directly related to the divisions and allocated costs that are managed at country or group level and subsequently allocated to the divisions. Please see the segment note on page 83.

CAPITAL EFFICIENCY With capital employed of around DKK 15bn, reaching the long-term target of more than 20% return on capital employed (ROCE) requires an increase in EBITA to around DKK 3bn through a combination of top-line growth and margin expansion. The equity ratio increased to 35% and the financial gearing (NIBD/EBITDA) declined to 1.6, both comfortably within the targeted capital structure. Improved working capital and positive operating cash flow led to a reduction in net interest-bearing debt of DKK 1.1bn.
Capital employed and ROCE Average capital employed was unchanged at DKK 15.2bn in 2016 (2015: DKK 15.2bn), while EBITA fell to DKK 1,289m (2015: DKK 1,582m). As a result, ROCE decreased to 8.5% (2015: 10.3%).

Certain indirect production costs are also managed centrally, including R&D, supply chain and procurement. These costs are allocated to divisions based on assessed usage and benefit.

Capital employed consists primarily of intangible assets amounting to DKK 10.2bn (average) which is mostly historical goodwill as well as patents and rights, and customer relations. Tangible assets account for DKK 2.6bn and net working capital for DKK 2.4bn, leaving little room for significant reductions in capital employed.

Cash flow developments and net working capital Cash flow from operating activities amounted to DKK 1,447m in 2016 (2015: DKK 538m), of which DKK 1,332m was related to continuing activities (2015: DKK 991m). The increase on last year is predominantly explained by a positive cash effect from change in net working capital.
Net working capital (continuing activities) amounted to DKK 2,099m at the end of 2016, which represents an improvement of DKK 0.5bn over 2015 (end of 2015: DKK 2,583m). The improvement is primarily explained by a decline in trade receivables, an increase in prepayments from customers and higher trade payables. The average net working capital ratio amounted to 12.9% in 2016 (2015: 12.3%). At the end of the year, the net working capital ratio was 11.5%.
Overdue trade receivables continue to be a key focus area and after further progress was made in 2016, overdue receivables declined from 46% to 35% of total receivables. Long overdue receivables (more than 60 days) decreased to DKK 1bn (end of 2015: DKK 1.1bn), representing 20% of total receivables (end of 2015: 23%).

Investing in the business After years on an acquisitive trajectory, investments have been held at a low level in the past four years as a response to changing market conditions. It is management's belief that in a cyclical downturn, the level of cash flow from investments (excluding acquisitions and divestments) should be below the level of depreciation and amortisation (excluding amortisations charges related to purchase price allocations), amounting to roughly DKK 0.4bn in 2016. Investments in safety are always given priority.

Equity at the end of 2016 increased to DKK 8,462m (2015: DKK 7,982), and the equity ratio increased to 35% at the end of 2016 (2015: 33%). Dividend distributed to shareholders in 2016 amounted to DKK 195m.
Net interest-bearing debt by the end of 2016 amounted to DKK 2,525m (end of 2015: DKK 3,674m) and the financial gearing was 1.6 at the end of 2016 (end of 2015: 2.0). The gearing is now well within the targeted capital structure of NIBD less than two times EBITDA.

Cash flow from investing activities amounted to DKK -194m in 2016 (2015: DKK 750m), including cash flow related to the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and activities of DKK 0m (2015: DKK 873m related to the divestment of Cembrit). Investments excluding acquisitions and divestments amounted to DKK -194m, which is less than the guidance for 2016 of DKK -0.3bn.
The free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow from investing activities) amounted to DKK 1,253m in 2016 (2015: DKK 1,288m).
Balance sheet, capital structure and dividend The balance sheet total amounted to DKK 24,112m at the end of 2016 (end of 2015: DKK 24,362m).

The available capital resources consist of committed credit facilities at a total of DKK 8.5bn (end of 2015: DKK 8.3bn) with a weighted average maturity of 3.8 years (end of 2015: 4.5 years).
It is FLSmidth's policy to pay out 30-50% of the year's profit as dividend, and the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of DKK 6 per share (2015: DKK 4) be distributed, corresponding to a total cash distribution of DKK 307m, a pay-out ratio of 59% (2015: 49%) and a dividend yield of 2.0% (2015: 1.7%). The dividend pay-out is higher than the targeted pay-out ratio because of the strong free cashflow generated in 2016.

At the same time, the global organisation has been signifi-

cantly impacted by the cyclical downturn and the changes

in market conditions over the last four years. In 2016, this

called for further efficiency improvements and business

right-sizing activities in the entire global organization.

22%

The number of employees amounted to 12,187 at the end of 2016, representing a decrease of 6% compared to last year (end 2015: 12,969). The decline is primarily explained by business right-sizing, as mentioned above.

than 2 years' seniority (end of 2015: 78%). 14% of

FLSmidth's permanently employed staff is female (end of

e mployees is explained by the fact that males continue

to be overrepresented in the engineering profession and

The Group guidance for 2017 reflects the low order backlog at the beginning of the year combined with an assumption of stable market activity in 2017. The EBITA margin guidance includes expected one-off costs of around DKK -200m related to corrective actions.

With respect to the divisional performance, it is clear that 2017 will be another challenging year for the two project divisions, Minerals and Cement, considering the low volumes and margins contained in their order backlogs at the beginning of the year. As a consequence, the EBITA margins both the Cement and Minerals Divisions are expected to be below their long-term financial target of 3-8% in 2017.

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS Overall, the market for Customer Services in 2016 was unchanged compared to the previous year.
The market for cement-related services was largely stable throughout the year, but with varying regional dynamics. North America and parts of Asia saw stronger activity, whereas South America saw a weakening. Customers focused on parts, smaller retrofits such as mill and cooler upgrades, and preventive maintenance such as kiln inspections.
The market for minerals-related services saw some weakening at the beginning of the year as customers deferred maintenance and larger purchases, reducing demand for upgrade projects and parts for inventory. Sentiment improved slightly in the second half of the year, as miners in countries like Chile, Kazakhstan, Russia and Peru increased discretionary spending, possibly as a result of higher commodity prices and an increased risk of equipment breakdown. All in all, miners remain guarded on operational expenditures, although there are signs that focus could turn more from cost cutting to asset management, especially within copper and gold.
In addition to market sentiment, FLSmidth's strategic focus on wear parts supported customer activity in the second

half of 2016 with growing sales of mill liners and FerroCer among other products. FerroCer was launched in 2015 and is a composite tile of steel and ceramic components which increases wear resistance by around 40% compared to traditional wear solutions.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2016 Order intake in Q4 2016 decreased 2% to DKK 1,616m (Q4 2015: DKK 1,655m) both organically and adjusted for currency effects.
Revenue amounted to DKK 1,786m and decreased 7% in Q4 2016 (Q4 2015: DKK 1,920m) which, nevertheless, represented the strongest quarter of the year. Currency effects had no impact on revenue in Q4.
Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 557m (Q4 2015: DKK 611m), and the corresponding gross margin was 31.2% (Q4 2015: 31.8%).
EBITA decreased 20% to DKK 223m (Q4 2015: DKK 279m) and the EBITA margin decreased to 12.5% (Q4 2015: 14.5%). EBITA in Q4 2016 was impacted by DKK -59m in one-off costs related to corrective actions (Q4 2015: DKK -21m). The EBITA margin adjusted for one-off costs was 15.8% (Q4 2015: 15.6%).

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2016 Order intake decreased 2% in 2016 to DKK 6,599m (2015: DKK 6,710m) but increased 2% when adjusted for currency effects, reflecting slightly weaker demand in the first half of the year and somewhat improved demand for minerals-related services in the second half of the year.
Revenue decreased 10% to DKK 6,555m (2015: DKK 7,294m) and declined 7% when adjusted for currency effects. The lower revenue was mainly a result of the lower backlog going into 2016 vs. the backlog entering 2015 but also explained by smaller cement service projects that generated revenue in 2015 but no revenue in 2016.
Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 2,070m in 2016 (2015: DKK 2,204m), and the corresponding gross margin was 31.6% (2015: 30.2%).
EBITA decreased 14% to DKK 816m (2015: DKK 951m) and the EBITA margin declined to 12.5% (2015: 13.0%). EBITA was impacted by DKK -75m in one-off costs related to corrective actions (2015: DKK -99m). The EBITA margin adjusted for one-off costs was 13.6% (2015: 14.4%). The decline is explained mainly by the lower revenue and operating leverage. Sales people have by and large been exempt from business rightsizing to ensure customer presence.

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS
5-10% annual revenue growth (over the cycle) EBITA margin > 15% NWC 15-20%
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS The Customer Services Division is targeting an annual revenue growth of 5-10% over the cycle (2016: -10%) and an EBITA margin above 15% (2016: 12.4%). Revenue growth in 2016 was impacted by the past years' strong cost focus, in particular in the mining industry. However, activity stabilised in the year and growth is expected to find support in improving markets and organic growth initiatives such as globalisation of service offerings, a stronger focus on wear parts, and concentration of product line management on productivity-focused solutions.
The margin target is expected to be achieved through better operating leverage and a better product mix, with the focus on activities that will maximise customers' installed base availability and return on assets.

PRODUCT COMPANIES

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS The market for Product Companies weakened slightly in 2016, primarily as a result of continued weak demand for equipment in general and for large project related activities in cement and adjacent industries, but also supported by solid demand for parts and services in minerals, driven by higher commodity prices.
Recent activity and customer inquiries suggest that the aftermarket will remain the driver for minerals-related business in the short-term, whereas cement and adjacent industries, such as power and steel, are showing positive signs from a new project perspective, although decisionmaking takes time. In general, customers focus on replacements, modernisations and products related to productivity improvements, with a particular focus on longer wear life, environmental solutions, and investment pay-back time.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2016 Order intake in Q4 2016 increased 15% to DKK 1,438 (Q4 2015: DKK 1,252m) and increased 13% when adjusted for currency effects, driven by higher demand for air pollution control systems and minerals parts and services.
Revenue decreased 11% to DKK 1,315m (Q4 2015: DKK 1,473m), reflecting the level of order intake in the past few quarters.

Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 440m (Q4 2015: DKK 451m), and the corresponding gross margin was 33.4% (Q4 2015: 30.6%).
EBITA in Q4 2016 decreased 18% to DKK 151m (Q4 2015: DKK 184m), explained partly by the lower level of revenue compared to Q4 last year and partly by the difference in one-off costs. The Q4 EBITA margin decreased to 11.5% (Q4 2015: 12.5%). EBITA included one-off costs of DKK -22m (Q4 2015: 7m). The EBITA margin adjusted for oneoff costs was 13.2% (Q4 2015: 12.0%).
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2016 Order intake decreased 7% to DKK 5,326m in 2016 (2015: DKK 5,742m) and decreased 5% when adjusted for currency effects. The decrease was primarily a result of a few larger air pollution control and automation orders received in 2015 which did not repeat in 2016, but also due to weak demand for mining equipment at the beginning of the year.
Revenue decreased 12% to DKK 5,015m (2015: DKK 5,711m and declined 10% when adjusted for currency effects, due to lower activity related to air pollution control systems and new cement projects. Minerals-related activities held up overall, as a strong aftermarket compensated for weak activity with respect to new equipment.

Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 1,608m in 2016 (2015: DKK 1,759m), and the corresponding gross margin was 32.1% (2015: 30.8%).
EBITA was down 26% to DKK 560m (2015: DKK 756m) and the EBITA margin decreased to 11.2% (2015: 13.2%). EBITA in 2016 included one-off costs of DKK -37m (2015: DKK 8m). The EBITA margin adjusted for one-off costs was 11.9% (2015: 13.1%). The decline was a result of lower operating leverage which impacted the Product Companies division more than the other divisions due to its greater content of in-house manufacturing and assembly.
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS The Product Companies Division targets an annual revenue growth of 5-10% over the cycle (2016: -12%) and an EBITA margin of 12-15% (2016: 11.2%). Organic growth initiatives initiated in 2016 were unable to compensate for market headwinds and lower project-related activities across industries. Nevertheless, growth is the key divisional focus area, and all product companies share the same ambition and potential to grow in their core markets as well as close adjacent industries where existing technologies can be applied.

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS
5-10% annual revenue growth (over the cycle) EBITA margin 12-15% NWC ~15%
As a result of lower operating leverage and one-off costs related to corrective actions, Product Companies was slightly below its targeted EBITA margin range in 2016. A stabilising business environment should be sufficient to get back within the targeted range.

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS While commodity prices increased across the board in 2016, miners remained committed to strengthening their balance sheets through lower investments and targeted procurement savings. This led to weak demand for projects and systems, whereas single equipment sales, enhancing customer productivity, was more stable. South America, South East Asia, North America and Australia showed most activity, especially in copper and gold.
The number of inquiries remained weak in the period despite increased customer dialogue. The most active commodity markets in Q4 were gold, c opper and lithium, followed by modest activity in alumina, potash, steel, iron ore and coal.

EBITA showed a positive quarterly result for the first time in two years and amounted to DKK 29m (Q4 2015: DKK -32m). As a consequence, the EBITA margin increased to 2.7% (Q4 2015: -2.8%). EBITA was impacted by oneoff costs of DKK -24m (Q4 2015: -33m), and the EBITA margin adjusted for one-off costs was 5.0% (Q4 2015: 0.1%). Q4 saw the strongest quarterly revenue in 2016 (although lower than Q4 last year) which improved the operating leverage versus the prior nine months. The leverage effect, combined with the positive impact from continued corrective actions and reversal of provisions resulting from good project execution, led to the significant margin improvement.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2016 Order intake in Q4 2016 increased 9% to DKK 685m (Q4 2015: DKK 630m) and increased 11% adjusted for currency effects.
Revenue decreased 4% to DKK 1,080m (Q4 2015: DKK 1,126m) but was unchanged over last year when adjusted for currency. Following slow progress on projects in the first 9 months of the year, activity picked up in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, about one third of the Minerals Division's backlog remains very slow moving on customer request.
Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 179m (Q4 2015: DKK 184m), and the corresponding gross margin was 16.7% (Q4 2015: 16.4%).

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2016 Order intake in 2016 decreased 35% to DKK 2,679m (2015: DKK 4,112m). Though disappointing, it should be seen in the context of the 31% order intake increase last year in a deteriorating market. As no large orders were received in 2016 (2015: DKK 1bn of orders above DKK 200m), the order intake represents a fairly solid base of small orders.
Revenue decreased 11% to DKK 3,185m (2015: DKK 3,576m) and declined 6% adjusted for currency effects which was below expectations at the beginning of the year. As described above, conversion of the backlog was challenged by one third of the order backlog which turned very slow moving during the year.

Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 530m in 2016 (2015: DKK 627m), and the corresponding gross margin was 16.6% (2015: 17.5%). The decrease in gross margin reflects a somewhat intensified pricing pressure, as communicated in the 2016 interim results.
Like the revenue, EBITA in 2016 was impacted by slow conversion of the backlog and low operating leverage. Una nticipated project delays challenged the planning of resources and caused considerable under-absorption. Consequently, EBITA amounted to DKK -135m, which nevertheless was an improvement on last year (2015: DKK -258m) owing to ongoing business right-sizing, satisfactory project execution, and not least a lower level of one-off costs compared to the previous year. Accordingly, the EBITA margin was -4.3% (2015: -7.2%). EBITA in 2016 was impacted by DKK -38m in one-off costs (2015: DKK -185m), and the adjusted EBITA margin was -3.0% (2015: -2.0%).
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS The Minerals Division targets annual revenue growth of 5-6% over the cycle (2016: -11%) and an EBITA margin of 3-8% (2016: -4.3%). With the end-of-2016 order backlog at 14% below the level 12 months ago, and about one-third of the backlog moving very slowly, revenue will remain under pressure in 2017. The Minerals Division, however, is exposed to the very cyclical behaviour of mining capital expenditures, and more importantly is to look at the average growth over a number of years. In the coming years, growth is expected to be supported by a cyclical rebound in the mining industry

coupled with strengthened product line management and new offerings related to ongoing R&D projects focused on enhancing customers' productivity.
The Minerals Division has been implementing significant efficiency and business right-sizing measures in the past few years to adjust the business to a market for mining capital expenditures that has declined more than 60% from the peak. The benefits of additional corrective actions currently being implemented and the prospects of a stabilising business environment, coupled with improved operational excellence, should support margins in the coming years.

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS Although tendering activity picked up slightly in the second half of 2016, the market for new cement capacity remains largely unchanged, and on a global level, supply continues to outweigh demand. Cement is, however, a local or regional business and opportunities persist in regions like Asia (mostly South Asia), parts of North Africa and parts of Latin America. Some activity is seen as well in North America, parts of the Middle East and other parts of Africa. Several years of overcapacity and relatively few orders available in the market has led to tough competition and continued pricing pressure.
Parts of the market for Operation & Maintenance was challenged by economic instability in 2016 but the O&M business continues to offer a good growth potential. The year saw customers renewing and extending the scope of existing contracts which underlines the strong value proposition.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2016 Order intake in Q4 2016 increased 159% to DKK 1,026m (Q4 2015: DKK 396m), supported by a large order of approximately DKK 525m received in Bolivia (no large orders in the comparison quarter). The order intake in a project business is lumpy per se and one quarter alone is insufficient to show a trend.
Timing of milestones on a few larger projects, and solid project execution, resulted in a strong quarterly revenue of

DKK 1,539m, representing an increase of 56% (Q4 2015: DKK 985m). As a consequence of the strong backlog conversion in Q4 and adjustments to the backlog, the backlog declined 8% year-on-year and 16% sequentially.
Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 175m (Q4 2015: DKK 106m), and the corresponding gross margin was 11.4% (Q4 2015: 10.8%).
EBITA amounted to DKK 7m which was an improvement on last year (Q4 2015: DKK -29m) but the lowest level seen in 2016, despite the leverage effect from a strong quarterly revenue. The development reflects increased execution of lower margin orders in the backlog which continues to constitute headwind going into 2017.
The EBITA margin increased to 0.4% (Q4 2015: -2.9%). The comparison quarter was impacted by DKK -42m in one-off costs while Q4 2016 saw only minor one-off costs of DKK -5m. Adjusted for one-off costs, the EBITA margin was 0.7% (Q4 2015: 1.2%).
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2016 Order intake in 2016 increased 63% to DKK 4,576m (2015: DKK 2,803m), mainly driven by a large order of more than DKK 1,500m won in Algeria early in the year.
Revenue increased 10% in 2016 to DKK 4,286m (2015: DKK 3,911m) and increased 14% when adjusted for currency effects. As 2016 started with a backlog that

was considerably lower than the backlog at the beginning of 2015, the revenue result is evidence of very solid project execution.
Gross profit, before allocation of shared cost amounted to DKK 590m in 2016 (2015: DKK 631m), and the corresponding gross margin was 13.8% (2015: 16.1%). As communicated in the 2016 interim results, the Cement division is increasingly executing on a lower margin backlog due to increased pricing pressure in the past couple of years.
Despite higher revenue, EBITA decreased 72% to DKK 28m (2015: DKK 99m) and the EBITA margin decreased to 0.6% (2015: 2.5%). EBITA included one-off costs of DKK -22m related to corrective actions (2015: DKK -44m), and the adjusted EBITA margin was 1.2% (2015: 3.7%). As mentioned above, the lower EBITA margin is a result of execution of orders in the backlog with lower margin.
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS The Cement Division targets an annual revenue growth of 3-5% over the cycle (2016: 10%) and an EBITA margin of 3-8% (2016: 0.6%). Despite a continued subdued market, FLSmidth achieved an increased order intake and showed solid project execution in 2016. As a result revenue grew above the targeted range over the cycle. Looking ahead, growth is expected to be supported by a cyclical rebound in the cement industry, coupled with leveraging the `Design, Build, Operate' business

model and the continued strengthening of productivityenhancing products and solutions.
Seven years into a cyclical downturn, the extended period of global overcapacity has resulted in intensified competition and margin pressure. Despite a series of cost management initiatives to help combat the ongoing market headwind, the Cement Division was outside the targeted margin range in 2016, and the margin pressure is expected to continue into 2017. Thus, cost-reducing initiatives will remain a top priority, but FLSmidth will also work to adapt and differentiate its offering and business mix to improve margins and get back within the longterm target.

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

FOCUSED INNOVATION RAPID COMMERCIALISATION

FLSmidth's future economic results are not dependent on the success of single innovations but on the continued stream of new developments to enhance our existing strong offering. In 2016, FLSmidth spent DKK 202m on in-house R&D to ensure productivity enhancing solutions that turn our customers' everyday challenges into opportunities. In addition, project-financed developments are undertaken in cooperation with customers.

INNOVATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS FLSmidth has a strategy to focus on its core business and that applies to R&D too.
However, in the continuous pursuit of staying one step ahead of the competition, product development sometimes calls for innovation within non-core technologies and in those cases, FLSmidth will look to partner up with technology experts rather than attempt to `reinvent the wheel'. As an example, FLSmidth and Haldor Topsoe are seeing mutual benefits in co-developing a catalytic filter bag technology. Other examples are the joint development with BASF to overcome the arsenic challenge in the mining industry, and the cooperation with GE to create enhanced digital solutions to increase productivity in the cement and mining industries.

IN-HOUSE INNOVATION FLSmidth's global technology centers are the backbone of in-house R&D. However, product development takes place locally in the product companies as well. Sophisticated laboratories and testing facilities in the USA, India and Denmark make it possible to carry out in-house pilot projects before new solutions are rolled out to customers in full scale. Fast commercialisation of new products and services is a top priority for FLSmidth.

FLSmidth also partners up with universities and firms to accelerate research. The MiCeTech (Minerals and Cement Technologies) programme is a joint research project between FLSmidth, Hempel and DTU (the Technical University of Denmark) with the support of The Danish Advanced Technology Foundation and with a clear aim to generate tangible outcomes. The programme is now half-way completed and, among other achievements, it has resulted in important contributions to the recent development of the JETFLEX® Burner.

ON-SITE INNOVATION On a frequent basis, product development takes place directly at customer sites. When specific customer requirements and the need for real-live testing go hand in hand, it is most logical to conduct feasibility studies or install pilot plants directly at a cement plant or minerals processing plant. As an example, FLSmidth is currently developing dry tailings technology (to confine tailings dams) in collaboration with copper and gold miners, just as a new cyclone technology is being developed in cooperation with a cement customer.

ENERGY
INDUSTRY CHALLENGE: Reducing the high operational and environmental cost of energy
Energy often makes up the highest cost of operating a cement plant or a minerals processing plant. The high energy consumption weigh on both the environment and the plant owners' wallet. One way to lower energy consumption is by improving equipment efficiency. In both mining and cement, grinding is one of the most energy-intense processes, and consequently improving the grinding efficiency has a huge impact. Another way to save energy is by managing overall plant consumption and optimising processes through collection and analysis of performance data.
SOLUTION 1: Introducing the world's largest and most energy efficient vertical roller mill
FLSmidth's OKTM mill is the world's most energy-efficient vertical roller mill for cement grinding, and the development of the OKTM 62-6 cement mill also makes it the world's largest by physical dimension and with the highest capacity. Large size OK mills offer the best product quality for the lowest energy consumption ­ and potentially a much lower initial investment. In addition, with the latest design update the OK mill will now be used both for cement and raw grinding applications, optimising maintenance and spare parts inventory for customers.

SOLUTION 2: ECS/EnerSentryTM Energy Management Solution for the mining and cement industries
FLSmidth's newly-launched advanced Energy Management System is an automation software that utilises the power of real-time, and historic, process and energy data and analytics to save energy, and increase utilisation and availability, of a complete cement or minerals processing plant. It can be easily integrated with existing plant process control systems which is a key purchase criterion for customers. Contrary to competing `monitoring solutions', FLSmidth makes use of its comprehensive equipment and process knowledge to take its offering one step further.
KEY FACTS: · 1-2% reduction in energy consumption and costs · Reduces 30-40% energy audit efforts · Short return on investment ­ down to 6 months ·Real time visibility and insights on key energy parameters
such as consumption, patterns, abnormalities, costs, losses, etc.

KEY FACTS: ·Up to 40% saving in capital expenditures by installing
a single OKTM 62-6 cement mill compared to installing multiple smaller mills ­ and lower total operating cost by maintaining only one mill ·10-15% more energy efficient than competing vertical roller mills ·The most flexible mill on the market for making multiple types of cement in a single machine ·Adding to the over 150 OK mill units already sold, the first OK 62-6 size mill has been sold and engineered and is being delivered in the first half of 2017 ·Additional system components supplied by FLSmidth include Max Drive from FLSmidth MAAG Gear and automation control system from FLSmidth Automation

ORE QUALITY
INDUSTRY CHALLENGE: Getting the most out of your raw materials and equipment
Access to high quality raw materials is one of the major everyday concerns for mining and cement plant operators across the globe. Although raw materials for cement production are widely accessible, the quality differs, and once a plant is built, the utilisation of raw materials is key to producers' profit. For some minerals like copper and gold, the quality of ore grades is constantly declining, making it more important than ever to increase recovery. Other minerals are more abundant, but the quality of deposits varies a lot, and combined with the costly handling of material, it remains crucial to get more out of less.
SOLUTION 1: Rapid Oxidative Leach® (update)
Background: 80-90% of all copper mines in the world are open pit (inverted cone shaped) mines. The top of the mine consist of oxide bound ore that is processed via heap leaching, followed by SX-EW to extract and produce copper cathode. As the mine develops, sulfide ore is exposed. Once sulfide ore is available, the mine will install a concentrator to produce copper concentrate of at least 25% Cu (copper) that will be shipped to a smelter (for 98% Cu concentration) and then refining (for 99.9% Cu).
The quality of the copper ore globally is decreasing and a lot of the remaining and existing mines have lost the ability to make copper concentrates of a sufficient concentration for smelting, as smelters require concentrates of more than 25% Cu. When the quality is not suitable for smelting the miners pay an additional treatment cost to blend their concentrates with other higher copper content concentrates. This treatment cost for low quality ore comes on top of the refining cost and the significant cost in transport as smelters are few and far between. For many miners, especially small to medium sized mines (15,000-100,000 tonnes/year), the cost of smelting can easily make up 25% of the end price of the copper, meaning that their ore is not economically viable to process. With this as an industry condition, the copper mining industry faces two significant challenges:

SUB-CHALLENGE 1: Economic stress in the transition from oxide to sulfide ore When miners transit from leaching oxide ore to processing sulfide ore, they are facing a period of declining utilisation of existing assets (solvent extraction/electrowinning equipment and staff), while they need to make additional investment in a concentrator for the processing of the sulfide ore. This economically stressful period can last several years and threaten operations.
SUB-CHALLENGE 2: Smelters rejecting arsenic polluted ore Globally, the availability of high quality copper ore deposits is decreasing, and an increasing share of the remaining deposits contains high levels of arsenic. In Chile, where more than 20% of the global copper deposits are based, already half of the mines are arsenic polluted, a number that is projected to significantly increase in the coming years.
Many smelters reject to treat concentrates containing arsenic. Others impose significant treatment cost penalties for ore containing more than 0.1% arsenic, and for concentrates containing more than 0.5% arsenic, it is very difficult to even find a solution. 30% of the world's copper concentrate output contains more than 0.1% arsenic. Since 2014, the volume of copper concentrate with high levels of arsenic has exceeded treatment capacity in smelters, where currently only one in the world is willing to treat concentrates containing more than 1% arsenic.
The Rapid Oxidative Leach® (ROL) solution: The copper industry has repeatedly attempted to leach primary copper sulfides just like the oxide ore, but without success: When the sulfide ore starts to leach, the sulfur creates a layer of passivation on the surface of each copper particle, inhibiting the chemical reaction that dissolves copper.
FLSmidth's Rapid Oxidative Leach® (ROL) mechano-chemical process is an alternative route to smelting, as ROL economically dissolves copper from low to mid-grade primary sulfide copper concentrates ­ even arsenic polluted ­ so it becomes feasible to produce cathode copper from concentrate directly at site rather than to sell the concentrate to a smelter. ROL can leach 97-99% copper from concentrates as low as 5% copper in less than 6 hours. The operating conditions of 80 degrees Celsius and atmospheric pressure makes it possible to leach directly at the mine and hence

ORE QUALITY

allows for a seamless transition from oxide bound ore to sulfide bound concentration, and the on-site SX-EW operation can be kept fully active for years getting more out of existing assets and avoiding costly smelting.

A high level of arsenic binds a high amount of gold that is potentially an additional source of revenue for the copper producers. While valuable by-product minerals such as zinc, lead, gold, silver, manganese, etc. are difficult to recover in smelting, they are easily recoverable from a ROL process.

In 2016, FLSmidth did pilot testing of ROL on various copper ore types with success and will in 2017 enter the phase of pilot-plant testing and feasibility studies with customers. FLSmidth's partnership with BASF for the arsenic track is progressing successfully and will also enter the pilot-plant phase in 2017.

SOLUTION 2: Down Draft Cyclone (DDX)
FLSmidth's newly launched patent-pending Down Draft cyclone (mixing raw material and preheater gas in a cement plant) has been installed and proven with a customer in Ukraine. The installation together with other kiln modifications resulted in 19% increased production (from 2,600 tonnes/day to 3,100 tonnes/day) and reduced power consumption, with stable and reliable operation. The ultra-light design with roughly half the weight of traditional cyclones makes it ideal for upgrade projects as a cyclone with up to 20% larger diameter can be installed without increasing the load of the existing preheater structure. Alternative, much heavier, cyclones require expensive reinforcement of the pre-heater tower which often makes an upgrade project economically unviable.

SERVICE
INDUSTRY CHALLENGE: Avoiding expensive downtime ­ or complete plant closure!
Three crushers, each weighing as much as an Airbus 380, are the heart of the world's largest copper mine, in the world's driest desert, the Atacama Desert in Chile. Every hour, they crunch 20 times their own weight of giant rocks. 24 hours a day, the three crushers chew more than 400,000 tonnes of rock, of which less than 1% is turned into pure copper a few kilometres further down the process.
This daily chewing where several hundred tonnes of rock is thrown around on reinforced steel lines translates into a continuous cost in wear parts and DKK 500,000 in lost earnings for every hour spent replacing them. Maintenance is more than a third of the operating cost for miners and wear is a key part.
In the past years, sensor technologies have undergone m ajor advancements and with internet of things (IoT), control systems can be integrated with maintenance systems, enabling

access to real time data for assets. This in turn enables maintenance to develop from reactive through proactive to a condition-based operation, where the greatest returns are created by operating the plant while taking a calculated risk into account. Better knowledge of the correlation between wear and process due to embedded sensors in the equipment means that some repair jobs can be postponed to the next relining given the risk of continuing operation.
SOLUTION 1: Smart Parts program ­ improving maintenance planning
In 2016, FLSmidth initiated a Smart Parts Program embedding sensors and transducers in equipment critical for the process flow. The sensor technology has been tweaked, and the first piece of equipment ready to be wired is the Gyratory Crusher. When the test results have proven successful, the model will be standardized and rolled out on other pieces of equipment. Alternative technologies are already used in FLSmidth's SmartCyclone TM which is a cyclone management system that offers increased process uptime, improved recovery, and predictable circuit maintenance through builtin wear detection and roping sensor technology, combined with FLSmidth's SmartwearTM automation control system. The SmartCyclone TM was lauched in 2016.

Tailings management and the (social) license to operate is on top of the agenda of the global mining industry, and increasingly tighter regulations are forcing miners to rethink traditional tailings storage solutions.

Different types of sensor technologies are being implemented for different purposes. The commonality is that ad vances in cost, availability and ease of programming within sensor technologies have created a space of opportunity for innovations related to asset management. Some of the most important technologies are related to hyperspectral sensing, laser scanning, ultrasonic material characterization, magnetic and electric probing, but also classical vibration monitoring and strain measuring remain important.

One of the world's biggest gold producers and FLSmidth have partnered up to develop a method of co-mingling tailings with mine waste in a continuous process to produce an environmentally safe alternative for tailings and waste rock storage.
The customer requests an environmentally safe solution that is also economically competitive with traditional tailings disposal methods.

During the summer of 2016, FLSmidth formed a partnership with General Electric on integrating data from the equipment on GE's cloud-based IoT-platform, Predix. By collecting all equipment data from vibrations to temperature and flow on the Predix platform, FLSmidth's software can recognize significant patterns, diagnose their exact condition and get the machines to act in response to those patterns. This will enable the customer to constantly optimize operations.
SOLUTION 2: Environmentally safe tailings management through continuous co-mingled tailings for large scale mines
Background: Tailings is the material left over after the valuable mineral has been seperated from an ore body. As much as 99.5% of the 100,000-400,000 tonnes per day of copper ore that a mine processes will become tailings, and as mines tend to operate for decades, tailing ponds are some of the biggest manmade structures on earth. Along with the tailings, huge waste rock disposal areas are required. For the local communities and governments, tailings and waste rock dumps are a target for much disapproval due to the potential environmental risks of contaminating the groundwater. As a consequence, governments increasingly require detailed tailings management plans from miners in order to issue new permits.

The solution being developed by the gold miner and FLSmidth is continuous co-mingling: ·A sustainable waste product is produced by continuously
mixing filtered concentrator tailings with crushed waste rock. ·The filtered tailings cost is minimized by using "fast filtering" and using waste rock to provide additional strength to the blended material. ·The acid rock drainage risk of the waste rock is reduced by filter cake filling the voids of the waste rock matrix, eliminating oxygen to flow through. ·The resulting co-mingled waste is both geochemically and geotechnically stable. ·Fast filtering of the concentrator tailings allows for significant water recovery and reuse.
Co-mingled waste disposal has been used successfully at small scale mine sites before but requires dozers, trucks, high cost liquid-solid separation, and significant manpower to produce a suitable mixture, having made co-mingling too costly for large ore bodies. FLSmidth's solution is able to economically process the significant amount of ore continuously using less energy than traditional solutions.

For existing mines, the challenge is that their tailings storage facilities risk constraining their remaining mine life as they are pushed to unplanned heights to accommodate additional production that was not anticipated when the mines and tailings dams were originally designed or permits issued.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND DIVIDEND FOR 2016 FLSmidth Management takes a conservative approach to capital structure due to the cyclical nature of the business, with the emphasis on relatively low debt, gearing and financial risk.
The Board of Directors' priority for capital structure and capital allocation is the following: 1. Well-capitalized (NIBD/EBITDA < 2) 2. Stable dividends (30-50% of net profit) 3. Invest in organic growth 4. Value-adding M&As 5. Share buyback or special dividend
The Board of Directors will propose at the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of DKK 6 per share (2015: DKK 4) corresponding to a dividend yield of 2.0% (2015: 1.7%) and a pay-out ratio of 59% (2015: 49%) be distributed for 2016.
The available capital resources consist of committed credit facilities at a total of DKK 8.3bn (end of 2015: DKK 8.3bn) with a weighted average maturity of 4.0 years (end of 2015: 4.5 years).

FLSMIDTH INVESTOR RELATIONS Through the Investor Relations function, the Board of Directors maintains an ongoing dialogue between the company and the stock market and ensures that the positions and views of the shareholders are reported back to the Board.
The purpose of the FLSmidth & Co. A/S Investor Relations function is to contribute to ensuring and facilitating that: ·all shareholders have equal and sufficient access to
timely, relevant and price-sensitive information; ·the share price reflects FLSmidth's underlying financial
results and a fair market value; ·the liquidity and the day-to-day trading turnover of
the FLSmidth share is sufficiently attractive for both short-term and long-term investors; and ·the shareholder structure is appropriately diversified in terms of geography, investment profile and time horizon.

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF FLSMIDTH & CO. A/S Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements of FLSmidth & Co. A/S for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2016, which comprise the income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of significant accounting estimates and policies, for the Group as well as the Parent, and the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and the parent financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF WORK IN PROGRESS Refer to chapter 1 and notes 2.1, 2.4 and 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements
Significant judgements are required by Management in determining stage of completion and estimation of profit on each project, including assessment of specific project risks. Specific project risks include disputes with customers and contingencies relating to e.g. technical, operational and country issues, especially relating to contracts classified by Management as risky, such as certain operation and maintenance contracts and contracts in oil producing countries. Minor changes in the stage of completion and specific project risks can have a significant impact on the valuation and recognition of work in progress and income for the year.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2016 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2016 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Also, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Parent at 31 December 2016 and of its financial performance for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2016 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements section of this auditor's report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2016. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Accordingly, valuation and recognition of work in progress is considered to be a key audit matter.
How the matter was addressed in the audit Based on our risk assessment, we have assessed the relevant internal controls for work in progress primarily relating to contract acceptance, change orders, monitoring of project development, costs incurred and estimation of costs to complete and assessment of specific project risks.
We obtained from Management overviews of the Group's contracts in progress at 31 December 2016. Based on assessed project risk and materiality, we selected a sample of contracts where we obtained the underlying contracts, including change orders, original budgets and any changes made to original budgets, including estimates of costs to complete, project reports and overview of identified specific project risks and contingencies, where deemed relevant by us.
For the selected contracts, we assessed and challenged Management's assumptions for determining stage of completion with due consideration to its assessment of project risks and contingencies and estimated profit through interviews with project controllers, project management, legal department and management representatives as well as our understanding and assessment of the contract terms, associated project risks, including valuation of change orders under discussion with customers and final acceptance. Additionally, we attended project meetings where the project performance, cost to complete and project risks, including likelihood of the risks materialising, were discussed and assessed in details. Furthermore, we performed retrospective reviews of completed contracts, including assessment of outcome of project risks and contingencies to assess the completeness and accuracy of Management's assumptions applied throughout the contract period.

VALUATION OF TRADE RECEIVABLES Refer to chapter 1 and note 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements
The determination of the recoverable amount from trade receivables is based on an assessment of ageing of the receivables as well as specific characteristics and circumstances of the customer, e.g. ability to pay, access to securities and payment guarantees provided on behalf of the customer by third parties, possibility to offset assets against claims, as well as country-specific matters. Significant judgement is required by Management in determining the recoverable amount, including assessment of customer credit worthiness, customer payment patterns and plans and current economic trends especially relating to trade receivables from customers in challenged financial situations and markets with liquidity limitations, e.g. parts of Africa and the Middle East.

PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTIES, LOSS-MAKING CONTRACTS, LEGAL CASES AND TAX RISKS Refer to chapter 1 and note 4.8 to the consolidated financial statements
Provisions for warranties, loss-making contracts and legal cases are ­ among other things ­ measured on the basis of empirical information covering several years, legal opinions for legal cases and expected future warranties etc., which by nature are uncertain. Significant judgement is required by Management in determining provisions.
Tax provisions in respect of a number of uncertain tax positions are measured on the basis of Management's assessment. Significant judgement is required by Management in assessing the risks relating to these tax positions.

Accordingly, valuation of trade receivables is considered to be a key audit matter.

Accordingly, provisions for warranties, loss-making contracts, legal cases and tax risks are considered to be a key audit matter.

How the matter was addressed in the audit Based on our risk assessment, we have assessed the relevant internal controls for determining the recoverable amount for trade receivables, primarily relating to dunning, monitoring of ageing and credit risk management procedures. In addition, we performed detailed substantive testing on a sample of trade receivables at 31 December 2016, assessing the valuation through the ageing compared to time of invoicing, subsequent payments and customer-specific circumstances as well as our understanding of the project management, invoicing and collection processes.
We assessed and challenged Management's ageing and recoverability analyses of trade receivables and the underlying process by which they were prepared, including the mathematical accuracy and assumptions of the recoverability model, including, interviews with local managements, who are the most knowledgeable of the customers. We evaluated the appropriateness of the recoverability model in the light of historical accuracy and retrospective review of such model and the current trend of payment patterns by business division.
We further assessed the reasonableness of Management's customer-specific analyses based on customer circumstances as well as current economic trends, especially in parts of Africa and the Middle East. We assessed and challenged Management's assumptions for expecting future payments from customers, including its assessment of customer credit worthiness with due consideration to security received or guarantees provided by third parties, agreed payment plans and adherence hereto.

How the matter was addressed in the audit Based on our risk assessment, we have assessed the relevant internal controls and procedures for provisions relating to warranties in respect of projects, goods or services delivered. In addition, we selected a sample of provisions at 31 December 2016 where we obtained the underlying empirical information and assessments of the related provisions. For the selected provisions, we assessed and challenged Management's assessment of the underlying empirical information, ageing of warranty period and internal and external assessments through interviews with group functions, project management and legal department as well as our understanding and assessment of the contract terms, associated project risks and external legal confirmations.
We assessed the relevant internal controls for Management's assessment of uncertain tax positions and we obtained and evaluated Management's overview and assessment of uncertain tax positions. We have utilised international tax specialists to assist us in the evaluation and challenge of the assumptions and estimates in relation to the level of provision recognised for uncertain tax positions. We have corroborated the movements in these provisions during the year, and the closing balances against our expectations.
Furthermore, we obtained from Management an overview of the Group's risky projects and ongoing legal cases supplemented by our understanding of ongoing projects and cases, which we compared to the recognised provisions for warranties and legal cases evaluating the completeness hereof.

CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Refer to chapter 1 and notes 4.5 and 4.7 to the c onsolidated financial statements
The current trough in the macroeconomics related to minerals has prolonged the cyclical downturn of the industry and postponed the expected increased growth. The determination of recoverable amount for the Cash-generating units was based on the valuein-use derived from future free net cash flow based on budgets and the strategy for the coming six years and cash flows from the terminal period. Significant judgement is required by Management in determining value-in-use, including free cash flow projections based on financial budgets for 2017 and financial forecasts for 2018-2022, discount rate and growth rate in the terminal period.
Accordingly, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets considered to have indefinite useful life relating to Cashgenerating units is considered to be a key audit matter.
How the matter was addressed in the audit Based on our risk assessment, we have obtained and evaluated Management's determination of future cash flow forecasts for the Cash-generating units, and the underlying process by which they were drawn up, including the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow model and agreeing future growth, investment and margin assumptions to the latest Board approved budget and financial forecasts. We used our valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of key market-related assumptions in Management's valuation model, including discount rates and terminal growth rates. We assessed the reasonableness of Management's future forecasts of growth, investment and margin included in the cash flow forecasts in the light of the historical accuracy of such forecasts and the current operational results.

VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Refer to chapter 1 and note 2.5 to the consolidated financial statements
The valuation of deferred tax asset is determined based on the recoverable value of the part of deductible temporary tax differences expected to be utilised within a foreseeable future as well as the expected release of the timing-related differences. Significant judgement is required by Management in determining the recoverable value, including projections of future taxable income, based on financial budgets for 2017 and financial forecasts, especially for the US where future operating results are subject to high uncertainty.
Accordingly, the valuation of deferred tax assets is considered to be a key audit matter.
How the matter was addressed in the audit Based on our risk assessment, in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, we have obtained and evaluated Management's expectations of generating future taxable profits in the foreseeable future, and the underlying process by which they were drawn up, including the mathematical accuracy of the models and agreeing future growth and margin assumptions to the latest Group Executive Management approved budget and financial forecasts as well as the expected related utilisation of deductible temporary tax differences. We assessed the reasonableness of Management's determination of expected future taxable profits in the light of the historical accuracy of such forecasts and the current operational results in the US.
In assessing the level of headroom, we performed a downside sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions, by using a range of lower growth rates and margin.

In assessing the level of headroom in the value-in-use calculations

for the Cash-generating units, we performed a downside sensitivity

analysis around the key assumptions, using a range of higher



discount rates and lower terminal growth rates.

STATEMENT ON THE MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW Management is responsible for the management's review
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements does not cover the management's review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the management's review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the management's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the management's review.
Management's responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Management is also responsible for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exits. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and these parent financial statements.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ·Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control

·Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent's internal control
·Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management
·Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent to cease to continue as a going concern
·Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view
·Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CHAPTER 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

Significant accounting estimates and assessments by Management
The preparation of the Annual Report requires that Management makes accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments to complex areas of accounting that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applying the Group´s accounting policies. As a consequence of the complex nature and the significant effect to the report, these areas have high attention of the Management through-out the year.

Revenue in work-in-progress for third parties
Trade receivables Provisions
Inventories

Estimates regarding revenue when applying the percentage of completion method are associated with a high degree of uncertainty due to the complex nature of the project and the parameters that are part of the assessment.
Total expected costs related to work-in-progress for third parties are partly based on estimates, as they include provisions for unforeseen cost deviation and future warranty claims. Furthermore, major projects are executed in parts of the world where macro-economic and political factors could materially impact the estimates and subsequently the recognition of revenue.
Mitigation: Management and highly skilled key personnel are performing continues evaluation of estimates based on direct supervision of each project. The evaluation is done taking all contractual obligations into account combined with cross-functional support from the entire group.
Estimates are applied when management determines the level of receivables recoverbility.
Mitigation: Management analyses trade receivables individually on an ongoing basis including: · Evaluation of the customer´s ability to pay · Ageing of the receivable · Possibility to offset assets against accounts receivables · Access to other securities
Estimates are applied determining the need of provisions including assessment of project related risks, warranty claims and legal cases.
Mitigation: Provisions for warranty claims are estimated on a project-by-project basis based on historical realised cost related to claims in the past. The provision covers estimated own costs of completion, subsequent warranty supplies and unsettled claims from customers or subcontractors.
Provisions regarding disputes and lawsuits are based on Management's assessment of the likely outcome settling the cases based on the information at hand at the balance sheet date.
The cost of loss-making projects covering projects expected to result in a loss, are assessed by Management and highly skilled key personnel.
Estimates are applied in assessing net realisable values of inventories.
Mitigation: Management assessment of net reliable value of inventories is performed items by item including: · Test for slow moving inventory · Test for aging of inventory · Assessment of expected market (pricing and market potential) · Assessment of strategic inventory items

Certainty of the estimates and assessments

Very limited impact from management assumptions and judgements Limited impact from management assumptions and judgements Impact from management assumptions and judgements High impact from management assumptions and judgements

FLSMIDTH ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / 79

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

CHAPTER 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)

Certainty of the estimates and assessments

Deferred tax assets and liabilities

Estimates are applied in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Mitigation: Management assess whether it is likely that there will be taxable income in the future against which timing differences or tax losses carry forwards may be used. For this purpose, management estimates the coming year´s earnings based on budgets.

Tangible assets

Estimates are applied in assessing the value in use of tangible assets.
Mitigation: Management estimates useful life and residual value of individual assets. Management continuously monitors whether any write downs should be recognised due to the carrying amount being higher than the recoverable amount.

Intangible assets/ impairment test

Estimates are applied in assessing the value in use of intangible assets.
Mitigation: Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Development projects are also tested for impairment at least once a year.

Assets that are subject to amortisation, such as intangible assets in use or with definite useful life, and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include the following: · Changes of R&D project expectations · Lower-than-predicted sales related to particular technologies · Changes in the economic lives of similar assets · Relationship with other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment

Pension assets

Estimates are applied in assessing the Group´s pension assets and liabilities.
Mitigation: The actuarial assessments are based on several assumptions made by Management regarding the benefit plan: · Discount rate · Inflation · Mortality

For further description regarding mitigation of descripted risks, please refer to notes regarding the individual items. The above items are deemed significantly affected by management estimates. All other items in the annual report are not significantly affected by management estimates.

Accounting policy
FLSmidth operates in the following divisions: Customer Services, Product Companies, Minerals and Cement which forms the basis for Management's day-to-day control of the business.
Customer Services include service, spare and wear part sales, as well as upgrades carried out before, during and after FLSmidth has installed a plant and commissioned it.
Product Companies include nine diverse product companies. Some offer primarily systems while the majority offers products with in house on assembly or manufacturing. All product companies are characterised by a high service content.
Minerals encompasses all the technologies, products, processes and systems used to separate commercially viable minerals from their ores. The Minerals division delivers engineered and customised single products, EPS projects and EPC projects to the global mining industry.
Cement includes design/engineering and building of complete cement plants, production lines, single machinery, knowhow, services and maintenance to the global cement industry.
Operation and maintenance (O&M contracts) of cement plants are included in the Cement division.
Administrative functions such as Finance, HR, IT and Legal are shared by the divisions. The administrative functions are based in the individual countries, but supported by Shared Services Centres located in Chennai, India and Group Functions mainly located in Denmark. Additionally, the divisions are supported by Group functions related to for example Procurement, Logistics and Marketing. Research and development not originating from work performed for customers are part of a Group function.
Shared costs are allocated to business segments based on assessment of usage.
Other companies, etc. consists of eliminations, companies with no activities, real estate and the parent company, while discontinued activities consist of Cembrit, bulk material handling activities and run-off on activities sold in previous years.
Revenue, assets, non-current assets and employees are presented by geographical region. Segment income and costs include transactions between divisions. Such transactions are determined on market terms. The transactions are eliminated in connection with the consolidation.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement on delivery and passing of the risk to the buyer, and when the revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue consists of the following products and services: · Project sales · Product sales · Services, spare parts, wear parts sales, etc.
Please see note 7.14 regarding the use of percentage of completion method and invoicing principle.
Work-in-progress for third parties is recognised in revenue based on the value of the work completed at the balance sheet date, whereby the revenue corresponds to the sales value of the year's completed work based on costs incurred as percentage of the total estimated costs (percentage of completion method).
Revenue from the supply of services, spare parts and wear parts are recognised as revenue in line with the services agreed being supplied, so that the revenue corresponds to the sales value of the work completed in the financial year.
Production costs include raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and production overheads such as administration and factory management.
Research and development costs are charged to production costs in the income statement for the financial year in which they are incurred. Development costs related to certain products or processes are recognised as intangible assets to the extent that such costs are likely to generate future earnings. See note 4.5 in the consolidated financial statements for further specification.
Sales costs comprise direct marketing costs, salaries for the sales and marketing functions as well as other indirect costs related to sales activities.
Administrative costs comprise the costs of administrative staff and management as well as other indirect administrative costs.
All intercompany transactions are made on market terms.

Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Total expected costs related to work-in-progress for third parties are partly based on an estimate, as they include provisions for unforeseen cost deviations in future supplies of raw materials, subcontractor products and services plus construction and handing over. Provisions for warranties on work-in-progress for third parties are based on Management estimates for each project, while taking underlying contracts as well as collected historical provision and warranty data into account.
The contract value of services in the form of operation & maintenance contracts is in some cases dependent upon the productivity of the plant serviced. In such cases, revenue recognition of the contracts includes Management´s estimate of the productivity of the plant.
Major projects are often sold to companies located in politically unstable countries and therefore entail enhanced risks and uncertainties related to project execution,

Accounting policy
Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except differences relating to initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is calculated based on the applicable tax rates for the individual financial years. The effect of changes in the tax rates are stated in the income statement unless they are items previously entered in the statement of other comprehensive income.
A deferred tax liability is made to cover re-taxation of losses in foreign enterprises if shares in the enterprises concerned are likely to be sold and to cover expected additional future tax liabilities related to financial year or previous years. No deferred tax liabilities regarding investments in subsidiaries are recognised if the shares are unlikely to be sold in the short term.
The tax value of losses that are expected with adequate certainty to be available for utilisation against future taxable income in the same legal tax unit and jurisdiction is included in the measurement of deferred tax.
FLSmidth & Co. A/S is jointly taxed with all Danish subsidiaries, FLSmidth & Co. A/S being the administrator of the Danish joint taxation.
All the Danish subsidiaries provide for the Danish tax based on the current rules with full distribution. Recognition of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities is made in the individual Danish enterprises based on the principles described above. The jointly taxed Danish enterprises are included in the Danish tax payable on account scheme.
If companies in the Group have deferred tax liabilities, they are valued independently of the time when the tax, if any, becomes payable.

2.5 Tax (continued)
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is likely that there will be taxable income in the future against which timing differences or tax losses carry forwards may be used. For this purpose, Management estimates the coming year´s earnings based on budgets.
As a result of the financial performance in US the US deferred tax assets of DKK 395m (2015: DKK 292m) has only been partly recognised with an amount of DKK 274m (2015: DKK 292m). The recognition has considered future cost savings and the recovery of the market. Other assets valued at nil with an amounts of DKK 96m (2015: DKK 69m) relates to tax losses mainly in discontinued and dormant entities.

CHAPTER 3 CASH FLOW STATEMENT

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

Accounting policy
The consolidated cash flow statement is presented according to the indirect method and shows the composition of cash flow divided into operating, investing and financing activities for both continued and discontinued activities, respectively, and the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the year.
The cash flow statement is based on earnings before special non-recurring items, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA).
In net working capital and net interest-bearing debt distinction is made between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing items, and cash and cash equivalents: · Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank deposits · Interest-bearing debt items are less interest-bearing receivables · All other non-interest-bearing receivables and debt items are regarded as working capital
Cash flow from operating activities consists of earnings before special non-recurring items, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) adjusted for non-cash operating items, changes in net working capital and provisions, taxes paid and financial items.
Cash flow from investing activities comprises payments made in connection with the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and activities, the acquisition and disposal of assets and prepayments of assets.
Cash flow from financing activities comprises changes in the size of the share capital and related costs as well as acquisitions and disposal of non-controlling interests, treasury shares and payment of dividends to shareholders. The Group's cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of cash deposited with banks.

4.2 Work-in-progress for third parties
Accounting policy
Work-in-progress for third parties is recognised in revenue based on the value of the work completed at the balance sheet date.The revenue corresponds to the sales value of the year´s completed work based on costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimate costs (percentage of completion method).
The stage of completion for the individual project is calculated as the ratio between the cost incurred at the balance sheet date and the total estimated cost to complete the project. In some projects, where cost estimates cannot be used as a basis, the ratio between completed subactivities and the total project is used instead. All direct and indirect costs that relates to the completion of the contract are included in the calculation. Costs deriving from sales work and winning of contracts are not included in the calculation, but are instead recognised in the income statement as revenue in the financial year during which they are incurred.
When invoicing on account exceeds the value of the work completed, the liability is recognised as work-in-progress for third parties under short-term liabilities. Prepayments are recognised as prepayment received from customers split between long-term and short-term liabilities based on when they are expected to become effective.
Prepayments to subcontractors consist of prepayments to subcontractors in connection with work-in-progress for third parties and are measured at amortised cost.
If projects are expected to be loss-making, the loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs not yet incurred are provided for as other provisions. Provisions are based on individual assessment of the estimated loss until the projects is completed.

Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Total expected costs related to work-in-progress for third parties are partly based on estimates, as they include provisions for unforeseen cost deviations in future supplies of raw materials, subcontractor products and services plus construction and handing over. Provisions for warranties on work-in-progress for third parties are based on Management estimates for each project, while taking contract obligations into account.

4.3 Inventories
Accounting policy
Inventories are measured at cost based on weighted average prices.
In the event that cost of inventories exceeds the expected selling price less cost of completion and selling costs, the inventories are written down to the lower net realisable value. The net realisable value of inventories is measured as the expected sales price less costs of completion and costs to finalise the sale.
Write down assessment of the inventory is performed item by item including: · Test for slow moving inventory · Test for aging of inventory · Assessment of expected market (pricing and market potential) · Assessment of strategic inventory items
Obsolete items are written down to zero and disposed of. Management considers part of the inventories as strategic. Strategic items are held in inventory, even if slow moving, because they are considered key equipment to the customers, that FLSmidth need to be able to deliver with very short notice.
Work-in-progress, finished goods and goods for resale include cost of manufacturing including materials consumed and labour costs plus an allowance for production overheads. Production overheads include operating costs, maintenance of production facilities and as well as administration and factory management directly related to manufacturing.

Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Assessing net realisable value of inventories requires Management estimates taking into account marketability, obsolescence and development in expected selling prices. Following the economic downturn in the market, special attention from Management has been paid to inventory turnover, when determining net realisable value.

4.4 Trade and other receivables
Accounting policy
Receivables comprise trade receivables, receivables from construction contracts and other receivables. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A write down cost is recognised when there is an indication that an individual receivable cannot be collected. Assessment of bad debt is carried out for individual receivables and includes: ·Evaluation of the customer´s ability to pay ·Ageing of the receivable ·Possibility to offset assets against claims ·Access to other securities The write down is deducted from the carrying amount of trade receivables and the cost is recognised in the income statement as administrative costs.

Significant estimates and assessments by Management

Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that cannot, in the opinion of Management, be collected. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful receivables, Management analyses trade receivables and examines changes in customer creditworthiness, customer payment patterns and current economic trends.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables net of write downs are specified according to ageing as follows:

DKKm

2016

Ageing: Not due for payment Overdue up to one month Overdue between one and two months Overdue between two and three months Overdue between three and six months Overdue more than six months Trade receivables at 31 December

4.5 Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Goodwill Goodwill is measured in the balance sheet at cost in connection with initial recognition. Subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. When recognising goodwill, it is allocated to the cash-generating units as defined by the Management. The determination of cash-generating units complies with the managerial structure and the internal financial control and reporting in the Group. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets than goodwill with a finite useful life are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Other intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised, but are tested for impairment at least once a year.
Development projects, for which the technical rate of utilisation, sufficient resources and a potential future market or application in the Group can be demonstrated and which are intended to be manufactured, marketed or used, are recognised as completed development projects. This requires that the cost can be determined and it is sufficiently certain that the future earnings or the net selling price will cover production, sales and administrative costs plus the development costs. Other development costs are recognised in the income statement when the costs are incurred. Development costs consist of salaries and other costs that are directly attributable to development activities.
Amortisation of completed development projects except from software is charged on a straight line basis during their estimated useful life. Development projects are written down for impairment to recoverable amount if lower. Development projects in progress are tested for impairment at least once a year.
The amortisation profile is systematically based on the expected useful life of the assets, taking into account the remaining patent and agreement period and consumption (unit for production method) at the time of implementation. The basis of amortisation is reduced by impairment, if any.
Amortisation takes place systematically over the estimated useful life of the assets which is as follows: · Development costs, up to 8 years · Software applications, up to 5 years · Patents, rights and other intangible assets, up to 20 years · Customer relations, up to 30 years
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Management estimates the useful life of software systems and future development projects. The asset is then depreciated and amortised systematically over the expected future useful life.
In connection with restructuring, Management reassesses the useful life and residual values of non-current assets after the restructuring.

4.5 Intangible assets (continued)
Much of the knowledge generated in the Group originates from work performed for customers. In 2016, the Group´s research and development costs totalled DKK 202m (2015: DKK 263m). The total addition of intangible assets includes internal capitalisation of DKK 49m (2015: DKK 77m), where capitalised research and development accounts for DKK 20m (2015: DKK 46m). Research and development costs not capitalised are included in production costs.
For 30% of patents and rights acquired, the estimated useful life is between 10-20 years and for 75% of customers´ relations, the estimated useful life is between 0-10 years.
Goodwill and trademarks acquired through acquisitions are considered to have indefinite useful life. The carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks are shown below, divided into segments.

4.6 Tangible assets
Accounting policy
Land and buildings, plant and machinery and other facilities, operating equipment and tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour costs. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets until they reach the estimated residual value. Estimated useful life is as follows: · Buildings, 20 ­ 40 years · Plant and machinery, 3 ­ 15 years · Operating equipment and other tools and equipment, 3 ­ 15 years · Lease hold improvements, up to 5 years · Land is not depreciated Assets with an acquisition value of less than DKK 50,000 or expected life of less than one year are expensed in the Income Statement at acquisition. Newly acquired assets and assets of own construction are depreciated from the time they are available for use. Where acquisition or use of the asset places the Group under an obligation to incur the costs of pulling down or re-establishing the asset, the estimated costs for this purpose are recognised as part of the cost of the asset, and are depreciated during the asset's useful life. Assets held under a finance lease are measured in the balance sheet at fair value or the present value of future lease payments at the time of entering the contract, if lower. In calculating the present value, the internal interest rate of the lease agreement is used as a discounting factor or as the Group's alternative borrowing rate are depreciated like other tangible assets of the Group. The capitalised residual lease commitment is recognised in the balance sheet as debt whilst the interest component of the lease payment is recognised in the income statement as a financial item. For operating leases, the lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease period.
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Management makes an estimate of the useful life and residual values. The asset is then depreciated and amortised systematically over the expected future useful life. In connection with restructuring, Management reassesses the useful life and residual values for non-current assets used after the restructuring.

4.7 Impairment test
Accounting policy
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Development projects are also tested for impairment at least once a year.
Assets that are subject to amortisation, such as intangible assets in use or with definite useful life, and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include the following: · Changes of R&D project expectations · Lower-than-predicted sales related to particular technologies · Changes in the economic lives of similar assets · Relationship with other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment
If the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal.
Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Recognition of impairment of other assets is reversed to the extent that changes have taken place in the assumptions and estimates that led to the recognition of impairment.
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Intangible assets are primarily related to acquisition of enterprises and activities, software, and research and development projects.
In performing the annual impairment test of assets, an assessment is made as to whether the individual units of the Group (cash-generating units) to which assets are allocated will be able to generate sufficient positive net cash flow in the future to support the value of the unit concerned.
Management defines the cash-generating units based on the smallest group of identifiable assets which together generate incoming cash flow from continued use of the assets and which are independent of cash flow from other assets or groups of assets. The definition of the cash-generating units is reconsidered once a year.
An estimate is made of the future free net cash flow based on budgets and strategy for the coming six years as well as projections for the subsequent years (the terminal value). From 2023 and onwards Management expects the growth rate to remain in line with the expected long term growth rate for the industries. Significant parameters in this estimate are discount rate, revenue development, EBITA margin, expected investments and growth expectations for the terminal period.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is based on value in use calculations and is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flow.
Result of annual impairment test As at 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets of indefinite useful life were tested for impairment. The impairment test showed no indication of impairment for 2016 (2015: DKK 0). Management is currently of the belief that no changes in the key assumptions are reasonably likely to reduce the headroom in any of the cash-generating units to zero.
The annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets of indefinite useful life, was based on the reporting segments: Customer Services, Product Companies, Minerals and Cement, these being the lowest level of cash-generating units as defined by Management. The definition of cash-generating units is based on the certainty by which the carrying amount of the intangible assets can reasonably be allocated and monitored. The level of allocating and monitoring the Group's intangible assets among cash-generating units should also be seen in conjunction with the Group´s strategy. The impairment test is based on the divisional structure implemented in 2015 which are the cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the intangible assets going forward. Carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in the cash-generating units for impairment test of those assets are specified on the following page:

The Group expects an EBITA margin of 7-9% in 2017 and in the long-term on EBITA margin of 10-13%.
The discount rate has been revised for each cash-generating unit to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk free rate based on a 10-year Danish government bond, the equity risk premium and the cost of debt.
The long-term growth rate for the terminal period is based on the expected growth in the world economy as well as input from current long term swaps. Due to the current low interest rate environment, a conservative approach regarding the long-term growth rate for the terminal period has been applied. This methodology has been applied to ensure consistency with the level of the risk free rate applied as a basis for the estimation of discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate. Based on these factors, a long term growth rate for the terminal period of 1.5% has been applied.
Investments reflect both maintenance and expectations of organic growth.
Management determines the expected annual growth rate in the budget period and the expected margins based on historical experience and assumptions about expected market developments:
Customer Services Growth is based on servicing the existing installed base as well as the additional installed base generated from new Cement and Minerals project business. Revenue in 2016 was impacted by the past years' strong cost focus, in particular in the mining industry, however activity resumed in the second half of year, supported by significant commodity price increases. Production levels are the key driver for market-driven growth in Customer Services, and despite several years of a subdued cement market and a mining capex downturn, global production for cement as well as most minerals have showed stable or increasing trends.
Future growth is expected to be backed by a recovery in the cement and mining industries, and by organic growth initiatives such as globalisation of service offerings, increased focus on wear parts, expansion of maintenance business, and concentration of product line management on productivity focused solutions.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

4.7 Impairment test (continued)
Product Companies The market headwind, and lower project related activities across industries, could not be compensated for by organic growth initiatives in 2016. However increased aftermarket activity compensated for most of the decline in new equipment sales. Growth is the key divisional focus area, and all product companies share the same ambition and potential to grow in their core markets as well as close adjacent industries where existing technologies can be applied. In addition, future growth is expected to be supported by a recovery in the cement and mining industries which will generate increased project activities and consequently increased product deliveries into FLSmidth Cement and Minerals projects as well as projects outside FLSmidth.
Minerals With an order backlog end of 2016 which is below the level 12 months ago, and about one-third of the backlog currently moving slowly, revenue will remain under pressure in 2017. The Minerals Division, however, is exposed to the very cyclical behaviour of mining capital expenditures, and more importantly is to look at the average growth over a number of years. In the coming years, growth is expected to be supported by a cyclical rebound in the mining industry coupled with strengthened product line management and new offerings related to ongoing R&D projects focused on enhancing customers' productivity. Further, FLSmidth plans to enter the mining mid-market through a recently established FLSmidth controlled joint-venture.
The market for mining capital expenditures is expected to be flattish in 2017 and showing growth in the subsequent years. Except fertilizer minerals, the prices of FLSmidth's key commodities have increased between 8% and more than 100% during 2016 which is significantly improving customers' cash flow and ability to make new investments. As a big potential for improving productivity in the industry remains, miners are expected to turn focus from cost cutting to asset management, especially in copper and gold which continues to lead FLSmidth's minerals activities. According to a study by Wood Mackenzie, miners will allocate the highest share of expansion capex to copper and gold projects in the coming years.
Cement Despite a continued subdued market, FLSmidth achieved an increased order intake and showed solid project execution in 2016, and consequently revenue grew above the targeted range over the cycle. Looking ahead, growth is expected to be supported by a cyclical rebound in the cement industry, coupled with leveraging the `Design, Build, Operate' business model and a continued strengthening of productivity enhancing products and solutions. Market-driven growth is based on a rising world population, increasing urbanisation, growing wealth and increasing demand for energy and infrastructure.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed of the main assumptions in the impairment test to identify the lowest and/or the highest discount rate and the lowest growth rate in the budget period for each cash-generating unit without resulting in any impairment losses.

4.8 Provisions
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group, due to an event occurring before or at the balance sheet date, has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that financial benefits must be waived to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured according to Management's best estimate of the amount whereby the obligation is expected to be settled. Provisions for warranty claims are estimated on a project-by-project basis based on historical realised cost related to claims in the past. The provision covers estimated own costs of completion, subsequent warranty supplies and unsettled claims from customers or subcontractors. Provisions regarding disputes and lawsuits are based on Management's assessment of the likely outcome settling the cases based on the information at hand at the balance sheet date. The cost of loss-making projects covering projects expected to result in a loss, is recognised immediately in the income statement. Losses not yet incurred are provided for as other provisions. Provisions for restructuring costs are based on Management's best estimate. Provisions are only made for liabilities deriving from restructuring that has been decided at the balance sheet date in accordance with a specific plan, and only provided that the parties involved have been informed about the overall plan. Provisions consist of: · Estimated warranty claims in respect of goods or services already delivered · Guarantees and liabilities resulting from disposal of enterprises and activities (included in other provisions) · Provisions for loss-making contracts (included in other provisions) · Provisions for losses resulting from disputes and lawsuits (included in other provisions) · Provisions for tax risks (included in other provisions) · Provisions for cost related to restructuring When assessing work-in-progress for third parties, a number of project-related risks have been taken into account, including performance guarantees and operation and maintenance contracts for which allowances are made based on Management estimates. A few cases are pending before the court in connection with previously supplied projects. Provisions have been made to counter any losses that are estimated to occur in settling the cases.
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
Management assesses provisions and the likely outcome of pending and probable lawsuits, ect. on an ongoing basis. The outcome depends on future events, which are by nature uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome of lawsuits and tax disputes, Management bases its assessment on internal and external legal assistance and established precedents. Tax provisions are made to cover expected additional future tax liabilities related to the financial year or previous years. Warranties and other provisions are measured on the basis of empirically information covering several years as well as legal opinions. Together with estimates by Management of future trends, this forms the basis for warranty provisions and other provisions. Long-term warranties and other provisions, discounting to net present value takes place based on the future cash flow and discount rate expected by Management.

FLSmidth is involved in a number of ongoing legal disputes and provision is made for the estimated cost.
FLSmidth is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits in the US that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured and/or distributed by FLSmidth in the past. Part of the Group's insurance for asbestosrelated claims expired in 2014. The strategy for managing the ongoing exposure includes a potential pool-sharing agreement which FLSmidth expects to enter into in 2017. Management's present belief is that the risk caused by the pending asbestos litigation cases in the US is not material in the context of FLSmidth's total business operations.

5.2 Financial income and costs

Accounting policy
Financial income and costs comprise interest income and costs, the interest portion of finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange gains and losses on securities, liabilities and transactions in foreign currency, amortisation related to mortgage debt, etc.
Interest income and costs are accrued on the basis of the principal amount and the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the discount rate used to discount the anticipated future payments which are related to the financial asset or the financial liability so that the present value of the payments corresponds to the carrying amount of the asset and the liability, respectively.

5.5 Financial risks

Introduction FLSmidth is exposed to multiple financial risks due to its international operations. The financial risks include currency, credit, interest, and liquidity risks. The overall framework for managing financial risks is contained in the Groups' Financial Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. Most of the FLSmidth Group's financial transactions are carried out centrally from Group Treasury, located in Denmark.
By centralising, the Group achieve economies of scale and ensures cost effective management of financial facilities, daily loans / deposits, currency and interest exposure, and cash management optimization. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close coordination with the divisions. Both global and local credit and guarantee facilities, are negotiated centrally. Additionally, Group Treasury acts as financial advisor to divisions on financial risks, and wording of export letters of credit, bank and corporate guarantees, and financial packages for customers.

·FLSmidth also has various short term facilities with its core commercial banks
· Cash management is optimised by operating a cash pool system

·Cash is centralised in the cash pool where possible.

Currency risk The Group's currency risks derive from the impact of exchange rates on future commercial and financial payments. A large portion of the Group's revenue is order based with long time to completion. This creates currency exposures, for instance between the revenue currency of the contract (typically EUR and USD) and the costs associated with the project, which might be in local currencies.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

5.5 Financial risks (continued)
The main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to reduce cash flow and earnings volatility by hedging exposures back to local (functional) currencies. Various financial derivatives is used to hedge these risks. The main aspects of currency hedging policy are: · H edge FX exposures on large projects and other large transactional exposures · H edge debt and cash back to the functional currency of the entity holding the exposures
The Group´s overall currency position is managed by means of Value at Risk (VaR) which must not exceed DKK 20m per day. VaR as of December 31 2016 was DKK 2m for the risks known by the Group. A 5% increase in a given exchange rate against the Danish Kroner would have had the following impact on the consolidated profit and equity for 2016:

Credit risk The use of financial instruments entails the risk that the financial counterparties might not honor their obligations. This financial counterparty risk is minimised by using various financial counterparties, all with an acceptable credit rating.

FLSmidth is also exposed to commercial credit risks, in case customers are not paying outstandings, or suppliers are not delivering goods as agreed. FLSmidth has no particular concentration of suppliers or customers. For instance, in 2015 and 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the revenue. Moreover, the credit risk related to trade receivables is generally managed by continuous risk assessment and credit evaluation of major customers and trading partners. Credit risks on counterparties - other than banks - are minimised to the extent possible through the use of export letters of credit and guarantees, or by securing positive cash flow throughout the project execution.

Interest rate risks Interest rate risks concern the interest bearing assets and liabilities of the Group. The interest bearing financial assets consist primarily of cash in financial institutions and the interest bearing liabilities mainly consist of bank and mortgage debt. The main funding currencies of the Group are DKK, EUR, USD and AUD. The hedging of interest rates is governed by a duration range and is managed by using derivatives such as interest rates swaps.

As of December 31 2016, a majority of the Group's interest bearing debt carried a floating rate. Other things being equal, a 1% increase in the interest rate will have a DKK 25m negative impact on the Group's interest earnings (2015 DKK 37m).

Liquidity Risk The purpose of the Group's cash management is to ensure that the Group, at all times, has sufficient and flexible financial resources at its disposal to assure continuous operations and honour obligations when due. The Group manages its short term liquidity risks through a cash pool system in various currencies, and by having short term overdraft facilities in place with various financial institutions. Long term liquidity risk is managed through committed financial facilities.

At the end of 2016, FLSmidth & Co A/S had entered into the following committed financial facilities:

The weighted average maturity is 3.8 years (2015: 4.5 years) which is within the limits of the Group's Financial Policy. The committed facilities contain standard clauses such as pari passu, negative pledge, change of control and a leverage financial covenant. The Group did not default or fail to fulfil any of its financial facilities, in neither 2015 nor 2016.
The Group continuously monitors its liquidity buffer which is targeted not to be lower than DKK 2bn at any point of time, at present and based on 12 months- forecasts. Liquidity buffers are monitored on a daily basis. As of December 31 2016, the liquidity buffer of the Group is well above the threshold.
Please see note 5.3 in the consolidated financial statements for maturity structure of financial liabilities.

5.6 Derivatives
Accounting policy
Derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and subsequently measured according to fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivatives is included in other receivables (positive fair value) or other liabilities (negative fair value) as the case may be. Positive fair values are only offset against negative fair values if the Company is entitled to and intends to make a net settlement of several financial instruments (cash settlement). The fair values of derivatives are measured on the basis of market data and recognised valuation methods.
Hedge accounting consists of positive and negative fair values of derivatives, which are recognised in the balance sheet under Other financial assets and Other financial liabilities respectively.
Derivatives used for cash flow hedges are measured at fair value on the reporting date, and value adjustments are recognised in Other comprehensive income.
Income and costs relating to cash flow hedges are transferred from Other comprehensive income on realisation of the hedged item.
Derivatives are recognised on the transaction date.
Derivatives that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting are regarded as trading portfolio and recognised in the balance sheet at fair value at the balance sheet date. Value adjustments are recognised in the income statement as financial items.
Certain contracts contain conditions that correspond to derivatives. In case the embedded derivatives deviate significantly from the overall contract, they are recognised and measured as separate instruments at fair value, unless the contract concerned as a whole is recognised and measured at fair value.

Fair value of hedge instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting (economic hedge) Fair value adjustments recognised in financial items in the Income Statement amounted to DKK -111m in 2016 (2015: DKK -156m). At 31 December 2016, the fair value of the Group's hedge agreements that are not recognised as hedge accounting amounted to DKK 5m (2015: DKK -135m).
Fair value hedge To minimise the foreign currency exposure arising from trade receivables, financial liabilities and firm commitments, the Group uses forward exchange contracts. The change in the fair value is specified below:

Hedging of forecast transactions (cash flow hedge) The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge currency risks regarding expected future cash flows that meet the criteria for cash flow h edging. The fair value reserve of the derivatives is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged items are included in the income statement. In addition, unrealised fair value of derivatives is recognised in other receivables and other liabilities.

Receivables measured at amortised cost including cash and cash equivalents include trade receivables of DKK 4,533m (2015: 4,884m) work-inprogress for third parties of DKK 2,426m (2015: DKK 2,526m) and cash and cash equivalents of DKK 1,448m (2015: DKK 1,123m).

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include bank loans and mortgage debt of DKK 3,950m (2015: DKK 4,878m) and trade payables of DKK 3,037m (2015: DKK 2,546m).
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through the Income Statement are measured at quoted prices in an active market for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation methods, where all significant inputs are based on observable market data (level 2).

Of financial assets available for sale, DKK 140m (2015: DKK 91m) are measured at quoted prices in an active market for the same type of instruments (level 1). The remaining financial assets available for sale are measured using valuation methods, where all significant inputs are based on observable market data (level 2).

There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2016 or 2015.

The carrying amount is equal to the fair value except for the financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

6.4 Share-based payment, option plans

Accounting policy
Plans classified as equity-settled share options are measured at fair value at grant date of allocation and are recognised in the income statement as staff costs in the period in which the final entitlement to the options is attained. The counter item is recognised directly in the equity.
In connection with initial recognition of share options, an estimate is made of the number of options to which Group Executive Management and key staff are expected to become entitled. Subsequent adjustment is made for changes in the estimate of the number of option entitlements so the total recognition is based on the actual number of option entitlements.
The fair value of the options allocated is estimated by means of the Black & Scholes model. The calculation takes into account the terms and conditions under which the share options are allocated.

6.4 Share-based payment, option plans (continued)

The Group Executive Management and a number of key employees in the Group have been granted options to purchase 2,587,005 shares in the company at a set price (strike price).

The fair value of the options allocated is estimated by means of the Black Scholes model. The calculation takes into account the terms and conditions under which the share options are allocated.

Performance-based plans (2016 plan) In 2016 a performance-based plan was adopted.

The total value of the performance-based plan at the time of allotment is DKK 44m corresponding up to 35% of the relevant member's base salary or 179.147 shares at a listed price of DKK 247,30 of which 33.541 shares pertain Executive Management at the grant date. Exercise is depending on certain KPI-goals and employment during the period 2016-2019.

7.1 Shareholders

Accounting policy

Earnings per share (EPS) and diluted earnings per share (EPS, diluted) are measured according to IAS 33. Non-diluted earnings per share are calculated as the earnings for the year after tax from continuing and discontinued activities allocated to the shareholders of FLSmidth & Co A/S divided by the total average number of shares outstanding during the year, (shares issued adjusted for treasury shares minus share options in-the-money).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to shareholders divided by the average number of shares in circulation, including the dilutive effect of stock options in-the-money.

In connection with the disposal of Group enterprises, guarantees, etc. are issued to the acquiring enterprise. Provisions are made for estimated losses on such items.

When assessing work-in-progress for third parties, a number of project-related risks such as performance, quality and delay of projects are taken into consideration, and estimates and allowances are made based on Management estimates. The financial partners of the Group provide usual security in the form of performance guarantees, etc. for contracts and supplies. At the end of 2016, the total value of performance and payment guarantees issued amounted to DKK 6.2bn (2015: DKK 5.6bn). In cases where a guarantee is expected to materialise, a provision for this amount is made under the heading of other provisions. The Group has non-committed guarantee facilities in financial institutions exceeding DKK 9.5bn (2015: DKK 11.3bn).

In addition, the Group is from time-to-time involved in disputes that are normal for its business. The outcome of ongoing disputes is not expected to have any significant impact on the Group's financial position.

7.4 Pension assets and liabilities
Accounting policy
The Group has signed post-employment benefit plans or similar arrangements with a large part of the Group's employees. Under defined contribution plans, the employer is required to contribute a certain amount (for example a fixed sum or a fixed percentage of their pay). Under a defined contribution plan, the employees usually bear the risk with regard to future developments in the rates of interest, inflation, mortality and disability. Payments by an enterprise into defined contribution plans are recognised in the income statement for the period to which they apply and any outstanding payments are recognised in the balance sheet under other payables. Under defined benefit plans, the employer is required to contribute a certain amount (for example a retirement pension as a fixed sum or a fixed percentage of the final pay). Under a defined benefit plan, the enterprise usually bears the risk with regard to future developments in the rates of interest, inflation, mortality and disability. Changes in the computation basis result in a change in the actuarial net present value of the benefits which the enterprise is to pay in the future under this plan. Fair value is only calculated for benefits to which the employees have become entitled through their employment with the enterprise to date. The actuarial net present value less the fair value of any assets related to the plan is stated in the balance sheet among pension assets and liabilities. Differences between the expected development of pension assets and liabilities and the realised values are described as actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes in benefits concerning the employees' former employment in the enterprise result in a change in the actuarial net present value, which is considered a historical cost. Historical costs are charged immediately to the income statement if the employees have already acquired a right to the changed benefit. Otherwise, the historical costs are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Significant estimates and assessments by Management
In stating the value of the Group's defined benefit plans, the statement is based on external actuarial assessments and assumptions such as discount rate, expected return on the plan assets, expected increases in salaries and pension, inflation and mortality.
The pension liabilities incumbent on the Danish Group enterprises are funded through insurance plans. The pension liabilities of certain foreign Group enterprises are also funded through insurance plans. Foreign enterprises, primarily in USA, Switzerland and Germany, whose pension liabilities are not - or only partially - funded through insurance plans (defined benefit plans) state the unfunded liabilities on an actuarial basis at the present value at the balance sheet date. These pension plans are partly covered by assets in pension funds. The Group's defined benefit plans were DKK 305m underfunded at 31 December 2016 (2015: DKK 283m) for which a provision has been made as pension liabilities. In the consolidated income statement, DKK 463m (2015: DKK 493m) has been recognised as contribution plans funded through insurance (defined contribution plans) and other security costs etc. In the case of plans not funded through insurance (defined benefit plans), DKK 7m is recognised (2015: DKK -5m) in the consolidated Income Statement. The actuarial result for the year at DKK -28m (2015: DKK -16m) is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.

7.5 Disposal of enterprises and activities

Accounting policy

On disposal of enterprises and activities the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the net assets at the date of disposal including remaining goodwill less expected costs of disposals is recognised in the income statement among special non-recurring items. If the activities prior to the sale were classified as discontinued activities, the difference is recognised as profit/(loss) for the year, discontinued activities.
If the final consideration is dependent on future events (contingent consideration), it is stated at fair value at the time of sale, and classified as financial assets and adjusted directly in the income statement.
Enterprises and activities sold are included in the consolidated financial statements until the date of disposal.

7.13 Accounting policies
This note sets out the Group´s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one financial statement item, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The Annual Report is also presented in accordance with Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports published by listed companies as well as the IFRS executive order issued in compliance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The financial statements of the parent company, FLSmidth & Co. A/S are presented in conformity with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act for reporting class D enterprises. The instances in which the parent company's accounting policies deviate from those of the Group have been separately described in note 18 of the financial statement of the parent company.
The Annual Report is presented in Danish kroner (DKK) which is the presentation currency of the activities of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company.
The accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements and for the parent company are unchanged from 2015. However, a few reclassifications have taken place in the comparative figures for 2015.
In 2015 it was decided to ring-fence and put the bulk material handling activities up for sale. As a consequence, this activity has been separated from the continuing business and reported as discontinued activity.
Furthermore, as a consequence of Cembrit being sold 30 January 2015, Cembrit was reported as discontinued activity in 2015.
The assets and related liabilities of the bulk material handling activities are presented in the separate lines "Assets classified as held for sale" and "Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale" in the balance sheet.
Implementation of new and changed standards and interpretations The Annual Report for 2016 is presented in conformity with the new and revised standards (IFRS/IAS) and new interpretations (IFRIC) approved by the EU, which apply to financial years beginning 1 January 2016 or later.
The implementation of new and revised standards and interpretations has not had material impact on the financial reporting for 2016.
General principles for recognition and measurement Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is likely that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is likely that future economic benefits will depart from the Group and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. In case of initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Subsequent measurements are based on value adjustments as described in the notes.
Consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company, FLSmidth & Co. A/S´ and all enterprises in which the Group holds the majority of the voting rights or in which the Group in some other way holds control. Enterprises, in which the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or in some other way holds significant influence, but not control, are regarded as associates. Investments in jointly controlled entities are recognised as joint ventures by using the pro-rata method.

FLSMIDTH ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / 134

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

/ BACK TO CONTENTS

7.13 Accounting policies (continued)
The consolidated financial statements are based on the financial statements of the parent company and the individual subsidiaries which are recognised in accordance with the Group accounting policies. All items of a uniform nature are added together, while intercompany income, costs, balances and shareholdings are eliminated. Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between consolidated enterprises are also eliminated.
The items in the financial statements of subsidiaries are fully included in the consolidated financial statements. The proportionate share of the earnings attributable to minority interests is included in the Group's profit/loss for the year and as a separate share of the Group's equity.
Materiality Transactions and information in the Annual Report are presented in classes of similar items. If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report.
There are specific disclosure requirements to the annual report according to IFRS. Management provides specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered irrelevant or immaterial to the users of the Annual Report.
Translation of foreign currency The functional currency is determined for each of the reporting enterprises. The functional currency is the currency primarily used by the individual reporting enterprises in connection with day-to-day operations.
Transactions in another currency than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currency. Transactions in another currency than the Group's functional currency are translated at the exchange rate of the day of transaction. Financial assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Any foreign exchange differences between the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction and the payment date or the balance sheet date, as the case may be, are recognised in the income statement as financial items.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the latest fair value adjustment.
The income statements of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency that differs from Danish kroner and of foreign associates and pro-rata consolidated joint ventures are translated at average exchange rates while their balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates quoted at the balance sheet date. The differences deriving from the translation of the income statements of foreign business units at average exchange rates and of their balance sheet items at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date are adjusted in the equity.
The foreign exchange adjustment of receivables from or debt to subsidiaries, that are considered part of the parent company's total investment in the subsidiary concerned, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.
If the financial statements of a foreign business unit are presented in a currency in which the accumulated rate of inflation over the past three years exceeds 100 per cent, adjustments for inflation are made. The adjusted financial statements are translated at the exchange rate quoted on the balance sheet date.
Equity/Dividend Dividend is allocated in the financial statements at the time when it is decided at the Annual General Meeting, and the company thereby incurs a liability. The dividend, which is proposed for distribution, is stated separately in the equity.
Foreign exchange adjustments Reserve for foreign exchange adjustments comprises exchange rate differences arising during the translation of the financial statements for entities with a functional currency other than Danish kroner, foreign exchange adjustments regarding assets and liabilities which account for a portion of the Group's net investment in such entities, and foreign exchange adjustments regarding hedging transactions which hedge the Group's net investment in such entities. On full or partial realisation of the net investment, the foreign exchange adjustments are recognised in the income statement in the same item as the gain/loss.
Value adjustments regarding hedging transactions Fair value adjustments comprise changes in the fair value of hedging transactions that qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges and where the hedged transaction has not yet been realised.

7.14 Implementation of standards and interpretations
Impact from new accounting standards The following amendments, interpretations and improvement projects have been adopted from 1 January 2016: · Amendments to IFRS 11 ­ Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations was issued May 2014 · Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation was issued May 2014 · Annual Improvements 2012-2014 was issued September 2014
- IFRS 5 ­ Changes in methods of disposal - IFRS 7 ­ Minor changes - IAS 19 ­ Discount rate: Regional market issue - IAS 34 ­ Disclosure of information (elsewhere in the interim financial report) · Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 ­ Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidated Exception was issued December 2014 · Amendments to IAS 1 ­ Disclosure Initiative was issued December 2014
The implementation of the amendments, interpretations and improvement projects has not had a significant impact on recognition or measurement in the Annual Report 2016 and is not expected to have material impact on the financial reporting for the coming financial years.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the time of releasing this Annual Report, the IASB has issued a number of new standards and interpretations that are not mandatory for the Annual Report 2016, some of which have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The standards and interpretations will be adopted when they are endorsed and mandatory. Furthermore they are not expected to have significant impact on recognition and measurement, but may result in further disclosure in the notes: ·IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with Customers was issued May 2014. The standard requires extensive disclosures and is effective from 1 January
2018. The implementation is expected to have impact on the revenue recognition and disclosures in the Group financial reporting.
IFRS 15 will not impact the business model, but may lead to changes in the pattern of the revenue and profit recognition. Long-term contracts will primarily be affected in terms of the recognition of the revenue and profit. IFRS 15 will impact the preparation of long-term contracts, which may be split into smaller contracts due to the performance obligations where recognition may differ with regards to product and services in the overall contract. In accordance to the divisions the following highlights the impact: Customer Service - Spare parts and components will most likely apply invoicing criteria - Services will apply invoicing criteria due to short contract periods - Basic orders will most likely apply invoicing criteria - Maintenance will be split into more than one performance obligation Product Companies - Sales will be split into more than one performance obligation Minerals - Engineering, Equipment and Supervision (EES) will be split into more than one performance obligation Cement - The POC method will be applied to major projects to the same extent going forward - EES will be split into more than one performance obligation One of the main changes is to apply a more general use of the invoicing principle depending on the recognized performance obligation.
·IFRS 9 ­ Financial instruments: Classification and Measurement and Hedge Accounting was issued July 2014. The standard is effective from 1 January 2018 and contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment methodology and general hedge accounting. An analysis of the effect of the implementation is ongoing but it is not expected to have material impact on the financial reporting.
·IFRS 16 ­ Leases was issued January 2016. The standard is effective from 1 January 2019 and contains a single accounting approach to all leases with a few exceptions. All leases are to be treated and recognized in the balance sheet as assets with a related liability and costs are recognized as depreciation and interests. The current assessment on the implementation of the standard is that it will not have a significant effect on the financial reporting, due to limited use of leases.
·Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ­ Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective date has been postponed)
· Amendments to IAS 12 - Recognition for Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (effective 1 January 2017) · Amendments to IAS 7 ­ Disclosure Initiative (effective 1 January 2017) · Annual Improvements 2014-2016:
- IFRS 12 ­ Clarification of the scope of the Standard (effective 1 January 2017) - IFRS 1 ­ Deletion of short-term exemptions for first-time adopters (effective 1 January 2018) - IAS 28 ­ Measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value (effective 1 January 2018) · Amendments to IFRS 2 ­ Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (effective 1 January 2018) · Amendments to IFRS 4 ­ Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2018) · IFRIC Interpretation 22 ­ Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective 1 January 2018) · Amendments to IAS 40 ­ Transfer of Investment Property (effective 1 January 2018) ·Annual Improvements 2015-2017 (comment period ends April 2017)
The amendments, interpretations and improvement projects are not expected to have material impact on the financial reporting for the coming financial years, except for implementation of IFRS 15.

The discount rate has been revised for each cash-generating unit to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk free rate based on a 10-year Danish government bond, the equity risk premium and the cost of debt.

The long-term growth rate for the terminal period is based on the expected growth in the world economy as well as input from current long term inflation swaps. Due to the current low interest rate environment, a conservative approach regarding the long-term growth rate for the terminal period has been applied. This methodology has been applied to ensure consistency with the level of the risk free rate applied as a basis for the estimation of discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate. Based on these factors, a long term growth rate for the terminal period of 1.5% has been applied.

18. Accounting policies (parent company)
Accounting policy
The financial statements of the parent company (FLSmidth & Co. A/S) are presented in conformity with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act for reporting class D enterprises.
To ensure uniform presentation, the terminology used in the consolidated financial statements has as far as possible been applied in the parent company's financial statements. The parent company's accounting policies on recognition and measurement are generally consistent with those of the Group. The instances in which the parent company's accounting policies deviate from those of the Group have been described below.
The accounting policies for the parent company are unchanged from 2015.
The company's main activity, dividend from Group enterprises, is presented first in the income statement.
Description of accounting policies Translation of foreign currency The foreign exchange adjustment of receivables from subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the parent company's total investment in the said subsidiary, is recognised in the parent company´s income statement.
Dividend from Group enterprises Dividend from investments in subsidiaries is recognised as income in the parent company´s income statement in the financial year in which the dividend is declared. This will typically be at the time of the approval in Annual General Meeting of distribution from the company concerned. However, where the dividend distributed exceeds the accumulated earnings after the date of acquisition, the dividend is recognised in the income statement. The recognition will indicate the need for impairment test of the investment.
Tangible assets Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets until they reach the estimated residual value. Pursuant to the provisions of IFRS, the residual value is revalued annually. In the parent company's financial statements, the residual value is determined at the date of the entry into service and is not subsequently adjusted.
Financial assets Investments in Group enterprises Investments in Group enterprises are measured at cost less impairment. Where the cost exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised to this lower value.
To the extent that the distributed dividend exceeds the accumulated earnings after the date of acquisition, that would indicate the need for impairment test of the investment.
Other securities and investments Other securities and investments consist of shares in cement plants that are acquired in connection with the signing of contracts and are measured at fair value. If the fair value is not immediately ascertainable, the shares are measured at a prudently assessed value. Value adjustments are recognised in the income statement as financial items.
Cash flow statement As the consolidated financial statements include a cash flow statement for the whole Group, no individual statement for the parent company has been included, see the exemption provision, section 86 of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
