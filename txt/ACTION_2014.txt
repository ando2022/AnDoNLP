MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ACTION S.A. (Company/Issuer) ON OPERATIONS IN 2014
1. Basic figures and development prospects for the next business year
In the business year 2014 the Company ACTION S.A. reported sales revenues of PLN 4,852,609 thousand, an operating profit of PLN 92,215 thousand and a net profit of PLN 69,503 thousand. Compared to the previous year, this constituted an increase of 4.88% for revenues, 10.58% for operating profit and 10.73% for net profit. The above data confirms a persistent upward trend observed over the years with respect to sales, operating profit and net profit despite low confidence on the retail market and information about the bankruptcy of large market participants. The consistently pursued strategy of development and the financial results achieved by the Company allow us to expect that stable growth at all levels of profitability and sales will also be maintained in the subsequent year.
In the Management Board's opinion, the main factors influencing the fulfilment of the forecasts are:
Regarding internal factors: a) closer cooperation and the realisation of benefits from working with leading suppliers such as Samsung (strategic partnership agreement), Lenovo, HP and many others, b) further growth of activity on e-commerce markets, c) further expansion of what we offer to include new business areas such as toys (conclusion of a distribution agreement with Hasbro), d) further improvement of activity in the handling of tenders and Enterprise in connection with the release of subsequent tranches of EU funding, e) further expansion onto foreign markets ­ making better use of the subsidiaries operating on the German market and further development of exports, f) using the advantages stemming from the expansion of the logistics centre in Zamienie, g) maintaining a wide base of customers representing all sales channels, h) maintaining strict current monitoring of costs in the Company and in the Capital Group, i) current monitoring and active management of working capital, j) further results optimisation in the ACTION Capital Group entities through the improved use of their competences.
Regarding external factors: a) economic and political situation in Poland and worldwide, b) implementation of the planned changes in tax regulations, in particular the changes related to the VAT reverse charge mechanism, c) changes in the current and long-term monetary policy in Poland and worldwide, d) maintaining a high demand for the goods offered by the Company.

ACTION S.A.

2. Material risk factors connected with the activities of the Company
2.1. Risk factors related to the Company's operation
2.1.1. Stock maintenance risk The Company's core business consists in selling technologically advanced products which are naturally exposed to the risk of becoming outdated, causing a decrease in their values. By launching new models, producers reduce the prices of products already available on the market. Due to the price protection clauses in agreements with suppliers and the standing market practice in this scope, the Company receives compensation for losses related to the decrease of stock value from all key suppliers. Regardless of benefits obtained from price protection mechanisms, the Company strives to ensure high rotation of maintained stocks.
2.1.2. Risk of losing receivables Trade receivables are the most significant item in terms of value in the Company's assets. As any entity involved in trading, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some of its receivables. This risk increases as the economic slowdown advances on the domestic and global markets. Having regard to the potential loss of receivables, the Company takes out insurance against this risk with leading insuring companies.
Detailed information regarding financial instruments in the scope of: a) price risk, credit risk, cash flow risk and liquidity risk, to which the entity is exposed, b) financial risk management objectives and methods adopted by the entity, including the methods which are used to hedge major types of forecasted transactions in respect of which hedge accounting method is used, was included in Note 31 Financial Instruments and Note 26 Hedge Accounting of the Separate Financial Statement.

2.2. Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates
2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation in Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. Dealers' willingness to buy new IT equipment and consequently the value of purchases carried out by the Company's customers is to a large extent related to the GDP growth, the level of investments and the way in which retail customers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.
2.2.2. Foreign exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ACTION S.A. obtains over 55% of its sales revenues in Polish zloty while about 60% of goods are imported. Payments for imported goods are made mainly in EUR and in USD. This currency structure of cash flows results in foreign exchange risk. The risk is proportionally higher for changes observed on the foreign exchange market. The Company strives to minimise the foreign exchange risk and in 2011 it adopted the Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. The principles of f/x risk management set forth in the policy the indicated optimum hedging levels in relation to existing currency items and the related monitoring and control system based on three units. In accordance with the adopted accounting principles, the Company has undertaken to maintain hedges at a level close to 100% of the open foreign exchange position.
2.2.3. Legal environment risk Changing legal provisions or various interpretations thereof pose a threat to the operations of ACTION S.A. Certain amendments to the provisions of the law may have a negative impact on the Company's operations. Such amendments may affect the legal environment of the Company's operations to a considerable degree. The coming into force of a new regulation of material importance for trading may involve interpretation ambiguities, inconsistent decisions of the courts or unfavourable interpretations adopted by public administration authorities, etc.

ACTION S.A.

2.2.4. Tax Policy Risk The Polish tax system is characterised by frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of these are not structured precisely enough and there are no clear interpretations. Interpretations of tax provisions are subject to frequent change and, unfortunately, tax-related decisions made by both fiscal authorities and courts are inconsistent. As a result of divergent interpretations of tax regulations, a Polish company incurs greater risk than a company operating under more stable tax systems. In such circumstances the Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements and tax returns may be deemed at variance with the tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. However, it is anticipated that the two-instance proceedings implemented at administrative courts and the acquis communautaire will contribute significantly to the uniformity of court decisions in tax cases and, as a result, to the uniform application of the tax law, including by fiscal authorities. One of the elements of the risk related to legal regulations concerns the limitation period established for tax liabilities, which involves the possibility of verifying whether the tax liabilities for the relevant period were calculated in a correct manner. Income statements specifying the amount of the tax liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by way of control by the fiscal authorities at any time during the five years from the end of the year during which the tax payment date passed. In the event that the fiscal authorities interpret the tax regulations on the basis of which the tax liability is calculated differently than the Company, it may have a material negative impact on the Company's operations, its financial standing and consequently on its results and growth prospects.
3. Corporate governance policies
ACTION S.A. is subject to the corporate governance principles: "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies" adopted by Resolution No. 12/1170/2007 of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 4 April 2007, the text hereof is included in the annex to the above mentioned resolution.

The statement concerning the application of corporate governance principles by ACTION S.A. in 2014, constituting an appendix to this Report, shall be published as a separate component of the Annual Report.
4. Identification of material proceedings pending before a court, competent arbitration authority or public administration authority
As of the day of submitting this Report, no proceedings were ongoing at any courts, authorities competent for arbitration proceedings or public administration authorities in relation to the Company's liabilities or receivables whose value, determined separately for individual proceedings and in total for all the proceedings, would represent at least 10% of the Company's equity.

ACTION S.A.

The end of 2014 saw a temporary growth of current assets, whose value increased by 25.84% compared to the value recorded at the end of 2013. It should be noted, however that 3 factors had a major impact on such a significant growth of current assets; 1) purchase of a large batch of LFD monitors under the strategic partnership with Samsung Electronics
Polska financed by the supplier, 2) purchase of large batches of goods necessary for the performance of tenders fully invoiced in
January and February 2015, 3) significant increase in cash. These factors were the result of the Company implementing projects with an increased level of profitability. The Company took up these challenges due to the low level of risk and its high capacity to make payments. The adjusted current receivables and liabilities remained at a level similar to that of the previous year and fully corresponded to the sales dynamics observed in 2014. The actions undertaken by the Company do not lower its financial standing and allow us to believe that the results of these actions should bring about above-average profitability.

Overall debt ratio Equity to assets ratio

Debt ratios

31/12/2014 74.65% 25.35%

31/12/2013 72.23% 27.77%

The debt structure analysis confirms a still high share of own funds in the financing of assets. The observed growth of the total debt was caused by the Company issuing bonds and incurring an investment credit for the expansion of the logistics centre in Zamienie.

16. Evaluation of the possibility of executing intended investments
Considering the Company's high creditworthiness as well as the value of profits generated, the Management Board has very positively assessed the possibility of carrying out potential intended investments. It should be mentioned, however, that after the completion of the investment projects carried out in 2014, the Management Board does not envisage further investments other than replacement or capital investments.

17. Evaluation of the factors and untypical events influencing the result of operations
The second half of the year saw a very dynamic weakening of PLN against USD and EUR, which was also accompanied by a high volatility of these currencies on the market. Despite the actions undertaken by the Company in connection with the mitigation of currency risk, these action still affected the result achieved by the Company.

18. Description of the external and internal factors significant for the Company's growth Factors significant for the Company's growth are described in Section 1 to this Report.

19. Changes to the basic principles of the Company management In 2014, the Company did not considerably change its management principles.

20. Agreements concluded between the Company and the persons managing it
Piotr Bieliski, President of the Management Board, has held his position pursuant to a resolution passed by the Supervisory Board. Possible compensation which may be due to the President of the Management Board in the case of dismissal is an equivalent to five-month's remuneration.
