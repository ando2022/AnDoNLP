From the CEO
Accelerated
transformation and
continuous
improvement
In 2017, Pöyry continued its transformation program according to the plan set out in 2016. It's cornerstones are: putting the client first; setting clear expectations to each employee; turning loss makers around and; improving efficiency.
"The transformation program has enabled clear improvement in operational results in both halves of the year.
Putting the client first has been well adopted across our teams and this is visible in the order stock development. We have continued our efforts to reduce internal administration and unnecessary complexity, gearing our teams towards the customers and increasing our focus on the projects. This is resulting in more opportunities in the market as we continue to provide exceptional value to our clients. Spending more time alongside our clients has enabled us to provide more differentiated and innovative offerings, particularly in the fields of bioeconomy, health & safety, #Poyrydigital and operational excellence services.
We are increasing our investments in the development of new offerings, differentiating us from the competition and enabling high levels of optimisation and value-add for our customers. Our actions to increase efficiency, including the reduction of layers and concentration of teams, has resulted in an improvement in the majority of the units. This will be continued in a stringent and effective way to provide the expected results throughout the company.
Good progress was also made in making our risk and opportunities more balanced in both our existing and legacy project portfolio. The efforts there will have to continue throughout 2018, where we expect to close some of the old cases.
In general market conditions are expected to continue with similar trends as in 2017. Growth in the Eurozone has continued, but remains fragile with the potential to change rapidly based on macroeconomic events. In Asia the markets relevant to our operations continue to be strong and offer opportunities, especially to our energy offering. The Middle-East shows continued high demand for desalination and new power capacity. Latin America is mixed, in Brazil we have seen three positive quarters in relation to GDP-growth but the economy is delicate. Whilst we continue to notice an increase in investment activity, these are yet to materialize as bigger projects. The North American market demand continues to be good.
Our industry business sector has been strong especially in Europe in 2017 and activity in Europe is expected to remain strong during first half of the year while the outlook for other regions remain mixed. The Energy market in Europe continues to provide few selected opportunities and remains strong for our management consulting services for market design, modelling and due diligence work.
Pöyry has taken the right steps during 2017, but this is only in the first stage of the transformation program. The elements that will continue guide us over the next years are: further simplification; empowerment as well as Intrapreneurship throughout the organisation; efficiency improvement including strengthening the core of our business; and increasing new offerings, getting us ready to expand as well as scale up. We need to continue this path, further improve on simplification and be even closer to our clients in order to reach a sustainable growth in our units.
Strengthening our Pöyry DNA with the Intrapreneurship concept whilst further increasing our employee motivation and engagement is the foundation for further development. I am also proud for the commitment shown by top management when they invested own money in company's shares as a part of transformation program's ownership culture target and as a part of new long term incentive program. We will continue to do what is required to improve our competitiveness and efficiency to ensure a continuous improvement."

Report of the Board of Directors 1 January - 31 December 2017

Market review

Uneven economic development in major economies continued during the reporting period. Economic growth in the USA was good, whereas in Europe the growth was improving. Development in the Asian countries was mixed. The market situation in Brazil continued to be challenging while modest recovery in terms of GDP growth was seen.
An increase in oil prices supported investment activity in the Middle East. In the European market the demand for energy related services continued to be modest due to structural changes in the energy sector. In majority of the Asian countries economic growth impacted positively on energy investments.
Demand for industry related services continued to be strong especially in the pulp and paper sector during the year. Investments in the bioproduct industry increased clearly. The Asian markets continued to be challenging while demand in Russia showed modest signs of improvement.
Demand for infrastructure and environmental services continued to be at a good level both in Central and Northern Europe.
Group financial performance
All figures and sums in the Report of the Board of Directors and in the financial statements have been rounded off from the exact figures, which may lead to minor discrepancies upon addition or subtraction.

Report of the Board of Directors
In order to increase transparency in comparing performance from one period to another Pöyry has been disclosing since 2016 an adjusted operating result. The adjusted items are not related to the business operations of the reporting period and include mainly restructuring and labour claim expenses, gains / losses related to divestments and profits / losses related to projects from the former Urban Business Group or projects which were finalised over two years ago.
The Group's order stock remained stable and was EUR 448.5 (442.5) million while at comparable currencies it increased by 6.5%. It increased in all the business groups except Regional Operations where it decreased.
Order stock was EUR 164.9 million in the Energy Business Group (37% of the total order stock), EUR 87.4 million in the Industry Business Group (19%), EUR 177.7 million in Regional Operations (40%) and EUR 18.4 million in the Management Consulting Business Group (4%).
Net sales were EUR 522.3 (529.6) million. The figure increased in the Management Consulting Business Group, remained stable in the Industry Business Group and Regional Operations and decreased in the Energy Business Group.
The adjusted operating result increased to EUR 26.0 (5.8) million. It improved in every business line. The adjusted items of EUR 10.9 (13.9) million consist of restructuring expenses, labour claims customary in one of the Group's country operations, as well as losses recognised on projects which originate from the former Urban Business Group or were finalised over two years ago. Despite further balancing of the old project portfolio we continue to fight to recover our position in these projects. In 2016 the adjusted items mainly included restructuring expenses, labour claims customary in one of the Group's country operations and losses recognised on projects originating from the former Urban Business Group. The operating result for the period was EUR 15.1 (-8.1) million.
Group financial result, financing and investments
The net financial items amounted to EUR -3.8 (-3.1) million.
The result before taxes totalled EUR 11.8 (-10.6) million.
Income taxes were EUR -6.1 (-2.2) million.
The net result for the period amounted to EUR 5.6 (-12.8) million, of which EUR 5.7 million was attributable to equity holders of the parent company and EUR 0.0 million to non-controlling interests.
Diluted earnings per share were EUR 0.07 (-0.24).
The consolidated balance sheet amounted to EUR 390.1 (421.8) million. Total equity at the end of the reporting period amounted to EUR 129.9 (118.3) million. Total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company was EUR 129.8 (116.9) million, or EUR 2.09 (1.96) per share. In November 2015, Pöyry issued EUR 30 million hybrid capital securities, which are treated as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The capital securities have no maturity date, but the company has the right to redeem them after four years from the issue date upon certain conditions.
Return on equity (ROE) amounted to 4.5 (-10.5) per cent. Return on investment (ROI) was 8.8 (-3.2) per cent.
Group cash and cash equivalents and other liquid assets amounted to EUR 50.7 (49.3) million at the end of the reporting period. In addition to these, the Group had available credit facilities amounting to EUR 60.7 million. The amount of issued Commercial Papers was EUR 26.8 million.
In H2 2016 Pöyry signed with its core banks and Finnish financial institutions an extension of its term loan and revolving credit facility arrangements until June 2019. The facilities are subject to covenants relating to Pöyry's financial performance and solidity.
Net cash flow from operating activities in the reporting period amounted to EUR 38.2 (-17.7) million, representing EUR 0.64 per share. In 2017 net cash flow from operating activities resulted mainly from EUR 17.6 (-17.1) million cash inflow related to a change in working capital. Net cash flow before financing activities amounted to EUR 33.2 (-22.0) million. Net debt at the end of the reporting period was EUR 6.1 (32.0) million. Gearing was 4.7 (27.0) per cent. The equity ratio was 39.7 (32.5) per cent.
During the reporting period, the Group's operating capital expenditures totalled EUR 3.3 (5.1) million and investments in shares in group companies were EUR 2.4 (0.0) million.

Report of the Board of Directors
Significant short-term risks and uncertainties
Economic and political uncertainty continues and the risk of recession persists, particularly in the European market. These circumstances may adversely influence Pöyry's clients' ability to arrange project financing and make investment decisions. More generally, this can slow down the overall business activity and hence impact Pöyry's net sales and profitability.
The economic and political crisis in Brazil has a significant impact on the market, including the sectors where Pöyry operates. This has caused Pöyry to downsize its operations to correspond to the market situation. If the Brazilian economic and political crisis continues, Pöyry may be required to take further measures to adapt to this situation.
Part of Pöyry's business comes from municipal and other public sector clients. The high level of indebtedness of various economies has led the EU and an increasing number of governments to decide on austerity and cost-reduction measures. This may have a negative effect on infrastructure investments and consequently could affect services provided by Pöyry.
As part of the project business, there are occasionally projects facing particular challenges and risks in the context of their execution. In some of these projects, the respective subsidiary companies are involved in disputes and litigations where the outcome and timing of the resolutions are uncertain and could differ from the management's current assessment. There is a distinct management focus on resolving these issues and their evolution is regularly reviewed and assessed in line with the company's risk assessment processes. In relation to the project contract, which expired in the fourth quarter of 2015, the respective Pöyry subsidiary company has started arbitration proceedings against the client. It is too early to assess the outcome of the proceedings. The projects in question are from the former Urban Business Group.
In its Annual review 2016 Pöyry has disclosed the ongoing "Rigesa arbitration". Pöyry is convinced on the justification for its claims against Rigesa and does not see merit in Rigesa's counterclaims but it is premature to assess the outcome of the Rigesa arbitration. Pöyry expects resolution on the merits of this case in H1 2018.
Part of Pöyry's net sales originates from emerging and developing countries, some of which face political and economic challenges. There is a risk that corresponding payment of invoices may be delayed excessively or that the Pöyry Group may experience credit losses. To manage this risk, the company maintains systematic processes for the follow-up and active collection of receivables.
There may occasionally arise risks that are related to Pöyry's or clients' social or environmental impact in projects. They are usually managed within the framework of Pöyry's contracts with the clients.
The most relevant risks that relate to Pöyry's business including risk management framework are presented in more detail on the company's website at www.poyry.com.
Events after the reporting period
On 9 February Pöyry announced that it is strengthening its Industry Business Group by consolidating its process engineering know-how and technology competence in Norway and Sweden, renaming its reporting segment `Regional Operations Business Group' as `Infra, Water and Environment Business Group'. This change will take effect as of 9 February 2018.
Pöyry's financial reporting will be based on the following four reporting segments: Management Consulting Business Group; Industry Business Group; Energy Business Group; and Infra, Water and Environment Business Group. Restated figures will be published before the publication of the half year financial report January - June 2018 on 9 August 2018.
Business Lines
Reporting is based on the organisational structure announced on 26 January 2017. In the new structure the globally-focused competences and process know-how in Pulp, Paper & Board, Chemicals & Biorefining and Mining & Metals are concentrated in one global Industry organisation. Also the industry-related operations in Brazil, Finland and Germany were brought together from Regional Operations to the Industry Business Group. Pöyry's financial reporting continued to be based on the following four reporting segments: Management Consulting Business Group; Industry Business Group; Energy Business Group; and Regional Operations. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.

Report of the Board of Directors

Market outlook 2018
In general market conditions are expected to continue with similar trends as in 2017. Growth in the Eurozone has continued, but remains fragile with the potential to change rapidly based on macroeconomic events. In Asia the markets relevant to our operations continue to be strong and offer opportunities, especially to our energy offering. The Middle-East shows continued high demand for desalination and new power capacity. Latin America is mixed, in Brazil we have seen three positive quarters in relation to GDP-growth but the economy is delicate. Whilst we continue to notice an increase in investment activity, these are yet to materialize as bigger projects. The North American market demand continues to be good.
Our industry business sector has been strong especially in Europe in 2017 and activity in Europe is expected to remain strong during first half of the year while the outlook for other regions remain mixed. The Energy market in Europe continues to provide few selected opportunities and remains strong for our management consulting services for market design, modelling and due diligence work. Infrastructure investments in Northern Europe and Central Europe are expected to remain stable.
Financial outlook for 2018
The Group's adjusted operating result is expected to improve.
Guidance is based on the order stock at 31 December 2017, a solid prospect pipeline and a well progressed transformation program.

Consolidated financial statements

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements

Group profile Pöyry PLC is a Finnish public limited liability company organised under the laws of Finland and domiciled in Vantaa. Pöyry PLC is the parent company of the Pöyry Group. Pöyry is a global consulting and engineering firm, which operations are conducted through four operating segments (business lines): Energy, Industry, Regional Operations, and Management Consulting.

A copy of the consolidated financial statements can be obtained either from the web site (www.poyry.com) or from the parent company's head office, the address of which is Jaakonkatu 3, 01620 Vantaa, Finland.

In its meeting on February 8, 2018 the Board of Directors of Pöyry PLC approved the publishing of these consolidated financial statements. According to the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act shareholders have the right to approve or reject the annual accounts in the shareholders' meeting held after their release. The shareholders' meeting also has the right to make amendments to the annual accounts.

Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Pöyry Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) including the IAS and IFRS standards as well as the SIC and IFRIC interpretations in force as at 31 December 2017. International financial reporting standards, referred to in the Finnish Accounting Act and in ordinances issued based on the provisions of this Act, refer to the standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the EU. The notes to the consolidated financial statements also conform to the Finnish accounting and company legislation. The financial statements of the parent company, Pöyry PLC, are prepared in compliance with FAS (Finnish accounting standards).

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated in the accounting principles below.
The Group has applied as from 1 January 2016 the following standards, their amendments and interpretations that have come into effect.
· Disclosure initiative- amendments to IAS1 · Annual improvements to IFRSs ­ 2012-2014 Cycle
The adoption of the amendments did not have any significant impact on the current period or any prior period. Other standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2016 are not material to the Group.
Uses of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities existing at the balance sheet date as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions rely on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions of the future events. The estimates are based on the management's current best knowledge at the end of the reporting period, but the actual results may differ from the estimates used in the consolidated financial statements.

In the following notes more information is presented on the managements' estimates and judgements, which are most critical to reported results and financial position:

Note 4. Net sales
10. Income taxes 12. Goodwill and intangible assets 18. Accounts receivable
24. Pension obligations 25. Provisions

Critical accounting estimates Estimates and assumptions relating to the revenue recognition of the percentage-of-completion projects Assumptions and estimates regarding future tax consequences Estimates and assumptions relating to impairment testing Estimates and assumptions relating to the recognition and measurement of trade receivables Estimates and assumptions used to determine future pension obligations Estimates and assumptions made when estimating provisions

Consolidated financial statements
Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the parent company and all those subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, over 50 per cent of the voting rights or in which it otherwise has control at the end of the reporting period. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of a company so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of companies is accounted for by using the acquisition method to which all identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company together with the consideration transferred are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, and taken into account as part of the consideration transferred. The obligation to pay contingent consideration is classified as a liability or as equity based on the definitions of financial instruments in IAS 32 standard. Contingent consideration classified as liability is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The companies acquired or founded during the reporting period are consolidated from the date that control of the companies commences, which is generally the acquisition or foundation date. The companies closed or disposed of are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements until control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at their proportionate interest in the recognised amount of identifiable net assets of the acquired company. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if it results in a deficit balance for the non-controlling interests. In the balance sheet, noncontrolling interests are presented within equity of the owners of the parent. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognised only in equity of the parent company.
In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer's previous equity interest in the acquired company is measured at fair value, and the related profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 have been recognised according to the previous effective standards.
Associates and joint ventures Associates included in the consolidated financial statements are those entities in which the Group's shareholding and voting rights are usually between 20 and 50 per cent or in which it otherwise has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Holdings in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in joint ventures in which the Group exercises a shared controlling interest with other parties are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost after which the Group's share of their post-acquisition retained profits and losses is included as part of investments in associates and joint ventures in the consolidated balance sheets.
Under the equity method the share of profits and losses of associates and joint ventures is presented separately in the consolidated statement of income.
Joint operations A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties having joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions concerning the relevant activities require unanimous approval of all the parties sharing control.
Due to the nature of Pöyry's business, the group is engaged in several consortium arrangements which are joint operations based on definitions in IFRS 11. Consortiums are contractually established for the purpose of tendering and executing project work for a specific project and they are terminated once the project is completed. Individual consortiums are not material to the Group.
The group accounts in relation to its interest for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to a joint operation in accordance with IFRS applicable for the particular item.

Consolidated financial statements
Foreign currency items Foreign subsidiaries In preparing the consolidated financial statements the income and expense items in the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows of those foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated into euros at the average exchange rate during the period. Their balance sheets are translated at the ECB closing rate at the end of the reporting period.
Foreign exchange differences for the period arising from the application of the acquisition method, translation of the accumulated post-acquisition equity items and translation of the comprehensive income for the period at the average rate in the statement of comprehensive income and at the closing rate in the balance sheet are recorded as separate item in other comprehensive income. The accumulated translation difference amounts are reported as separate item under equity.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency monetary balances and non-monetary items stated at fair value in a foreign currency are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. Other non-monetary items are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from transactions in foreign currencies and translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on business operations are adjusted to revenues or operating expenses, respectively. Exchange rate differences arising on foreign currency loans are included in financial income and expenses except for the loans designated as hedges of foreign net investments that are highly effective. The effective portions of the exchange differences from such loans are recognised in other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements and presented as translation differences under equity. The translation differences accumulated in equity are transferred to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment as part of the gain or loss on disposal, when the Group disposes of all, or part of, that entity.
Net sales and revenue recognition principles Net sales equal fair value of services less indirect taxes associated to sales and other adjustment items.
The Group's operations estimates are made at least quarterly, when all project managers are required to prepare updated estimates for all ongoing projects. Also the provisions as well as overdue trade receivables are reviewed by the management at least on a quarterly basis.
The services provided by the Pöyry Group are generally classified into three categories for revenue recognition purposes:
1. Consulting and engineering projects with a fixed price contract or any type of cap or ceiling price contracts: The revenue is recognised on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by reference to the stage of completion at the end of the reporting period. The stage of completion is defined as the proportion that project costs incurred for work performed both by the Group and subcontractors to date bear to the estimated total project costs, or as the proportion that all the project costs to date bear to the estimated project costs.
2. Consulting and engineering projects with a cost plus contract which can be classified as pure reimbursable projects: The revenue is recognised in the period during which the corresponding services have been rendered. If a reimbursable project has any kind of maximum, cap or estimate type of characteristics, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion.
3. Contracting/Turnkey/EPC projects: The revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by reference to the percentage of total cost incurred to date to estimated total cost at the end of the reporting period. Due to the different risk profile separately defined procedures are followed when assessing the risks and the progress made as well as in monitoring and controlling throughout the project.
The percentage-of-completion method is only applied when the outcome of a project can be estimated reliably. Project managers are responsible for the total estimate of a project made at least quarterly. If the outcome of a project cannot be estimated reliably, the Group applies the cost recovery method in which the project costs incurred are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and revenue is recognised only to the extent of project costs incurred that probably will be recoverable.
When it is probable that total project costs will exceed total project revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Consolidated financial statements
The project revenue recognised according to the percentage-of-completion method, but not yet invoiced, including unfinished work is presented in the balance sheet under `work-in-progress'. The unrecognised part of the invoicing is included in `received project advances'.
Foreign currency cash flows in projects are mainly hedged for changes in exchange rates.
Employee benefits Pension plans The Group companies have various pension plans throughout the world. The statutory pension plans of Finnish companies are funded through payments to pension insurance companies. Voluntary pension plans are funded through pension insurances. Foreign subsidiaries operate their pension plans in accordance with the local regulations and practices.
Pension plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The plans the Group has currently are mainly classified as defined contribution plans under which fixed contributions are paid into a separate entity and they are recognised as an expense in profit or loss in the year to which they relate. If the payee is not capable to pay the pension benefits in question, Pöyry Group will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans not meeting the above criteria are classified as defined benefit plans. The Group has defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Norway. In Finland some voluntary pension plans have been classified as defined benefit plans. The expenditure from these plans is calculated separately for each plan in accordance with its terms and recognised as an expense over the expected working lives of the employees participating in the plan based on the actuarial calculations. The discount rate used in calculation of the present value is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds and to the maturity of the pension obligation. The present value of pension obligations is netted against the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
The unfunded part of the defined benefit obligations increases the pension obligations and decreases equity. If a defined benefit plan is overfunded, the overfunded part increases the Group's assets and equity, respectively.
Share-based payments Pöyry has share-based incentive plans for its key personnel. The fair value of the reward is expensed until the target group is entitled to the reward and the shares are freely transferable. The fair value of the share is the share price on the date at which the target group has agreed to the conditions of the plan reduced by the estimated dividends. The fair value of the cash part is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the share price at the end of the reporting period. The expenses are recognised as personnel expenses and the component settled in shares is credited to the retained earnings and the cash part as an accrued liability until paid out. The share-based incentive plans are described in the note 7.
Operating result Operating result is the net amount that consists when other operating income is added to the net sales and materials and supplies, external charges (subconsulting), personnel expenses, depreciation, possible value decreases and other operating expenses are deducted. All the other items are presented below the operating result. Exchange rate differences and changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the operating result if arisen from the items related to business, otherwise recorded I financial items.
Income taxes The income taxes in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income comprise current tax of the Group companies calculated on the taxable profit for the period determined in accordance with local tax rules, the tax adjustments related to previous years as well as the change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. For transactions and other events recognised in profit or loss, any related tax effects are also recognised in profit or loss. For transactions and other events recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), any related tax effects are also recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The withholding taxes which are deducted from income taxes are recognised in income taxes. The withholding taxes which are not deductible from income taxes are recognised in expenses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided in the consolidated financial statements generally for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The main temporary differences arise from tax losses carried forward and defined benefit plans. Deferred taxes are not provided for impairment of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, or for undistributed profits of

Annual Review 2017

20

Consolidated financial statements

subsidiaries to the extent that is it probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at their full amounts in the balance sheet, and deferred tax assets are recognised at estimated realisable amounts, i.e. to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in the future, against which temporary differences can be utilized. The tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period is used as the tax rate.

Intangible assets
Goodwill For acquisitions after 1 January 2010, the Group recognises goodwill at the acquisition date as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired company and the acquirer's previous equity interest in the acquired company over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 have been booked according to the previous IFRS standards (IFRS 3 (2004)), in which goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value measured at the acquisition date of the net identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill arisen from the business acquisitions occurred prior to 1 January 2004 is reported as it was recognised under FAS and taken as deemed cost under IFRS. Based on this exemption granted in IFRS 1 the classification and accounting treatment of the business combinations was not been reconsidered in preparing the Group's opening IFRS balance sheet.

Goodwill is stated in the balance sheet at cost less any impairment losses. Goodwill together with other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, or in case of associated companies, goodwill is included in the acquisition cost of the associated company. The business groups of the Pöyry Group represent the independent cash generating unit levels where the Board of Directors and the management monitors the profit, cash flow and capital employed, and are therefore chosen as the goodwill allocation level.

Other intangible assets An intangible asset is initially capitalised in the balance sheet at cost if the cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. Other intangible assets are stated at historical cost less cumulative amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Those borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Intangibles with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their known or expected useful lives. An intangible asset once classified as held for sale is not amortised.

Software Amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 to 5 years.

Order stock The order stock recognised separately in the connection of a business combination is expensed during the related projects.

Research and development The income and expenses attributable to research and development are part of the Group's client work and cannot therefore be reasonably defined in exact monetary terms in practice. These revenues and expenses are recognised in profit or loss and they are included in the operating profit/loss.

Tangible assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less cumulative depreciation and any impairment losses. Those borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Gains and losses on sales and disposals are included in other operating income and in other operating expenses, respectively.

A predetermined schedule has been used to calculate depreciation on tangible assets. Depreciation is calculated based on historical cost and expected useful life. Depreciation is charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis. Expected useful lives and residual values are reassessed at least at each financial year-end and where they differ significantly from previous estimates, depreciation periods are changed accordingly. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Buildings Machinery and equipment

20-40 years 3-8 years

Land is not depreciated. A tangible asset once classified as held for sale is not depreciated.

Consolidated financial statements
Leases The Group may have both finance and operating leases. The group had only operating leases at the balance sheet date.
An operating lease is a lease of property, plant and equipment where the lessor retains significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership. In the Pöyry Group leases classified as operating leases mainly relate to office premises, also some car and office equipment leases have been classified as operating leases. Payments made there under are charged to profit or loss as rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets The carrying amounts of the Group's assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication for impairment. If an indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amounts of following assets are also estimated annually irrespective whether there is any indication for impairment or not: goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit. This is the smallest identifiable group that is independent of other units and whose cash flows are separable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell, or its value in use. The value in use represents the present value of discounted future net cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or a cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow analysis used to calculate value in use is based on the approved strategy where growth from acquisitions has been eliminated. The recoverable amount is based on reasonable estimates and assumptions and the latest plans or forecasts approved by the management. Goodwill impairment testing is carried out annually during the last quarter primarily by using discounted cash flow analysis. Pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as a discount rate for the recoverable amount. WACC represents the market opinion of time value of money and special risks relating to an asset.
The Group's scale for classifying the goodwill impairment testing results is the following (compared to the total carrying amount of tested assets): a) is below, b) corresponds to, c) exceeds slightly, d) exceeds clearly, e) exceeds significantly (> 50 per cent).
Financial instruments Pöyry classifies its financial items as follows: financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, loans or receivables (assets) as well as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial assets A financial asset is classified when originally acquired based on its purpose of use. All purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised or derecognised using settlement date accounting. The Group derecognises financial assets when it has lost its right to receive the cash flows or when it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards to an external party.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified in this category when the financial asset is held for trading. In Pöyry Group this category comprises those derivative instruments not meeting the hedge accounting criteria and certain investments. Gains and losses arising from a change in the fair value, realised or unrealised, are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Available-for-sale assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. In the Pöyry Group assets classified as available for sale comprise unlisted shares. As their fair value is not available or cannot be measured reliably, they are carried at cost. However, when there is objective evidence that the fair value of such share investments is significantly lower than their book value, this is indication of an impairment loss. If there is objective evidence of an impairment loss, the loss arisen is recognised in profit or loss. Available-for-sale financial assets are included in non-current assets unless the Group has the intention to sell them within less than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, in which case they are included in the current assets.
Loans or receivables (assets) Financial assets that belong to this category are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Group does not hold them for trading purposes either. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less impairment losses.
In the Pöyry Group this category includes trade receivables and other receivables arisen from business operations. Trade receivables are presented net of credit losses.

Annual Review 2017

22

Consolidated financial statements
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Bank overdrafts related to Group's cash pool accounts, if any, are included within current interest-bearing liabilities.
Financial liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities in the following categories: financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. A liability is classified as current when the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. The Group removes a financial liability (or a part of it) from its balance sheet only when it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss In Pöyry Group this category comprises those derivative instruments not meeting the hedge accounting criteria. Gains and losses arising from the change in the fair value, realised or unrealised, are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost This category includes the borrowings taken by the Group. On initial recognition a loan is measured at its fair value, using the effective interest method. Interest expenses are recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are stated at amortised cost.
Committed Credit facilities The issuer of committed credit facility is paid commitment fee that is recognized as an expense during validity of credit facility. Commitment fee is based on the amount of unused credit facility and time.
Derivative instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. They are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value on the trade date. Subsequently they are fair valued. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. Gains and losses are accounted for based on the purpose of use of the derivative.
The Group applies the hedge accounting to certain derivatives. In that case, at the inception of a hedge relationship, the company, which enters into the hedges, documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item as well as the strategy for undertaking the hedge in accordance with the Group's risk management objective. The Group also documents and assesses, both at hedge inception and at least at the end of each reporting period whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Fair value hedges The Group applies fair value hedge accounting to part of the forward contracts hedging sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies as the hedge relates to a binding sale agreement that is an off-balance sheet item. In that case the fair value change resulting from the hedging instrument as well as from the hedged portion of the binding agreement is recognised in profit or loss, together with the change in the fair value of the interest element of a forward contract separated from the hedge relationship.
Treasury shares Pöyry PLC's own shares acquired by the Group, including directly attributable costs, are presented as a deduction from the total equity in the consolidated financial statements. Purchases and subsequent sales of treasury shares, including directly attributable transaction costs, are presented as changes in equity.
Hybrid bond Hybrid bonds are classified as a part of shareholders' equity in the consolidated financial statements, as the company has no contractual obligation to repay the loan capital or the interest on the loan. The bond holders do not have any rights equivalent to ordinary shareholders, and the bond does not dilute shareholders' ownership in the company. Hybrid bonds are recognised at fair value less transaction costs. If interest is paid to hybrid bonds, it is recognised directly into retained earnings.
Provisions A provision is an obligation of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that is probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A provision is measured to the present value of the costs required to offset the obligation. If it is possible to receive compensation for part of the obligation from a third party, the compensation is recognised as a separate asset, but

Annual Review 2017

23

Consolidated financial statements
only when receipt of the compensation is virtually certain.
To minimise business risks the Pöyry Group has a group-wide risk management policy that includes procedures for identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of risks. The policy is described in the risk management section.
Project provisions When a project is unfinished, a project provision is recognised only in an exceptional case. If a disagreement arises between the Group and a customer or a subcontractor, or cost overrun is expected, their effect on the project is assessed. If the effect on the result of a project is probable, it is taken into account either by reducing the expected total invoice amount or by increasing the costs and consequently the expected total result falls. The expected loss is recognised immediately as a project provision only in an exceptional case when it is probable that the total project costs will exceed the total project revenues.
Existing professional, contractual or legal third party liability risks may also result in a provision to be recorded regarding a project already completed. A provision is recognised if the Pöyry Group is to compensate the client or a third party a damage caused by negligent action or inaction or normative breach.
Restructuring provisions Group's restructuring provisions relate mainly to restructurings, i.e. termination expenses if employees are laid off and lease payments for vacant office space.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions usually related to employment claims customary in one of the Group's operating countries and are based on local professional opinions.
Contingent liability A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. A contingent liability can also be a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A contingent liability is disclosed in the notes to the financial instruments.
Dividends The dividend relating to the financial year ended is not recognised until approved by a general meeting of shareholders.
New and amended standards and interpretations IASB has issued the following new and amended standards and interpretations that the Group has not yet adopted. The Group will adopt them as of the effective date or, if the date is other than the first day of the financial year, from the beginning of the subsequent financial year.
IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments": IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" replaces the multiple classification and measurement models in IAS 39 and it will bring changes to classification and measurement of financial assets, their impairment assessment and hedge accounting. A debt instrument is measured at amortized cost only if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset for the collection of the contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows under the instrument solely represent payments of principal and interest. All other debt and equity instruments, including investments in complex debt instruments and equity investments are measured at fair value. All fair value movements on financial assets are taken through the statement of profit or loss, except for equity investments that are not held for trading, which may be recorded in the statement of profit or loss or in reserves (without subsequent recycling to profit or loss). In addition debt instruments can be classified at fair value through other comprehensive income according to entity's business model. The group does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets as major part of group financial assets are currently classified as assets measured at fair value through profit and loss. According to the new standard impairment of financial asset will be based on new expected credit loss method. The group will apply a simplified provision matrix approach for trade receivables, where the impairment loss is recorded using an accrual matrix for the whole maturity of the receivable, unless the receivable is regarded impaired due to the credit risk. IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2018 which is also the initial application date for the Group.
IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers": The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. It will replace IAS 18, which covers contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer ­ so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards. New standard needs to be applied only to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application. In 2017 the Group has started preparations which are needed to

Annual Review 2017

24

Consolidated financial statements
implement the standard. continued its work on assessing the effects of applying the new standard on the Group's financial statements and continued validating its engineering and consulting contracts according to the approach presented in the standard and has not identified any major changes to the existing principles of identifying the contract with the customer, identifying separate performance obligations, determining and allocating the transaction price and recognising the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The engineering and consulting services provided by the Group do not generally create an asset with and alternative use to the Group and based on contract terms the Group has generally an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Thus, according to the Group's assessment new rules will not have significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, as it will not have significant influence in the most important aspects of revenue recognition: timing and amount. At this point group cannot provide reasonable quantitative estimates of the effect as this is dependent on the contract portfolio available at the time of the initial application. The standard must be applied and will be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018 when also presentations and disclosures will be included as required by the standard, IAS 8 and IAS 34. The Group will apply full retrospective application for the adoption of the standard and make use of practical expedients available in the new standard.
IFRS 16 "Leases": IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The new standard will have a significant impact on Group's balance sheet and key figures, as at the moment all the leases of the Group are operating leases, which have not been recognised in the balance sheet. The more detailed impact of the new standards is currently being assessed. The standard must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

The parent company charges intra-group royalties and service fees.
Reporting The operating segments correspond to the internal reporting structure of the Group according to which the management monitors the operating result. The statement of income of the segment is presented down to the operating result. Reporting is based on the organisational structure announced on 26 January 2017. In the new structure the globallyfocused competences and process know-how in Pulp, Paper & Board, Chemicals & Biorefining and Mining & Metals are concentrated in one global Industry organisation. Also the industry-related operations in Brazil, Finland and Germany were brought together from Regional Operations to the Industry Business Group. The figures for the comparison periods have been adjusted accordingly.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis. There are no significant sales between the segments.
All personnel numbers are calculated as full-time equivalents (FTE).

4. Net sales

Critical accounting estimates
The estimates of the total project costs made by management have a significant impact on the revenue recognition of the percentage-of-completion projects. Even though the percentage-of-completion method is only applied when the outcome of a project can be estimated reliably, the estimated costs may differ from the actual costs. This may have an impact on the revenue recognition in the future reporting periods.

7. Performance share plans
Performance share plan 2017 The Board of Directors of Pöyry PLC approved on 5 May 2017 a share-based incentive plan for Pöyry Group key personnel and the plan commenced on August 8th 2017. The new long-term share-based incentive plan is targeted to the top management and key personnel of the Company where they purchase the Company's shares as an initial investment. The aim of the incentive plan is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key personnel in order to increase the value of the company as well as to engage the key personnel to the company and to offer them a competitive incentive plan based on share ownership in the company. The share-based incentive plan covers 9 participants. New participants may join the incentive plan if decided by the Board of Directors and the maximum amount of participants in the incentive plan is 15.

New shares in the Company will be offered in the share issue for subscription to persons entitled to participate in the plan. The share subscription price for the new shares to be paid by each of the participants will be 90% of the trade volume weighted average quotation of the share on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd on 8 August 2017.
The prerequisite for participating in the incentive plan is that a person participating in the plan at the commencement of the plan owns or acquires the company's shares up to the number determined by the Board of Directors (Initial Investment). The maximum amount of shares to be awarded as reward is calculated based on the Initial Investment amount of the participant in question and on the predetermined matching share multiple, which varies depending on the size of investment as per the plan terms. The incentive plan contains one earning period consisting of five consecutive years, years 2017-2022. During the earning period, the persons participating in the plan have an opportunity to attain a long-term incentive reward in the form of matching shares. The plan offers a right for a participant to receive matching shares, the number of which is dependent on the amount of the Initial Investment made by the participant. The prerequisite for receiving any reward on the basis of the plan is that a participant holds the shares initially contributed to the plan (Initial Investment) throughout the earning period. In addition, the participant must hold the shares received as reward for two years from the payment date of the reward in question. The reward will be paid in instalments over the duration of the plan.

The participant is entitled to choose whether the participant wants to receive the potential reward partly in the company's shares (50 %) and partly in cash (50 %) or in shares (100 %) only. The cash portion is intended to cover taxes and taxrelated costs arising from the reward to the participant. The rewards will be paid yearly after each consecutive year within the earning period. No reward will be paid if participant's employment or service relationship within the company ends before the payment of the reward.

1) Interest income from other financial assets consists mainly of interest earned on short term bank deposits. 2) Other financial expenses include mainly fees concerning restructuring of the Group's loan portfolio.
The Group hedges the project cash flows denominated in foreign currency by using foreign exchange derivative contracts. Exchange rate gains or losses arisen from these derivative contracts are recorded in sales and project expenses, and not in financial income and expenses except for the forward points.

Annual Review 2017

Consolidated financial statements

The parent company conducts the Group's financing and grants loans to subsidiaries if considered necessary. These loans are mainly granted in the currency of the subsidiary, and the subsidiaries lend their excess cash to the parent company in their home currency. The subsidiaries hedge their commercial foreign currency exposures by doing internal forward deals with the parent company, which hedges the net exposure externally.

10. Income taxes

Critical accounting estimates
The Group reviews at each balance sheet date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. For this assessment it is considered, whether it is probable that the subsidiaries will have sufficient taxable profits against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised. The assumptions used in estimates may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant write-downs of the deferred tax assets in the future reporting periods.
The Group recognises liabilities for tax dispute issues from the ongoing tax audits based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. The final outcome from these matters may differ significantly from the estimates initially made, which will impact the income tax for the period and deferred tax provisions in the reporting period in which such determination is made.

12. Goodwill and intangible assets

Critical accounting estimates
The Group's goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations. These calculations are based on estimated future cash flows, which require management to make assumptions relating to future expectations. Actual cash flows could differ from the estimated cash flows, which may lead to recognition of significant impairment losses in the future reporting periods.

Result of goodwill impairment testing
Pöyry's scale for classifying the goodwill impairment is as follows: a) is below, b) corresponds to, c) exceeds d) exceeds significantly (>50%).
Impairment testing result shows that the "value in use" in the Regional Operations operating segment exceeds the book value. In other operating segments the "value in use" exceeds significantly the book value. In 2016 the "value in use" in the Industry operating segment exceeded significantly the book value. In other operating segments the "value in use" exceeded the book value.
Sensitivity analysis 1. Sensitivity analysis in a scenario in which the growth per cent and operating profit per cent after year 2017 have been reduced with 20 per cent in comparison with the ordinary testing levels. In the sensitivity analysis the impairment testing result shows that the "value in use" for the Energy and Industry operating segments exceeds significantly the book value. In other operating segments the "value in use" exceeds the book value.
2. In this analysis the discount rate is 20 per cent higher compared to the original testing. In the sensitivity analysis the impairment testing result shows that the "value in use" for the Energy and Industry operating segments exceeds significantly the book value. In other operating segments the "value in use" exceeds the book value.

18. Accounts receivable

Critical accounting estimates
Trade receivables are presented net of credit losses. The recognition and measurement of the allowance for impairment requires management estimates and assumptions on the factors, that may influence the risk of individual projects or items. Such factors are, amongst others, outcomes of litigations and arbitration proceedings. Due to inherent uncertain nature of these factors the actual credit losses may significantly differ from the initial estimate.
The amount of doubtful receivables and assessment of need for impairment is based on risk of individual receivables. Generally, an impairment allowance of 50 per cent is made for those trade receivables which are more than 180 days overdue. If a receivable is due more than 360 days a credit loss provision is made unless there are especially weighty reasons.

20. Financial risk management

The financial risks represent one of Pöyry's main risk categories, and are hence managed as part of Pöyry's risk management process. Financial risk related responsibilities and procedures are described in the Treasury Policy.
The Group has centralized the management of financial risks to Group Treasury, which is operating within the parent company Pöyry PLC. The objective of concentrating the financial risk management into Group Treasury is to be able to evaluate and control the risks in an efficient manner. The objective of Group Treasury function is to provide financial risk related services for the group companies to protect from unfavourable changes in the financial markets, and therefore to help secure the Group's profitability and ensure that adequate funding is available at all circumstances.
The Group has exposure to the following financial risks: · credit risk · liquidity and refinancing risk · market risk
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligation, and arises principally from the Group's project assignments. The maximum amount of the credit risk equals the total book value of the financial assets reported in note 22. Financial assets and liabilities.
The Group's client profile and the spread of its sales between numerous clients reduce the exposure to credit risks. Credit rating procedures, internal follow-up of overdue receivables and a contract policy of balance between work performed and payments received further reduce the Group's credit risk exposure.
Overdue accounts receivable are reported and monitored by the management on a monthly basis. Overdue accounts receivable over 60 days are reported by client including reasons for delay and actions taken or planned.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses. An allowance for impairment of 50 per cent is made for amounts which are overdue more than 180 days, except for amounts related to international institutions, government or municipality controlled entities. Notwithstanding the client category, an allowance for impairment of 100 per cent is made for amounts which are overdue more than 360 days. Any deviation from above rules is allowed only in special circumstances.
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities with good credit rating, and are subject to both specified limits and approval procedures.
Liquidity and refinancing risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, and refinancing risk is defined as the risk of being unable to borrow on the market to fund actual or forecasted commitments.
In order to ensure that funding is obtainable and to minimise the cost of funding, the Group shall have a minimum liquidity corresponding to an average of one month's expenses. The Group minimizes the total cash needed for operations by efficient cash management including cash pool arrangements.
The Group had committed and uncommitted credit facilities as at 31 December 2017 in several banks amounting to EUR 60.7 million of which EUR 0.0 million were utilized.

The Group's liquidity at the end of December 2017 was EUR 111.5 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of EUR 50.7 million and unused credit facilities of EUR 60.7 million. According to the Group's Treasury Policy the Group's required minimum liquidity should correspond to the Group's one month's average expenses.
The total amount of current loans includes EUR 26.8 million of issued commercial paper. The Group monitors that the outstanding total amount of issued commercial paper does not exceed the total amount of unused committed Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group's Treasury Policy also sets a guideline according to which the average maturity of long-term debt should be at least three years.
In November 2016 Pöyry signed an agreement on extending its financing with its core banks and Finnish financial institutions. EUR 45 million revolving credit facilities and EUR 27 million term loans were refinanced by new facility agreement. This agreement includes EUR 55 million revolving credit facility available from signing date, and EUR 30 million

term loan facility which was fully raised in August 2017. The agreement is subject to covenants relating to Pöyry's financial performance and solidity. The agreement is valid until June 2019.
Pöyry issued EUR 30 million hybrid bond in November 2015. The hybrid bond bears a fixed interest rate of 7.50 % per annum until November 2019, after which the interest rate will be floating. The hybrid bond has no maturity date, but the company has the right to redeem it after four years from the issue date upon certain conditions. The hybrid bond is a debt instrument, which is subordinated to the company's unsubordinated debt obligations and treated as equity in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. The hybrid bond does not confer on its holders the right to vote at shareholder meetings and does not dilute the holdings of the current shareholders.

Contractual maturity of liabilities and derivatives has been presented in Table of Maturity Analysis in Note 21.

Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as exchange rates and interest rates, which affect the Group's result. The objective is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable limits.

Currency risk Transaction risk, commercial: Majority of the Group's international business operations are denominated in the local functional currencies, and only about five per cent of the Group's net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Group companies hedge their commercial exposure, i.e. the project cash flows denominated in a foreign currency, by using internal foreign exchange derivative contracts with Group Treasury. Hedging principles follow the Group's Treasury Policy which states that all committed cash flows in foreign currencies must be hedged. The deviation from policy can be made only for justified reasons and deviation must be approved by the CFO. Speculative derivative contracts without connection to business operations are not allowed.

Transaction risk, financial: According to the Group's Treasury Policy the parent company conducts financing and subsidiaries are not allowed to take up loans from external parties without permission and coordination from Group Treasury. The parent company grants loans to Group companies if considered necessary, justified or otherwise to be in the best interest of the parties. Group companies lend their excess cash to the parent company and as a rule, in order to centralize the foreign currency risks to the parent company; all internal funding is done in the domestic currency of the group companies. At the end of December 2017 the parent company did not have any external loans denominated in foreign currency. Thus the Group's financial exposure consists mainly of the Group's internal loans between the parent company and subsidiaries.

The Group did not have major open transaction risk exposures at the end of 2017. The impact on result of a ten percent strengthening/weakening of euro would not have been material.

The parent company hedges the net transaction exposure centrally by external derivative contracts. The main objective is to minimize external hedging needs by netting as much cash flows in foreign currencies as possible against each other. The derivative contracts are stated at fair value and recognised in the income statement. Fair value hedge accounting can be applied to the derivative contracts when they are used for hedging order stock. External derivative instruments have not been netted in the financial statements but they all belong to master netting agreements signed with external counterparties. Financial assets and liabilities belonging under these agreements are described in the following table:

Translation risks: Currency exposure and hedging need related to share capital and other restricted equity in foreign subsidiaries is reviewed on an annual basis but the main principle is that the translation exposure of investments in foreign subsidiaries is not hedged. If the Group needs external funding, the funding currency can be chosen in a way that the foreign equity becomes partly or fully hedged. To these loans the Group can apply net investments hedge accounting, and the exchange differences arisen from these loans are recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment of the particular entity is disposed. The Group did not have net investments hedged by loans at the end of 2017.

Due to translation risk, changes in the currency rates have influence on the amount of equity as well as on the result. Weakening of euro would increase the total amount of the Group's equity and increase the amount of profit/loss. Strengthening of euro would have an opposite impact on equity and profit/loss. In the table below is simulated the impact of ten (10) percent strengthening/weakening of euro on the Group's equity and net profit regarding currencies in which the Group has the most significant amount of equity. All other variables held constant and compared with the closing rates of 31 Dec 2017 the impact on the Group's equity and net profit would be as follows:

Interest rate risk The Group's policy is to achieve a balance between the maturity of long-term loans and the corresponding interest rate level. In case of essential interest rate level differences, the Group may use interest rate derivatives to achieve this target. Changes in the interest rate markets affect the Group's funding costs and the fair values of interest rate derivatives.
The total amount of interest bearing loans at the end of 2017 was EUR 56.8 million (81.2) of which EUR 26.8 million were fixed interest rate loans and EUR 30 million floating interest rate loans. One percentage unit rise in interest level would increase annual interest expenses of floating rate loans by EUR 0.2 million.
Capital structure management The Group's policy is to preserve a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the ownership structure, as well as the return on capital and the level of dividends to shareholders. The Group defines capital as the total balance sheet deducted with non-interest bearing liabilities.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost equals their carrying amount as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair values are within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value calculation rules of the derivatives can be found in note 31 Derivative Instruments.

1) Cash and cash equivalents include current account balances which belong to a multi-currency notional cash pool operated by Pöyry PLC. For reporting purposes the account balances of this cash pool can be offset if the conditions of "IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation" are met. The Group met these conditions and at 31 December 2017 EUR 35.2 (27.0) million of the cash balances and equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset.

Level 1 fair values are measured using quoted prices in active markets at the balance sheet date for identical assets or liabilities. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are easily and regularly available from e.g. an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. Instruments in Level 1 consist mainly of DAX, FTSE and Dow Jones equity investments classified as trading securities or available for sale.
Level 2 fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example OTC-derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. The following techniques can be used to value financial instruments: - Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments - Interest rate swaps: the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves - Foreign exchange forward contracts: discounting back to present value based on forward rates at the balance sheet date - Other financial instruments: for example discounted cash flow analysis
Level 3 fair values are measured using valuation techniques based on unquoted parameter inputs.
During the reporting period there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3.

24. Pension obligations
Critical accounting estimates The present value of the pension obligations is calculated using several factors, which are based on various statistical and other actuarial assumptions. These factors include, among others, assumptions about the discount rate and changes in future compensation. Statistical factors used may differ materially from actual results due to, among others, changing market and economic conditions. Significant differences in actual experiences or significant changes in assumptions may have a material impact on the carrying amount of pension obligations in the future reporting periods.
Defined benefit pension plans at Pöyry 29.5 (70.4) per cent of the Group's net defined benefit liability is related to Swiss defined benefit pension plans. In Switzerland the level of benefits provided is based on accumulated account balance, which depends on salary during the service time. The plan also provides benefits on death, disability, and termination. Retirement benefit is paid either as a lump sum or as a monthly pension payment, which is defined as a proportion of the accrued retirement savings amount. Benefits are paid from the funds managed by a trust. The foundation board of the trust must be composed of representatives of company and plan participants.
The defined benefit pension plans in Finland are mainly funded voluntary pension plans. The amount of the benefit is based on salaries of the final years leading up to retirement and guarantees a total pension defined in the plan. The voluntary plan pensions are increased based on the earnings-related pension index.
The defined benefit pension plans in Germany are individual, partly funded and partly unfunded pension plans. In unfunded pension plans the company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. The Group has additionallly minor defined benefit pension plans e.g. in Austria and Norway. Assets related to defined benefit pension plans are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all the other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assuptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to signifcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

Annual Review 2017

Consolidated financial statements
Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks. The most significant risks are detailed below:
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate or government bond yields depending on the plan; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Asset volatility is particularly significant in the Swiss plan, as company has to pay additional contributions if the pension fund becomes underfunded.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. In the Swiss plans, the pension payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancy When plans' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant in the Swiss and German pension plans.
In the Swiss pension plan the pension fund holds an "Asset fluctuation reserve" in order to absorb the volatility of the yields on plan assets. The full target value of this reserve is a security level of 97.5%. According to the rules of the pension fund another utilisation of the return on assets is not permitted before the Asset Fluctuation Reserve has reached its full target value. In the Swiss pension plan the company must contribute 14% of contributory salary for the pension plan according to the rules of the pension plan. In Finnish pension plans company's contributions are mainly related to index increases in pension benefits.

Claims and litigation
Given the nature of Pöyry's operations, claims are made against Group companies from time to time based on various grounds, which sometimes result in litigation or arbitration. Occasionally also Pöyry needs to initiate legal proceedings in order to collect receivables.
Litigations and arbitrations of material value
Sino-Forest Corporation related litigations In 2011 three competing class proceedings of material value were commenced in Ontario, Canada against Pöyry's subsidiary companies along with other defendants concerning matters relating to Sino-Forest Corporation ("SFC"). Only one of these competing class proceedings was allowed to proceed by the Ontario court (the "Ontario Proceeding"), the others were stayed. The Ontario Proceeding only named one Pöyry subsidiary company as a defendant. A parallel proceeding was commenced in Quebec, Canada involving the same Pöyry subsidiary company (together with the Ontario Proceeding, the "Canadian SFC Litigation"). During the first reporting period of 2012, the Pöyry subsidiary company named as a defendant in the Ontario Proceeding concluded a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs concerning the Canadian SFC Litigation (the "Settlement Agreement"), which was subsequently approved by the Ontario and Quebec courts in the third and fourth reporting periods of 2012, respectively. In the fourth reporting period of 2012, the Pöyry subsidiary company named as a defendant in the Ontario Proceeding was also added as a defendant to an existing class action previously commenced against SFC and others in the State of New York of the USA (the "US SFC Litigation"). The allegations pleaded are similar to those in the Canadian SFC Litigation. There have been no material developments in the US SFC Litigation since the above-referenced addition of the Pöyry subsidiary company as a defendant.
A 'Litigation Trust' was created by way of the SFC insolvency proceedings in December 2012 to pursue certain claims that SFC and/or its noteholders had at that time. Commencing in the last reporting period of 2013, proceedings in various jurisdictions were issued by the Litigation Trust against, inter alia, certain of Pöyry's subsidiary companies that had provided consulting services to SFC. While Pöyry's legal advisors in those jurisdictions are of the view that these proceedings are without merit, it is premature to assess the outcome of these proceedings.
Rigesa arbitration In 2013 Pöyry Tecnologia Ltda. and Pöyry Soluções em Projectos Ltda., subsidiary companies of Pöyry, commenced arbitration proceedings against Rigesa Celulose, Papel e Embalagens Ltda. ("Rigesa") in Brazil regarding the payment of certain change orders and other claims in relation to project deliveries of the said subsidiary companies to Rigesa. Rigesa has since commenced counter proceedings against the said Pöyry subsidiary companies in relation to the same project. The two arbitration proceedings have been combined into one proceeding (together the "Rigesa arbitration"). Pöyry is convinced on the justification for its claims against Rigesa and does not see merit in Rigesa's counterclaims but it is premature to assess the outcome of the Rigesa arbitration. Pöyry expects resolution on the merits of this case in H1 2018.
Metro Lima Line No 1 ­ Contraloria litigations
The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic of Peru ("Contraloria") has commenced several proceedings, together with a material value, against the Consortium CESEL-PÖYRY ("Consortium") and some of the employees of the participating companies concerning certain aspects of the site supervision services provided by the Consortium to its public sector client, Autonomous Authority of the Electric Mass Transportation System of Lima ­ Callao ("AATE"). Pöyry Switzerland Ltd. is a party to the Consortium. The services of the Consortium ended in 2013 and have been approved by the client AATE. While Pöyry's legal advisors in Peru are of the view that these proceedings are without merit, it is premature to assess the outcome of these proceedings.
Apart from the above referred legal proceedings, the risk related to the individual claims and litigations where Group companies are involved is, on balance, not considered material on the Group level, taking into consideration the value and basis of these claims and litigations, the contractual terms and conditions and expert opinions applicable to these claims and litigations, the extent of Pöyry's business operations and insurance cover of the Group companies. There are, however, always uncertainties related to the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings.
Labour legislation in one of the Pöyry's country operations
There are some uncertainties relating to the interpretation of labour legislation in one of the countries where Pöyry operates. Unexpected negative interpretations by authorities and court decisions could have a harmful impact on the local subsidiary companies' business, financial position and results. While Pöyry's labour law advisors in the country in question support Pöyry's views on the interpretation matter, it is not possible to assess at this time further risk associated with this.

The Group hedges the project cash flows denominated in foreign currency by using foreign exchange derivative contracts. Exchange rate gains or losses arisen from these derivative contracts are recorded in sales and project expenses.
The fair value of the foreign exchange derivative contracts is specified by closing date fair values for the corresponding maturities of the agreements. Derivatives in hedge accounting are effective. The fair values of the interest rate swaps have been specified by the present values of the future cash flows which are based on the closing date's interest rates and other information, excluding the accrued interest and exchange rate difference. The fair values represent the prices which the Group should pay or receive if it terminated the derivative agreement. The fair values are based on banks' confirmations as well as reports produced by the treasury management system. Derivative instruments have not been set off in the financial statements but all belong to master netting agreements agreed with external counterparties.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting principles for the financial statements
Pöyry PLC prepares its financial statements in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS). Pöyry PLC is the parent company in the Pöyry Group. The financial statements are presented in euros and are prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
When appropriate, the financial statements of Pöyry PLC comply with the Group's accounting principles based on IFRS. Below are described those accounting principles in which the financial statements of Pöyry PLC differ from the accounting principles of the consolidated financial statements. The accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Net sales Pöyry PLC's net sales consist of intra-group royalties and service fees whose total invoice value is deducted by indirect taxes relating to sales, discounts and exchange rate differences of trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies.
Share-based incentive plans The accounting treatment of Pöyry PLC's share-based incentive plan is described in the accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements. Pöyry's share-based incentive plan is a combination of shares and a cash payment. The granted amount of the incentive plan, settled in shares, is measured at cost for the shares. The cash-settled part of the plans is measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The expenses arising from the incentive plan are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period. In the financial statements of the parent company the component settled in shares as well as the cash-settled part are recognised as accrued liability until paid out. When paid out the share settled part is credited to the invested free equity reserve.
Pension arrangements The statutory pension arrangements are generally satisfied through contracts with external insurance companies. Voluntary pension plans are organised through pension insurances. Pension-related payments are recognised as pension expenses on accrual basis. No other pension liabilities or pension assets arising from pension arrangements are recognised in the balance sheet except for pension-related accruals
Leases The leases are mainly office facility agreements. The company also has some car and office equipment leases. Lease payments are expensed over the rental period and they are included in other operating expenses. Assets leased under finance leases and related liabilities are not recognised in the parent company's balance sheet.
Hybrid bond Hybrid bonds are presented as bonds in the balance sheet in the financial statements of the parent company. They are initially measured at fair value, using the effective interest method. Interest expenses are recognised in profit or loss over the life of the bonds using the effective interest method. Subsequent to initial recognition, the bonds are stated at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. They are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value on the trade date. Subsequently they are fair valued. Gains and losses are accounted for based on the purpose of the use of the derivative.
Pöyry PLC hedges the currency risk of the Group centrally by foreign exchange derivatives. Group companies hedge their cash flows denominated in foreign currency by using internal foreign exchange derivative contracts with Pöyry PLC which does all the external derivative contracts. Hedging principles follow the Group's Treasury Policy which states that all committed cash flows in foreign currencies must be hedged. The deviation from policy can be made only for justified reasons and deviation must be approved by the CFO. Speculative derivative contracts without connection to business operations are not allowed.
Pöyry PLC hedges interest rate risk by using interest rate derivatives, most commonly interest rate swaps. Interest rate derivatives are used to adjust the average interest reprising period of external loan portfolio depending on market conditions and within the limits set in treasury policy.

The fair values of the foreign exchange derivative contracts are specified by closing date fair values for the corresponding maturities of the agreements. The fair values of the interest rate swaps and gross currency swaps have been specified by the present values of the future cash flows which are based on the closing date's interest rates and other information. The fair values represent the prices which the company should pay or receive if it terminated the derivative agreement, and the fair values are based on bank's confirmation as well as reports produced by the treasury management system.

Level 1 fair values are measured using quoted prices in active markets at the balance sheet date for identical assets or liabilities. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are easily and regularly available from e.g. an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. Instruments in Level 1 consist mainly of DAX, FTSE and Dow Jones equity investments classified as trading securities or available for sale.
Level 2 fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example OTC-derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. The following techniques can be used to value financial instruments: - Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments - Interest rate swaps: the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves - Foreign exchange forward contracts: discounting back to present value based on forward rates at the balance sheet date - Other financial instruments: for example discounted cash flow analysis
Level 3 fair values are measured using valuation techniques based on unquoted parameter inputs.
During the reporting period there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3.

21. Financial risk management

Pöyry PLC is responsible for the whole Pöyry Group's financial risk management which risk related responsibilities and procedures are described in the Treasury Policy. Group Treasury within the parent company provides services related to financial risk management to Group companies. Main tasks include protection from unfavourable changes in the financial markets while securing the Group's profitability and ensure that adequate funding is available at all circumstances.
The Group has exposure to the following financial risks: · credit risk · liquidity risk · market risk
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligation, and arises principally from the Group's project assignments. The maximum amount of the credit risk equals the total book value of the financial assets.
The Group's client profile and the spread of its sales between numerous clients reduce the exposure to credit risks. Credit rating procedures, internal follow-up of overdue receivables and a contract policy of balance between work performed and payments received further reduce the Group's credit risk exposure.
Overdue accounts receivable are reported and monitored by the management on a monthly basis. Overdue accounts receivable over 60 days are reported by client including reasons for delay and actions taken or planned.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses. An allowance for impairment of 50 per cent is made for amounts which are overdue more than 180 days, except for amounts related to international institutions, government or municipality controlled entities. Notwithstanding the client category, an allowance for impairment of 100 per cent is made for amounts which are overdue more than 360 days. Any deviation from above rules is allowed only in special circumstances.
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities with good credit rating, and are subject to both specified limits and approval procedures.
Liquidity and refinancing risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, and refinancing risk is defined as the risk of being unable to borrow on the market to fund actual or forecasted commitments.
To ensure that funding is obtainable and to minimise the cost of funding, the Group shall have a minimum liquidity corresponding to an average of one month's expenses. The Group minimises the total cash needed for operations by efficient cash management including cash pool arrangements.
Pöyry PLC had committed credit facilities as at 31 December 2017 in several banks amounting to EUR 55.0 million of which EUR 0.0 million were used.

Pöyry PLC's liquidity at the end of December 2017 was EUR 71.5 (71.3) million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of EUR 16.5 (16.3) million and unused credit facilities of EUR 55.0 (55.0) million.
The total amount of current loans includes EUR 26.8 (48.7) million of issued commercial paper. The Group monitors that the outstanding total amount of issued commercial paper does not exceed the total amount of unused committed Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group's Treasury Policy also sets a guideline according to which the average maturity of long-term debt should be at least three years.
In November 2016 Pöyry agreed on the financing with its core banks and Finnish financial institutions. EUR 45 million revolving credit facilities and EUR 27 million term loans were refinanced by new facility agreement. This agreement includes EUR 55 million revolving credit facility available from signing date, and EUR 30 million term loan facility which was fully raised in August 2017. The agreement is subject to covenants relating to Pöyry Group's financial performance and solidity. The agreement is valid until June 2019.
Pöyry PLC issued EUR 30 million hybrid bond in November 2015. The hybrid bond bears a fixed interest rate of 7.50 % per annum until November 2019, after which the interest rate will be floating. The hybrid bond has no maturity date, but the company has the right to redeem it after four years from the issue date upon certain conditions. The hybrid bond is a debt instrument, which is subordinated to the company's unsubordinated debt obligations and treated as equity in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. The hybrid bond does not confer on its holders the right to vote at shareholder meetings and does not dilute the holdings of the current shareholders.

Contractual maturity of liabilities and derivatives has been presented in Table of Maturity Analysis in Note 19.

Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as exchange rates and interest rates, which affect company's result. In accordance with Treasury Policy the objective is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable limits.

Currency risk Transaction risk, commercial: Majority of the Group's international business operations are denominated in the local functional currencies, and only about five per cent of the Group's net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Group companies hedge their commercial exposure, i.e. the project cash flows denominated in a foreign currency, by using internal foreign exchange derivative contracts with Group Treasury. Hedging principles follow the Group's Treasury Policy which states that all committed cash flows in foreign currencies must be hedged. The deviation from policy can be made only for justified reasons and deviation must be approved by the CFO. Speculative derivative contracts without connection to business operations are not allowed.

Transaction risk, financial: According to the Group's Treasury policy the parent company conducts financing and subsidiaries are not allowed to take up loans from external parties without permission and coordination from Group Treasury. The parent company grants loans to Group companies if considered necessary, justified or otherwise to be in the best interest of the parties. Group companies lend their excess cash to the parent company and in order to centralize the foreign currency risks to the parent company, all internal funding is done in the domestic currency of the subsidiary. At the end of December 2017 the parent company did not have any external loans denominated in foreign currency. Thus the Group's financial exposure consists mainly of the Group's internal loans between the parent company and subsidiaries.

Pöyry PLC did not have major open transaction risk exposures at the end of 2017. The impact on result of a ten percent strengthening/weakening of euro would not be material.

Pöyry PLC hedges the net transaction exposure centrally by external derivative contracts. The main objective is to minimize hedging needs by netting as much cash flows in foreign currencies as possible against each other. The derivative contracts are stated at fair value and recognised in the income statement. Fair value hedge accounting can be applied to the derivative contracts when they are used for hedging order stock. Derivative instruments have not been netted in the financial statements but they are all against Group companies or belong to master netting agreements signed with external counterparties. Financial assets and liabilities towards Group companies or belonging to netting agreements are described in the following table:

Translation risks: Currency exposure and hedging need related to share capital and other restricted equity in foreign subsidiaries is reviewed on an annual basis but the main principle is that the translation exposure of investments in foreign subsidiaries is not hedged. Translation differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries are not recognized in Pöyry PLC's income statement but only in Pöyry Group's consolidated income statement.
Interest rate risk The Group's policy is to achieve a balance between the maturity of long-term loans and the corresponding interest rate level. In case of essential interest rate level differences, the Group may use interest rate derivatives to achieve this target. Changes in the interest rate markets affect the Group's funding costs and the fair values of interest rate derivatives.
Pöyry PLC's long term, floating rate loans from other than associated companies at the end of 2017 amounted to EUR 30.0 (0.0) million. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps. One percentage unit rise in interest level would increase annual interest expenses of floating rate loans by EUR 0.2 million.
Capital structure management The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the ownership structure, as well as the return on capital and the level of dividends to shareholders. The Group defines capital as the total balance sheet deducted with noninterest bearing liabilities.
The Group seeks to achieve a balance between growth targets, higher level of borrowings and return on capital and the Board sets the long-term targets on return on investment and gearing ratio. Aiming for and maintaining these targets ensure the Group's access to external funding sources when needed and with competitive pricing.

Auditor's report

Our Audit Approach

Overview

· Overall group materiality:  3 million, which represents 0.5 % of net sales.

· The focus of our work was on the reporting units in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden and Brazil.

Group: · Project revenue recognition and valuation of accounts receivable and work in progress · Legal proceedings and claims · Valuation of accounts receivable past due 360 days · Goodwill valuation · Realizability of deferred tax assets relating to losses carried forward Parent company: · Valuation of investments in subsidiaries

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.

Overall group materiality
How we determined it
Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied

 3 million (previous year  3 million)
0.5% of net sales
We chose net sales as the benchmark because, in our view, it represents the most stable and relevant benchmark to measure the performance of the group. In the absence of steady profits it is also a generally accepted benchmark. We chose 0.5%, which is within the range of acceptable quantitative materiality thresholds in auditing standards.

How we tailored our group audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.

Annual Review 2017

85

Auditor's report
The group audit scope was focused on components in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden and Brazil, where an audit of the complete financial information was performed due to their size and their risk characteristics. We performed further specific audit procedures over group functions and areas of significant judgement, including taxation, goodwill, and material litigation at the group's head office.
We determined the type of work for each component that needed to be performed by us in relation to activity within Finland, or by other PwC network firms operating under our instruction in relation to activity outside Finland. Where the work was performed by those other firms, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key audit matter in the audit of the group

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Project revenue recognition and valuation of accounts receivable and work in progress
Refer to note 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
Project revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable and work in progress are significant to the financial statements based on the quantitative materiality and the degree of management judgment required to account for revenue recognition and valuation of accounts receivable and work in progress. The complexity and judgments are mainly related to the estimation of the costs to complete the projects, expected revenues and the related percentage of completion which the group applies for recognizing revenues and assessing provisions for projects.
The total amount of revenue and profit to be recognised under a contract can be affected by changes in conditions and circumstances over time, such as:
· variations to the original contract terms
· cost overruns
· scope changes that require further negotiation and settlement.
Variations can arise from changing client specifications, changes to the job based on unforeseen circumstances (e.g. macroeconomic factors), as well as from inefficiencies on the part of either party. There can be some uncertainties, therefore, in determining the amounts to be recovered from any additional work performed.
Management has also considered this area to be a key accounting estimate as disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We therefore determined this to be a key audit matter.

We have met regularly with business line management to identify high risk projects e.g. loss making projects, projects with large work in progress balances or ongoing litigations.
We tested certain key internal controls relating to revenue recognition and IT systems which support the project management and accounting. We performed detailed procedures on individually significant projects and high risk projects. This includes challenging management's estimates and assumptions and substantiating transactions with underlying documents and performing recalculations of management's models to determine project revenue recognition. We used among others contracts, client and sub-contractor correspondence and internal revenue and cost forecasts. In addition, we discussed the progress of projects with controllers and project leaders.
With the outcome of those discussions and the results of our audit procedures, we assessed management's assumptions in the determination of the percentage of completion of a project, estimates to complete for both revenue and costs and provisions for loss making projects or provisions for accounts receivables. We requested and assessed legal opinions from Pöyry's external or internal lawyer in situations where the outcome of project results or the recoverability of accounts receivable and work in progress was dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings or arbitration.

Legal proceedings and claims
Refer to note 25 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
As outlined in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements, the group is exposed to potential claims, which sometimes result in litigation or arbitration. The group has legal proceedings, both against it and in its advantage. The project provisions recognised are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements and the contingent liabilities relating to projects and other guarantees are disclosed in note 29.
We focused on this area as management judgement is required in assessing the completeness and valuation of provisions to cover the risk, the assessment process is complex and is based on future developments.

We evaluated management's assessment of the nature and status of litigation, claims and assessments and discussed them with group business management, including the legal counsel as well as the Audit Committee for certain of the more significant cases.
We examined management's conclusions with respect to the provisions and disclosures made for significant cases, by considering the correspondence between the group and its external legal counsel and legal letters obtained.

Auditor's report

Valuation of accounts receivable past due over 360 days
Refer to notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
As described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements an allowance for impairment of 100 per cent is made for amounts which are overdue more than 360 days. Any deviation from the above rule is allowed only in special circumstances.
At 31 December 2017 the group's accounts receivable past due over 360 days amounted to 7 million euro.
We focused on this area as the balance past due over 360 days is significant and the valuation requires management judgement and is to some extent based on expectations not controlled by the group.

Our audit procedures included an evaluation of the significant judgments made by management to not impair the accounts receivable past due over 360 days, whereby we examined documentation supporting the valuation of these receivables and discussed the judgements and the status of the collection process with business management and finance staff of the group.
We also performed tests of details including obtaining accounts receivable confirmations, analysis of aging structure and audit of the bad debt provision.
We further focused on the group's disclosures about the accounts receivable and the related risks such as credit risk and the aging of receivables in notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill valuation
Refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
At 31 December 2017 the group's goodwill balance is valued at 118 million euro. Under IFRS, the company is required to annually test for impairment of goodwill. Goodwill valuation was important to our audit due to the size of the goodwill balance and because the assessment of the value in use of the group's CGUs is complex, involving judgement about the future results of the business by estimating future sales growth rates, profit margins and inflation rates and determining the discount rate for the calculations. We focused on the risk that goodwill may be overstated.
Based on the annual goodwill impairment test management concluded that no goodwill impairment was needed.

We evaluated management's future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board-approved budgets, and testing the underlying calculations. We evaluated and challenged the company's future cash flow forecasts in a discussion with management of the business involved, and the process by which they were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use calculations. We compared the current year actual results to the figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 included in the prior year impairment models to consider whether any forecasts included assumptions that, with hindsight, had been optimistic.
We evaluated and challenged the discount rate used.
We assessed the sensitivity analysis that had been performed by management around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, which were:
· the discount rate · the projected operating profit margins and growth rates
to identify how much each of these key drivers needed to change, either individually or collectively, before the goodwill was impaired.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for the goodwill to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in those key assumptions arising.
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in note 12, by checking that they were compliant with IFRS and that their presentation was consistent with our understanding of the key issues and sensitivities in the valuation.

Annual Review 2017

Auditor's report

Realizability of deferred tax assets relating to losses carried forward
Refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
At 31 December 2017 the group has recognized in the consolidated financial statements deferred tax assets amounting to 27 million euro of which 17 million euro relate to losses carried forward. In addition there are deferred tax assets from losses of 84 million euro, which have not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
The group recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
The ability of the company to utilize these assets in the countries which have been loss making is uncertain. Judgement is required in assessing the recognition and valuation of deferred tax assets. There are uncertainties regarding the timing of these benefits, uncertainties regarding the realisation of such benefits, including the expiration date of losses and future taxable income.

We audited the available tax losses carried forward with special focus on the greatest and most judgmental balances in this regard. We considered the local expiry periods together with any applicable restrictions in recovery for each individual jurisdiction. In addition, our audit procedures included evaluating and challenging management's forecasts about the future taxable profits especially in loss-making units. We checked the consistency of underlying assumptions with those of the impairment analysis. We also assessed the past performance against business plans used by the group to determine the future taxable income per country.

Key audit matter in the audit of the parent company

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of investments in subsidiaries
Refer to note 11 to the parent financial statements and note 32 to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.
The parent company has investments in subsidiaries amounting to 260 million euro at December 31, 2017. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment about the future results of the subsidiaries. Management determines the need for possible impairment by estimating the net present value of each investment. This process includes estimating future sales growth rates, profit margins and inflation rates of the subsidiaries as well as determining the discount rate for the calculations. The valuation of investments in subsidiaries was important to our audit due to the size of the investments and because of the judgments required. We focused on the risk that the investments may be overstated.

We performed a detailed analysis of management's assessment of the valuation of investments in subsidiaries. This included comparing the investments to the amount of equity in each subsidiary as well as evaluating management's net present value calculations and the process by which they were drawn up.
We evaluated, challenged and tested the company's net present value calculations and the process by which they were drawn up. We compared the current year actual results to the figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 included in the prior year valuation models to consider whether any forecasts included assumptions that, with hindsight, had been optimistic.

There are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Annual Review 2017

Auditor's report
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Reporting Requirements
Appointment
We were first appointed as auditors by the annual general meeting on 8 March 2012. Our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 6 years.
Other Information
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. In our opinion · the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements · the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
