Dear Shareholders,
2014 was the year of putting into practice the mid-term plans of the Agora Group announced in March, 2014. Those plans were the Group's response to the structural changes in the media market which Agora had observed, and which had a substantial influence on its financial results in previous years. Execution of the plans was designed to enlarge the scale of business as a result of growth of revenues and profitability improvement.
The actions undertaken in 2014 brought about a positive effects: the Group noted growth of revenues. Not only did most of Agora's businesses not related to the press increase their revenues, but they also improved profitability. The Press segment successfully entered into the process of transforming its activity, the result of which was 55 thousand Gazeta Wyborcza's active digital subscriptions. Stopklatka TV, the TV channel developed in cooperation with partner, reached its target level of 1% of the audience.
The Group's activity in 2014 have clearly shown that consistent implementation of the tasks resulting from Agora's midterm growth directions, is the proper way of achieving positive effects. That is why the Group plans to continue execution of those tasks in the near future.
The Group's priority remains effective digital transformation of its print media operations. Agora followed the example of the world publishers who implemented metered paywall successfully. In the first year of operation, not only did Agora Group execute the target of 40 thousand active subscriptions, but it actually exceeded it.
Agora Group wants to build a strong and significant position in the TV market. As a result, on March 15, 2014 together with Kino Polska TV S.A. a TV channel, Stopklatka TV was launched. During the first year of operation, the business achieved its target of 1% of the audience. Now, the time has come to focus on the efficiency of this enterprise. The Group also plans to take actions to increase its presence in this field of the media market.
Agora will still undertake necessary actions to improve profitability of its main businesses not related to the press. The priority for its Internet business is rapid development of mobile and video, as well as further diversification of revenue streams. The Group plans on investing in content and mobile applications, and it wants to be more active in search for new revenue sources by means of organic growth.
As far as the cinema business is concerned, the Group plans to still develop Helios cinema network. In 2015 new Helios cinemas will be opened. Agora also plans to increase the scale of business related to film distribution and production. In September, 2015 a new film, whose Agora is the leading producer, will be seen in cinemas.
In the outdoor business Agora's priority remains strengthening its position in the premium panel segment. Construction of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw, which has begun in 2014, is an important step in execution of this strategy. The Company believes that it is a landmark project on the Polish outdoor market, and AMS has a great chance to shape this market in the upcoming years by participating in similar projects in other Polish cities.
The main objective of our radio business is to improve profitability and this target has been executed in 2014. Further organic growth is dependent on the number of available licences. The Group's objective is to acquire the largest possible number of the licences in order to grow technical reach of current radio stations ­ in 2014 Agora successfully maximized the range potential of its information and music radio stations. The Company will also work on optimization of music formats and building the model of distribution of audio content online.
Agora Group is of the opinion that the first positive results of the execution of targets for the upcoming years can already be seen. It is strongly convinced that the execution will result in effective transformation of its businesses, which, in turn, will lead the way to profitability improvement and growth of business scale. This in turn should result in the growth of value for shareholders.
Simultaneously, delivering our mission, we would like to become the first and natural choice for its users and business partners, to whom our businesses deliver credible information and quality entertainment, as well as innovative solution for business partners to reach their clients.
We would like to thank all shareholders, clients and employees for support and trust in Agora and our readers and listeners for interest and feedback.
Bartosz Hojka
The President of the Management Board of Agora S.A.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2014 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

(g) Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 1 April 2015.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union.
Information about standards and interpretations, which were published and become effective after the balance sheet date, including those awaiting endorsement by the European Union, is presented in point (ae).
(b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine, which functional currency was hryvna - UAH). All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the companies from continuing their business operations.
The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2013, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2014, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effecitve:
1) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements; 2) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; 3) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; 4) IAS 27 (2011) Separate Financial Statements; 5) IAS 28 (2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Venutres; 6) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Transition Guidance; 7) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities; 8) Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities; 9) Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting; 10) Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets.
The adoption of the new standard IFRS 12 by the Group resulted in additional disclosures required for investments in other entities, which were presented in these consolidated financial statements. According to the Group assessment, the other standards and amendments have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In particular, the Group assessment of control over its current investees based on the new standards IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 does not change the previous conclusions regarding the Group's scope of control over those investees and methods of their recognition in the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2014 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities, which are controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group due to its involvement in an investee is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group has power over an investee when the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, ie the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.
The acquitision method of accounting is applied to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control commences until the date that control ceases to exist. Contingent consideration is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the value of the contingent payment liability is recognised through the income statement Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
(ii)Joint ventures and associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and other shareholders on the basis of a statute, company's act or other agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases to exist. The investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. An interest in a joint venture or associate is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture or associate. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.
(iii)Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the joint venture.
(iv) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equal to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point w).
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is usually as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 5 - 8 years 2 - 20 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, except for some special projects related to distribution and co-operation rights for movies and computer games, in case of which the consumption of economic benefits may significantly differ from the straight line approach and the pattern of consumption of economic benefits in particular periods can be reliably determined based on generated revenue.
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets (apart from acquired magazine titles) are usually between 2 and 15 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.

(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised. At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses, whether there is objective evidence of impairment of financial assets. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset`s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted with the effective interest rate. Changes in impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine ­ which functional currency is hryvnia). Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.

(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses. Inventories comprise goods for resale, materials, finished goods and work in progress, including production cost of own movies.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i) Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii) Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii) Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv) Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses, including reserve capital accumulated from prior years profits. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 and the recognition of the put option given to the non-controlling shareholders.
(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.
Deferred income tax is provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.

(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.

(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method. Changes in the value of the liability are recognized in profit or loss, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants from the disabled fund
The Group's subsidiary (AMS S.A,) receives grants from the state to fund acquisition of fixed assets, which are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto (related to employment of disabled persons). The grants are recognised in the income statement as other operating revenues on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.
(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).

(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over its useful life, but no longer than the lease term. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets as described in point (d).
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.
(z) Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
In Agora Group the share incentive plans based on Agora S.A.'s shares are carried out. These plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment" which came into force from 1 January 2005.
According to incentive plans based on investment certificates, which ended in the first half of 2013, eligible employees were entitled to purchase investment certificates in a closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates was determined by applying valuation model, which took into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates was included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates was established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased. The costs were recognized over the vesting period.
Within the Agora Group there are 3-Year-Long Incentive Plans carried out, described in note 27B. One of the components of the plans is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. These are cash-settled plans with rules based on -

inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In this plans, eligible employees of the Agora Group (including the Management Board) are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The value of the provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are presented in salaries and remuneration.
(ab) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac) Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.
(ad) Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operates in a Special Economic Zone. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption is recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 17, 2014 or later)
The Interpretation provides guidance as to the identification of the obligating event giving rise to a liability, and to the timing of recognising a liability to pay a levy imposed by government.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
2) Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits entitled Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015 or later)
The amendments apply to contributions from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the existing defined benefit plan has no contributions from employees.
3) Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015 or January 1, 2015 or later)
The annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 contain 8 amendments to 7 standards and the Improvements to IFRS 2011-2013 contain 4 amendments to different standards, with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group analyzes the impact of the amendments, however, does not expects them to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later).
The new standard replaces the guidance included in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a model for calculating impairment losses. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of three categories:
- financial assets measured at amortized cost;
- financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or
- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).
The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. In respect of the financial assets impairment requirements, IFRS 9 replaces the "incurred loss" impairment model in IAS 39 with an "expected credit loss" model. Under the new approach, it will no longer be necessary for a loss event to occur before an impairment allowance is recognized.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
2) IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2016 or later)
The interim Standard that permits first time adopters of IFRS to continue to use its previous GAAP to account for regulatory deferral account balances both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements.
The standard will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, because the Group has no regulatory accounts.
3) Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations ( (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments provide guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business and related disclosures.
The Group analyzes the impact of the amendments on the consolidated financial statements.
4) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments clarify that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset.
The Group analyzes the impact of the amendments on the consolidated financial statements.
5) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2017 or later)
The Standard provides a framework that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in IFRS. Under the new standard, entities will apply a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue, and at what amount. The model specifies that revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled. The Standard includes new qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements to enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
6) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture - Bearer Plants (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments change the financial reporting for bearer plants. Under the new requirements, bearer plants should be accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment in IAS 16.

The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments introduce an option for the entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements, in addition to the existing cost and fair value options.
The Group assesses that the amendment will have no impact on the unconsolidated financial statements of the parent entity, because the parent plans to continue to account for its investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates by using the cost model in its unconsolidated financial statements.
8) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments remove the acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is contributed to an associate or a joint venture concerning the recognition of profit or loss on the loss of control of subsidiary.
The Group assesses that the amendment will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, because the Group does not plans to carry out transactions covered by the new regulations.
9) Improvements to IFRS (2012-2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The annual Improvements to IFRSs (2012-2014) contains 4 amendments to existing standards (IFRS 5, IFRS 7, IAS 19, IAS 34), with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
10) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The amendments relate to financial reporting of investment entities and will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
11) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure initiative (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments clarify requirements related to presentation and disclosures in financial statements. An emphasis is placed on materiality. Specific single disclosures that are not material do not have to be presented ­ even if they are a minimum requirement of a standard.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the unconsolidated financial statements.

The Purchased Shares were acquired with the aim of being redeemed.
On April 1, 2015, the Management Board of Agora S.A. announced the offer to buy back shares of the Company ("Offer"). All shareholders of the Company are entitled to participate in the Offer. Within the Offer, the Company shall purchase no more than 1,138,380 shares ("Shares"), constituting no more than 2.23% of the Company's share capital, however no more than 771,960 bearer shares traded on Warsaw Stock Exchange and no more than 366,420 registered shares.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996.
IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Company to be restated by applying the general price index.
Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Company with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount.
Consequently, the restatement of share capital due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Company, only the structure of the equity is affected.
Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies).
Consequently, due to lack of impact on equity of the Company following the hyperinflationary adjustment and lack of regulations in polish law, the Company did not post any adjustment to equity as a consequence of IAS 29 application.

13. RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER RESERVES
Dividends
Retained earnings may be distributed subject to regulations, stipulated in the commercial companies' code and according to dividend policy announced by the Company.
Frame dividend policy announced by the Company on 14 February of 2005 provides for return of excess cash to shareholders through annual dividend and ­ if the situation warrants ­ share repurchases (with cancellation) in connection with the Company's perspectives and market conditions.
For the financial year of 2013, Agora S.A. made a net loss of PLN 1,857 thousand, which was covered in accordance with the resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders of Agora dated June 24, 2014 from the reserve capital.

2014

2013
27,592 -

Put option liabilities concern the estimated redemption amount of the put options granted to non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., Sport4People Sp. z o.o. and Sir Local Sp. z o.o.
The estimated redemption amount of the put options classified as a financial liability is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group and at initial recognition decreased the line item in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group: Retained earnings and other reserves.
As at December 31, 2014, its value is estimated to:
- PLN 17,176 thousand for non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A. (31 December 2013: PLN 26,409 thousand),
- PLN 213 thousand for non-controlling shareholders of Sport4People Sp. z o.o. (31 December 2013: PLN 200 thousand),
- PLN 346 thousand for non-controlling shareholders of Sir Local Sp. z o.o. (31 December 2013: PLN 983 thousand).
On December 11, 2014 Agora S.A concluded share sales agreement on the basis of which the Company acquired 384,600 shares of Helios S.A. from a non-controlling shareholder. The consideration transferred comprised a cash payment of PLN 2,638 thousand and a contingent payment with a fair value of PLN 4,483 thousand. Group recognized the contingent payment liability, which is valid until the end of 2019 and which future value depends on the future value of EBITDA and net debt of Helios Group. Moreover, due to concluding the above share sales agreement, the provisions of the option agreement signed on August 31, 2010, which granted a put option to the non-controlling shareholder, expired. As a result, the put option liability in the amount of PLN 6,252 thousand expired and increased retained earnings within the Agora Group equity.

17. RETIREMENT SEVERANCE PROVISION
According to the Polish employment regulations, employees have the right to retirement severances payments. The amount provided as at 31 December 2014 amounted to PLN 2,582 thousand (31 December 2013: PLN 2,451 thousand).

21. SALES AND OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
(a) Operating segment information
In these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, information on operating segments are presented on the basis of components of the Group that management monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Operating segments are components of the Group, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in the process of decision making regarding allocation of resources and assessing the performance of the Group.
For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services. Since the first quarter of 2014, as a result of organizational changes, the Group changed the reporting method of selected operating segments. The most important changes concern separating printing services from former Newspapers segment into an independent business line. The second important change relates to including magazine publishing activities in a new Press segment and transferring former Special Projects division into a new Movie and Book segment (former Cinema segment). The comparable data for 2013 were restated, respectively. The Management Board would like to point out that, due to the change, the data presented in the quarterly reports for previous reporting periods may not be comparable in full with the present data prepared under the current management approach.
From 1 January 2014, there are six reportable operating segments as follows:
1) the Press segment includes the Group's following activities: publishing of Gazeta Wyborcza and Metro as well as publishing of the magazines within Agora's Magazine Department and Free Press division,
2) the Movies and Books segment includes the Group's activities within the cinema management of Helios S.A., film distribution activities of Next Film Sp. z o.o. as well as activities of Agora`s Special Projects Department (including book collections and film co-production),
3) the Outdoor segment includes the activities within the AMS Group, which provides advertising services on different forms of outdoor advertising panels,
4) the Internet segment includes the following Group's activities: the Internet and multi-media products and services within the Agora's Internet department, Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o., LLC Agora Ukraine (till December 10, 2013), AdTaily Sp. z o.o., Sport4People Sp. z o.o. and Sir Local Sp. z o.o. (since December 1, 2013),
5) the Radio segment includes the Group's activities within local radio stations, super-regional TOK FM radio and Agora's Radio Department,
6) the Print segment includes the Group's activities related to printing services within the Agora's Printing Department and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.
Accounting policies for operating segments are the same as followed by the Agora Group, besides some issues described below.
Data within each reportable segment are consolidated pro-forma. The Management Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance

assessment. Press segment operating costs associated with the production of the Group's own titles are settled on the basis of allocation of direct and indirect costs associated with their production from the Print segment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Operating results of reportable segments do not include: a) revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior
reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments, b) amortisation recognised on consolidation (described below).
Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income tax are managed on a Group level and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on the market basis in the manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Reconciling positions show data not included in particular segments, inter alia: other revenues and costs of Agora's supporting divisions (centralized IT, administrative, HR functions, etc.) and the Management Board, Agora TC Sp. z o.o., intercompany eliminations and other matching adjustments which reconcile the data presented in the management reports to the consolidated financials of the Agora Group. Since the first quarter of 2014, as a result of organizational changes in Agora Group, the administration of local divisions of the Company is reported in central supporting divisions (previously it was reported in Newspapers segments) and the press distribution division has been included into Press segment (previously it was reported in supporting divisions). The comparable data for 2013 were restated, respectively.
Operating depreciation and amortisation includes amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets of each segment. Amortisation recognised on consolidation can be defined as consolidation adjustments, inter alia: the amortisation of intangible assets and adjustments to property, plant and equipment recognised directly on consolidation.
Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses show impairment losses and their reversals presented in other operating expenses and income.
Amount of investment in associates and joint ventures accounted for by the equity method include the amount of acquired shares adjusted by the Group`s share of net results of those entities accounted for by the equity method. The financials presented for twelve months ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 relate to GoldenLine Sp. z o.o., Online Technologies HR Sp. z o.o, Instytut Badan Outdooru Sp. z o.o. (from June 1, 2013 r.), Stopklatka S.A. (from March 12, 2014) and Hash.fm Sp. z o.o. (from August 1, 2014).
Capital expenditure consists of additions based on the invoices booked in the reported period (purchases of intangible and fixed assets).
The Agora Group does not present geographical reporting segments, because the business activities carried out in the Ukraine till December 10, 2013 did not have material impact on the financial statements of the Group as a whole.

B. Incentive plans based on realization of operating result goal and share price increase
In the period of 2010-2012, the eligible employees of the Group (the Management Board and top managers) participated in incentive program ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2010-2012") based on two components: the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Group ("the EBITDA target") and the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"), which are described in consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2013.
In accordance with its assumptions, 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2010-2012 was settled in cash in the second quarter of 2013. The realization of the plan resulted in the payment of PLN 3,048 thousand.

Starting from the third quarter 2013, eligible employees of the Group (Management Board members of the Company) participate in a new incentive program based on two components ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan" for the period of 2013-2015) described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The target depends on the achievement of certain EBITDA level for 2014 ("the Condition"). If the Condition is not fulfilled, the target is based on the accumulated operating EBITDA (excluding some adjustments) to be reached in the years 2013-2015. The amount of potential reward depends on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the period of 2013-2015. If the stage of achieving the target will be below 70% or if the Condition will be fulfilled, the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan,
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan will depend on the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2016 till March 31, 2016 ("the Reference Share Price") adjusted by: (i) the accumulated dividend per one share, to which the shareholders will be eligible in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 and (ii) the adjustments resulting from the share buy-back program in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 ("the Share Price for Reward Calculation"). If the Share Price for Reward Calculation will be lower than PLN 9.9, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan.
The reward for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of other conditions, which are non-market conditions (for example: continuation of the employment within the Agora Group, holding the post of Management Board member of the Company).
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are described in the Supervisory Board resolution.
In the fourth quarter 2014, the value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the assumption that the Condition has been fulfilled basing on the achievement of certain EBITDA level for 2014. As a result, the liability relating to the EBITDA target component of the Plan accumulated so far has been reversed. The impact of this reversal on the Income Statement was compensated by an increase of the accrual for cash motivation plans.
The fair value of the provision for the cost of potential reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan, that is from December 1, 2013 (the grant date) till June 30, 2016 (the vesting date). The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the cost to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk.
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, granted loans and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 % of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
Investments
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by diversification of its investments in investment funds, which invest in different classes of debt instruments. The Company does not acquire securities directly, but only through investment funds. At the same time, the Company invest only in liquid securities.

Guarantees
The information on guarantees and promissory notes are descibed in note 37.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2014, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 14.
Payment deadlines concerning trade payables are described in note 20 and for credits and loans in note 14.

The Cash Pooling Agreement aims to optimize cash liquidity and the most efficient management of cash for entities participating in the cash pooling system. Agora S.A. acts as a cash pool leader within the system. The settlements between Agora S.A. and its subsidiaries resulting from cash pooling agreement are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises and credits which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 821 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2013: PLN 1,707 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 15,991 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2013: PLN 9,818 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 7,684 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2013: PLN 11,147 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to three months.
Agora S.A. has not been or was in 2014 engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).
Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.

Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group's operations.
The Group's objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of possible financial losses and possible damage to the Group's reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas:
requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions,
requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions,
compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements,
documentation of controls and procedures,
up-to-date analysis of the causes of operational results and setting remedial actions if a operational loss appeared or the probability of happening significant operational risk,
training and professional development,
ethical and business standards,
risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Compliance with Group's standards is supported by a programme of periodic reviews undertaken by Internal Audit. The results of Internal Audit reviews are discussed with the management of the business unit to which they relate, with summaries submitted to the Audit Committee and senior management of the Group.
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.

Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2014, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the impact of changes in fair value of financial instruments is estimated at the level of net loss/profit of PLN 298 thousand (as at December 31, 2013: PLN 344 thousand).

3) Fair value hierarchy for financial instruments
The Group applies the following hierarchy for disclosing information about fair value of financial instruments ­ by valuation technique:
- level 1: quoted prices in active markets (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities; - level 2: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are observable, directly or indirectly, market data; - level 3: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are not based on observable market data.

The table below shows financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date:

The table below shows a reconciliation from the beginning balance to the ending balance for financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:

Key assumptions that are most significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include discount rate and the estimated level of the EBITDA. In case of the put option granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., an increase of the estimated EBITDA level over the period specified in put option conditions by 10%, would cause an increase of put option liability by ca PLN 1,900 thousand, while an increase of the discount rate by 1pp, would cause a decrease of the liability by ca PLN 860 thousand.

Moreover, AMS S.A. provided to the bank cash deposits as a cash collateral securing the bank guarantees issued in relation to the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw. As at 31 December 2013, the deposit receivable amounted to PLN 40 million. In the first quarter of 2014 AMS S.A. provided further PLN 7 million and in the fourth quarter of 2014 based on the annexes to guarantee contracts the cash deposit was reduced by PLN 9.4 million. As a result, as at 31 December 2014 the deposit receivable amounts to PLN 37.6 million (including PLN 29.6 million presented within long-term receivables).

Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to PLN 818 thousand in 2014 and PLN 880 thousand in 2013.

38. COMMITMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are primarily for the lease of outdoor locations for advertising panels, land and buildings and are summarised as follows:

41. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the cash flow forecasts have been prepared.
There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and
2) pre-tax discount rate.

AGORA GROUP MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(MD&A) FOR YEAR OF 2014 OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REVENUE PLN 1,102.4 MILLION NET LOSS PLN 11.0 MILLION
OPERATING EBITDA PLN 77.7 MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 97.8 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2014, while comparisons refer to 2013. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP [1]
Since the first quarter of 2014, as a result of organizational changes, Agora Group ("The Group") has changed the reporting method of selected operating segments. The most important changes concern separating printing services from former Daily Press segment and turning it into an independent business segment. The second important change relates to including magazine publishing activities in a new Press segment and transferring former Special Projects division into a new Movies and Books segment (former Cinema segment). Detailed description of changes in the reporting of particular business lines of the Agora Group can be found in respective sections of this Management discussion and analysis. The comparable data for 2013 were restated adequately. The Management Board would like to point out that, due to the change, the data presented in the reports for previous reporting periods may not be comparable in full with the present data prepared under the current management approach.
In 2014, the Group's revenues amounted to PLN 1,102.4 million and increased by 2.7% yoy. This resulted from higher revenues reported by most of the Group's operating segments. The highest increase in revenues was reported in the Movies and Books segment ­ its revenues amounted to PLN 282.9 million. This growth results from higher attendance in Helios cinemas and revenues from film distribution and film co-production, which amounted to almost PLN 17.0 million. Revenues in Internet and Radio segments increased thanks to higher yoy advertising sales and amounted to PLN 127.1 million (up by 14.1% yoy) and PLN 87.4 million (up by 5.2% yoy), respectively. The increase in the revenues of the Print segment to PLN 173.1 million resulted from a higher volume of orders from external clients. Segments which reported lower yoy revenues included Press and Outdoor segments. In case of the Press segment, the drop in revenues is mainly connected with drop in expenditure of advertisers in dailies and magazines. In case of the Outdoor segment, the drop in the segment's revenues, results from lower yoy advertising sales in the first and the third quarter of 2014.
In 2014, the Group's net operating cost amounted to PLN 1 120.7 million and increased by 5.1% yoy. This was affected by impairment losses in the amount of PLN 15.1 million, which were charged to the Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2014. After exclusion of the impairment loss effect, the net operating cost of the Group amounted to PLN 1,105.6 million and increased by 3.7% yoy. A substantial increase in operating costs (up by 11.1% yoy) occurred in the Movies and Books segment and was connected with the film distribution and coproduction activities, development of the Helios network, and higher cost of film copy purchase. In the Internet segment, higher operating cost is related to the development activities and more extensive promotional activity. In the Print segment, the increase in operating cost resulted from a higher production volume for external clients, which also translated into an increase of revenues in this segment. A growth in operating costs was also reported in the Press segment and it was mainly connected with the impairment losses of press titles published by the Magazines and Free Press division and development of the segment's

translation only digital offer. In the Radio segment the operating cost remained flat yoy and in the Outdoor segment it decreased by 4.1% yoy mainly due to lower yoy maintenance and advertising expenditure. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Group's operating result was burdened with the impairment losses in the amount of PLN 15.1 million. As a result, the Group closed 2014 with the operating loss on the EBIT level of PLN 18.3 million and net loss of PLN 11.0 million. In 2014 the net loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent company amounted to PLN 12.5 million. The Group's EBITDA amounted to PLN 77.7 million and was lower yoy. After eliminating the effect of impairment losses, the Group's EBITDA in 2014 amounted to PLN 92.8 million and operating loss on the EBIT level was at PLN 3.2 million. The Group's net profit, after eliminating the impairment losses, amounted to PLN 1.2 million and was at the same level as in 2013. The contribution in kind and leaseback of advertising panels, executed as optimization measures aimed at improvement of operating efficiency of the AMS group companies, affected the value of deferred tax and in consequence the Group's net result in 2014. At the end of December 2014, the Group's cash and short-term monetary assets amounted to PLN 110.2 million, which comprised cash and cash equivalents in the amount of PLN 52.3 million, and PLN 57.9 million invested in short-term securities. Additionally, the Group has had a cash receivable of PLN 37.6 million deposited by the subsidiary AMS S.A. as a cash collateral securing the bank guarantees issued in relation to the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw (of which PLN 29.6 million is presented within long-term receivables). Additionally, the level of the Group's cash and monetary assets was influenced by the first part of buyback program executed by the Company. Agora bought 2,500,000 shares at PLN 12.0 per share outside the regulated market. The transaction was settled on September 12, 2014 and total cost related to the execution and settlement of the transaction amounted to almost PLN 30.1 million. At the end of December 2014, the Group's debt amounted to PLN 93.4 million (including external debt of the Helios S.A. group ("Helios"), which covers bank credits and liabilities due to financial lease in the amount of PLN 84.7 million). On 15 March 2014, the Agora Group, in cooperation with Kino Polska TV S.A. launched a movie channel Stopklatka TV, developed as part part of the company Stopklatka S.A. The results of Stopklatka S.A. are consolidated in the results of the Agora Group by means of the equity method.

In 2014, the Group's revenues amounted to PLN 1,102.4 million and increased by 2.7% yoy. Most significant factors influencing the Group's revenues included higher revenues of Helios cinemas, revenues from film distribution as well as revenues of the Internet segment. The revenues in Press and Outdoor segments decreased by 8.6% yoy and 2.4% yoy, respectively. This is mainly a result of a drop in the value of advertising expenditure in press and lower yoy revenues of Outdoor segment in the first and third quarter of 2014.
In 2014, the Group's advertising revenues decreased by 2.1% yoy and amounted to PLN 533.1 million. The main reason for this drop included lower by PLN 30.2 million yoy advertising revenues in the Press segment. In addition, advertising revenues in the Outdoor segment decreased slightly (down by 0.9% yoy). Other operating segments of the Group (Internet, Radio, as well as Movies and Books) reported an increase in advertising revenues - the largest growth ­ up by 11.9% yoy - was visible in the Internet segment. In Radio segment the ad revenues grew by 5.1% yoy and in the Movies and Books segment by 7.2% yoy.
In 2014, the copy sales revenues amounted to PLN 135.5 million and were higher by 1.1% yoy. This results from higher yoy copy sales revenues in the Press segment and from the sale of books in the Movies and Books segment. Revenues from the sale of Gazeta Wyborcza were slightly higher (up by 0.2% yoy) and reached PLN 100.8 million despite lower yoy average number of the newspaper's copies sold (down by 13.0% yoy). The value of revenues from the copy sales in the Press segment was positively affected by a change in the publishing cycle of the magazine Wysokie Obcasy Extra. Revenues from the copy sales of magazines decreased by 7.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 17.6 million.
In 2014, admission revenues in the Movies and Books segment increased by 10.8% yoy to PLN 143.0 million thanks to higher yoy attendance in Helios cinemas. During the analysed period, almost 8.4 million tickets were purchased in Helios cinemas (up by 11.8% yoy). During the same period, the number of tickets sold to cinemas in Poland amounted to 40.4 million and was higher by 11.2% yoy [10].
In 2014, revenues from the sale of printing services increased by 5.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 165.3 million, mainly thanks to a larger volume of orders for heatset print.
In 2014, revenues from other sales amounted to PLN 125.5 million and increased by 14.4% yoy.

(1) including the non-cash cost of share-based payments for 12 months of 2013 in the amount of PLN 1.4 million;
(2) the amount includes impairment losses of two monthlies published by Agora S.A.
Net operating costs of the Group increased by 5.1% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,120.7 million. A significant factor affecting this amount included PLN 15.1 million impairment losses on two monthlies published by Magazines and Free Press division which burdened the Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2014. After exclusion of the influence of the impairment losses, the net operating cost of the Group amounted to PLN 1,105.6 million (up by 3.7% yoy).
The increase in the cost of external services in 2014 was connected with higher cost of film copy purchase in the Movies and Books segment and higher production cost for external clients in the Print segment. At the same time, the Group substantially reduced the system maintenance cost in the Outdoor segment.
The Group's staff cost in 2014 increased by 4.4% yoy to PLN 302.3 million. This growth resulted from the increase of this cost position in most of the Group's operating segments in connection with strengthening of the sales force, other development activities and higher yoy cost of motivation and bonus system in connection with higher than planned goal achievement ratio.
The Group's headcount at the end of December 2014 amounted to 3,067 employees and decreased by 21 FTEs yoy. This reduction results from a lower yoy level of employment in Press and Outdoor segments. An increase in headcount was reported in Internet, Radio, as well as Movies and Books segments, and mainly resulted from development projects and strengthening the sales force.
The Group offers its employees different incentive plans (for example: cash motivation plans, incentive plans in sales departments etc.), whose cost is charged to the Group's staff cost position. Since the third quarter of 2013, the Group's operating result is burdened quarterly by the accrued cost of Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the Management Board members for the period of 2013 - 2015 (described in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group). In 2014, there has been a partial reversal of the accrual for this Plan created in 2013, which was compensated by an increase of the accrual for cash motivation plans.
The cost of raw materials, energy and consumables were at a similar level as in 2013.
The Group's cost of promotion and marketing increased in 2014. This resulted from the growth of advertising expenditure in Internet segment (up by 34.9% yoy) and in the Movies and Books segment (up by 24.2% yoy). The largest drop of advertising expenditure was observed in the Outdoor segment (down by 24.6% yoy). The Press segment limited advertising expenditure by 3.1% yoy.

3. PROSPECTS 3.1. Revenue 3.1.1 Advertising market [3]
In 2014, the advertising market in Poland increased by over 2.5% yoy. In each quarter last year, advertisers spent more yoy to promote their products and services (up by 0.5% yoy, up by 2.5% yoy, up by almost 4.5% yoy and up by almost 3.0% yoy, respectively).
According to the Company's estimates, in 2015 the value of advertising expenditure in Poland should increase by 2 to 4% yoy and the value of expenditure for advertising in Poland may be increasing slightly quicker than in 2014.
The data relating to the changes in the value of advertising expenditure in particular media segments are presented in the table below:

Total advertising expenditure
2-4%

Television 3-5%

Internet 6-8%

Magazines (8)-(11)%

Radio 4-6%

Tab. 5

Outdoor 1-3%

Dailies Cinema (12)-(15)% 3-5%

3.1.2 Copy sales
In 2015, negative trends relating to copy sales of dailies and magazines in their print versions shall continue, however their dynamics should be lower than in previous years. The Company develops the sales of its digital content. In the beginning of 2014, Agora implemented a new model of access to the digital content of Gazeta Wyborcza and a digital subscription offer. At the end of 2014, thanks to the development of digital offer and implementation of institutional subscription offer, the Company recorded 54.9 thousand of active subscriptions. In the Company's opinion, amongst others, such activities will stabilize the Press segment's financial results in the long term.
3.1.3. Ticket sales
The most significant factor affecting attendance in Polish cinemas is the repertoire. Based on available information, it is estimated that the number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas in 2014 amounted to 40.4 million and was 11.2% higher than in 2013. This is a record number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas post 1989 [10]. The repertoire for the current year looks promising and allows the Company to estimate that the cinema attendance may be at a similar level as in 2014.
3.2. Operating cost
In 2015, the Group is planning to execute development projects in selected business segments, which may result in an increase of operating cost. Segments with largest projects to be executed include: Internet, Radio, Outdoor as well as Movies and Books. The Group's growing engagement in production and film distribution activities may substantially influence both revenues and operating cost.
3.2.1 Costs of external services
The cost of external services will largely depend on the cost of brokerage services - in particular in the Internet, Radio and Press segments, costs of film copy purchase related directly to the level of revenues from the cinema ticket sales and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. In addition, the increase of this cost position will be caused by opening of new cinema facilities planned for 2015 and execution of other development projects.
3.2.2 Staff cost
The staff cost shall increase yoy due to execution of development projects in the Group. In the Internet segment, the increase in staff cost may be connected mainly with a development of selected websites of Gazeta.pl and

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 10

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2014 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
mobile applications, and strengthening the sales force teams. In the Movies and Books segment this will be connected with expanding of the Helios network with new facilities and other development activities.
3.2.3 Promotion and marketing cost
In 2014, the promotion and marketing cost was higher by 11.5% yoy. In 2015, the Agora Group plans further development activities, which also include promotional activities. The dynamics of the changes in individual media, the number of launched development projects, including film co-production and distribution activity, as well as market activities and projects of the Group's competitiors may affect the level of these expenses. Considering the above factors, the Company estimates that this cost position may be higher yoy.
3.2.4 Cost of raw materials and energy
In 2014, the value of this cost position decreased by 1.3% yoy. According to the Group's estimates, the level of this cost position in 2015 will be shaped by similar market trends as those observed in 2014. The printing activity carried out within the Agora Group has the most significant impact on this cost position, especially due to the cost of production materials, the volume of production and EUR/PLN exchange rate.
4. THE GROWTH DIRECTIONS OF THE AGORA GROUP
The primary objective is the growth in media sector. Agora Group wants to achieve the objective by the growth of revenues and profitability improvement according to the medium term development plans announced in March 2014. The key to success is execution of four main tasks: 1) digital transformation of print media operations, 2) building position in the TV market, 3) profitability improvement of the Group's key business segments, 4) cost optimization of the Group's shared functions and infrastructure. Due to the implementation of the metered paywall on "Gazeta Wyborcza's" website on February 4th, 2014 the process of digital transformation significantly accelerated in the Agora Group. In order to achieve that goal, the Group supports development of quality journalism and builds necessary technological tools. At the end of 2014, the number of active digital subscriptions of ,,Gazeta Wyborcza" amounted to 54.9 thousand and exceeded the defined objective of 40 thousand. On March 15, 2014 the Agora Group entered the TV market launching Stopklatka TV - a TV channel created together with Kino Polska TV S.A. Agora's objective is a quick success of the digital film channel and its aspires to build a significant position in the TV thematic channel market in the long term perspective. At the end of 2014, Stopklatka TV achieved its objective of 1% audience share. Agora plans to develop its other business segments. The Group aims to grow its cinema network Helios and increase the scale of operations in the field of film distribution and co-production. In the outdoor business Agora wants to strengthen its position in the premium segment. The priority for the Group's online operations is an intensive growth in mobile and video as well as further diversification of revenue streams. The Group's objective in the radio business is to successfully acquire the largest possible number of licences in order to grow technical reach of current radio stations and optimization of music formats. The Agora Group undertook optimization initiatives related to the Group's cost of shared functions and infrastructure in order to simplify and unify internal processes.

2.3. Sales and markets
Over 90% of the total sales of the Group were related to sales in domestic market. Sales to foreign markets are realized mainly through the sales of printing services to foreign customers, advertising services and copy sales (foreign subscription).

The Group does not depend on one particular customer. The biggest customers of the Group (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). In 2014, the value of transactions with none of the distributors exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.4. Suppliers
The Group does not depend on one particular supplier. Newsprint and printing services are important cost items of the Group. Newsprint used for printing services for external customers and in order to print the Group's own titles is purchased from several suppliers. In 2014, the value of transactions with none of the suppliers exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.5. Finance cost, net
Net financial activities of the Group, in 2014, were influenced mainly by interest from bank deposits and bank commissions as well as interest on the bank loans and lease liabilities. Moreover, in 2014 the net result on financial activities was positively influenced by the remeasurement of the put option liabilities granted to non-controlling shareholders.

3.1. Non-current assets
The decrease in non-current assets, versus 31 December 2013, results mainly from depreciation and amortisation charges as well as impairment losses, which were, to some extent, compensated by new investments in property, plant and equipment and intangibles as well as by the increase of long-term investments in related companies (e.g. acquisition of shares in Stopklatka S.A.). Moreover, in 2014, there was a decrease of long-term receivables related to cash deposits provided by the subsidiary AMS S.A. as a result of signed annexes to the bank guarantee contracts issued in relation to the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw. Besides, part of the cash deposits were reclassified to the short term receivables.
3.2. Current assets
The decrease in current assets, versus 31 December 2013, results mainly from the decrease in short-term securities and cash and cash equivalents, which was to some extent compensated by an increase in accounts receivable. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents is related to, inter alia, the realization of shares buy-back program.
3.3. Non-current liabilities and provisions

The decrease in non-current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2013, stems mainly from the decrease in long-term borrowings. Moreover, there has been a decrease of deferred tax liabilities as well as a decrease of liabilities related to put options granted to non-controlling shareholders.
3.4. Current liabilities and provisions
The decrease in current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2013, stems mainly from the decrease in short-term borrowings, which was to some extent compensated by the increase in accounts payable and accruals.

Additionally, the Group had a cash receivable of PLN 37.6 million deposited by the subsidiary AMS S.A. as a cash collateral securing the bank guarantees issued in relation to the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw (out of which PLN 29.6 million is presented within longterm receivables).
In 2014, Agora S.A. has not been engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative purposes).
On May 28, 2014, the Company entered into a new multi - purpose credit line agreement ("Agreement") with Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. ("Bank"). As a result of the new Agreement, the previous loan agreement with the Bank, related to long- term syndicated loan and executed on April 5th, 2002 with subsequent annexes, was terminated

translation only on July 11, 2014. On the basis of the new Agreement, Agora S.A. received a refinancing credit for repayment of the outstanding debt from the syndicated loan agreement, as well as, was provided with a time credit of up to PLN 100 million, which may be used by May 31, 2015 and with a credit facility in the current account of up to PLN 35 million, which may be used by May 28, 2015. In 2014, the Company repaid four consecutive installments of the credit line used in previous years, which now constitutes the refinancing credit based on the agreement described above. Moreover, on December 5, 2014, Agora S.A. and selected subsidiaries signed an agreement with Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A regarding implementation of liquidity management system in the Group ("the Cash Pooling Agreement"), which aims to optimize the cash management process within Agora Group. Considering the cash position, the Cash Pooling Agreement and available credit facility, the Agora Group does not anticipate any liquidity problems with regards to its further investment plans (including capital investments).
4.1. Operating activities
The decrease in net inflow from operating activities, in 2014, stems mainly from smaller amount of cash generated from the main operating activites.
4.2. Investment activities
Net outflow from investing activities, in 2014, results mainly from spending on property, plant and equipment and intangibles and investments in related entities.
4.3. Financing activities
In 2014, the net cash flows from financing activities included mainly repayments of bank loans and financial lease liabilities as well as expenditure related to the first stage of share buy-back program, which amounted to nearly PLN 30.1 million.

IV. OPERATING REVIEW - MAJOR SEGMENTS OF THE AGORA GROUP
IV.A. PRESS [1]
The Press segment includes the pro-forma consolidated financials of Gazeta Wyborcza, Magazines and Free Press division.
Since the first quarter of 2014, as a result of organizational changes in the Group, a new Print segment was separated from the Press segment (former Newspapers segment) and Special Projects division was merged with Cinema segment creating new segment Movies and Books. The press operations (Gazeta Wyborcza and Free Press division) merged with Magazine division (former Magazine segment) and Press distribution division (reported previously in supporting divisions) creating a new Press segment.

(2) the amounts refer to only a portion of total revenues from dual media offers (published both in Gazeta Wyborcza, as well as on GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl verticals and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website), which is allocated to the print edition of Gazeta; (3) the amounts refer to total revenues of the Free Press department, including revenues from Metro's display advertising, classifieds and inserts as well as from mTarget services and Metro's special activities; (4) segment operating costs associated with the production of the Group's own titles are settled on the basis of allocation of direct and indirect cost associated with their production from the Print segment; (5) including non-cash cost of share-based payments for 2013 in the amount of PLN 0.6 million; (6) the amounts include inter alia the production and promotional cost of gadgets offered with Gazeta Wyborcza and Agora's magazines; 7) the amount includes impairment losses of two monthlies published by Agora S.A.
Due to the cost of impairment losses on two monthlies published by the Magazines and Free Press division, which burdened the operating result of the Press segment in the fourth quarter of 2014 with the amount of PLN 15.1 million, the segment reported an operating results on the EBIT level in the amount of PLN 11.6 million and on the EBITDA level of PLN 21.6 million [1]. After eliminating the influence of the cost of impairment losses, the operating result of the segment on the EBIT level amounted to PLN 26.7 million and on the EBITDA level to PLN 36.7 million in 2014. The deterioration of the operating result of the Press segment is mainly connected with lower revenues from the advertising sales, which translated into a reduction of the segment's total revenue. The second negative factor affecting the segment's operating result was the yoy increase of operating cost [1].
1. REVENUE
In 2014, total revenues of the Press segment amounted to PLN 306.4 million (down by 8.6% yoy). This is mainly the effect of lower by 21.7% yoy advertising revenues of Gazeta Wyborcza. At the same time, it is worth emphasizing that the segment's total revenues were positively affected by 1.4% yoy increase in revenues from the copy sales, mainly due to the change in the publishing cycle of Wysokie Obcasy Extra and growing revenues from the copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza.
1.1. Copy sales 1.1.1. Copy sales and readership of Gazeta Wyborcza [4]
In 2014, Gazeta Wyborcza maintained its leading position among the opinion-forming dailies. Gazeta Wyborcza sold 192 thousand copies on average (down by 12.9% yoy). During this period, Gazeta's revenues from copy sales increased by 0.2% yoy, which was possible due to the increase in the cover price of Gazeta Wyborcza in January and in October 2014 and the positive effect of revenues from digital distribution of the daily. During the analysed period, the weekly readership of Gazeta Wyborcza (according to the CCS indicator) amounted to 8.8% (2.7 million readers), which placed it as the second daily among nationwide dailies. In 2014 the level of the segment's revenues was positively affected by the 25.8% yoy growth of sales of Gazeta Wyborcza magazines caused mainly by the change in the publishing cycle of Wysokie Obcasy Extra.
1.1.2. Copy sales of Agora's magazines
In 2014, copy sales of Agora's magazines decreased by 7.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 17.6 million. This is an effect of a lower average number of copies sold by Agora's monthlies, which amounted to 342.7 thousand copies (down by 32.4% yoy). It should also be remembered that these data are not fully comparable due to the change in the segment's publishing portfolio. In February 2013, Agora S.A. disposed of the right to publish the Poradnik Domowy magazine to Edipresse Polska S.A. and acquired from this company the right to publish the Dom &
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 20

Wntrze magazine. The average copy sales of Poradnik Domowy in the first quarter of 2013 amounted to 293.7 thousand, whereas in case of Dom & Wntrze ­ it amounted to 15.8 thousand copies.
1.2. Advertising sales [3] 1.2.1. Advertising sales of Gazety Wyborcza
In 2014, Gazeta's net advertising revenue (including display advertising, classifieds, inserts and other advertising services) amounted to PLN 112.9 million (down by 21.7% yoy). The above figures include a portion of revenues from dual-media advertising offers (published both in print as well as on GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl verticals and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website), which is allocated to the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza. In 2014, the ad spend in dailies in Poland decreased by over 16.0% yoy. During the analysed period, the decrease in revenues from display advertising in Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to approximately 16.0% and its estimated share in display ad spend in dailies remained flat yoy and amounted to 36.0%. The total share of Gazeta and Metro in display ad spend in dailies increased by over 1.0pp yoy. In 2014, Gazeta's share in the national newspapers ad spend amounted to over 43.5% and increased by 1.5pp yoy. During this period of time, Gazeta's share in Warsaw ad spend in newspapers decreased by ca 4.5pp yoy while the joint share of Gazeta and Metro remained flat yoy. At the same time, Gazeta's share in local dailies (excluding Warsaw) remained flat yoy and the joint share of Gazeta and Metro increased by over 0.5pp yoy. One should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discounting pressure on the part of the advertisers. Once the Company has more reliable market data, it may adjust the ad spending estimations in the consecutive reporting periods. In 2014, the share of ad pages in Gazeta's total pagecount amounted to ca 26.8% (down by ca 3.1pp yoy), while the average number of paid-for ad pages published daily in all local and national editions amounted to ca 95.
1.2.2. Advertising sales of Metro [3],[4]
In 2014, Metro's total ad revenues declined by 2.7% yoy, whereas the display advertising revenue increased by over 0.5% yoy. At the same time, the total display ad spend in all daily newspapers decreased by over 16.0% yoy. As a result Metro increased its share in advertising spending in all dailies by 1.0pp to over 6.0%. Metro's share in advertising spending in national dailies increased by almost 1.0pp yoy and by almost 1.0pp yoy in local dailies. Metro increased its share in Warsaw dailies by over 4.5pp yoy to 27.5%.
1.2.3. Advertising sales of Agora's magazines
In 2014, the advertising sales of the Agora's magazines decreased by 9.2% yoy and amounted to PLN 22.7 million. At the same time, advertisers limited their expenditure in the magazines by almost 13.0% yoy. Agora had 3.4% share in the total national magazines ad spend and 7.3% share in monthlies (based on rate card data) [7].
2. COST
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the segment's operating costs were burdened with the cost of impairment losses booked on two titles published by the Magazines and Free Press division, in the amount of PLN 15.1 million. As a result, the segment's operating costs increased by 6.7% yoy and amounted to PLN 294.8 million. After eliminating the effect of the impairment losses, the segment's operating cost amounted to PLN 279.7 million and its increase was insignificant. The main reason of this growth includes higher by 5.5% yoy staff cost related to the implementation of a new system of access to the digital content of Gazeta Wyborcza. At the same time, the cost of raw materials, energy, consumables and printing services were substantially decreased (down by 6.1% yoy) due to a reduction in the volume of Gazeta Wyborcza and Metro and a smaller number of special editions of monthlies published by Agora.

In 2014, the Movies and Books segment improved its operating results at both EBIT and EBITDA level [1]. EBITDA increased by 13.2% yoy and amounted to PLN 39.5 million. This was possible thanks to the higher yoy attendance in Helios cinemas which translated into higher (by 10.8% yoy) revenues from ticket sales and higher (by 16.1% yoy) revenues from concession sales.
In 2014, the segment's level of revenues and operating cost was also affected by film co-production (executed by the Special Projects division) and distribution (executed by Next Film Sp. z o.o.), related mainly to the Bogowie movie.

In 2014 the operating result of Special Projects division on the EBIT level was lower yoy by 1.2 million and amounted to PLN 0.6 million. [1]
1. REVENUE [3]
In 2014, the total sales of Movies and Books segment were higher by 12.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 282.9 million. This was possible thanks to the increase in all categories of revenues generated by the segment. A significant factor affecting the increase in the segment's revenues was the growing attendance in Helios cinemas, which amounted to 8.4 million visitors and was higher by 11.8% yoy. This translated into both higher revenues from the cinema ticket sales and higher revenues from concession sales. The higher increase of those revenues occurred in the first and fourth quarter of 2014. These values were also positively affected by the expansion of the Helios network with new cinemas in 2014. The segment noted also a growth of 7.2% yoy in advertising revenues. This growth resulted mainly from larger number of cinema theatres yoy and took place in majority of quarters in 2014. The segment's revenues were significantly influenced by film co-production and distribution executed within the segment. The revenues from this activity amounted to almost PLN 17.0 million in 2014. In 2014, Special Projects' revenues amounted to PLN 32.9 million and increased by 5.4% yoy. During the analysed period, Special Projects recorded also revenues from co-production of Bogowie. The revenues of Special Projects were also positively influenced by the organization of Olsztyn Green Festival in September 2014. In 2014, Agora's publishing house, part of the Special Projects division, published 69 books and issued a series of audiobooks entitled Mistrzowie Slowa 3. As a result, during the analysed period, it sold ca 0.7 million books and books with CDs and DVDs.
2. COST
In 2014, operating cost of the Movies and Books segment increased by 11.1% yoy and amounted to PLN 269.5 million. The growth in the segment's operating costs results from higher by 9.9% yoy operating cost of Special Projects, which amounted to PLN 32.3 million. Additional factors affecting the level of the segment's operating cost were higher yoy costs of film copy purchase which were in turn related to higher yoy revenues from the sales of cinema tickets in Helios network, as well as higher yoy cost of film distribution. The growth of other cost is mainly connected with the development of the Helios network.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2014, Helios expanded its network by three new cinema theatres: in Kalisz, Siedlce and Starachowice. At the same time, the network closed its cinema (Femina) in Warsaw. As a result, the Helios network has 34 theatres with 180 screens. In September 2014, the first edition of Olsztyn Green Festival, organized by Special Projects division operating within Movies and Books segment, took place. The event turned out to be a great success with more than 10 thousand visitors. Next Film, a company from Helios group, specialized in film distribution, introduced following films to Polish cinemas: Powstanie Warszawskie, Karuzela, Bogowie and Serce, serduszko. Agora was a co-producer of two latter titles. Bogowie directed by Lukasz Palkowski, which had its premiere in Poland on 10 October 2014, was the most popular film throughout 2014 and gathered approximately 2.2 million viewers in Polish cinemas.
In October 2014, the filming of Krol Zycia ended. The movie is directed by Jerzy Zielinski, a valued film operator who made his debut as a director. This is the first film production, where Agora is the leading producer. The leading role was played by Robert Wieckiewicz, accompanied by Magdalena Poplawska, Bartlomiej Topa, Jerzy Trela and Jan Peszek.

In 2014, thanks to the reduction of operating cost, the segment's operating result on the EBIT level increased to PLN 6.2 million, and the EBITDA increased to PLN 22.7 million.
1. REVENUE [8]
In 2014 the total amount of expenditure on outdoor advertising, according to IGRZ estimates, was almost flat yoy. The dynamics of revenues from the advertising sales in AMS slightly deviated from the dynamics of the entire market. The segment noted a decline in ad revenues by 0.9% yoy, which resulted mainly from a reduction in the number of billboards 12 m2. Estimated share of the AMS group in outdoor advertising expenditure amounted to almost 35.5% in 2014. [8]
2. COST
In 2014, the Outdoor segment decreased its operating cost by 4.1% yoy to PLN 143.6 million. This is the result of the consistent execution of the cost control and reduction policy in each of the quarters of 2014.
This was possible thanks to the reduction of system maintenance costs (down by 7.1% yoy) thanks to the effective optimization of the panel portfolio and decreasing rental rates for some types of panels.
The reduction in the segment's operating cost was also possible due to lower yoy promotion and marketing expense due to lower yoy costs of joint non-profit/commercial campaigns.
In 2014, the segment reported the growth of campaign execution cost as well as staff cost.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 25

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2014 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only The increase of the campaign execution cost by 1.7% yoy results from higher orders for poster printing services and higher revenues from advertising campaigns executed on public means of transport. The growth in staff cost is an effect of higher provision for motivation and bonus systems. Other factor contributing to the growth of the operating cost was a provision for severance payments to employees in connection with the group layoffs in the third quarter of 2014.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In the first quarter of 2014, the segment introduced new interactive panel in bus shelter. Due to the special application in a citylight placed in the bus shelter it is possible to combine the analog and the virtual world. In the second quarter of 2014, the segment began to install panels of Urban System of Paid Information with panels directing to the advertised points of interest in Warsaw. Advertisers can place their logo on the panel, information on the distance from the company's seat, a shop or mall. In the third quarter of 2014 AMS introduced in one of the campaigns executed in Wroclaw new functionality ­ the option to charge mobile phones in a bus shelter. In October 2014, the largest Polish investment in city furniture has begun. It comprises construction of 1 580 modern and elegant bus shelters. All shelters will be interactive ­ they will be equipped with the Near Field Communication technology and QR codes. Shelters will be also equipped with gateams.com, thanks to which passengers will be able to quickly enter the virtual world and e.g. plan the trip, read information about the city, or download free content.

1. REVENUE
In 2014, total revenues of the Internet segment increased by 14.1% yoy and reached the highest level in the segment's history at PLN 127.1 million.

In 2014 revenues from display ad sales amounted to PLN 99.6 million and grew by 11.9% yoy, with the market growth rate of display ad expenditure of almost 4.0%.

NOTES
[1] EBIT and EBITDA of Press, Internet, Movies and Books as well as Print segments are calculated on the basis of cost directly attributable to the appropriate operating segment of the Agora Group and excludes allocations of all Company's overheads (such as: cost of Agora's Management Board and a majority of cost of the Company`s supporting divisions), which are included in reconciling positions. [2] The data on ticket sales in the cinemas comprising Helios group come from the accounting data of Helios reported in accordance with full calendar periods.
[3] The data refer to advertising expenditures in six media (print, radio, TV, outdoor, Internet, cinema). In this MD&A Agora has corrected the numbers for TV and Internet advertising market in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the data for cinema advertising in the fourth quarter of 2013 and in the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, the value of the advertising expenditure in dailies and in magazines in the first, second and the third quarter of 2014 was corrected. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, print and radio advertising market data referred to herein are based on Agora's estimates adjusted for average discount rate and are stated in current prices. Given the discount pressure as well as advertising time and space sell-offs, these figures may not be fully reliable and will be adjusted in the consecutive reporting periods. In case of print, the data include only display advertising, excluding classifieds, inserts and obituaries. The estimates are based on rate card data obtained from the following sources: Kantar Media monitoring, Agora S.A. monitoring. Presented TV, Internet and cinema figures are based on Starlink media house estimates; TV estimates include regular ad broadcast and sponsoring with product placement, exclude teleshopping and other advertising forms. Internet ad spend estimates include display, search engines (Search Engine Marketing), e-mail marketing and video advertising. Outdoor advertising figures are based on Izba Gospodarcza Reklamy Zewnetrznej estimates [8]. The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on the average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media. [4] The data on the number of copies sold (total paid circulation) of daily newspapers is derived from the National Circulation Audit Office (ZKDP). The term "copy sales" used in this MD&A is consistent with the sales declarations of publishers to the National Circulation Audit Office. The data on dailies readership are based on PBC General, research carried out by MillwardBrown SMG/KRC on a random, nationwide sample of Poles over 15 years of age. The CCS index was used (weekly readership index) percentage of respondents reading at least one edition of the title within 7 days of the week preceding research. Size of the sample: nationwide PBC General for January-December 2014:N = 40,179.

12. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2014, advertisers spent over 2.5% yoy more on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in almost all advertising market segments. The erosion of advertising expenditure was observed only in press and cinema. It should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.
Seasonality of advertising spending The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's advertising revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year. Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarters.
Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting over half of the advertising market expenditure (almost 51.5%) in 2014. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 21.5% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted 8.0% and 4.0% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2014, 6.0% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted 7.5% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2015 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.

Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content and on February 4, 2014 the Company introduced system of metered paywall on websites related to Gazeta Wyborcza. Nowadays, it is hard to evaluate the impact of new access system on the Group's revenue. The Group also publishes a free daily ­ Metro. We cannot predict how the global changes occurring on the press market will influence the free press position and consequently, the position and the results of the Group.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive and influenced by consolidation processes. Number of internet users in Poland is not growing so fast as in the past. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged. Additionally, online advertising market is undergoing transformation. Search advertising, dominated in Poland by one player, is becoming more popular among advertisers. The Group's main source of Internet advertising revenue is display advertising. Video and mobile advertising are growing their share. Maintenance of the strong position in rapidly changing market requires investment in advanced technological solutions. Due to that fact there is no guarantee that the Group will be able to compete with national and foreign players with larger financial resources.
Outdoor
Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
In 2014, execution of the contract to construct of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw commenced. The investment process shall last 3 years. The estimated cost of the bus shelters' construction amounts to ca PLN 80 million. The duration of the contract is nearly 9 years.
The timely execution of the contract carries risk related to the necessity of acquiring a number of approvals and administration decisions. Additionally, in such a competitive and changing environment the macroeconomic and market assumptions necessary for the project success may not materialize.
Cinema
Helios group opens new cinemas in shopping and entertainment centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping and entertainment galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators.
Additionally, the available repertoire affects results of cinema business. Lack of interesting movies, abilities to promote movies or the quality of movies may negatively affect cinema admissions. Moreover, economic downturn
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 47

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2014 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
may translate into lower expenditure on entertainment which may result in lower revenues from ticket sales and willingness to buy food and beverages in cinema bars.
Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, in Internet.
Risks of running licensed business The Group has been running its activities in radio market for years and since 2014 it started to operate in TV market. Radio and TV operations are licensed activity in Poland. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted. There is a risk that demand, from radio and TV audience, for a certain radio or TV format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
Radio stations Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora Group's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
Television Due to the purchase of 41.04% stake in Stopklatka S.A. by Agora on March 12, 2014 r. the Group entered television market. Our television channel competes with existing television broadcasters and potential new market entrants. Among Stopklatka TV competitors there are larger broadcasters with better brand recognition and financial resources than us. The increasing success in Poland of DTH, cable and DTT providers will likely result in the increasing fragmentation of Polish TV viewing audiences, which may make it more difficult for us to persuade advertisers to purchase airtime in Stopklatka TV. The results of Stopklatka are consolidated on the equity basis.
Movie business Movie distribution and co-production is of project nature, which may result in volatitility of its results ­ it may also impact the Group's results. The majority of costs incurred, especially those related to movie co-production, burdens the Group results long before the profits related to that fields of operations. The impact of this activity on the Group's results depends also on the popularity of given film production.
Impairment tests Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.
Currency risk The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the production materials and services and IT services, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
Interest rate risk The changes in interest rates may influence the level of the Group's financial cost related to the Group's debt.

Risk of losing key employees The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
The risk of collective dispute On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., AMS S.A., Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o. and Grupa Radiowa Agory Sp. z o.o. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.
13. FACTORS AND UNUSUAL EVENTS WHICH HAD INFLUENCE ON THE RESULTS OF BUSINNESS ACTIVITIES FOR 2014 WITH THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR INFLUENCE
A positive impact on the Agora Group results had film distribution and co-production activities. This kind of activity is of project nature, which may result in volatitility of its results Total revenues from the film distribution and coproduction generated in 2014 PLN amounted to ca 17.0 million revenues (in 2013: PLN 12.7 million). Further limitation of ad expenditure in press in 2014 had a negative impact on the Group's results. As a result the ad revenues of Press segment decreased by PLN 30.2 million yoy. The cost of impairment losses in two monthlies published by Press segment in the amount of PLN 15.1 million had a negative impact on the Group's results in 2014. On the other hand, a positive impact (of PLN 8.0 million) on the Group's net result in 2014 had the contribution in kind and leaseback of advertising panels, executed as optimization measures aimed at improvement of operating efficiency of the AMS group companies and the remeasurement of the put option liabilities granted to noncontrolling shareholders (PLN 3.6 million).
14. LEGAL ACTIONS CONCERNING LIABILITIES OR DEBTS OF THE ISSUER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH AMOUNT IN SINGLE OR IN TOTAL TO AT LEAST 10% OF THE AGORA'S SHARE CAPITAL
In 2014, there were no legal actions against Agora S.A. or its subsidiaries related to their liabilities or debts whose total value would amount to at least 10% of Agora's share capital in a single or in all legal proceedings.
15. DIVISIONS OF THE COMPANY AND OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
Agora S.A. has 19 divisions and the major headquarters in Warsaw. Other companies from the Group do not have local divisions.
16. THE MANAGEMENT BOARD'S STATEMENT OF THE REALIZATION OF FORECASTS
The Management Board did not publish any forecasts of the Group's financial results and because of that this report does not present any Management Board's statement of the realization of them, as well as any differences between actual and forecasted financial results.
17. ISSUING OF SECURITIES
In 2014 the Company did not issue any securities.

These activities constitute a part of segments' or brands' development within the Agora Group. The most important information regarding these projects can be found on the Company's website. Actions undertaken by Agora's media are of serial or ad hoc nature as an answer to a specific social problem or event.

II. BEST PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT BOARDS OF LISTED COMPANIES
According to the corporate governance rules of the companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Company operates its corporate website in Polish and English. Apart from legally required information Agora's corporate website offers basic corporate documents as its Statutes and by-laws of its governing and supervising bodies. Additionally, the website presents the professional biographies of the members of the Management and Supervisory Board. According to the requirements, the Company publishes on its website financial statements and regulatory filings as well as information on the participation of women and men in Company's governing bodies. Additionally, to facilitate the analyses of the financial information, the Company provides presentations with the quarterly financial reports and audio recordings from the teleconferences during which members of the Management Board discussed the Group's financial results in a given period of time.

In case of questions from shareholders and answers to those questions during the general meeting of shareholders they are available for everyone due to the fact that the Company records the meetings of shareholders. Additionally, the Company prepares the list of questions and answers relating to a given meeting of shareholders if they appear before and during meeting of shareholders.

Here, one can also find the documents relating to the dividend, for example the Management Board recommendation on profit distribution, draft resolutions and final resolutions.

III. BEST PRACTICE FOR SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
The Supervisory Board of Agora S.A. complies with all the requirements of the corporate governance rules.
As part of its duties the Supervisory Board prepares the concise evaluation of the Company together with the evaluation of internal control system and risk management system. This evaluation is published on the corporate website together with all the documents relating to general meeting of shareholders.
Additionally, the Supervisory Board examines and gives its opinion on all issues being the subject of the general meeting of shareholders. The representatives of the Supervisory Board participate in the general meeting in the composition enabling them answering possible questions voiced by shareholders.
