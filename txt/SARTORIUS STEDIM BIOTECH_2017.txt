Chairman's Message

Dear Shareholders,
For Sartorius Stedim Biotech, 2017 was a year of solid growth in revenue and profit. Yet, in comparison with the two exceptionally strong years of 2015 and 2016 and with our own initial expections, the markets turned out to be more challenging than we had assumed at the outset of the year.
We closed 2017 with an increase in sales revenue by around 4.1% to 1,081.0 million, thus surpassing the one-billion -euro threshold for the first time. Operating profit rose 2.2% to 294.9 million and was influenced by unfavorable currency effects; the corresponding margin stood at 27.3%. Underlying earnings per share were up to 1.96.
Therefore, the Board of Directors will submit a proposal to the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting to raise dividends by 9.5% to 0.46 per share. After the price of our shares had nearly quadrupled over the past five years, development was volatile during 2017 and, regarding the full year, was rather flat, with a gain of just 0.5%.
Besides the high, comparative revenue base mentioned above, we experienced a couple of effects that temporarily muted growth, especially in the third quarter, such as destocking by some customers and transient manufacturing and supply bottlenecks that weighed particularly on the Americas region and also partially on Europe. However, these effects were all of a temporary nature, and our strong finish to the year with double-digit order growth underlines this assessment. Also important to mention was that development in Asia was not impacted by these abovementioned effects, and this region continued to show strong double-digit growth, fueled by large equipment projects throughout the entire year 2017.
Fiscal 2017 was also characterized by further operational achievements.

We significantly progressed in our multi-year investment program, which provides for almost doubling the manufacturing capacity of single-use bags and filters at our plant in Puerto Rico, creating additional membrane casting capacity at our Göttingen site in Germany, and preparing for extension of our aseptic bag site in Aubagne, France, and our cell line development site near Ulm, Germany.
Further expansion of our portfolio has also continued to be a key item on our agenda. We are highly satisfied with how well our acquired businesses have been developing and performing under the Sartorius Stedim Biotech umbrella. Besides growing on their own, they typically also generate promising growth synergies for our existing product portfolio.
In 2017, we were able to acquire the Sweden-based software company Umetrics. This company is a highly specialized, globally leading provider of data analytics software for modeling and optimizing biopharma development and manufacturing processes. Though a relatively small addition in size, it is a perfect match for our existing portfolio and comes at a time when our customers are looking for tools to better monitor, automate and predict their biomanufacturing processes. While market uptake of such new tools may be slow due to the regulated nature of our market, we have registered high interest among our customers and look forward to contributing to their digital agendas.
Moving forward, we expect continued profitable growth, and adhere to our 2020 mid-term plan of achieving sales revenue of around 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion with an underlying EBITDA margin of about 29% to 30% by the end of this period.
Specifically, for 2018, we are aiming to increase our sales revenue by about 7% to 10% and our operating profit margin by approximately 0.5 percentage points, with both figures stated in constant currencies. Because of recent currency developments, especially

regarding the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, this expected profitability figure may differ from our present constant currency guidance and need to be reviewed as the current year progresses..
In line with our mid-term plans, for 2018 our investments in global infrastructure and manufacturing capacities will continue at above-average levels, and are projected at a capex ratio in the range of 15%.
Strategically, our primary focus will remain on the biopharma market. We expect that biotech will continue to grow faster than the global pharma market, remaining the innovation engine of this industry. Cell-based medicines are advancing at an astonishing pace, with partial developments including completely new platforms, e.g., in regenerative cell technologies and personalized treatments.
Cost-effective bioprocessing technologies will become even more essential as parts of the biopharma market mature and biosimilars make further inroads, increasing the volumes of biopharmaceuticals being manufactured. In this context, we anticipate that the adoption of single-use systems will continue, encompassing a growing number of steps in our customers' value chain, and that these systems will progressively move from pre-commercial manufacture to commercial scale.
Regionally, we will further strive to gain market share in the Americas, especially the U.S., the largest, still most innovative biopharma market and a region in which we have been historically underrepresented. Meanwhile, we have been generating around 34% of our sales in this region compared with 27% five years back.

Further, we assume that the biopharma market will become increasingly differentiated and also more competititve in some segments, offering additional opportunities for well-positioned suppliers. Our customers are looking for partners that help them develop innovative medicines faster and more effectively while maintaining R&D and production costs under control and thus ultimately making medical drugs more affordable. Sartorius Stedim Biotech is a prime vendor for this market and will continue to come up with further innovative products and services, constantly enriching its portfolio through acquisitions, alliances and its own R&D. At the same time, we will also make additional investments in our processes and systems to make doing business with us as convenient and easy as possible.
Particularly in view of some of the challenges over the past months, I would like to sincerely thank our worldwide teams for their dedication and fighting spirit that were key to making 2017 yet another successful year for Sartorius Stedim Biotech.
I also appreciate the continued trust of our customers, partners and shareholders, and cordially invite you to continue with us on the road to further achievements.
Sincerely,
Joachim Kreuzburg Chairman of the Board and CEO

Dividends
Sartorius Stedim Biotech strives to enable its shareholders to participate adequately in the company's success and has continuously increased its dividend in recent years. In line with this objective, we basically follow the policy of paying out a relatively stable share of relevant net profit to our shareholders.
Relevant net profit
The Board of Directors will submit a proposal to the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting on April 3, 2018, to pay a dividend from the net profit of 180.4 million for fiscal 2017 of 0.46 per share compared to previous year's figure of 0.42. The total profit distributed would increase by 9.5% from 38.7 million a year ago to 42.4 million. The corresponding dividend payout ratio would be 23.5% compared to 21.9% in the previous year. In relation to the shares' closing price of 60.29 on December 31, 2017, the dividend yield would be 0.8% (previous year: 0.7%).

Financial Controlling and Key Performance Indicators
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is managed using a number of key performance indicators, which are also decisive for determination of the variable remuneration component for the Executive Committee and managers.
The key management parameter that Sartorius Stedim Biotech uses to measure the development of its size is currency-adjusted growth of sales revenue.
The key performance measure for profitability is EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items, i.e. underlying EBITDA, and the corresponding margin. For a definition of this term and more information on its presentation, see the Glossary on page 236.
Regarding the debt capacity of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, a further key indicator is the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA for the last twelve months.
Moreover, the capex ratio, i.e. capital expenditures relative to sales revenue, represents a key control parameter.
The following financial and non-financial indicators are also reported on a regular basis:
­ Order intake ­ Underlying net profit | Earnings per share ­ Net profit | Earnings per share ­ Equity ratio ­ Net working capital ­ Net cash flow from operating activities ­ Number of employees
The annual financial forecast published at the beginning of a fiscal year for the Group generally refers to the development of sales revenue and of underlying EBITDA margin. The expected capex ratio, as well as a directional forecast for the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, is also indicated for the Group.

20 To Our Shareholders Strategy and Goals

Strategy and Goals
Sartorius Stedim Biotech is a leading international supplier of products and services for the safe and efficient biologic manufacture of medications and vaccines.
A part of our total solutions provider strategy, we have created a broad product and technology portfolio, from both our own developments and acquisitions, for our biopharma customers. This portfolio covers virtually all steps of their production processes and includes, inter alia, cell culture media, cell lines, bioreactors, a wide range of products for separation, purification and concentration, as well as solutions for storage and transportation of intermediate and final biologic products.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech generates around threequarters of its sales revenue with single-use products. Due to their cost advantages and higher flexibility compared with reusable technologies, such single-use products are increasingly being used by the pharmaceutical industry. Sartorius Stedim Biotech offers the most extensive portfolio of single-use technologies in the industry.

Through the acquisition of Umetrics, Sartorius is now a globally leading specialist in data analytics software for modeling and optimizing biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing processes.
With its global, specialized sales force, Sartorius Stedim Biotech addresses an attractive market with above-average growth rates. As our customers' manufacturing processes are validated by the respective health authorities, product quality and assurance of supply are essential. We see the leading international market positions of this division as good stepping stones for sustained dynamic and profitable growth in the future. Beyond realizing our organic growth potential coupled with a continuous increase in profitability, we also aim to further expand the division's portfolio through complementary acquisitions and alliances.

Sartorius Stedim Biotech 2020 Strategy
In the spring of 2018, Sartorius Stedim Biotech plans to announce its new mid-term targets for its business development up to 2025. According to its strategy defined in 2011 and updated in 2016, along with its targets to achieve profitable growth by 2020, its projected target of about 1.5 - 1.6 billion in sales revenue is to be reached predominantly by organic growth; i.e., through its currently existing portfolio, and supplemented by acquisitions.
In view of its profitability margin related to underlying EBITDA, the company aims to achieve about 29% to 30% for 2020. This is assuming that the profitability of any future acquisitions would be at a level comparable to that of the existing business and that no significant changes in key exchange rates would occur.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech's 2020 targets are being implemented by various growth initiatives with the following areas of focus:
Regional Growth Initiatives
Regionally, North America and selected countries in Asia are at the focus of our growth strategy.
North America is the world's largest market for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. As this market is home to our main competitors, we historically had lower market share in this region than in Europe and Asia. Accordingly, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is striving to further gain market share, primarily by strengthening its sales and service capacities.
Our second regional focus is on Asia, especially on China, South Korea and India. These markets have tremendous potential due to their expanding healthcare systems and increased spending by private households. Moreover, major production facilities for biosimilars are being set up in these countries, and contract manufacturers are strengthening their presence in this region. To participate in this momentum in the best possible way, we have already invested substantially in our sales infrastructure in this region.

Expansion of Product Portfolio
Regarding the further development of our portfolio, the 2020 strategy also provides for making acquisitions for the Group. Such acquisitions will be primarily focused on adding complementary technologies and products that enhance the attractiveness of the company's portfolio even more from a customer perspective.
Infrastructure
The foundation for future profitable growth is constituted by efficient business processes, a powerful IT infrastructure and sufficient production capacities. Based on standardized business processes worldwide, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is investing continuously in the digitalization of its processes. Moreover, the company is considerably extending its production capacities at various locations, especially for filter and bag products. For further information, refer to page 28.

22 To Our Shareholders Sector Conditions

Sector Conditions
Sartorius Stedim Biotech serves customers mainly in the biopharmaceutical industry, which makes its business particularly sensitive to the development of this industry.
Continued Growth in the World's Pharmaceutical Markets
According to estimates from several market observers, the global pharmaceutical showed positive development once again in 2017, with growth of approximately 4% to 5%. The market was fueled by better access to health services in emerging markets and rising median ages in industrial countries, which led to an increasing demand for medications. By contrast, growth of the pharmaceutical market was dampened by government initiatives directed at reducing health spending, as well as expiring patents for high-margin pharmaceutical products.
All the regions contributed to sector growth in the year under review. The United States continues to represent the largest single market, followed by China, Japan and Germany. The strongest growth, though with a slower tempo, took place as in previous years in the "pharmerging markets", which include China, India, Brazil and Russia, among others. Performance of the European pharmaceutical market was impacted by increased efforts to control costs in the health sector. In the United States, expiring patents and tough competition among pharmaceutical manufacturers led to a moderate slowdown in market growth. Rising expenditures for newly launched medications had a positive impact.
Above-Average Growth in the Biotechnology Market
Given the company's highly specialized product portfolio, the trend in the biopharmaceutical market is especially relevant for Sartorius. The market for medications and vaccines manufactured using biotech methods has grown overproportionately within the pharmaceutical market for many years now. In 2017, the biopharmaceutical market was estimated at a volume of 214 billion, an increase of approximately 6% over the previous year. Overall, the proportion of sales revenue of the world's pharmaceutical market from medications manufactured using biotech methods rose from around 25% to approximately 26%.

This overproportionate growth is especially attributable to the launch of new biopharmaceutical drugs as well as additional market penetration by existing medicines, in part through expanded indications. A growing number of active substances manufactured using biotech production methods are being approved for the treatment of rare diseases that have been untreatable thus far. Development activities in the pharmaceutical industry also reflect the steadily growing significance and rising acceptance of biopharmaceutical substances. For example, biopharmaceutical compounds account for more than 40% of the R&D pipeline.
In spite of market prospects that continue to be very positive, several large biopharmaceutical manufacturers reduced their inventories during the reporting year. The supply industry thus charted temporarily more subdued demand in North America and parts of Europe following several dynamic years.

To Our Shareholders Sector Conditions 23

Biosimilars, which are biological copycat medications, continued to play only a minor role in the growth of the biotechnology market in 2017. However, the market still advanced in the reporting year as new biosimilars were approved and launched on the market. At the time of this report, nine such drugs had already been approved in the United States and 36 in the European Union. China has currently approved 96 biosimilars and India 66. The biosimilars market is expected to see continual growth throughout the coming years due to expiration of the patents for a number of high-margin biopharmaceuticals. In addition, the regulatory, patent law-related and marketing hurdles that have hindered faster market penetration of biosimilars to date are likely to decrease step by step.
Single-Use Systems for Biopharmaceutical Production Continue to Gain Importance
Biotech production methods are much more complex and cost-intensive than traditional methods for producing medications. Consequently, manufacturers and suppliers are continuously looking to develop more efficient technologies. Single-use products play a decisive role in this effort: They require significantly less capital expenditure, reduce costs for cleaning and validation and minimize downtime. They also offer greater flexibility in production and help accelerate time to market.
These advantages have already led to single-use technologies becoming an established part of many process steps. Single-use systems are primarily employed in pre-commercial development activities and production phases and in small batch manufacturing. It can be expected that single-use technologies will be increasingly used for the production of high-volume commercial quantities. This is particularly relevant to the production of biotech substances, which are clinically developed in singleuse systems.

Moderate Growth in the Global Laboratory Market
The global laboratory market grew by approximately 2.8% in the reporting year according to Frost & Sullivan. Europe reported higher growth of 1.9% yearon-year thanks to the increased rate of economic growth. The United States, the largest market for laboratory products, registered growth of 3.2%. On the demand side, uncertainty regarding both planned legislation and the trend in government spending for academic and public research activities led to weak demand in the first quarter of 2017 in particular. These factors became increasingly less significant as the year progressed, however, resulting in a positive overall trend for the entire year ­ especially due to strong demand from the biopharmaceutical industry.
Significant growth was once again reported in Asian countries such as China and India, in which the laboratory market saw above-average expansion of 7.6% (China) and 8.6% (India).
Competition
The primary means by which companies in the biotechnology market differentiate themselves from competitors are innovative process and the quality and performance of their products. The biotechnology sector is constantly discovering new areas of application and expects suppliers to be equally fastmoving and creative in developing new equipment for the manufacture of biotech products. New suppliers, in particular, seek to exploit the opportunities inherent in this environment to gain a foothold in the market with carefully targeted niche products. The more established suppliers, meanwhile, are expanding their product range continuously.
We generate around 90% of our sales revenue from validated processes in which replacing products during the production cycle is very expensive, so we receive a high proportion of follow-up and repeat business. The particular strength of Sartorius Stedim Biotech lies in its integrated process solutions: we offer the broadest range in the industry, from research and development of substances in the lab to the production of the final product. Our strategic focus on single-use products gives us a further edge over the competition. Sartorius Stedim Biotech occupies a strong position in the market worldwide in the fields of bioprocess filtration, fermentation, cell cultivation, fluid management and membrane chromatography.

24 To Our Shareholders Sector Conditions
Most of our competitors are multinationals based in the USA. Merck KGaA, Danaher Corp., General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. are among our main rivals in the process area; Thermo Fisher and Merck are key players in the laboratory field. We also face competition from smaller companies in individual segments.

Group Business Development

Sales Revenue and Order Intake
After two years of exceptionally strong growth in 2015 and 2016, Sartorius Stedim Biotech showed sales growth in constant currencies of 4.1% to 1,081.0 million in the reporting year. Therefore, revenue was slightly lower than originally expected, but at the level of the sales forecast adjusted for the third quarter (adjusted forecast: about 4% in constant currencies; initial forecast: about 8% to 12% in constant currencies). In fiscal 2017, the Group's development was impacted by a few simultaneous, temporary effects. For the year under review, Sartorius Stedim Biotech thus reported a relatively soft sales development in North America and in parts of Europe, which was caused by inventory destocking by various customers. Moreover, no deliveries were meanwhile possible from the company's production facility in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria, and ongoing bottlenecks in a partner's delivery capacity that lasted longer than expected impacted business performance of cell culture media. The consolidation of the acquisitions of kSep and Umetrics contributed around 1 percentage points in the reporting year to sales growth.
Order intake developed positively in the reporting period, considerably outperforming sales. Orders increased 8.8% in constant currencies to 1.162,3 million. On a reported basis, this gain was 7.5%.

The Group's sales development was quite different in the regions. EMEA, the region generating the highest revenue for the company and representing around 43% of its total sales, recorded a gain of 2.2% to 460.7 million. In the Americas region, which represented around 34% of revenue, sales decreased slightly by 3.5% to 368.8 million due to the temporary effects already mentioned above. The Asia | Pacific region, which accounted for around 23% of the Group's sales, performed very dynamically. Partly driven by equipment shipments to fill relatively large orders, sales for this region rose significantly by 21.4% to 251.6 million.

26 To Our Shareholders Group Business Development

Development of Costs and Earnings
In the reporting year, the cost of sales stood at 526.2 million. In comparison with sales revenue growth of 2.8%, the cost of sales increased underproportionately by 0.3%, which was due to product mix effects and economies of scale. The cost of sales ratio was 48.7% relative to 49.9% a year ago.
Selling and distribution costs rose by 4.6% to 195.2 million. The ratio of selling and distribution costs to sales revenue increased from 17.7% in the previous year to 18.1%.
Expenses for research and development rose overproportionately relative to sales year over year by 11.9% to 53.2 million. The ratio of R&D expenses to sales revenue was 4.9%, slightly above the prior-year level of 4.5%.
Concerning general administrative expenses, Sartorius Stedim Biotech reported a 9.2% increase to 61.7 million, which can be primarily attributed to the expansion of the IT functional area. In relation to sales revenue, general administrative expenses rose from 5.4% in the previous year to 5.7% in the reporting year.
In fiscal 2017, the balance of other operating income and expenses was - 23.0 million relative to - 10.3 million a year earlier. This year-on-year change was driven amongst others by extraordinary items that totaled - 22.6 million in the reporting year (2016: - 18.1 million). These items were essentially incurred due to various corporate projects, expenses related to the most recent acquisitions and to the consequences of Hurricane Maria.
In the year under review, the Group's EBIT edged down slightly by 1.9% to 221.7 million, amongst others due to higher PPA amortization in connection with the recent acquisitions. The Group's EBIT margin was 20.5% because of higher depreciation as well as extraordinary items (2016: 21.5%).

The financial result improved significantly to - 1.1 million from - 12.9 million in 2016. This was essentially attributable to positive valuation effects from hedging transactions.

Income taxes totaled 56.8 million (2016: 57.1 million). The company's tax rate was 25.8% after 26.8% in the year before.

In the reporting year, net profit attributable to shareholders of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. was 161.1 million relative to 153.7 million a year earlier.

Earnings

At the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are used as the key profitability measure. To provide a complete and transparent picture of the Group's profitability, also in an international comparison, we report earnings adjusted for extraordinary items (underlying EBITDA). For more information about definitions, please refer to the Glossary on page 236. The underlying presentation is reconciled with the EBITDA key indicator (see Glossary) as follows:

The underlying net result after non-controlling interest for the Group surged from 176.6 million a year ago to 180.4 million in fiscal 2017. This figure is the basis for calculating the profit to be appropriated and is calculated by adjusting for extraordinary items, eliminating non-cash amortization of 16.6 million (previous year: 14.3 million), and is based on the normalized financial result (see Glossary), as well as the corresponding tax effects for each of these items. Underlying earnings per share surged by 2.2% from 1.92 a year earlier to 1.96.

In the reporting year, Sartorius Stedim Biotech yet again slightly increased its underlying EBITDA, which rose by 2.2% from 288.7 million to 294.9 million. The Group's respective margin decreased from 27.5% to 27.3%, slightly below our forecast adjusted for the third quarter (adjusted forecast: about 27.5% in actual currencies; initial forecast: about +0.5 percentage points compared to 2016 in constant currencies).

Research and Development
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group's research and development (R&D) activities encompass both new and advanced in-house product developments in our own core technologies as well as the integration of new products through alliances and acquisitions. Sartorius aims to help customers continually optimize their processes and steadily increase their efficiency.
Development activities at Sartorius focus in particular on the following technology areas: membranes, which are the core component of all types of filter products; various base technologies such as single-use containers and sensors; and control technologies, for instance for fermentation.
During the reporting year, one focus of the R&D activities was the development of a new software platform for the control of individual process steps. It enables the generation of consistent data in real time for optimized monitoring and control of both upstream and downstream processes from laboratory scale all the way to commercial production.
Another key task is ongoing integration of the software portfolio acquired in the takeover of Umetrics. Even prior to the acquisition, Sartorius had already spent several years working with Umetrics data analysis specialists for the purpose of modeling and optimizing biopharmaceutical development and production processes. Additional data-based software analysis tools are planned for the future to enable customers to work more efficiently and costeffectively.
From a regional perspective, the largest R&D site is located at our headquarters in Goettingen, with other key R&D activities taking place in Aubagne (France) Guxhagen (Germany) and Bangalore (India) as well as Bohemia (U.S.), Royston (UK) and Umea (Sweden).
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group stepped up its research and development activities in the reporting year, increasing spending in this area by 11.9% to 53.2 million (previous year: 47.5 million). The ratio of R&D costs to sales revenue slightly increased to 4.9% compared to 4.5% a year earlier.

IFRS require that certain development costs be capitalized on the balance sheet and then amortized over subsequent years. In the reporting year, these development investments amounted to 20.8 million compared to 14.6 million the year before. This amounts to a share of 28.1% (2016: 23.5%) of the Group's total R&D expenses. Regular depreciation related to capitalized development costs amounted to 4.7 million during the reporting period (2016: 5.3 million). These expenses are disclosed in the cost of sales.

To Our Shareholders Group Business Development 29

To protect our know-how, we pursue a targeted intellectual and industrial property rights policy. We systematically monitor compliance with these rights and review from a cost | benefit viewpoint whether it is necessary to continue to maintain individual rights.
The number of applications for intellectual property rights filed in 2017 amounted to 135 compared to 107 in the previous year. As a result of the applications submitted in the past years, we were issued 197 patents and trademarks (previous year: 188). As of the balance sheet date, we had a total of 2,073 patents and trademarks in our portfolio (previous year: 1,901).

Capital Expenditures
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group increased capital expenditures considerably from 80.2 million in 2016 to 136.7 million in the reporting year. The ratio of capital expenditures to sales revenue was 12.6% (previous year: 7.6%), reaching the upper end of our forecast.
Owing to its strong organic growth, the company made significant investments during the reporting year in its production capacities. For instance, we build significant additional capacity for filters and bags at our facility in Yauco.

Net Worth and Financial Position

Cash Flow
The net cash flow from operating activities of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group increased from 156.7 million to 174.7 million in the reporting period. This represents a gain of 11.5% which was primarily driven by lower tax payments compared to the previous year.

On a whole, net cash outflow from investing activities and acquisitions thus amounted to 194.9 million compared with 102.7 million in 2016.

Net cash flow from financing activities of 16.6 million essentially reflects financing of above mentioned acquisitions. Moreover, it contains the payment of dividends for fiscal 2016 paid in April 2017 of 39.4 million.

Net cash outflows from investing activities increased by 59.1% to 126.8 million. This increase mainly reflects investments for the expansion of our Yauco plant for single-use bags and filters as well as additional membrane casting capacities at the Göttingen site. Thus, the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group financed its operational investments entirely from operating cash flows. The ratio of capital expenditures relative to sales in 2017 was 12.6% (previous year: 7.6%).
Cash outflows of 68.1 million related to acquisitions in the reporting period were attributable to the purchase of Umetrics. Prior-year figure of - 23.0 million reflected the acquisitions of kSep.

Consolidated Balance Sheet
The balance sheet total of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group increased by 208.1 million to 1,403.9 million between year-end 2016 and the reporting date on December 31, 2017.
Non-current assets rose from 764.1 million in 2016 to 913.0 million in 2016, primarily due to investments in our production capacities.
Current assets amounted to 490.8 million compared to 431.7 million in the prior year. This increase was mainly driven by the aforementioned buildup in working capital.

32 To Our Shareholders Net Worth and Financial Position

Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA Regarding the debt financing potential of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA represents a key management indicator. This ratio further improved from 0.2 to 0.4 for the year ended December 31, 2017, in line with our expectations.
Financing | Treasury The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is financed on a long-term, well-diversified basis, which covers both its short-term cash requirements and its long-term strategy. In December 2014 Sartorius AG has entered into a syndicated revolving credit line agreement of 400 million with a maturity that was extended until December 2021. Since then, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is utilizing a credit line with a volume of up to 300 million provided by Sartorius AG. Furthermore, the Group has a long-term loan agreement with the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) for a current volume of 9.4 million relating to investments in production capacities and diverse bilateral credit lines of approximately 41 million in total.

The above mentioned financing comprises instruments with both fixed and variable interest. Financing facilities with variable interest rates are partly hedged against an increase in the general interest rate level.
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group conducts business across the globe and thus is affected by currency fluctuations. For the Group, the U.S. dollar represents the most important foreign currency as well as several others such as the South Korean won, the Chinese renminbi, the Swiss franc and the British pound. Our global manufacturing network with production facilities outside Germany and France -- in North America, the U.K., Switzerland and India -- enables us to compensate for the majority of currency fluctuations (natural hedging).
We generally hedge the remaining net currency exposure by around two-thirds for a period of up to approximately 1.5 years ahead through suitable currency transactions.
Product and Sales
The product portfolio of Sartorius Stedim Biotech covers virtually all steps in biopharmaceutical production process, and increasingly preceeding process development as well. The portfolio includes cell cultivation media, cell lines, bioreactors, a wide range of products for separation, purification and concentration, and systems for the storage and transport of intermediate and finished products. We also offer an extensive range of services to support our customers in complying with regulatory requirements.
Well-Developed Portfolio Supports Customers
Sartorius Stedim Biotech expanded its portfolio in the reporting year via product upgrades and new generations of existing product lines as well as through the acquisition of Umetrics.
Furthermore, Umetrics provides software solutions that enable biopharmaceutical customers to increase efficiency as well as assisting them in digitalizing their processes, especially during scale-up.

To Our Shareholders Net Worth and Financial Position 33

In the product area, Sartorius Stedim Biotech presented the second generation of its BIOSTAT STR single-use bioreactor series in the year under review. The second generation is designed for the new singleuse bags and can handle a working volume of 12.5 to 2,000 liters. The scalable series saves customers a significant amount of time in developing production processes.
In addition, a newly developed single-use system offers users an innovative, comprehensive solution for the filtration of biopharmaceutical media on a large scale. The new system makes filtration processes even easier and less time consuming.
The area of membrane chromatography was expanded as well. Now also available as cassettes, membrane adsorbers can be combined on a large scale to form a production system for the purification of biopharmaceutical media, thus eliminating the previous limitations inherent in the smaller sizes.
Sales Activities Expanded
Sartorius Stedim Biotech markets its product portfolio directly through its own field sales representatives. Sales activities for key accounts are coordinated and supported by global key account management. As part of our regional initiatives for implementing our midterm strategy, we stepped up our sales activities in North America during the year under review.

Production and Supply Chain Management
Sartorius Stedim Biotech operates a well developed global production network with plants in Europe, North America and Asia. The largest production sites are located in Germany, France and Puerto Rico. Moreover, Sartorius Stedim Biotech has manufacturing operations in the UK, Switzerland, Tunisia, India and the USA.
Expansion of Production Capacity
Against the backdrop of the dynamic growth of the bioprocess business in recent years, Sartorius Stedim Biotech increased and accelerated the expansion of its production capacities compared to its initial plans. Membrane production in Goettingen was further expanded.
In September, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. Thanks to the Yauco site's high construction standards, both existing buildings and those under construction suffered only minor damage. Heavy infrastructure damage made deliveries from the plant impossible for around four weeks, however. Even so, Sartorius Stedim Biotech considers the Yauco location to be highly suitable. In the future, however, production will focus more strongly on standard products that can be stored on the U.S. mainland to reduce possible future disruptions in the supply chain.

34 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Sustainability Report
Sustainability is one of the core values that are firmly embedded in Sartorius Stedim Biotech's corporate culture. Ever since the company was established, the sustainable development of the company has been its major objective.
As a leading international partner of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, we help accelerate development and production processes in pharma companies. Our commitment is to enable medications and vaccines to be produced safely and economically. We are dedicated to propelling scientific progress by identifying, combining and further developing new trends. Doing this sustainably, we believe, means taking a broad-based, long-term view of our business that includes social and ecological considerations and preserves the rights and interests of our stakeholders.
In line with this approach, we consider it essential to comply with legal and ethical standards, manufacture with ecological responsibility, and keep the environmental impacts in mind when developing product innovations. Likewise, our HR policy is aimed at preserving the rights and interests of employees, and we support our staff in their further professional development. At the company sites around the world, we as employers and contractors take an active part in developing the regional environments.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech has made sustainability a responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer in recognition of its overarching importance for the company.
Our indicators for social, health and safety, environmental and raw material data have been defined to cover most of the impacts of the Group's activities. Since 2012, Sartorius Stedim Biotech has been reporting social, environmental and societal information and metrics in compliance with the French Grenelle II environmental law. Internally, the figures enable the impact of our business activities on stakeholders, the environment and society to be assessed.

Methodological Note
The Sustainability Report is published annually as part of the Group's Reference Document. The reporting period is the fiscal year. If not indicated otherwise, the indicators reported below for HR and health and safety refer to the entire Group, excluding the latest acquisition of Umetrics with 36 employees who are included only in the indicator "total headcount" and the subindicators "headcount by region" and "headcount by function". The environmental indicators cover all our production sites in Aubagne, Bangalore, Beijing, Glasgow, Göttingen, Guxhagen, Laupheim, Lourdes, Mohamdia, Royston, Stonehouse, Tagelswangen and Yauco, representing 81.8% of the Group's total workforce.
To facilitate company-wide data collection, analysis and reporting of CSR KPIs, Sartorius Stedim Biotech introduced a web-based solution in 2016. The software fulfills audit requirements in terms of security and verifiability of information transfer and processing. In addition, HR data is monitored using SAP. Most of the required data is reported monthly or quarterly; it is reviewed and consolidated by the HR and Facility Management units at the largest Group site in Göttingen.

Sustainable Corporate Management
Our activities are based on our corporate values: sustainability, openness and enjoyment. These values govern how we interact daily inside our company and connect us outside ­ with our customers, investors and society at large. In addition, they guide us in the definition of our strategies and their implementation.
Open Dialogue with Stakeholders
As a fair and responsibly acting company, Sartorius Stedim Biotech continuously maintains an open and constructive dialogue with various stakeholders and considers sustainability aspects that are important to these groups, both now and in the future. With respect to sustainability, we view our customers, employees, investors and society as our most important stakeholders. Beyond these, suppliers and business partners have a stake in the sustainable and prosperous development of our company. We use the opportunity afforded by our close relationships with our stakeholder groups, some of which have been maintained for years, to also discuss the standards that apply to sustainable corporate management.
Customers
Our objective is to offer our customers attractive products and solutions. As we market our portfolio directly through our own field sales representatives, we are in very close contact with our customers. Also, we are continuously informed about their current requirements and priorities through audits, product demonstrations and tests that we perform in our application laboratories. Beyond such requirements, our sustainable products help our customers reach their own sustainability goals.
Employees
Capable, motivated and efficient staff members are indispensable in ensuring our business success. Regional and Group-wide employee surveys, annual performance reviews and an open working atmosphere help us discover what our employees find satisfying about the company, and where they see potential for improvement. The results of these surveys suggest relevant topics that we implement as specific plans of action at our local sites.

Investors
With its investor relations activities, Sartorius Stedim Biotech creates transparency and continuity for its shareholders. We engage in a dialogue with our investors also about our environmental and social responsibility as well as corporate governance topics at roadshows, investor conferences and as part of capital market days. In addition, we participate in sustainability analyses and ratings to gauge our performance concerning environmental, social and governance-related business practices (ESG). In 2016, Sartorius Stedim Biotech became a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index.
Society
We maintain good neighborly relationships with local residents and public authorities, and consider their interests and expectations on our business activities. Such interests and expectations relate, in particular, to paying our fair share of taxes, maintaining job security, complying with legal requirements, conserving and protecting environmental resources and promoting infrastructure.
To us, potential employees are a special social group. Precisely young and qualified staff is appreciated by companies that take social responsibility. A valueoriented corporate culture and sustained employee engagement help to convey a positive image of Sartorius Stedim Biotech to social communities, thus increasing our attractiveness as an employer.
Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards
Sartorius Stedim Biotech conducts its business in compliance with globally accepted ethical standards and applicable national legal requirements. Our actions are in line with good corporate governance and control, focusing on sustainable value added. These principles include protection of our stakeholders' interests, transparent communications, appropriate risk management and proper accounting and auditing. Sartorius Stedim Biotech follows the rules and recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.

36 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Ensuring Responsible Monitoring of Good Governance
With our global compliance system we ensure that members of the executive bodies, managers and employees comply with all legal regulations and codes and act in accordance with our internal guidelines. By systematically providing information, we prevent misconduct and avoid financial loss and damage to the company's image. The Legal Department is responsible for the task areas of legal consultation, internal auditing, Group safety, data protection, anticorruption and customs and export control.
Respecting Human Rights
We are committed to respecting human rights and are actively engaged within our sphere of influence in ensuring these rights are upheld. As pharmaceutical equipment suppliers, we see our greatest sphere of influence in employee rights, such as the freedom of association and right to collective bargaining. Another important concern of ours is to improve the availability of medical products to all members of society. Moreover, our company rejects all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We do not tolerate employees being discriminated against, disadvantaged, harassed or excluded based on their gender, ethnic origin, race, religion, age, disability, appearance, sexual preferences and identity, origin or political position, and we expect our suppliers to apply the same standards. As business partners, we act with integrity and fairness in our dealings with our customers, suppliers and competitors.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech supports and respects the principles defined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Global Compact, the world's largest initiative for human rights, work standards, environmental protection and anticorruption. Our internal standards, such as our Code of Conduct and our Code of Conduct for Suppliers, are derived from these global principles.
Code of Conduct
Sartorius Stedim Biotech's Code of Conduct specifies our requirements on the responsible conduct of our employees. This set of rules provides them with guidance on ethically appropriate conduct in accordance with the law in their daily work.

Employees are required to ask themselves the following questions for each of their activities: Are my actions legal? Is my behavior in line with our company values and guidelines? Is my behavior uninfluenced by personal interests (that are not covered by employment contract provisions) and would my behavior stand up in the face of public examination? Specifically, our Code of Conduct deals with the subject areas of compliance with international social and environmental standards, general rules of conduct and dealing with conflicts of interest.
Code of Conduct for Suppliers
Sartorius Stedim Biotech expects all suppliers and service providers to comply with internationally recognized social and environmental standards, to respect the law and to uphold the tenets of fair competition. The company excludes existing or new suppliers who are determined to be the source of considerable risks regarding compulsory, forced or child labor, other violations of human rights or negative effects on society. We have set out our requirements in our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Service Providers. Our major suppliers are required to sign a written confirmation acknowledging their commitment to comply with the Code of Conduct for Suppliers. Moreover, compliance topics are part of annual supplier performance reviews and are additionally monitored in part by regular quality audits.
Suppliers are required to support our company in upholding our standards and in disclosing all information requested. If such support is not provided or the requirements placed on our suppliers are not fulfilled, Sartorius will review whether further collaboration can still be maintained. Responsibility for upholding human rights in our supply chain rests with the Vice President of Global Sourcing. The Purchasing Department ensures that each Sartorius Stedim Biotech supplier recognizes and signs the Sartorius Code of Conduct for Suppliers. This Code is sent to all new suppliers to obtain their signature, and all regular suppliers have been requested in writing to sign a declaration of commitment to comply with this Code. If a supplier does not sign, we review whether he has an equivalent code in place that can be used as a contractual basis. If this is not the case, further measures are taken.

To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report 37

Sartorius Stedim Biotech has globally standardized its procurement channels. Contracts are awarded in a fair and transparent process that meets generally recognized standards.
Export Control
In line with good corporate governance, we keep an eye not only on our upstream chain, but also on our downstream chain. As soon as a new customer is entered in our SAP system, we check in the SAP global trade system whether the customer's name is on any sanctions list or is subject to any embargo. Only after a customer has passed this screening will his name be placed on active status for delivery of our products. In addition, each outbound shipment is checked against a sanctions list before leaving the company. In the process, certain products are given even greater attention to ensure that they are supplied for legal use.
Anti-Corruption Code
Our Anti-Corruption Code serves as the basis for making all employees aware of the risks of corruption, while providing guidance, instructions and help to enable them to take the appropriate action to prevent and fight such corruption. Management's objective in providing such a code is not only to systematically pursue any corruption cases that have occurred, but to take preventive action and create and strengthen an appropriate organizational structure to ward off corruption before it even can occur.
Every department is to be considered vulnerable to corruption if the information it has available or the decisions it makes can represent a tangible or intangible benefit for third parties outside the company.
Employees, suppliers, customers and business partners can use our whistleblower portal and telephone hotline to anonymously report any potentially damaging conduct.
We ensure that every staff member is familiar with our Code of Conduct and our Anti-Corruption Code by ensuring that all Group employees complete online training and earn a certificate. In this training seminar, employees are schooled in the way to deal with morally or legally questionable situations.

Basically, the multi reviewer's approach ("four or more eyes are better than two") is mandatory throughout the Group. It involves "checking up on each employee" for the employee's own protection and for the protection of his or her colleagues.
Due Diligence Processes
In contemplating acquisitions, we have a standard policy in place as part of our due diligence processes to assess non-financial aspects as well. These include, inter alia, compliance with legal standards and the effectiveness of compliance systems. Moreover, we include personnel and environmental aspects in our assessment of risks and opportunities of such potential takeover candidates. We seek to retain key top performers for our company by taking special measures.
Interests of the Workforce
One aspect of our corporate culture is that we regularly and promptly share information with our employees about our financial progress, strategic objectives and changes within the company. This information is disseminated in internal notices, newsletters and the company magazine, among other means of communication. Our Group companies also comply with the national regulations governing the minimum reporting deadlines regarding changes to operations.
In France, Sartorius Stedim Biotech staff is represented by three employee councils; this also applies for the German sites. These employees' councils hold regular staff meetings. In 2017, 12 collective agreements were signed at the French sites, of which one was a collective agreement on health insurance. At the German locations, 8 collective agreements were signed. These agreements cover topics such as profit sharing, retirement, salary increases, plant shut down times or shift plans.

38 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Compliance Management System
A corporate compliance team is currently being set up. As of January 2018, several staff members will be tasked with implementing and enforcing all compliance issues within the Group. A whistleblower portal in place already ensures that all cases of, for example, corruption, unequal treatment or sexual harassment can be anonymously reported to those responsible for compliance management. All options for contacting these individuals are given on our company home page and are available throughout the Group.
There were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions levied against the Group in the reporting year.

Employment
The employment numbers reported in the following include all staff members, except for vocational trainees, interns, employees on extended leaves of absence and those participating in an early retirement plan. This number is recorded as headcount.
As of December 31, 2017, the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group employed a total of 5,092 people, 367 more than in the previous year. Headcount increased by 7.8%. These figures include 36 employees from the most recent acquisition of Umetrics.

Regionally, EMEA that accounts for 70.6% of the total workforce added 7.1% new staff in 2017. Half of the 237 additional people were hired at the two largest SSB sites in Göttingen and Aubagne. 15% of these new employees joined the workforce through the acquisition of Swedish-based Umetrics.
The Americas region charted an increase of 8.3% or 63 new people. One-third of staff can be attributed to legal entity in Yauco.
In Asia | Pacific, headcount rose 11.0%; 67 more people worked at the company than at the end of the previous year.

To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report 39

Regarding our workforce broken down by function, manufacture and areas directly related to production accounted for 63.6% (2016: 63.7%); the 7.7% increase translates to 231 people. Service staff is also included in our production headcount. Marketing and sales reported an increase in staff of 7.7% as a result, 22.4% of the Group's employees worked in marketing and sales as in the previous year. Sartorius Stedim Biotech stepped up its research and development activities in 2017 so headcount in this unit accordingly rose at an above-average rate of 19.2% or by 75 people, (2016: 8.3%). Of this figure, 17 people are allotted to Umetrics and 28 to the largest R&D site in Göttingen. The decrease in headcount in administration by 7.6% or 20 people is mainly due to the allocation of administrative tasks to a Sartorius AG entity that is not included in SSB's scope of consolidation. During the reporting year, the share of administrative employees in the total workforce was 4.8% (2016: 5.6%).
The following evaluations do not include the 36 staff members who joined as a result of our latest acquisition of Umetrics.

As of December 31, 2017, 3,089 men and 1,967 women were employed by the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group. The percentage of women in the total workforce, which had continuously increased for years, was 38.9% at year-end 2017, slightly below the 2016 proportion of 39.5%.

Regarding the age structure of our staff, the group in the 31 - to 50 -year age bracket accounts for over half of our workforce. The median employee age of 40.7 was slightly above the previous year's average of 39.3.
Finding and Developing Talented People
Sartorius Stedim Biotech is a strongly growing company. To remain successful in the future as well, we need to continuously gain and retain talented and well-educated employees for our company. A special challenge in this respect is to get suitable, internationally experienced specialists interested in working for our company.

40 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

We continuously expand our personnel-related programs as a way of attracting, retaining and developing qualified employees.
Our company specifically attracts people who not only contribute their expertise, but also their openness, a sense of responsibility and a proactive willingness to further develop their own field of work.
We use classic career fairs and digital professional networks to attract the attention of talented people, and collaborate with relevant universities, institutes and organizations.
Promoting Young Academics
The aim of our own international scholarship program is to gain qualified young academics, particularly from the global growth markets, for our company. For many years, we have been supporting talented students and graduates in scientific and technical disciplines. Students from sales and marketing can also apply for our scholarship. The company aids these recipients not just financially, but also helps them technically and personally. For example, each scholarship holder is assigned a mentor from within our own organization.
In order to enhance their professional knowledge, skills and experience, Sartorius Stedim Biotech offers young people the opportunity to work within the company. For many years, we have been using the corresponding European Union funding programs, such as the Leonardo da Vinci scheme for international vocational education. If possible, we give interns also the possibility to participate in trainings. Thanks to an alliance with the Kedge Business School in Marseille, France, the interns at our Aubagne site, for example, can attend the Master of Business Administration courses offered there.
Further Developing and Promoting the Potential of Employees
Continuing professional development, assumption of responsibility, and opportunities to advance within the company are important for our employees' satisfaction. Such opportunities safeguard their employability and open up new professional prospects for them. Moreover, motivated, well-trained employees are a significant success factor for us as a company.

We create motivating work conditions that enable our employees to unfold their full potential to the best of their capabilities. Sartorius Stedim Biotech offers its staff all the advantages of an international group: working in a vibrant multi-cultural environment, the flexibility to set their own workhours, attractive compensation and company healthcare. At the same time, they enjoy the benefits of a medium-sized company: short lines of communication and decisionmaking and people-focused, family-style corporate culture.
Training and Further Education
Sartorius Stedim Biotech retains its qualified employees by offering targeted continuing education courses. At its sites in France, Tunisia, Puerto Rico, India and Germany, Sartorius Stedim Biotech provided 55.258,25 hours of training in 2017. This corresponds to an average of 15.2 hours of training per employee. The scope of training hours currently reported corresponds to 73.2% of total headcount.
The professional development program of Sartorius Stedim Biotech covers a broad range of topics. To help improve language and methodological skills, we provide all employees with a large number of advanced training and professional development opportunities offered in several different languages. Specialist training programs and targeted on-the-job courses teach necessary skills and knowledge. To meet the evolving needs of our employees and company, we refine the programs and modify them, both at a Group level and at a regional site level.
Annual performance reviews conducted for employees at all Group subsidiaries encourage individual and collective performance. These appraisals cover performance, review of targets and identification of development opportunities. Sartorius Stedim Biotech conducts them worldwide in accordance with uniform criteria.
Training of Managerial Staff
Sartorius Stedim Biotech's leadership guidelines help to strengthen our managerial culture on the basis of shared values. When possible, Sartorius Stedim Biotech fills management vacancies from within its own ranks, and accordingly develops and promotes employees with management potential at an international level.

To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report 41

A special program helps junior managers develop and refine their management skills through specific projects directly related to the company's business. For experienced management staff, Sartorius Stedim Biotech provides a separate development program.
As an alternative to the classic manager career, we enable scientists and engineers in R&D, in particular, to pursue an expert career path, which helps recognize the value of their expert knowledge for the success of the company and to offer experts and project managers adequate development prospects. In 2017, a similar program for experts in IT was implemented.
Global Mobility
The company benefits from employees who think and act beyond departments and locations. We therefore encourage employees to network within the company and to transfer temporarily to other departments or sites. Our internal job market also offers a variety of prospects to further develop and even change their jobs.
The basic conditions for temporary assignments in foreign countries are transparently defined for all staff members. Sartorius Stedim Biotech considers international assignments and global mobility an investment in the future of the company and is therefore further extending these opportunities.
Diversity as an Opportunity
As an international company, we do business in the widest range of regions and markets in the world. The diversity of our procurement and sales markets is reflected by our corporate culture and represents added value for us as the productive interaction with different perspectives and backgrounds helps us to better understand the needs of our customers, develop perfectly tailored solutions and to remain competitive in a globalized economy. Also, when filling management vacancies, we aim to achieve a mix of cultures, genders and age groups.
Regardless of age, gender, ethnic origin or physical disability ­ at Sartorius, everyone has an equal opportunity because we go strictly by performance as our principle for deciding on who to hire for entrylevel jobs and who to promote up the career ladder. Our employees are encouraged to develop personally and professionally throughout their entire professional career.

Employees from More than 60 Nations
Today, people from more than 60 countries work well as a team at our company. Managers from Germany, France, the USA and India, for example, are represented at the second management level, that of vice presidents. Throughout our sites, we also rely on local management, and continue to internationalize our management line-up over the medium term. In addition, we promote international opportunities for our employees' development, for instance, through temporary deployment at other sites or international teamwork.
Women in Managerial Positions
The number of posts held by women in the two levels of management immediately below the Executive Committee was 21.4% as of December 31, 2017 (2016: 23.7%). Sartorius Stedim Biotech aims to increase the proportion of women in managerial positions.
In 2017, Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed 120 people (2016: 102 people) who are registered as disabled ­ of this number, 27 work in France and 89 in Germany.
Freedom and Flexibility at Work
Generally, we assign our employees demanding tasks, delegate responsibility at an early stage and give them the freedom to define their daily work schedule. An increasing number of sites respond to the wide range of employee needs and requirements of life situations by providing various options for structuring their employment flexibly. Flextime, part-time work and teleworking offer employees models that help them find the right balance between family, work and leisure. Increasing digitalization of workplaces opens up new options for staff to set their own work schedules self-reliantly. To our employees, this flexibility is critical for their satisfaction with Sartorius Stedim Biotech, and it increases our attractiveness as an employer.
The number of part-time employees is 279 (2016: 270), which equates to 5.5% of our total headcount (2016: 5.7%). Sartorius Stedim Biotech complies with statutory and contractual working time obligations at all its subsidiaries. Working time varies depending on local environments and business activities.

42 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Remuneration Policy
Our remuneration policy aims to attract, retain and motivate employees. It ensures internal and external competitiveness by conducting regular reviews of the local markets. Our two global incentive programs, in which many of our employees are eligible to participate, are linked to both the success of the company and the achievement of targets defined in annual performance reviews. Generally, Sartorius Stedim Biotech applies industry standards or complies with union agreements. In Germany, for instance, compensation is paid according to the pay rates set by the trade unions, or even above, based on local performance-related components.
Employee benefits expense grew from 278.7 million in 2016 to 303.9 million in the reporting year. Of this figure, 242.7 million accounted for wages and salaries (2016: 224.1 million).
Occupational Health and Safety
The Group's corporate health management policy covers both the physical and the psychosocial elements of health to enhance employee performance, and motivation, ensure their employability and to reduce illness-related costs. We promote awareness of personal health among all employees, through special action days or sports courses at individual sites for example. Also, we offer advisory and assistance services especially for employees traveling on business to a foreign country or staying abroad. In the event of any medical emergencies or safety risks, our employees can obtain assistance by phone or find help on-site at all times. In France and Germany, employees experiencing professional and personal problems can consult with an external support service at no charge. Vice presidents in Germany may take advantage of an annual medical checkup at a selected partner clinic.

High Safety Standards

Sartorius Stedim Biotech has high safety standards to further reduce job-related medical conditions, risks to health and potential causes of industrial accidents. We draw on the standards of the International Labor Organization as well as on national regulations and recommendations. The job safety and occupational conditions are continuously improved. In this effort, we are responsive to the concerns of our employees as well: At the Aubagne site, for example, we operate a special program that implements specific improvements suggested by employees to prevent potential health hazards. Regular employee training on occupational health and safety, as well as on environmental protection, ensures that staff members can recognize risks and avoid them. At our local Group sites, work safety committees confer regularly to discuss measures that promote health and prevent work-related accidents.

The attrition rate expresses the number of people leaving the company as a percentage of the average headcount. Excluding expired fixed-term contracts, this figure at Sartorius Stedim Biotech was 7.7% in the reporting year, 1.3 percentage points above the low level a year ago. In general, fluctuation is subject to sizable regional differences. Europe typically has the lowest levels of staff turnover, whereas changing employers is more common in Asia and fluctuation there is usually higher. At Sartorius Stedim Biotech, too, staff turnover was the lowest at the Group's German sites, at 3.1%; in France, the attrition rate was 5.7%, with both figures excluding expired fixed-term contracts. In India, we have decreased the attrition rate in recent years through a variety of measures aimed at increasing employee loyalty and motivation. In 2017, it was at 8.4%.

The absenteeism rate, defined as the proportion of planned working time that is not worked due to general absences, is generally dependent on factors such as influenza waves. At Sartorius Stedim Biotech, absenteeism during the reporting year was at the previous year's level of 3.9%. The average number of days missed per employee due to illness excluding work-related accidents, slightly decreased from 7.3 days in 2016 to 7.2 days in 2017.
As a result of the consistently high number of new hires, the average seniority decreased significantly over the past years. In 2017, about half of the employees had been with Sartorius Stedim Biotech for less than five years. One-fifth of the total staff had been working for 15 years or more at the company.

Ecological Sustainability
As a technology company with manufacturing facilities, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is active at 15 production sites, where we consume water and energy, release greenhouse gases and produce waste as byproducts.
We classify the ecological impacts of our business activities as comparatively low. At the same time, we are aware of our responsibility to the environment and, for this reason, have set high standards for environmental protection as a matter of principle. At our sites with modern building technology, we often exceed the requirements of national environmental protection standards.
The focal points of our ecological sustainability management are compliance with environmental regulations and efficient handling of our energy, water and waste resources. To us, environmentally friendly advancement of our products is also a key concern. Growth coupled with underproportionate use of natural resources ­ this is a goal we achieve at various levels.
Information on health and safety measures adopted for Sartorius Stedim Biotech employees is described on page 42
Again in 2017, no specific environmental risks requiring provisions to be set up were identified.
High Standards in Quality and in Environmental Protection
At Sartorius Stedim Biotech, an increasing number of manufacturing companies apply for certification with international standards, thus continuously widening the scope. Currently, all our manufacturing sites are certified according to internationally recognized quality standards (ISO 9001), apart from Tagelswangen in Switzerland, which employs 58 staff members. An environmental management system according to ISO 14001 has been introduced at our two plants in Göttingen, Germany, as well as in Aubagne, France, and in Bangalore, India. Related to the average number of employees working at our manufacturing sites (2017: 4,083), 59% of these sites meet the requirements of this international standard for environmental protection. These two management systems ensure that we comply with quality requirements in the manufacture of our products, conserve the resources we use and prevent environmental risks. We also operate an energy management system according to ISO 50001 at our

two plants in Göttingen and the one in Guxhagen, where we manufacture equipment and systems for biopharmaceutical production. In relation to the average number of employees, this represents 41% of all our manufacturing sites.
Continuous Improvement of Processes
Sartorius Stedim Biotech operates a web-based software solution that ensures a standardized process of global acquisition and monitoring of sustainability data. At a local level, management ensures that the company complies with the relevant local and national environmental laws, regulations and standards. The company's international Environmental, Health and Occupational Safety Steering Group gives recommendations for harmonizing and continuously improving our processes in these three areas worldwide.
Promoting Consumer Health and Safety
Sartorius Stedim Biotech does not supply its products directly to end consumers, but rather to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, foods and chemicals. A high level of product quality and delivery reliability is critical for our customers in these strictly regulated industries. The company employs rigorous quality checks and advanced manufacturing methods and processes, such as cleanroom technology, to ensure that these products, when used as intended, comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and do not pose any risk to health or safety.
Our methods and processes are subject to constant review as part of our continuous improvement policy, moreover, and are refined appropriately as requirements evolve. The high standard of quality achieved in Sartorius Stedim Biotech products and processes is documented both by our successful completion of a host of annual audits by customers and our certification according to the standards for quality (ISO 9001) and for quality management for medical devices (ISO 13485). Detailed application brochures, as well as our service team, provide guidance to the customer on the correct use of our products. To respond rapidly to any product defects and minimize any adverse consequences, we have established a traceability system that enables us to recall entire product batches immediately, if necessary.

Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gases
Our largest site in Göttingen accounts for 60% of the energy used by all our manufacturing plants. For this reason, it is a focal point of our energy-saving measures and plays a pioneering role.
Emissions Monitoring in Line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
Since 2013, Sartorius Stedim Biotech has been using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) ­ a global standard for recording greenhouse gas emissions ­ as a guide for reporting its CO2 emissions. We thus account for emissions not only of CO2, but of all gases of relevance to climate change, and report them in CO2 equivalents (CO2eq). Currently, we report climaterelevant emissions that are directly given off by our production sites (Scope 1). We also report energy indirect emissions that arise during power generation by external energy suppliers (Scope 2). Other greenhouse gas emissions that are produced, for instance, in the manufacture of precursor products or through distribution (Scope 3) are analyzed only at our plant for single-use bags in Aubagne. We are considering phased integration of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which are time-consuming to record and calculate.

Primary energy sources, such as oil and natural gas, represent around 48 of our total energy consumption, with natural gas accounting for a major share. Secondary energy constitutes 52% of our power requirements. Regenerative energy covers 0.2% of the Group's needs.
At our Göttingen site, we produce our own electricity and heat using two combined heat and power plants, but we purchase most of our electricity from suppliers.
Emissions from the consumption of electricity are classified as Scope 2 and account for about two-thirds of our emissions of relevance to climate change. About one-third of these emissions primarily result from the use of fossil fuels (Scope 1).
Emissions from solvents, which occur only in filter manufacturing at the Göttingen and Yauco sites, amounted to 29.0 metric tons total carbon in the reporting year, (2016: 45.3 metric tons). This decrease reflects the lower production volumes at the Yauco site since September 2017 due to Hurricane Maria. The proportion of the total carbon relevant to greenhouse gas emissions has been taken into account when calculating the CO2eq figure.

46 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Climate Footprint at the Aubagne Site
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions at the Aubagne site for manufacturing single-use bags have been assessed for quite some years according to the "Bilan Carbone" method developed by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME). It also includes indirect greenhouse gas emissions generated by preliminary and subsequent steps across the valueadded chain. Results for 2015, the most recent year analyzed, yields the following distribution: Over half of our ecological footprint is caused by freight transport (29%) and by preliminary products that Sartorius Stedim Biotech sources from its suppliers (22%). Business travel and work-related commuting by employees contributes 20% to the generation of greenhouse gas emissions; energy consumption in buildings 10%, packaging 9%, others 10%. Based on these data, the site set up a plan of action for ongoing reduction in CO2 emissions.
Use of Advanced Technology to Reduce CO2
Sartorius Stedim Biotech is adapting to the negative consequences of climate change and endeavoring to continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its business. In addition, more efficient use of energy is economically sensible.
At our site in Göttingen, we employ state-of-the-art technology, such as two energy-efficient combined heat and power plants, an advanced compressed air center for controlling and regulating production equipment, and intelligent control systems. We thus substantially lower our carbon dioxide emissions. The company's energy management system facilitates systematic identification of additional energy savings potential.
At its international sites as well, Sartorius Stedim Biotech continuously develops its manufacturing processes and enhances its building facilities to conserve resources. Particularly at our new buildings, we are increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources in our energy mix.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech reduces transportation routes that burden the environment by supplying the various markets directly from its local production facilities. Where possible and practical, we ship via environmentally friendlier sea freight instead of air freight. We also work to minimize energy consumption caused by business travel, for example, by making greater use of teleconferencing as well as video conferencing.

The success of these and other eco-friendly measures is reflected in the company's overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which have increased at a much lower rate over the last few years than the company's expansion in terms of sales revenue.

Water Consumption

We consider water a valuable resource and use it responsibly at our sites. The company takes care to reduce water consumption and soil sealing, particularly at its manufacturing plants located in baseline water stress areas according to the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, such as Yauco or Bangalore. Most of the water we use is for rinsing in the manufacture of filter membranes according to the precipitation bath method at the Göttingen site.

To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report 47

We primarily draw water from public sources, but also use surface water. The amount of wastewater discharged into public sewage systems roughly corresponds to total water consumption, plus rainwater drainage. The biochemical oxygen demand is determined for production wastewater classified as significant. This figure identifies the amount of dissolved oxygen needed to break down organic material present in wastewater.
Sustainable Use of Water Resources
When expanding our membrane production capacity at the Göttingen site, we purchased advanced casting machines that need considerably less water for rinsing procedures than earlier machine generations. Our own water treatment plants that we operate at our large production sites also help ensure efficient use of water. Based on the low water usage strategy implemented at our green facility in Yauco, we reduce its consumption of drinking water by approximately 85% compared with a conventional plant, for example by using rain water. In Bangalore, we minimized sealing of the production facility grounds, and large green spaces enable rainwater to seep into the soil.
Our water consumption has also been considerably decreasing since 2012 in proportion to our increasing sales revenue.

Waste

We strive to reduce waste and, by using waste sorting systems, contribute toward recycling reusable materials and lowering the proportion of waste stored in landfills. All of our local sites are requested to develop appropriate measures according to the national legal requirements and options as well as internal policy.

The increase in the quantities of waste is mainly attributed to higher production capacity usage in Göttingen, where we put a new modification plant into operation in 2017.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech complies with the European Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE).
At our sites in Germany, where about 40% of total waste is produced, we use an electronic signature for hazardous materials, such as acids and oils. As a result, we document the production of hazardous waste and provide digital proof of its proper recovery and/or disposal, ensuring that such waste is fully tracked from end to end.
To use less polyethylene packaging, we have switched delivery of polypropylene from sacks to silos for the manufacture of injection-molded components for single-use products.
We give away unsold food from our cafeterias in Göttingen to a local charity organization. Any food that cannot be donated is sent to a biogas facility for anaerobic digestion to generate biogas from this
organic food waste.
Waste is primarily disposed of in the countries, where such waste is created. Exceptions to this principle are only made in justified cases. For instance, the Mohamdia site sends a small part of its waste to Aubagne to be disposed of properly.

48 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

Return of Recyclable Materials
Organic solvents, which we need for manufacturing membranes for filter cartridges, are recovered and recycled. The Göttingen facility, which accounts for most of our solvent usage, has a solvent reprocessing plant on site so that solvents can be reused in production operations. In this way, we maintain closed-loop material cycles, minimize transportation requirements and reduce the quantities of water used and wastewater produced. By conducting our own research and development, we also continuously lower the relative volume of solvents needed for membrane manufacture.
As a supplier for the pharmaceutical industry, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is currently prohibited by regulatory requirements from using recycled plastics on the grounds of product safety. In Germany, we consistently employ special waste disposal companies that send plastic waste for recycling or have it disposed of in an environmentally responsible way. In France, energy-rich, but composite, plastic waste resulting from our bag manufacture is reused to generate energy by incineration in a special power plant. A large proportion of polymer waste is separated and collected according to type of material, such as polyamide and polyethylene, for recycling as secondary materials.

Use of Raw Materials According to Legal Regulations
Based on an international ERP software standard in use, Sartorius Stedim Biotech developed a hazardous materials management system that enables chemicals to be selected within the Group by a release process. As a result, it is also possible to provide safety data sheets for customers as well as instructions for the inhouse use and handling of such hazardous substances. The legal basis for releasing such materials is constituted by global and national regulations, such as REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals") and GHS ("Globally Harmonised System"), as well as RoHS ("Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment").
We defined three types of raw materials as particularly important for manufacturing our products: chemicals and solvents for membranes for filter cartridges, polymers for single-use materials and stainless steel for reusable bioreactors and systems. In 2017, we purchased 4,189 metric tons of chemicals and solvents (2016: 4,240 metric tons) and 1,677 metric tons of polymers (2016: 1,401 metric tons). The quantity of stainless steel decreased to 500 metric tons (2016: 439 metric tons). These figures may vary to some extent as they reflect the quantities purchased and not the amounts used.
According to its general manufacturing policy, Sartorius Stedim Biotech has a high in-house manufacturing rate, which is nearly 100% in some cases, such as for filter membranes. Regarding trading goods, Sartorius Stedim Biotech spent 48.6 million in the reporting year (2016: 52.5 million), mainly for supplies sourced from companies based in Europe and the U.S. This equates to a rate of just under 5% of sales revenue.

Environmentally Friendly Expansion of the Group's Infrastructure
We invest continuously in new plants and plant expansions to accommodate our constant growth. In the process, we comply with local regulations and practices for land use. We also reduce the impact on the environment by selecting areas for its premises that are already developed as industrial zones. None of our production sites is situated in nature reserves or in intact ecosystems. Where possible, we maximize green space and minimize impermeable areas at our facilities. A good example of this is our site in Bangalore. Although we generally estimate that our impact on biodiversity is negligible, Sartorius Stedim Biotech strives to meet the special protection needs of biodiversity hotspots where our factories in Tunisia and Puerto Rico are located. For example, our site in Puerto Rico, which was expanded in 2012 to serve as the central manufacturing and logistics site for the North American market, meets the highest U.S. standards for green, resource-saving and efficient construction. We became the first pharmaceutical industry supplier worldwide to achieve Platinum-level certification under the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED initiative. As part of the expansion of the Göttingen site, we are seeking to gain certification from the German Sustainable Building Council. Beyond this, we have created an infrastructure with our electrical charging stations to expand electromobility.
At our other sites, too, we integrate advanced ecological utilities and technologies for lowering energy consumption, preventing waste, limiting noise pollution for employees and reducing scrap that results from manufacturing processes. In doing so, we often exceed the requirements imposed on us by local environmental protection regulations.
Because our manufacturing plants are mostly situated in industrial areas, noise pollution for residents is not a relevant issue for the company.

Sustainable Product Innovations
Our efforts to optimize the environmental performance of our products and production methods begin at the research and development stage. We reduce the amount of packaging and increase the share of environmentally friendly raw materials when such steps do not affect the safety and functionality of products and packaging. Sartorius Stedim Biotech also works with partners from industry and the scientific community on sustainable product solutions and efficient use of raw materials.
High-Performance Products Improve Customers' Environmental Footprint
Single-use products are becoming increasingly widespread in the manufacture of innovative, effective medications. They are not only practical under economic aspects, but also provide ecological benefits. Studies have shown that single-use products are far superior to complex reusable systems in their consumption of energy, water and chemicals over a product's lifecycle. Experts have compared approaches based primarily on reusable materials with those based predominantly on single-use materials across various scenarios, which included a typical industrial manufacturing process for monoclonal antibodies. The result is clear-cut: manufacturers employing mostly single-use solutions use around 87% less water and 30% less energy. In addition, the experts found that the deployment of single-use solutions reduces the size of production units. Manufacturers are said to require 30% less space, thus also saving energy and materials. Other studies have confirmed that the energy needed for sterilization, cleaning and materials in processes based on single-use products is around half that of conventional processes.1)
Although single-use products have clear ecological benefits, their usage generates more waste. Yet consistent reuse and recycling can improve environmental performance here as well. The ultrapure plastics we utilize to manufacture our various singleuse products contain around 80% to 90% of the energy of pure crude oil and are thus valuable secondary raw materials. The high energy content of polymers, for example, means that they can be reused as fuel in heat and | or for power generation.

50 To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report

The integrated solutions of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech FlexAct product range are a further example of this approach: Beyond the ecological benefits generally offered by single-use technologies, FlexAct solutions reduce the need for stationary installation of equipment and thus the quantity of materials and land required. The versatile central control unit of FlexAct, for instance, can be used in a number of different biopharmaceutical processes.
Technical refinements made by our R&D specialists to the Sartopore Platinum membrane filter series slashed consumption of ultrapure water for wetting and rinsing the membranes by around 95%. The filters' significantly lower adsorption lessens the amount of expensive protein solutions lost. As a result, pharmaceutical manufacturers can substantially reduce resources, while recovering higher yields.
Our Services unit assists customers in adapting solutions optimally to their requirements on site. We always analyze customer processes as a whole and identify potential for both financial and ecological improvements. In this way, we contribute to increasing the efficiency and environmental compatibility of our customers' processes.

Contributing to Society
Our products help the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry to develop and manufacture medications at the forefront of technology. Single-use products, in particular, contribute toward faster development of new biopharmaceuticals that improve treatment of serious diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune illnesses. As a result, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is helping to supply society with safe, effective and affordable medical drugs.
Fostering research and education and supporting events for the scientific community are among our chief priorities in our social outreach activities. Beyond this, our business activities have many positive effects on the progress of the cities and communities in which Sartorius Stedim Biotech has been operating for many years in most instances. Particularly at our production facilities located in small- to mid-sized cities and communities, such as our Göttingen, Guxhagen, Aubagne and Yauco sites, we rank among the important private employers and customers in their regions, contributing to the growth and purchasing power of such communities.
Together with our cooperation partners, we are actively involved in shaping the economic and social environments around our sites, focusing on areas that are directly or indirectly affected by our business activities. By providing financial support to projects in education, culture, social affairs and sports, we additionally contribute toward making the regions in which we operate more attractive for current and future Sartorius Stedim Biotech employees alike.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech is politically independent and does not provide financial or in-kind support to politicians or political parties.

To Our Shareholders Sustainability Report 51

Fostering Education and Scientific Excellence
Promoting academic excellence and interdisciplinary communication are key aspects of our long-term alliances with research and educational institutions.
At our Group headquarters in Aubagne, we collaborate with several schools and universities, which included the École Nationale Supérieure de Technologie des Biomolécules in Bordeaux, to support the education and training of biotechnology engineers and business administrators and help young graduates start off their careers. We also cooperate closely with higher institutes of learning, such as the Institut Universitaire de Technologie, Hygiène, Sécurité, Environnement in Le Ciobat and with the Kedge Business School in Marseille.
Sponsoring Events for the Scientific Community
As a partner of the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, Sartorius Stedim Biotech regularly contributes to symposia, conventions and annual conferences, which cover subjects such as the development of antibodies and vaccines, single-use systems and microbiological analysis. For instance, we regularly support the international and regional annual conferences of the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE), an independent not-for-profit association dedicated to employee education and information-sharing across the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.
Dedicated to the Local Environment
At our headquarters in Aubagne, a city with some 45,000 inhabitants, for instance, we provide attractive long-term jobs for more than 800 people. As a member of the large French employers' organization MEDEF, Sartorius Stedim Biotech collaborates closely with national and local institutes to help improve the job market situation. Our expanded Yauco plant provides employment for around 470 people directly with Sartorius Stedim Biotech and for around 120 additional people with local service providers and suppliers, such as for maintenance of machines and buildings and for plant security.

A Reliable Partner
Our local subsidiaries are involved alongside representatives from city councils, the industrial and social communities in initiatives to strengthen the competitiveness of their respective regions. Our corporate values of sustainability, openness and enjoyment guide us, also in our relationships with various local stakeholders. We remain a reliable partner for regional organizations. As part of our policy to maintain a constructive, open dialogue with the communities in which we are based, we inform them promptly and comprehensively about all our activities and developments that could affect them. We also involve them in our projects, where possible and expedient.
In 2017, for instance, Sartorius Stedim Biotech continued a trainee program for refugees from the Middle East and Africa as part of its activities in cooperating with the city of Göttingen and the local employment agency. Ever since the initiative started in 2015, we have been able to offer job perspectives to many of these refugees at the end of their trainee program.
At our subsidiary in Yauco, Puerto Rico, we work with several local schools, and award around 20 scholarships annually to especially talented highschool and university students from low-income families. In addition, visits to the company are organized to motivate these young people to begin vocational training or university studies. We also sponsored a variety of youth sports teams and other local sporting events, as well as supported two local organizations that look after homeless people in Yauco.
Christmas Donations Instead of Gifts
Besides its regional social engagement, Sartorius Stedim Biotech also has been supporting international non-profit organizations since 2014 by making charitable donations as part of the company's "Christmas Donations Instead of Gifts" initiative. In the reporting year, Sartorius Stedim Biotech donated $58,975 to the aid organization Estancia Corazón in Puerto Rico. This organization supports the local homeless, whose number has substantially risen after Hurricane Maria in September 2017.

We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by article L.233 - 1 and the controlled entities as defined by article L.233 - 3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological note, presented in the management report.
Conclusion
Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report.
2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information
Nature and scope of our work
We conducted twenty interviews with persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to:
­ assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate ;
­ verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information.
We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices.

Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important3):
­ at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report;
­ at the level of a representative sample of entities/divisions/sites selected by us4) on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average between 50% and 91% of environmental indicators and between 10% and 34% of social indicators.
For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company.
We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part.
We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated.

Opportunity and Risk Report

Principles
Every business activity entails opportunities and risks, which have to be managed. The skill with which this is done goes a long way in determining the future development of a company's shareholder value. The central element in risk managements is systematic identification and realization of opportunities, as well as avoidance of risks that could jeopardize the success of the company.
In managing risks and opportunities, Sartorius Stedim Biotech aims to identify and use business opportunities systematically, as well as to recognize and evaluate risks at an early stage and take measures to counter them where possible. It is not the task of risk management to eliminate all risks: rather, our approach is to intentionally take a certain measure of risk in our business activities in order to be successful in unlocking opportunities. However, in this endeavor, it is important to keep risks contained within acceptable limits and to control them carefully. Through appropriate guidelines, we ensure that risk assessments are taken into account in the decision-making processes from the very beginning.
Sartorius Stedim Biotech has no single organizational unit tasked with identifying and managing opportunities and risks. Instead, it prefers to make this a crossfunctional component of Group management. In this context, Sartorius Stedim Biotech's risk management is integrated into the Sartorius Group organization. Our risk management organization reflects a global functional matrix organization in which individuals heading a functional area are each responsible for their own management of opportunities and risks. The Finance & Controlling department is responsible for the organization of the respective reporting process, including the further development of the Group's risk management system.

Managing Opportunities
Our opportunity management centers on the analysis of target markets and sector environments, as well as the assessment of trends, both of which give strong indications as to future business opportunities. The identification of the potential for development in this context is one of the key roles of the relevant managers and initially takes place at the local rather than the central level. The market-facing functions, such as strategic marketing and product management in the individual divisions, play a leading role in this respect. The central Business Development unit additionally supports these areas with market monitoring, data analysis and the implementation of strategic projects.
As part of strategy reviews, the members of the Group Executive Committee regularly meet with the managers having operational responsibility and with the Business Development unit to discuss short-, mediumand long-term opportunity potential for the various business areas. The subsequent steps of prioritizing the opportunities and evaluating them from a business management perspective, deriving strategic measures and allocating resources proceed in accordance with a standardized decision-making process that applies throughout the Group. If the opportunities are shortterm in nature, they are considered in annual budget planning. Medium- and longer-term opportunities are tracked systematically as part of strategic planning. The status of opportunity management as a permanent fixture of the corporate management system means that it also features in the discussions and decisionmaking processes of top-level management.
Key areas of opportunity are presented below. Where appropriate, reference is made to the relevant section of the Group Management Report in order to avoid repetition. Most of the risks we describe in the section on specific risks represent opportunities, should events develop in the opposite, positive direction. For this reason, we discuss these opportunities in the section on specific risks and opportunities at the end of this chapter.

58 To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report

Areas of Opportunity
As a supplier for the pharmaceutical industry, Sartorius Stedim Biotech operates in a future-oriented and high-growth sector. The significant opportunities generated by the various market and technology trends are described in detail in the sections entitled "Sector Conditions" and "Outlook for the Sector" on pages 22 et seq. and pages 69 et seq., respectively.
Our assessments rank the company as one of the global market leaders in many subsegments and product areas. We believe the high quality of our products, our strong brand recognition and our established customer relationships give Sartorius Stedim Biotech strong opportunities to continue extending our market leadership. The corresponding strategies and the growth opportunities and initiatives based on them are discussed in the section on the strategy of the Group, which begins on page 20.
Strict management of processes and costs provides opportunities to further increase our profitability. Key target areas in this respect include continued enhancements of our procurement chain and ongoing efforts to optimize production, which we present on page 33.
Other opportunities are discussed in the context of the presentation of specific risks and opportunities beginning on page 57.
Risk Management
Just as for opportunity management, overall responsibility for the maintenance of an effective risk management system ensuring comprehensive and consistent management of all material risks rests with the Audit Committee. Coordinating and developing this system and combined risk reporting are the responsibilities of the Finance & Controlling department, while the particular functional areas are responsible for identifying and reporting risks, as well as for assessing their potential impact and for taking the appropriate countermeasures.
The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system. Furthermore, while carrying out their statutory audit mandate for the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, the independent auditors examine whether the early warning system in place is capable of prompt identification of risks that could jeopardize the future of the company.

Risk Management System and Risk Reporting
At the heart of the risk management system is the Sartorius Group Risk Management Handbook, which applies throughout the entire Group organization. The Handbook, which includes definitions of the framework, the structural organization, processes, risk reporting and monitoring and control of the effectiveness of the risk management system, is based on the internationally recognized COSO standard. There are also a number of other sources that contain stipulations for the handling of risks, including the articles of association and rules of procedure of the Group companies and other internal guidelines. The strong growth of the Group over the past years and the rising demands of customers and regulators meanwhile require that we continue to adapt our guidelines and rules.
A key element of our internal communication of risks is Group-wide risk reporting. The objective of this is to enable structured, continuous tracking of risks and to document them in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The prescribed reporting process in the risk categories subsequently described establishes the rules for the ongoing review of and information on risk situations. Those responsible for functional areas at the Group subsidiaries periodically review and assess their respective risk situations. If any specific risks are discernible, these are documented with respect to their assessment, probability of occurrence and measures to be taken to eliminate such risks or to mitigate their impact. In addition, as soon as these risks reach defined size criteria, they are reported to the central risk management system. Appropriate insurance policies are taken out to reduce any remaining risk situations, where feasible. New organizational units joining the consolidated Group companies are successively integrated into our risk reporting process.
We have an urgent reporting procedure in place to ensure that when a new or emerging significant risk to our net worth, financial position and profitability is identified and estimated as involving 2.5 million or higher, the Audit Committee receives all of the necessary details without undue delay.

To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report 59

Risk Classification
The first level of risk management relates to the four main risk categories defined by Sartorius Stedim Biotech: external risks, operating risks, financial risks and corporate governance risks.
The second level consists of additional subcategories that we classify within these main categories, such as supply chain risks, sales and distribution risks, and quality risks.
We categorize risks according to the scale of their implications too, and also perform a specific evaluation in which all risks are assigned the value of their maximum impact at the time of risk analysis. In other words, we record the maximum risks without considering the probability of occurrence or the effects of risk mitigation measures.
For the purposes of this report, we have assessed the probability of the risks as shown below and, in the adjacent columns, classify their particular significance for the entire Group.

Explanation of Principal Risks and Opportunities
General and Macroeconomic Risks and Opportunities
General Risks
In principle, our ability to foresee and mitigate the direct and indirect effects of risks entailed by life in general is limited, but we proactively take measures, whenever feasible, to ensure that we can respond appropriately and at short notice or are insured against any damage entailed by such risks that include, for instance, natural catastrophes and their associated damage to commercially significant and critical infrastructure. After severe hurricanes hit Puerto Rico in the reporting year, we deployed a task force that defined the immediate measures to take in order to reduce economic damage for the Group. At the same time, a project for updating our production network strategy was initiated.
Business Cycle Risks
The nature of our various business areas means that Sartorius Stedim Biotech as a whole is insulated to a certain extent from the full force of wider cyclical effects. If economic developments prove more positive than expected, this, in turn, can additionally stimulate stronger growth.
Supply Chain Risks and Opportunities
Our supply chain extends from procurement to production to sales and distribution. Problems within this workflow can have consequential effects, including delays in deliveries. The global supply chain management system we have instituted throughout our production processes to prevent such problems largely minimizes the associated risks by analyzing and controlling all of the operations involved. The strongly international alignment of our organization opens up a whole series of opportunities too. The various risks and opportunities encountered within our supply chain are explained in detail below.

60 To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report

Procurement Risks and Opportunities
We purchase a wide range of raw materials, components, parts and services from suppliers and are consequently exposed to the risks of unexpected delivery bottlenecks and | or price increases.
Over the past years, we have implemented powerful tools and robust processes in our Materials Management unit to manage risks and critical materials. These means enable us to meet the needs of our customers with respect to delivery reliability and transparency. This can represent a competitive advantage. Important measures in this respect are to maintain security stock and to define alternative suppliers according to our econd-supplier policy. We moreover conduct regular supplier reviews and also use early warning systems.
Risks from raw material prices play a rather subordinate role in our business. On the one hand, the proportion of raw materials in our production costs is comparatively low. On the other hand, we purchase a wide range of materials so that price increases for certain materials do not represent any significant impacts.
Opportunities can arise in the area of procurement when our growth enables us to increase order quantities and thereby strengthen our position with our suppliers, such as by receiving price discounts or preferential treatment as a "preferred customer." In addition, we maintain a list of preferred suppliers in parallel, which permits us to enter into long-term business relationships with key suppliers to our mutual benefit.
Increased globalization of our supplier pool holds the prospect of purchasing on more favorable terms, moreover, and there is also a possibility of our expanded purchasing activities in the international markets leading us to identify suppliers with special product and technical expertise that could eventually enhance our own competitive edge.
Production Risks and Opportunities
Based on our core technology expertise, we ourselves manufacture a large proportion of the products that involve a high level of vertical integration. Other products, such as reusable fermenters and bioreactors, are manufactured in collaboration with suppliers so that some of the production risks are transferred to external third parties. When we manufacture products ourselves, we also bear the associated risks of capacity bottlenecks or overcapacity, production downtimes, excessive reject rates and high levels of tied-up work-

ing capital, as well as dependency on individual manufacturig sites. We contain and reduce these risks by planning production capacities carefully, using versatile machines, semi-automated individual workstations and flextime work schedules, and by continuously monitoring production processes. Moreover, our global manufacturing network enables us to compensate for any capacity bottlenecks by shifting production to other regional plants and to minimize our dependency on individual local production plants.
Furthermore, we have taken out policies for business interruption insurance to compensate for any possible losses due to production downtimes.
Beyond this, we work closely together with our customers to gain a better understanding of their needs and to schedule our production capacities optimally.
We consider it an opportunity that our investments in infrastructure and production resources, among other things, have given us high flexibility in our manufacturing operations and that we are capable of meeting our customers' requirements and regulatory standards with respect to business continuity concepts. In addition, this approach ensures that our individual production sites can concentrate on specific manufacturing technologies, gaining added efficiency as a result. Our international manufacturing network also makes it possible to capitalize on the cost advantages offered by individual sites. Furthermore, continuous improvements in production, such as simplifying processes and increasing levels of automation, help drive manufacturing efficiency even higher.
Sales and Distribution Risks and Opportunities
We use a variety of channels to sell and distribute our products around the world. The potential risks entailed are unexpected changes in the demand structure, growing price pressure and non-compliance with supply agreements concluded with customers. We employ targeted market analyses to identify emerging demand trends in individual segments early on so that we have time to respond appropriately. Our technical innovations and our focus on less price-sensitive sales markets, such as products for validated production processes in the biopharmaceutical industry, reduce our exposure to the risk of growing price pressure. We have minimized our risk exposure in the area of logistics in recent years by setting up and using central warehouses to optimize distribution logistics.

To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report 61

Opportunities arise in the area of sales and distribution when the increasing breadth of our product range puts us in a position to sell new products to existing customers. Our business relationships, most of which are established for the long term, and our global presence provide further opportunities.
Quality Risks and Opportunities
Our customers use Sartorius Stedim Biotech products in a wide range of critical production processes, including the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, foods and chemicals, and in research and development laboratories. The main risk encountered in these areas is non-compliance with agreed quality criteria, which can lead to losses for our customers, or their customers, for which we may be made liable through compensation claims. We employ rigorous quality checks and advanced production methods and processes, such as cleanroom technology, to ensure that our products satisfy the most stringent quality standards and high regulatory requirements. These manufacturing methods and processes are subject to constant review under our continuous improvement processes, moreover, and are optimized as requirements evolve. Our successful completion of a host of annual audits by customers and our certification under ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 together document the high level of quality achieved in Sartorius Stedim Biotech products and processes. Irrespective of these measures, we also maintain significant insurance coverage against product liability risks. Sartorius Stedim Biotech has established a traceability system that enables us to recall an entire production batch immediately, if necessary, and minimize any adverse consequences in the event of defects being discovered in a product.
We have installed a complaints management system to deal with customer requests and to ensure full documentation.
Quality requirements are growing more and more stringent all the time, not least as a result of increasing requirements on protection of medical patients and on product safety by regulatory authorities, so we actually regard this first and foremost not as a risk, but as an opportunity that opens up new market prospects. Also, challenging quality demands represent a considerable barrier to entry for potential new competitors and provide stimulus for further technical innovation to which we actively respond.

R&D Risks and Opportunities
We devote a considerable share of our resources to research and development. Potential risks in this area may arise from development results that diverge from market needs and application requirements and from exceeding planned development deadlines. Our advanced project management, intensive R&D controlling and early involvement of our customers in the development process substantially limit these R&D risks. Patents and continuous tracking of the technologies and competitors relevant to us secure our technology and marketing position.
On the other hand, the R&D sphere also offers a number of potential opportunities. Our intensive collaboration with partners that rank among the global market leaders in their own fields opens up the opportunity for us to jointly develop products with an especially high level of innovation. In areas such as membrane technology and plastics technology, as well as sensorics and bioprocess engineering, in turn, the expertise of our own specialists puts us at the very forefront of global research and development, presenting us with an opportunity to turn this technical knowledge into potential sales and an even stronger position on the market.
Customer Risks and Opportunities
Sartorius Stedim Biotech sources its key customers from the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. These customers are usually relatively large organizations that have been in existence for some time and have strong credit ratings. Accordingly, the Group has had low to zero credit losses over the past years, and its overall credit risk continues to be at a very low level. Most of our business areas have a highly diversified customer base, so the Group as a whole is not dependent on individual key accounts to any significant degree.

62 To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report

Competitive Risks and Opportunities
Sartorius Stedim Biotech has a leading competitive position in most of its markets. Some of our competitors are larger than us, and most share our status as a globally operating company. As we serve a large number of customers from highly regulated sectors like the pharmaceutical and food industries, and the technology barriers to market entry are substantially high, we regard the probability of new competitors emerging within the short term as low. Overall, the competitive environment is therefore comparatively stable.
The fact that many of our products are used in validated bioprocesses ensures a robust revenue stream, reducing the risk of losing significant market share within a short timeframe. At the same time, it is not possible for us to quickly force out the competition that serves customers in this area.
Changes in the competitive environment, for example, consolidation in the markets, can pose opportunities. Our sectors find themselves in an ongoing process of change in which Sartorius Stedim Biotech has been actively participating. We have been continuously making acquisitions in recent years to reinforce our market position and open up new potential synergies.
Acquisition Risks and Opportunities
By nature, acquisitions provide many opportunities, such as sales growth, extension of our product portfolio and development of new markets. By contrast, the purchase and sale of companies or parts of companies entail a number of typical risks, such as incorrect valuation assumptions or insufficient usage of anticipated synergy effects. To prevent these risks, we take various measures, such as performing a standard due diligence review of important areas and carrying out comprehensive analysis of the market concerned. In addition, we involve external consultants and experts in the purchase or sales process as required. We especially focus on drafting transaction contracts so that they adequately counter such risks, especially by clauses assuring specific characteristics or by contractual warranty or guarantee provisions, as well as agreements on mechanisms for adjustment of the purchase price and on liability clauses. Immediately after an acquisition has taken place, an integration phase is initiated in which any potential risks can likewise be detected as early as possible and prevented or minimized by taking the appropriate counteractions.

Personnel Risks and Opportunities
As an innovative technology group, Sartorius Stedim Biotech employs a large percentage of highly qualified people. We counter the risks of a possible scarcity of required specialists, especially those in key positions and of demographic change by offering performancerelated remuneration models, targeted continuing professional development options, further attractive social benefits, continuous education and training for junior staff members within our organization and interesting people development opportunities.
The success of these measures is apparent in the low attrition rates of recent years and the many years of seniority our people accumulate on average. Employment contracts in certain cases contain a clause prohibiting any move to a direct competitor.
Opportunities for Sartorius Stedim Biotech primarily arise in that it can further qualify its staff by offering its own training courses and retain such staff over the long term, thus covering company needs for qualified personnel particularly well.
Financial Risks and Opportunities
The global nature of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group's operations means that its business activities are inevitably exposed to financial risks. The most significant of these, aside from risks associated with Group accounting, are exchange rate risks, interest rate risks and liquidity risks, all of which are described below and addressed in detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Vice versa, financial risks, most notably exchange rate risks and interest rate risks, are balanced by opportunities of approximately equal magnitude.
Risks Associated with Group Accounting
Except for the general, typical risks inherent in any accounting process, no specific risks concerning Group accounting are discernible. Typical accounting errors in this connection are, for example, incorrect discretionary decisions in the measurement of assets and liabilities. The use of various common and standardized, partially automated control mechanisms ensures that such errors are recognized and corrected at an early stage. A highly detailed monthly reporting and analysis process, as well as the regular legal audits, essentially contributes to these targets.

To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report 63

Exchange Rate Risks and Opportunities
As we generate around half of consolidated sales revenue in foreign currencies and two-thirds of this total revenue in U.S. dollars or in currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, we are positively or negatively impacted by currency effects, especially when converting the currencies of balance sheet items and profit or loss items, respectively. To largely compensate for the general risk resulting from the impact of individual foreign currencies, we have taken a number of measures besides hedging currencies. Our global production network thus enables us to offset the lion's share of sales revenues received in foreign currency within the Group against costs likewise incurred in foreign currency. For example, we manufacture many of our products for the North American market locally, and are not disadvantaged in competition with our U.S. rivals, insofar as this general currency risk is concerned. We continuously monitor both exchange rates and our net currency exposure ­ i.e. that proportion of our foreign currency sales revenue that remains after we have settled our costs, likewise in a foreign currency ­ and use derivative financial instruments for hedging. These instruments are primarily spot, forward and swap transactions, on the basis of current and anticipated net currency exposure and foreign currency levels. We make it a policy to hedge up to 70% of our exposure in advance for the following 18 months. Hedging transactions are set up by one group of staff and monitored by another, separate group.
Interest Rate Risks and Opportunities
We have concluded fixed interest agreements for a smaller portion of our outstanding loans to eliminate the risk posed by variable interest payments. The majority of the financial instruments outstanding on the reporting date are subject to variable interest based on the market rate. A substantial part of these are currently covered by interest rate swaps, so interest rate risks and opportunities apply only to the remainder. We monitor interest rate trends and our interest rate exposure constantly and have the facility to arrange additional hedging transactions where we consider it necessary and economically advisable to do so for individual loans.

Liquidity Risks and Opportunities
Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group's liquidity is managed centrally in order to minimize liquidity risks and optimize liquidity allocation within the organization. For this purpose, various long- and short-term financial instruments are utilized. Regarding the maturities of our loans, we make it a policy to take a risk-averse approach.
In addition to a 300 MEUR credit line provided by Sartorius AG that can be accessed and repaid at short notice, we have a number of bilateral working capital credit lines for individual Group companies in place. Furthermore, we use cash pooling agreements between selected Group companies as the primary tool to manage liquidity within the Group.
Regulatory Risks
Our role as a supplier to the biopharmaceutical industry and health care providers means that Sartorius Stedim Biotech can also be affected by underlying developments in these areas. The possibility of the regulatory authorities (FDA, EMA) adopting a more restrictive approach to the approval of new medications remains the principal source of risk in this context. Such a move would reduce the number of new pharmaceutical products to be marketed and would consequently downgrade future prospects for Sartorius Stedim Biotech over the medium term.
Environmental Risks
Sartorius Stedim Biotech has established an environmental management system that encompasses, and is integrated into, all divisions and covers a whole series of environmentally relevant regulations to minimize environmental risks. This management system has been certified for compliance with ISO 14001 at a number of the company's relatively large manufacturing sites. The respective company organizational units ensure at the particular sites that the laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are observed and that further technical possibilities for limiting environmental risks are identified on an ongoing basis.

64 To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report

The increasing importance of sustainability considerations in many industries represents an opportunity. That is why this aspect is a key element in our supplier selection process for assessing the suitability of a particular company as a business partner.
IT Risks and Opportunities
Besides the risks already described, the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is exposed to potential risks in the area of IT as a result of its pronounced dependence on these systems, since their error-free operation is essential for the smooth functioning of the company's business processes. IT security risks are reduced by continuously enhancing and implementing IT security guidelines and policies. These rules and measures are based on the requirements of ISO 27001 and the standards of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI Standards). Furthermore, our company's existing IT applications and IT systems are checked for potential risks in regular external and internal IT audits, and appropriate measures are taken to minimize any risks identified. Continuous alignment of our IT strategy and business strategy, tracking of new technical developments and the use of advanced hardware and software minimize the risk inherent in the operation of our IT system environment. A new ERP system has been successively rolled out to the Group sites around the world since 2012. In conducting this IT project, one focus was made on controlling the risks involved, such as by maintaining a precautionary backup system. The implementation of the new system brings with it a whole series of opportunities, especially in relation to efficiency gains and the standardization and harmonization of business processes worldwide.
Process Risks
Process risks for Sartorius Stedim Biotech can arise from pending or forthcoming legal disputes or from administrative proceedings. All judicial or extrajudicial disputes are attended to by the company's own attorneys and legal experts, who engage external lawyers as needed.
At present, there are no pending or discernible legal disputes or proceedings that lack any cost coverage allowances in the statement of financial position or that could have a substantial negative impact on Group.

Insurance
We have taken out insurance policies to cover a wide range of risks where possible and economically advisable. These insurance policies include coverage against liability, property damage, business interruption, transport, material and pecuniary damages and other risks, and provide comprehensive coverage for legal costs. An independent department working in conjunction with an external insurance broker regularly reviews the nature and extent of our insurance protection and makes any adjustments necessary.
When choosing our insurers, we consider the credit rating of the respective entities, as well as a high degree of diversity in order to mitigate the related risks.
Assessment of the Overall Risk Situation and Risk Outlook
Where feasible, we adopted countermeasures and | or arranged for balance sheet measures during the reporting year to cover all discernible risks within the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, and those of a defined probability of occurrence, that had the potential to damage our net worth, financial situation and profitability.
For the purposes of this report, we have assessed the probability of occurrence of the risks shown below and, in the adjacent columns, classify their particular significance for the entire Group.

Internal Control Procedures
Introduction
The objectives defined by the Chairman for the internal control system of Sartorius Stedim Biotech are as follows:
­ Prevent risks that would endanger the quality of the assets of Sartorius Stedim Biotech or even its existence;
­ Ensure that the executive management activities, the transactions completed and the conduct of employees comply with the guidelines defined by exec-

utive management, applicable laws and regulations, the fundamental values, standards and internal rules of the business and the ethical codes and conventions of the healthcare industry; ­ Ensure that accounting and financial information and management data provided to the executive management of the company accurately reflect the operations of Sartorius Stedim Biotech; ­ Prevent risks arising from operations, errors or fraud, especially in the accounting and financial area.
Scope of Internal Control
The internal control system described covers the parent company and its affiliates.
Components of Internal Control
Environment for Internal Control
The core of any business is its people (their individual attributes, including integrity, ethical values and expertise) and the environment in which they operate. They are the engine that drives the organization and the foundation that supports the company.

66 To Our Shareholders Opportunity and Risk Report

Risk Assessment Process -- Risk Mapping
The company must be aware of, and deal with, the risks it faces. It must set itself objectives and integrate them into its sales, production, marketing, financial and other activities so that the organization operates in concert. It must also establish mechanisms to identify, analyze and manage the related risks.
Control Activities
These control activities are undertaken at every level of the Group to ensure that internal control is efficient: checking the accuracy, completeness, authorization, validation and recording of transactions and ensuring that different people discharge different duties so as to reduce the risk of errors or fraud.
Information and Communication
The availability of accurate, reliable and complete information is essential both to achieve business objectives and to enable proper reporting to all parties concerned in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
Monitoring, Control and Management
Responsibilities and authorities must be defined and understood at all levels of a company for internal control to function effectively. Duties must be assigned in such a way that a person's work is always checked and approved by a different person. Where the size of the local unit concerned permits, responsibility for initiating, authorizing, recording and processing transactions must always be assigned to different individuals.
Unit management is responsible for maintaining internal checks and internal control at all times.

Internal Controlling Roles
Executive Management
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the internal control system and management at all levels. He is also responsible for the development, operation, monitoring and management of the internal control and controlling systems and for providing the necessary assurances that these steps have been implemented.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for carrying out any necessary reviews and evaluations of the internal controlling procedures, including those relating to financial information, and also assists with the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements. For further information about the Audit Committee, see page 90.
Risk Management
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is inevitably exposed to a wide variety of risks by the nature of its operations around the world. Accordingly, an internal risk management system has been set up to help identify, assess and manage these risks efficiently. Within this risk management system, an ad hoc committee comprised of representatives of different departments regularly studies current issues of risk management. This enables the committee to provide executive management with an overview of the risk to which the company is exposed, enabling it to take appropriate action when required.
Internal Auditing Department

Forecast Report
Pharmaceutical Industry Continues to Grow
Strong, long-term trends are fueling growth in the global pharmaceutical industry. Major factors contributing to this expansion include the growing and aging global population, combined with increasing access to healthcare, especially in the emerging and developing countries. However, the expiration of patents and measures aimed at limiting national healthcare expenditures will have a dampening impact. Market observers estimate that growth of the world's pharmaceutical market will be between 4% and 7% per year during the period up to 2021.
The U.S. pharmaceutical market ­ the world's largest ­ is expected to grow at a rate of 6% to 9% on average during the period between 2017 and 2021. Expansion will be driven principally by new, innovative medications, while moderating effects will result from expiring patents for lucrative medications and increased use of biosimilars.
Growth in the European pharmaceutical market is likely to remain moderate over the next few years as continuing austerity measures affect its national healthcare systems. Thus, average growth of between 1% and 4% is projected for the region up to 2021.
It is expected that the "pharmerging markets," especially China, will continue to expand at an aboveaverage rate. Market observers estimate growth at around 6% to 9% annually from 2017 to 2021 due to demographic trends, rising investment in governmentled healthcare systems and increased private spending.

Biotech Sector Records Above-Average Growth
Market observers forecast that the biopharma segment of the pharmaceutical market, which has been enjoying particularly strong growth for years, will continue to outperform the market. Forecasts project that the global biotechnology market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 9% during the period from 2017 to 2022, which would increase the market volume from the current 214 billion to 326 billion. The share of biological medications and vaccines in the total revenue generated by the pharmaceutical market is expected to rise from roughly 26% at present to around 30% in 2022.
This dynamic trend will be driven largely by the increasing market penetration by already approved biopharmaceuticals and an expanded range of indications. Thanks to technical and medical advances, the field of applications for substances manufactured using biotech production methods is growing steadily. For example, biopharmaceuticals are increasingly being used in yet-to-be fully explored therapeutic areas and in the treatment of rare diseases that have thus far been untreatable. This relatively young market segment is driving sector growth with its highly innovative strength, as reflected in the strong research and development pipelines. Overall, around 40% of the medications in R&D pipelines are based on biological manufacturing processes. These include more than 800 biosimilars and 500 "biobetters," i.e., generic versions of biologic agents with better efficacy or fewer side effects than the original compounds.
The high level of innovation and R&D productivity in the biotechnology sector are mirrored by the rising number of new product approvals. In the USA, for example, the number of newly approved biological medications during the last five years was approximately 120% higher than the number of approvals from the period 2008 to 2012.

Biosimilars, which are biological medications highly similar to already approved reference medicines, will continue to increase in importance during the years to come. They are less expensive than the reference compound, while having similar properties in terms of their application, dosage and efficacy. Increased use of biosimilars thus brings the prospects of lower individual treatment costs and financial relief for national healthcare systems. This is a goal likely to be pursued by the industrialized countries, where aging populations are leading to rising demand for medications and notably higher expenditures. In many developing countries, biosimilars offer initial access to biopharmaceutical substances. The development of national production capacities is receiving political support. Regulatory requirements are generally much less strict in developing countries than in the industrialized countries; thus, the biosimilars market could experience substantial growth in the emerging economies over the next few years.
Eight of the strongest selling biopharmaceuticals are due to lose their patent protection in the United States and Europe by 2020. Various pharmaceutical manufacturers have therefore announced the market launch of biosimilars that have already been approved. At present, around 30 companies are actively working on the development of such biopharmaceutical products for 16 different molecules. At the same time, the biosimilars market will also see a gradual decline in regulatory and patent-related barriers and challenges to marketing these products ­ factors that have thus far slowed development of the market. Against this backdrop, current estimates project accelerated growth over the next few years. By 2020, sales of biosimilars could multiply to between U.S. $25 billion and U.S. $35 billion.
Furthermore, some spectacular achievements have been made in cell therapy lately. The goal of cell therapy is to prevent, treat, heal or mitigate human disease or injury through the use of autologous,

allogenic or xenogenic cells that have been manipulated ex vivo or otherwise altered. Regardless of the type of cell therapy, the technologies used for manufacturing of the respective therapeutic products are similar to those employed for manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals. The growing number of cell-based therapies currently in clinical development and the rising number of approved cell therapies already in use could lead to increasing demand for the corresponding production capacities in the future.
Stable Growth Expected in the World's Laboratory Market
According to Frost & Sullivan, global demand for laboratory products is likely to remain stable, with growth of 2.8% projected for 2018. The key U.S. market is expected to generate growth of 3.0%, in part due to the sustained strength of the biopharmaceutical industry and its business-friendly climate. In Europe, experts anticipate an increase of just 1.7% owing to the comparatively moderate economic growth and as a result of uncertainties in the wake of the Brexit referendum. However, the European Union's increased budget for academic research will likely spur mid-term growth. As before, market observers expect the highest growth rates in Asian countries, such as China and India, in which the individual laboratory markets are likely to grow around 7.5% to 8.8% in 2018.

Future Business Development
The outlook for fiscal 2018 incorporates the risks and opportunities outlined in this report. As we supply the biopharmaceutical industry, our business development is generally driven by stable long-term trends. Therefore, economic fluctuations play less of a role than, for example, decisions of regulatory agencies regarding drug approvals or the use of medications.
Based on the assumption that the relevant trends for Sartorius Stedim Biotech have been correctly anticipated, we expect sales revenue to grow considerably again in 2018. Thus, we forecast that sales revenue will rise by about 7% to 10% in constant currencies compared to a strong prior-year base. Management expects that the underlying EBITDA margin will rise by approx. 0.5 percentage points in constant currencies (2017: 27.3%).
All forecasts are based on constant currencies. Due to the latest currency developments, especially in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, these figures may have to be reviewed as the year progresses.
In light of its continued strong organic growth, Sartorius Stedim Biotech invests into its production capacities. For 2018, we thus expect a capex-ratio of about 15%. A focus will be the expansion of our Yauco plant for single-use bags and filters.
With regard to our financial position, we forecast that by the end of 2018, the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA will be approximately on the same level as in the previous year of 0.4 reported, without taking any potential acquisitions into account.

Directors' Meeting Attendance Fees
Directors' meeting attendance fees are calculated on an annual basis. The method of calculating these fees remains the same. It is as follows.
The directors receive directors' meeting attendance fees whose amount and allocation are established by the Board of Directors in consideration of the limits set by the ASM:

To Our Shareholders Financial Statements of the Parent Company Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. as of December 31, 2017 77

­ Each Director receives a fixed remuneration of 25,000 per year, to be paid after the annual financial statements have been adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and which falls due for payment after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The chairman of the Board receives twice this amount. Furthermore, members of the Board receive an attendance fee of 1,200 per meeting and reimbursement of its expenses in addition to the annual remuneration.
­ For their membership of any committee each Director receives a lump-sum amount of 4,000 per full year of membership in addition to the attendance fee of 1,200. Insofar as they hold the chair, instead of this, they receive a lump-sum amount of 8,000 per full year that they hold the chairperson in addition to the attendance fee. The remuneration for the activities on any committee is

due together with the remuneration under the terms of previous Subsection hereof.

80 Corporate Governance The Board of Directors and its Committees

The Board of Directors and its Committees

The Board of Directors
The company is administered by a Board of Directors composed of seven members, four of whom are independent. The directors are appointed for a three-year period.
The organization of the works of the Board and its composition must be suited to the shareholding structure, to the size and the nature of the activity of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. and the particular circumstances it can face.
Composition of the Board of Directors as of 31 December 2017
For historical reasons due to the shareholding structure of the Company, the composition of the Board of Directors and its Committees reflected the search by our reference shareholder of a long lasting balance between the Directors representing these shareholders, the Independent Directors and the executives.
Our reference shareholder takes its own responsibility towards the other shareholders, direct and distinct from the Board of Directors' one. He takes particular care to avoid possible conflicts of interests in the transparency of the information provided to the market and to fairly take all interests into account.
The Board of Directors should consider what would be the desirable balance in its membership and that of the Committees it has stablished, in particular in the representation of women and men, nationalities and diversity of skills by taking measures appropriate to guarantee to the shareholders and to the market that its missions are carried out with the necessary independence and objectivity. It makes public in the Reference Document the objectives, methods and results of its politics on these subjects.

Registered Addresses
With regards to their social mandates, the members of the Board of Directors and of the General Management are domiciled at the Company's headquarters.
Independent Directors
The Company being controlled by a majority shareholder, the portion of independent administrator board members should be at least a third of the Board. As of 31 December 2017, the Board of Directors of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. is composed of 57% of independent members under the independence criteria defined by the APEF-MEDEF code.
Pursuant to the principles of good corporate governance, the independent members may not be principal shareholders, employees, former Group employees, suppliers or bankers of the Group or major customers, nor may they have any other link likely to impair their judgment.
In accordance with the internal rules of the Board of Directors and in application of the AFEP-MEDEF code, the independence of directors is assessed each year with respect to the following criteria.
An independent director:
- May not be an employee or senior executive employee or director of his or her parent company or of one of its consolidated companies and may not have been so during the five previous years (criterion 1);
­ May not be a senior executive of a company in which the company directly or indirectly holds a director's position or in which an employee as such or a senior executive of the company (either currently or having been so for less than five years) holds a director's position (criterion 2);
­ May not be a significant client, supplier, business banker or investment banker of the company or of its group, for which the company or its group represents a significant part of its business (criterion 3);
­ May not have any close family ties with one of the senior executives (criterion 4);
­ May not have been an auditor of the company for the five past years (criterion 5);
­ May not have been a director of the company for more than twelve years (criterion 6).

86 Corporate Governance The Board of Directors and its Committees

In addition to the abovementioned criteria, the Board of Directors analyses other factors, such as length of service on the Board and the ability to understand the issues and risks, prior to making a decision on whether a director qualifies as independent.
­ More specifically, concerning the length of service criterion, the Board does not strictly consider the latter to neutralize the independent nature of a director, but rather as a quality that improves critical thinking and openness, enabling in particular a greater ability to question, which is essential in debating the directions taken by the company. For further information, see the section "Corporate Governance ­ AFEP-MEDEF code recommendations that have not been followed" in the above Registration Document.

­ As part of the Assessment of the Board of Directors ,the Board of Directors goes through all the criteria listed above and currently it states that it has four independent directors: Mr. Susan Dexter, Mrs Anne-Marie Graffin, Mrs Liliane de Lassus and Mr Henri Riey.

1) Particular attention was paid to the situation of Mrs. Susan Dexter, who holds a position at Latham Biopharm Group Inc., a company with whom Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH signed a consultancy agreement, which expired on December 31, 2017 and has not been renewed. The Board noted that the relation between these two companies were not significant in terms of their volume. In addition, the possibility for Sartorius to use a panel of providers having similar expertise than Latham Biopharm Group, in a competitive context, rules, out all relationship of dependence.

Balanced representation of women and men
Each year, the Board of Directors examines the desired balance in its composition and that of its committees, seeking in particular a balanced representation of men and women, and a wide diversity of skills and nationalities, reflecting as best it can both the highly technical and global nature of the company's business.
Specifically, as regards the target of 40% women to be reached under the provisions of Article L. 225 - 18 - 1 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors has put significant effort into searching for skilled, independent and dedicated female directors with a proven level of expertise in biotechnologies or related industries.

Assessment of the Board of Directors
The internal rules of the Board of Directors require that once a year the Board devotes an item on its agenda to discuss its functioning and ensures that a formal assessment is carried out. For this purpose, in December 2017 all members of the Board completed a questionnaire on the following topics:
­ the Board's composition;
­ the mode and structure of governance;
­ the effectiveness of the Board of Directors;
­ the Board's working methods;
­ the areas of competence of the Board's members;
­ areas for improvement.

Corporate Governance The Board of Directors and its Committees 87

Corporate Governance Code / AFEP MEDEF
Since fiscal 2008, the Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. Board of Directors therefore decided to adopt the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations as the reference code for corporate governance (see www.medef.fr).
The AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (the "Code") defines a set of regulations for good and responsible corporate governance. It follows the "comply or explain" principle that is implemented in most countries of the European Union. If a listed company does not comply with a recommendation of this Code, it must explain this in its corporate governance report.
In accordance with article 27.1 of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies in effect from the presented date (the "Code"); listed companies referring to the code are required to precisely identify, in their Reference Document, the application of these recom-mendations. In case on non-application of one of the-se provisions, companies are required to provide a comprehensible, relevant and circumstantial explanati-on according to the rule "apply or explain". It is recommended by the AMF (recommendation n°2014 - 08 of 22 September 2014) that companies indicate in a specific table each recommendation that are not ap-plied and the related explanations.

The Board of Directors has opted for the Chairman's functions meeting of the Board Committee and as Chief Executive Officer in order to simplify the company operational management and increase its effectiveness. This organization turned out to be a factor of efficient governance considering the organization of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group. Mr Joachim Kreuzburg is Chairman of the Board and CEO of Sartorius AG mother company of the group. He is on one hand bound to the controlling shareholder and on the other hand very involved in the business affairs of the Group which he particularly knows and experienced.

Also, the Board of Directors is proceeding to an annual evaluation of its functioning to identify the improvements that could be made. The result of the evaluation shows that this organization is well suited for the interests of the company.

EXPLANATIONS The Board of Directors decided to create a Remunerations and Nominations Committee. To this end the committee in charge of remunerations and nominations will during fiscal year 2018 amend its bylaws to state clearly its new functions. For historical reasons related to the company share options, the composition of the specialized committee was reflecting the research by our shareholder in order to reflect a balance between the directors representing the shareholders and the independent directors.

DIRECTOR'S COMPENSATION Attendance fees / retained actions The director should be a shareholder personally and hold a fairly significant number of shares to the received attendance fees: by default if he does hold the shares upon assuming his functions, he must use the acquired attendance fees when acquired. It is the responsibility of the Board to complete otherwise this list of directors' basic obligations
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT IN CASE OF APPOINTMENT AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR When an employee is appointed as executive director, it is recommended to terminate his or her employment contract with the company or with a company affiliated to the group, whether through contractual termination or resignation23
COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Award Awards of options and shares to executive directors must be conditional on the attainment of performance targets.

The Chairman of the compensation committee of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, non-independent, is also the Chairman of the compensation committee of the Sartorius Group AG for management and coherency reasons.
Beyond the application of the article L 225 - 25 of the French Code of Commerce, The Board of Directors has left until now the freedom to each director to invest insignificantly for the company. He has also subscribed these ethic principals in its internal ruling The executive members not perceiving attendance fees, therefore no stock options purchase obligations have been formulated to them.
This recommendation is only applied to 2 out of 4 of the directors. According to German law it is not necessary to change such employment contract when someone becomes a Managing Director of the company he works for. It should be also considered that Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is controlled by a German majority shareholder and the biggest group company is a German company, therefore in this respect German rules and regulations are very common in the whole group and have to be observed at the respective group level.
Mr Joachim Kreuzburg is representing the Group Sartorius AG, his compensation policy is deliberated and decided at the level of the mother house of Sartorius Stedim Biotech. The performance action elements are detailed in the document reference within the parts of the company's governance Report and the internal control (cf. p96). All particular topics related to these awards are duly detailed in the reference document remuneration report.

An executive director may not be awarded any stock option or performance share at the time of his or her departure. In accordance with legal provisions, if stock options or performance shares are not awarded to all employees, then it is necessary to provide for another scheme involving them in corporate performance (incentive scheme, profit-sharing scheme other than the mandatory scheme, granting of bonus shares, etc.). The total amount of the stock option plans and performance shares must represent a small fraction of the capital, and the right balance must be struck according to the benefits derived by shareholders from the management. The level of dilution must be taken into account.

The shares Mr Joachim Kreuzburg has received in course of December 2015 are not subject to any performance criteria. Nevertheless he has to give back all of the shares if he leaves the Sartorius AG before 11 November 2017 and half of the shares if he leaves Sartorius AG before 11 November 2019. The stock option policy is run exclusively under the application of German Law provisions and the code of governance that shall apply.

Remuneration of the Executive Director and Non-executive Members of the Board

Information about the Remuneration of the Executive Director
The Executive Director, Joachim Kreuzburg, is at the same time Chairman of the Executive Board of the major shareholder of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. He receives his fixed and variable remuneration from the major shareholder Sartorius AG. A portion of his remuneration is charged to Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., reflecting his role as Executive Director of the Company. A portion of his total remuneration is charged to the SSB Group for his management services based on his proportional work for Sartorius Stedim Biotech (please refer also to section "Related Parties" of the "Financial Statements and Notes"). This allocation key is applied to all components of his remuneration.
Remuneration of the Executive Director who is chairman of the Executive Board of the major shareholder Sartorius AG (Joachim Kreuzburg)
General and Fixed Remuneration
The total amount of the remuneration of the chairman of the Executive Board of Sartorius AG, as well as for other members of this Executive Board, reflects the scope of the responsibilities of the Executive member concerned, the Executive member's personal performance, the company's economic situation and sustainable progress. In addition, this amount is benchmarked with those at peer companies and with the vertical remuneration structure within the company as well as at peer companies. Remuneration is comprised of both fixed non-performance-based components and of variable performance-based components, and is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains appropriate. The variable performance-based remuneration components consist of those to be paid annually and of multi-year components intended to have a long-term incentive. Fixed non-performance-based remuneration is paid in the year in which it is granted. For 100% target achievement, the variable annual and long-term performance-based components generally represent half of total remuneration, which excludes pension commitments under a defined benefit plan as well as fringe benefits. The targets set for the performancebased remuneration refer to financial key figures of the Sartorius Group in which the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is fully consolidated. Specifically, Sartorius Stedim Biotech represents approx. 80% of the business and assets of the Sartorius Group. There-

fore, the development of Sartorius Stedim Biotech has a significant influence on the financial results of the Sartorius Group and thus on the variable remuneration of Sartorius AG´s Executive Board members. However, all components of the remuneration described below refer to parameters and financial key figures of the Sartorius Group in total.
Variable Remuneration
The variable portion of this remuneration contains components that are paid annually (subordinate targets measured against sales revenue | order intake, underlying EBITDA and ratio of net debt to EBITDA) and components determined by multi-year assessment (measured against (i) consolidated net profit and (ii) the phantom stock plan).
The components to be annually paid and the elements determined by multi-year assessment each make up one half of the target achievement that is possible. A cap is provided for all variable components to be paid.
Of the total that can be awarded for 100% target achievement, the subordinate targets of the components to be annually paid are weighted as follows:
­ sales revenue | order intake 15%;
­ EBITDA 20%;
­ ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA 15%.
The subordinate targets constituted by (i) consolidated net profit and (ii) the phantom stock plan as components determined by multi-year assessment are each weighted at 25%.

Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Director and Non-executive Members of the Board 101

a) Annually paid variable remuneration
The portion of the variable remuneration that is to be paid annually depends on the degree to which the target is achieved, which the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG defines by setting each individual subordinate target. Thus, target achievement is subdivided into the previously mentioned three subordinate targets, which are each separately paid.
Sales Revenue | Order Intake
If the degree of target achievement is below 90%, no remuneration is paid. If 90% is achieved, 50% of the sum awarded is paid out. Thereafter, payment increases linearly up to a target achievement of 104%, at which a maximum of 120% of the sum awarded is paid out. The degree of payment of 120% constitutes the cap for this subordinate target at the same time.
Underlying EBITDA
If the degree of target achievement is below 70%, no remuneration is paid. If 70% is achieved, 70% of the sum awarded is paid out. Thereafter, payment increases linearly up to a target achievement of 120%, at which a maximum of 120% of the sum awarded is paid out. The degree of payment of 120% constitutes the cap for this subordinate target at the same time.
Ratio of Net Debt to underlying EBITDA
No remuneration is paid if the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA achieved is below the lower limit defined. If this defined value is achieved, 50% of the sum awarded is paid out. Thereafter, payment increases linearly up to a target achievement of 120%, at which a maximum of 120% of the sum awarded is paid out. The degree of payment of 120% constitutes the cap for this subordinate target at the same time.
b) Variable remuneration with multi-year components
On the one hand, components determined by multiyear assessment depend on the degree to which the target is achieved, which the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG defines by setting the subordinate target constituted by consolidated net profit. On the other hand, these multi-year components depend on the value of the monetary sum ascribed to the Executive Board member at the beginning of each year.

Consolidated Net Profit
For this subordinate target, the basis for assessment is the consolidated net profit after non-controlling interest excluding amortization (amortization of the value of intangible assets, such as customer databases or patents, which results from purchase price allocation within the scope of business combinations pursuant to IFRS 3). Target achievement for assessing annual variable remuneration is based on the average taken over a period of three fiscal years, beginning with the present fiscal year.
To smooth the amounts to be paid out, a partial payment amounting to 50% of the target achievement for a fiscal year will be effected. Any overpayments as a result of these partial payments will be offset in the following year against other remuneration components (fixed or variable). No partial payment will be made in the year prior to an Executive Board member's resignation. Full account is thus taken of any negative results, and the effects thereof continue to have an impact on the remuneration of the Executive Board member concerned even after he or she has left the company. If a defined minimum value is attained, payment of the awarded sum will increase linearly from 0% to a maximum of 120% of the subordinate target achievement value defined by the Supervisory Board. The degree of payment of 120% constitutes the cap for this subordinate target at the same time.
Phantom Stock Plan
Through the issue of shadow shares, called phantom stocks, the Executive Board members are treated as if they were owners of a certain number of shares in Sartorius AG, without, however, being entitled to receive dividends. The development of the value of these phantom stocks are linked with the development of the Sartorius share; both increases and decreases in the share price are taken into account. Later, this phantom stock is valuated based on the share price at the time and its equivalent is paid out, provided that the associated conditions are met. Phantom stocks cannot be traded and does not entail any share subscription rights.

102 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Director and Non-executive Members of the Board

According to the Sartorius phantom stock plan, each Executive Board member is credited at the beginning of every year with phantom stock units valued at an agreed monetary sum. The value of these phantom stocks can be paid out only as an entire annual tranche. Payment can be requested, at the earliest, after a period of four years and no later than after eight years.
An Executive Board member is entitled to receive payment for phantom stock units only if the share price at the time of the payment request has appreciated at least 7.5% per year relative to the time the phantom stock was assigned or if the share price outperformed the TecDAX® as a comparative index. The phantom stock plan rules out subsequent changes to the parameters used for comparative stock valuation.
The amount to be paid is capped at a maximum of 2.5 times the share price at the time the phantom stocks were assigned, based in each case on the actual annual tranche concerned.
Assignment of this phantom stock and payment of its monetary equivalent depend on the mean value calculated from the average prices of the preference share in the closing auction of Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last 20 days of trading of the previous year or over the last 20 days of trading prior to submission of the payment request. This serves to compensate for any short-term fluctuations in the share price.
Payment for phantom stocks is blocked for the four weeks preceding the scheduled publication date of quarterly and preliminary year-end results and for 20 days of trading on the stock exchange following the actual publication of quarterly and preliminary year-end results. These blackout periods are intended to prevent Executive Board members from profiting from potential insider knowledge.
Pension Commitments
According to the company's remuneration policy, Executive Board members of Sartorius AG receive performance-related benefit commitments under a defined benefit plan when reappointed for the first time. In addition to including a basic pension, these commitments provide for the Executive Board member to make his own contribution from his variable earnings and for the company to match this contribution by a bonus amount. An Executive Board member may choose to receive such defined benefits in the form of a monthly retirement pension for old age or as a onetime payment to cover the member's retirement pen-

sion for old age and invalidity as well as in the form of survivor's benefits for the surviving spouse and children of the decedent.
Beyond such commitments, Joachim Kreuzburg is additionally entitled under a former company pension scheme to receive performance-based retirement benefits based on the salary of a German federal civil servant classified as grade 10 of salary class B for ministry officials according to the Federal Civil Service Remuneration Act [Bundesbesoldungsgesetz]. Such benefits are paid in the form of a retirement pension for old age and invalidity as well as in the form of survivors' benefits for the surviving spouse and children of the decedent.
After a member has turned 65, this shall be considered the regular age limit at which this member shall automatically be entitled to receive all such benefits.
Other Remuneration Components
The remuneration system provides that the Supervisory Board of Sartorius AG at its discretion may grant an Executive Board member special compensation based on that member's exceptional performance.
Severance Caps
The service contracts include a severance pay cap of a maximum of two annual salaries to cover cases in which Sartorius AG Executive Board membership is terminated prematurely. Potential amounts have to be paid by Sartorius AG.
Non-competition Clause
All Executive Board members of Sartorius AG have a post-contractual non-competition obligation, which is in accordance with German law. This obligation will last for two years after an Executive Board member has left the Group. During this time, if the non-competition clause is not waived or terminated, this Executive Board member may claim half of his most recent annual remuneration received from the company.

Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Director and Non-executive Members of the Board 103

Fringe Benefits
The members of the Executive Board of Sartorius AG are each entitled to use a company car, reclaim expenses incurred on business travel and to be covered by accident insurance and D&O insurance as fringe benefits in addition to receiving the remuneration components mentioned. The D&O insurance provides for the application of a deductible or excess in the amount required by law.
Share-based Payment
The remuneration policy for Executive Board members of Sartorius AG does not provide for the transfer of Sartorius AG shares as compensation for members. An exception to this was made in December 2014 for Joachim Kreuzburg in connection with his third appointment as a member of the Executive Board and its Chairmann and CEO.
Consequently he holds now 100,000 shares of each class of shares. The shares transferred are subject to a holding period that will end on November 10, 2019. Should Joachim Kreuzburg leave the company after November 11, 2017, and before November 11, 2019, at his own request, Joachim Kreuzburg shall be required to transfer half of the shares granted to him back to the company. The amount resulting since December 16, 2014, for the shares granted are to be spread as an employee benefits expense over the full vesting period and recognized as such in profit or loss. In fiscal 2017, an amount of 496 K was accordingly recognized in the accounts of Sartorius Stedim Biotech.

Information about the Remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration for non-executive board members is defined in the Board of Directors internal rules of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. and comprises fixed remuneration, meeting attendance fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Members also serving as a member of a committee of the Board receive higher fixed remuneration.

120 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements

The following standards will be applicable in 2018 and 2019 respectively:
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, defines a comprehensive framework for determining whether, in which amount and at which point in time revenue is to be recognized. This standard replaces the existing guidance for revenue recognition, including IAS 18, Revenue; IAS 11, Construction contracts; and IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is applicable from 2018 on.
The Group ran a project to analyze the impact of the application of the new standard. On this basis, the Group does not expect any material changes regarding the amount and timing of revenues for the major part of the Group's business. However, especially in the case of construction contracts that were accounted for under IAS 11, the timing of revenue recognition may change as a result of the new criteria of IFRS 15 for revenue recognition over time.
The Group will not perform a full retrospective application of the new standard. Instead, the Group will recognize the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity. Furthermore, at initial application, the Group applies IFRS 15 only to contracts that are not considered completed contracts at the date of initial application. On the basis of the assessment of the construction contracts which are not completed at the date of initial application it has been concluded that revenue in the amount of about 5 million which has been recognized in the past would be recognized at a point in time under IFRS 15, i.e. when the respective Integrated Solutions project is closed. Accordingly, revenue in future periods will be higher by this amount in comparison to the former revenue recognition policy. In case that revenue is recognized over time under IFRS 15 for construction contracts, the progress will continue to be measured on the basis of the costs incurred in relation to the planned costs of the Integrated Solutions project.
Furthermore the application of IFRS 15 will lead to extended disclosure requirements regarding revenues from contracts with customers.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, ultimately changes the rules for classification and measurement and impairment testing of financial instruments, as well as the guidelines for hedge accounting.
The Group has conducted an analysis of its financial instruments and classified the financial instruments according to IFRS 9. On this basis, it is not expected that the new regulations regarding the classification

of financial assets based on the business model and the related contractual cash flows change the Group's financial statements significantly. The Group's financial assets are mainly held to collect. Furthermore, the contractual cash flows of the financial assets mainly arise from payments of interest and principal (SPPI). On this basis, no material changes result from the new classification and measurement guidelines in IFRS 9.
The Group decided to apply the new hedge accounting guidelines in IFRS 9 from 2018 on. The hedging relations of the Group also qualify as such under IFRS 9. The Group uses forward transactions to hedge cash flow risks that result from changes of foreign exchange rates in relation to sales of products and designates only the spot element of the hedging instrument. Under IFRS 9, changes of the value of the forward element will be recognized by the Group in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss as the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. This change is expected to reduce the volatility of the Group's profit or loss. As of December 31, 2017, the amount which is not designated as hedging amounts to about 3 million.
With regard to the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 replaces the incurred-loss model with the expected-loss model. Impairments are either recognized on the basis of the twelve-months expected credit loss or on the basis of the lifetime expected credit losses. With regard to the financial assets of the Group, especially the simplified approach which is applied to trade receivables is of relevance. However, due to the low credit losses incurred in the past years, the Group does not expect to recognize material additional impairments under the assumption of a constant economic outlook. Besides trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents are the most material financial assets with respect to the statement of financial position of the Group. Based on the current knowledge, the impairment which would have to be recognized according to IFRS 9 would not be material due to the high creditworthiness of the counterparties and the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents. Overall, the impact of the new impairment approach introduced by IFRS 9 is expected to be limited.
The Group will not adjust prior year financial figures with respect to classification and measurement (including impairment) when applying IFRS 9 initially. Upon initial application, differences between the carrying amounts as of December 31, 2017, and those at the beginning of the period in which IFRS 9 is applied for the first time (January 1, 2018), are recognized in equity. Under consideration of the

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements 121

impact of the new standard as described above, this will especially apply to the carrying amount of the trade receivables and the reclassification of the forward element of the hedging instruments as of the balance sheet date into the "cost of hedging reserve". Due to materiality considerations, no impairment will be recognized for cash and cash equivalents. In addition, IFRS 9 requires new disclosures, especially with regard to hedge accounting, credit risk and expected credit losses.
The application of IFRS 16, Leases, is mandatory for periods from 2019 on. IFRS 16 introduces a standardized accounting model according to which leases are generally to be recognized on the lessee's balance sheet. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use a lease asset, as well as a liability resulting from the lease, which represents its obligation to make lease payments. There are exemptions for short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets. Accounting for the lessor is comparable to that of the current standard; i.e., lessors continue to classify leases as financial or operating leases.
The Group has started to analyze the effects of this new standard and does not plan to apply the standard earlier than 2019. At the current stage of analysis, the Group plans to use the exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets and to recognize the corresponding lease payments as an expense generally on a straight-line basis over the particular lease term.
IFRS 16 will likely lead to an increase in fixed assets and financial liabilities. Based on its present level of knowledge, the Group does not expect any significant impact overall on its most important key figures, such as equity ratio or underlying EBITDA. For example, on the basis of the Group's future financial obligations in relation to operating leases as reported on December 31, 2017, the equity ratio would be reduced by about 1% and the underlying EBITDA-margin would be slightly increased.

3. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are based on the principle of the historical cost of acquisition, construction or production, with the exception of the items reflected at fair value, such as financial assets held for trading or available for sale, and derivatives.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group include the annual financial statements of all companies, which are controlled directly or indirectly by Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. In terms of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group Sartorius Stedim Biotech controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Such enterprises are included in the consolidated financial statements from the time when Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. or its subsidiaries obtains such control until the date on which control ceases.
Subsidiaries have been included on the basis of their annual financial statements for the same reporting period as the parent company, using uniform Group recognition and measurement methods.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted according to the acquisition method. The identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities are generally recorded at fair value on the date of combination.
For significant acquisitions, the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent third-party valuation specialists. The valuations are based on the information available at the acquisition date.

122 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements

The Group determines goodwill at the acquisition date as:
­ the fair value of the consideration transferred; and
­ the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and
­ if the business combination is carried out in stages, the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree; less
­ the net recognized amount for the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the difference is negative, the purchase gain is recognized immediately in income.
Expenses directly related to business combinations are recorded in the profit or loss as they are incurred.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is the euro (financial statements presented in thousands of euros). In the financial statements of each company, transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary at the exchange rate applicable on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and debts denominated in a foreign currency have been translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Rate gains and losses have been recognized in profit or loss for the period.
Translation of financial statements prepared in foreign currencies
Subsidiaries' financial statements prepared in foreign currencies have been translated pursuant to IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, in accordance with the concept of a functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries have been regarded as independent subdivisions of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group. The assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The incomes, expenses, and cash flows of these entities have been translated using the average rate for the year, to the extent that this rate represents an approximate value of exchange rates

used as of the date of the transaction in the absence of significant fluctuations. Resulting translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.
For long-term loans for which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, the Group applies the principle of "net investment in a foreign operation." Exchange differences resulting from these loans are recognized in other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 21.32.
The exchange rates for major currencies against the euro were considered as follows:

Sales Revenue
All revenues derived from the selling of products or rendering of services are recognized as sales revenue. Other operational revenues are recognized as other operating income. Revenues from the sale of goods are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, the company retains neither continuing managerial nor effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company.
Revenues from the rendering of services are recognized in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements 123

Construction Contracts
A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenues from construction-type projects are generally recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs to date compared to the total estimated contract costs. An expected loss on the construction contract is recognized as an expense immediately.
Contracts are disclosed under receivables or liabilities from percentage of completion. If cumulative work (contract costs and contract result) exceeds the advance payments received, the construction contracts are recognized under receivables as amounts due from customers. If the balance after deduction of advance payments received is negative, this obligation from construction contracts is recognized as a liability under amounts due to customers.
Functional Costs
In general, operating expenses are recognized in profit or loss based on function within the Group. Expenses relating to cross-functional initiatives or projects are assigned to the respective functional costs based on an appropriate allocation principle.
The caption "cost of sales" includes the costs of products sold and the acquisition costs of merchandise sold. In addition to directly attributable expenses, such as raw materials and supplies, employee benefits expense and energy expenses, cost of sales also includes overhead, which can be allocated to the manufacturing area, and the corresponding depreciation and amortization.
The selling and distribution costs pertain, in particular, to the costs of the sales and marketing function, distribution, advertising and market research.
Research and development costs comprise the costs of research and product and process development, unless they are recognized as assets.
The item "general administrative expenses" mainly includes employee benefits expense and the cost of materials of the general administrative area.

All profit and loss items that cannot be allocated to one of the mentioned functional areas are recognized as other income and expenses. This includes essentially effects from translation of transactions in foreign currencies, sale of fixed assets, allowances on trade receivables and reorganization and other nonrecurring expenses. Income from grants related to income is recognized as other income, when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to the grants are complied with and the grants will be received. They are recognized systematically as income over the period in which the related costs are recorded.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset and are therefore part of the cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is defined as an asset that takes a substantial period of time (six to twelve months) to get ready for its intended use.
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are determined based on the respective local taxable income of the period and local tax rules. In addition, current income taxes include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet assessed. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in income taxes except for changes recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities (except in special cases provided by IAS 12) including loss carry forwards and tax credits. Measurement is based on the tax rates expected to be effective in the period in which an asset is realized or a liability is settled.
For this purpose, the tax rates and tax rules are used which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax losses and unused tax credits only to the extent that it is probable that the Group will have future taxable income against which they can be charged.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized.
According to IAS 36, goodwill acquired in a business combination may not be amortized, but rather, must be tested annually for impairment and as soon as there is any indication of asset impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill must be allocated to each of the acquirer's cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The CGU is the smallest group of assets that generates cash flows from continuing use largely independent of the cash flows from other assets.
Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired are recorded at cost less the accumulated, regular amortization that is calculated according to the straight-line method and any impairment loss. The useful life of an intangible asset is the period during which the Group expects to use the asset.
Costs incurred within the scope of the development of new products and methods were capitalized as internally generated intangible assets if the following criteria were met:
­ The technical feasibility of completing the intangible assets so that it will be available for use or sale;
­ The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
­ The ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
­ The demonstration of how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
­ The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset;
­ The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The capitalized development costs essentially cover the costs that were allocated to the staff involved in R&D, raw materials and supplies, outside services and directly attributable overhead. Intangible assets generated internally are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives, which generally do not exceed six years.

If an internally generated intangible asset may not be recognized, the development costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Costs for research activities are reported as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

Amortization of intangible assets is based on the following estimated useful lives:

Software Capitalized R&D expenses Customer relations and technologies
Brand name

2 to 5 years 4 to 6 years 5 to 15 years
5 years to indefinite

Property, Plant and Equipment

The "Property, plant and equipment" caption is recorded at cost, and related assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life using the straight line method.

Depreciation of fixed assets is based on the following periods of useful life:

Buildings Machinery Factory and office equipment

15 to 50 years 5 to 15 years 3 to 13 years

Tangible assets are subject to impairment tests whenever there are indicators of impairment.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements 125

Impairment of Non-financial Assets
The book values (carrying amounts) of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are subject to impairment testing if there is an indication of impairment and at least once a year for assets with an indefinite useful life or not yet available for use in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. When an asset is tested, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value ­ less costs to sell the asset or its CGU ­ and its value in use. In the event the individual asset's recoverable amount cannot be estimated, the recoverable amount of the asset's cash-generating unit (CGU) is estimated.
If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or a CGU) goes below its book value (carrying amount), this carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount (impairment allocated in priority to goodwill).
If the causes of the asset impairment are removed, the book value of the asset (or the CGU) is credited to the newly estimated recoverable amount. However, the book value increase is limited to the value that the asset (or CGU) would have had if no asset impairment loss had been recognized in previous financial years.
Leases
A lease is an arrangement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. According to IAS 17 a lease is classified as either an operating or a finance lease. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. All other leases are designated as operating leases.
When the Group is a lessee in a finance lease, the amount equal to the fair value of the leased property, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognized as an asset on the balance sheet and simultaneously recognized as a financial liability. The minimum lease payments essentially consist of the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability, which are measured according to the effective interest method. A leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected useful life or over the shorter lease term.

For an operating lease, the lease instalments to be paid by the lessee are recognized as expenses over the lease term and the lease payments received by the lessor are recognized as income, respectively. The leased asset continues to be recognized on the lessor's balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Inventories
Raw materials and supplies, including merchandise, are reported under "Inventories" at average cost. In principle, finished goods and work in progress are reported at cost of conversion. This cost includes direct costs, which can be allocated to these materials, and the appropriate portion of production and materials handling overhead, general administrative expenses and fixed assets at normal depreciation and | or amortization rates, based on the normal production capacity, provided that these expenses are caused by production.
Inventories must be valued at the lower amount of cost and the net realizable value. The net realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary for marketing, sales and distribution. Where inventory risks exist, such as the risk of reduced shelf life as a result of storage periods or limited usability, inventories are marked down accordingly.
Pension Obligations
Pension provisions and similar obligations are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group in accordance with actuarial principles. IAS 19, Employee Benefits, stipulates the Projected Unit Credit Method as the method of measurement. In addition to known pensions and life expectancies, this expected cash value method takes into account future salary and pension increases.
All remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are recognized in other comprehensive income (pension reserves) in accordance with the standard IAS 19.

126 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements

Provisions
A provision is recognized when a present obligation to third parties arising from past events has been incurred, an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the closing date. Provisions with a maturity of which the outcome is expected to intervene in over 12 months are discounted (determination of the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation).
Provisions are reviewed regularly and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. The estimate of the provision for warranty costs is based on historical experience.
Restructuring provisions are set up in connection with programs that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. In most cases, restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers, including leasing contracts. Restructuring provisions are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced.
Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets of the Group mainly include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, trade and loan receivables and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value.
Financial liabilities of the Group mainly comprise loans borrowed from Sartorius AG, trade payables, finance lease payables and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value.
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
Upon initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair value plus transaction costs, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss for which transaction costs, as incurred, are recognized in profit or loss. At the acquisition date the Group determines the classification of financial instruments into one of the categories provided by IAS 39 "Financial instruments: recognition and measurement" (Available-for-sale

financial assets, loans and receivables, financial liabilities). This classification determines the asset or liability financial valuation method in subsequent closing (amortized cost or fair value).
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Group considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. This mainly includes checks, cash on hand and deposits in banks. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value. For purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
Investments
Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and securities are measured at cost when no active market exists for these shares and securities and the fair values of these assets cannot be reliably measured.
Trade Receivables
Trade and other receivables are reported so that all discernible risks are covered. The book values of trade receivables and other receivables are representative of their fair value considering the maturity date and the credit risks. In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality from the date the credit was originally granted.
Loans and Receivables
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized using separate allowance accounts.
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured, except for derivative financial instruments, at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements 127

Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts, are measured at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied.
Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income (financial result). Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.
Statement of Cash Flows
In the statement of cash flows, cash flows are presented according to the allocation to operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Cash flows from operating activities are determined using the indirect method; i.e., expenses without an effect on payments are added to the profit before tax, while income without an effect on payments is subtracted. The cash flows from financing activities are composed primarily of changes in equity instruments including dividend payments and additions or repayments of loans.
4. Use of Judgments and Estimates
During the preparation of consolidated financial statements, management uses estimates and assumptions based on their best knowledge of the current and future situation. However, actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates and assumptions are revised on a regular basis, and the impact of changes in estimates is recognized prospectively.
In addition, Group management exercises its judgment in defining the accounting treatment of specific transactions when the existing Standards and Interpretations do not specifically treat the accounting problems concerned.

Assumptions and estimates primarily concern the following topics:
Business Combinations
The accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Group obtains control. The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
These measurements are based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used in calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group's future results of operations.
Impairment of Assets
An impairment test is conducted, if certain events lead to the assumption that an asset might be impaired. In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use. The calculation of the value in use is generally based on discounted cash flow methods using cash flow projections up to five years. These projections take into account past experience and represent management's best estimate about future sales revenue and cost developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of the value in use include estimated growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and tax rates. These estimates can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.

128 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements

Intangible Assets
The capitalization of self-constructed intangible assets also includes a significant level of judgment, e.g. the evaluation of feasibility of a development project, the expected market prospects and the determination of useful lives.
Trade and Other Receivables
The allowance for doubtful accounts involves significant management judgment and review of individual receivables based on individual customer creditworthiness and current economic trends as well as an analysis of historical bad debts on a portfolio basis.
Employee Benefits - Pension Provisions
Obligations for pension and other post-employment benefits are determined in accordance with actuarial valuations. These valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected salary increases and mortality rates. The discount rate assumptions are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period.
Due to changing market and economic conditions the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments and may lead to significant changes in pension and other post-employment benefit obligations.
Such differences are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. For a sensitivity analysis, see note 24, Pension and Employee Benefits Provisions.
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognized for legal or constructive obligations that exist as of the balance sheet date. To determine the amount of the obligations, certain estimates and assumptions have to be applied, including the determination of the probability and the amount of future outflows of resources. Typically, significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement obligations and legal proceedings.

Income Taxes
The Group operates in various tax jurisdictions and therefore has to determine tax positions under respective local tax laws and tax authorities' views which can be complex and subject to different interpretations of taxpayers and local tax authorities. Deferred tax assets have to be recognized for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond management's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will be recovered.
Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption. If management considers it probable that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset cannot be realized, the corresponding amount is not recorded as an asset.
Fair Value Measurement
A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, including Level 3 fair values (unobservable inputs).
If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

5. Operating Segments
According to IFRS 8, Operating Segments the identification of reportable operating segments is based on the "management approach"; i.e. the segments are defined analogously to the internal financial reporting of an entity. Therefore, an area of activity is to be considered an operating segment if its business activities may result in revenues and expenses, its operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker (= the Executive Members of the Board of Directors) and discrete financial information is available in its internal reporting. Internal control and reporting within Sartorius Stedim Biotech is based on the approach of operating as a "total solution provider" for its customers. Accordingly, there is only one single segment to be identified for Sartorius Stedim Biotech, driven by the product and customer perspective: Biopharm.
The key performance indicator of the operating segment of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is the so-called "underlying EBITDA", as the board monitors this performance measure at a consolidated level and they believe this measure is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance.

EBITDA corresponds to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; "underlying EBITDA" means EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items. In this connection, extraordinary items are expenses and income that are of an exceptional or a one-time nature and accordingly distort the sustainable profitability of a segment and have a material impact on the net worth, financial position and earnings of the Group. Examples of such items are restructuring expenses, large Group projects as well as proceeds or losses from the disposal, sale or other transfer of financial assets or of property, plant and equipment, provided that these are not of a recurrent nature.
Underlying EBITDA is not a defined performance measure in IFRS. The Group's definition of underlying EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities.
Segment assets and segment liabilities are not analyzed on a regular basis to the chief operating decision maker and are therefore not part of the segment report.

Acquisition Umetrics
On April 3, 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in the Swedish company MKS Instruments AB (Umetrics) based in Umeå, Sweden. In the meantime, the company has been renamed "Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB." In addition to these shares, the Group acquired further related intangible assets through asset deals as part of the business combination.
Umetrics is a globally leading provider of data analytics software for modeling and optimizing development and manufacturing processes, especially in the biopharmaceutical industry. The purchase price allocation is disclosed below:

Intangible assets Property, plant and equipment Trade receivables Other assets Cash and cash equivalents Deferred taxes - net Other liabilities Net assets acquired

The purchase price of approximately 75.0 million was paid in cash. The expenses directly attributable to the acquisition amounting to 0.2 million were recognized as other expenses in profit or loss. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets recognized are primarily technology-based and customer-related intangible assets. The goodwill represents synergies and not separable intangible assets such as the know-how of the workforce.
Since the consolidation of the entity on April 3, 2017, Umetrics contributed sales revenue of approximately 10 million and a positive net result to the Group's sales revenue and earnings. If the acquisition had taken place as of January 1, 2017, sales revenue of the Group would have been approximately 1,083.7 million. The profit for the period would have been 164.7 million.

Income taxes in France are calculated at 34.43% of the estimated taxable profit for the year. For Germany, a rate of approx. 30% was applied to the taxable income. Income generated outside France and Germany is taxed at rates applicable in the corresponding country.
Considering the French and German average tax rates and the impact of other tax legislations, the expected tax rate for the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is roughly 29%. The following table describes the difference between the expected tax expense and the income tax expenses reported for the particular financial year.

The caption reported as goodwill in the amount of 386,045 K is the capitalized difference in assets resulting from business combinations. According to IAS 36, goodwill acquired in a business combination may not be amortized, but rather, must be tested annually for impairment and as soon as there is any indication of asset impairment.
The increase recorded in 2017 concerns the acquisition of Umetrics (see note 8).
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill must be allocated to each of the acquirer's cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The cash-generating unit (CGU) represents the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management

purposes and may not be larger than a segment. Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group follows the strategy to be a total solution provider for its customers. Because of the various interdependencies within the business, the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored is that of the Biopharm segment. Therefore, the acquired goodwill is allocated to this group of CGU's.
As in 2016, the impairment test conducted for 2017 measures the recoverable amount on the basis of the value in use of the particular cash-generating unit (Biopharm segment). The cash flow forecasts consider previous experiences and are generally based on Group management's forecasts for a period of four years. The calculations were based on a terminal year growth rate of 2.5% for the years after 2021. This rate is derived from market expectations, which forecast significant growth rates for the targeted biopharmaceutical market. The major growth driver for the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group will be the aging and increase in population and the improved access to drugs in the emerging markets as well as the ongoing paradigm shift from reusable products to single-use products utilized in bio manufacturing by the biopharmaceutical industry.
The discount rates applied correspond to the weighted capital cost rates and were recognized as follows:

2016 After tax

In 2017, our impairment test did not result in recognition of impairment losses. In this context, various sensitivity analyses based on realistic variations of the assumptions disclosed above did not result in an impairment either. The following variations would theoretically represent the "break-even point":

138 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items

The Stedim brand name acquired in 2007 is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized. There is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the brand name is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. The brand name is tested annually for impairment at the level of the "Biopharm segment" cash-generating unit (CGU).
In 2017, the development costs of 20,788 K were recognized as assets (14,570 K in 2016). The capitalized development costs essentially covered the costs that were allocated to the staff involved in R&D, raw materials and supplies, outside services and directly attributable overhead. Internally generated intangible assets were amortized according to the straight-line method over their useful life, which usually did not exceed six years.
Amortization of intangible assets is allocated to the corresponding functions in the statement of profit or loss. For capitalized development costs, amortization is disclosed in the line "cost of sales".

Deferred Tax Assets
On the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax loss amounts carried forward of 18.2 million to be deducted from future taxable profits (12.0 million in 2016). A deferred tax amount was reported on approx. 9.8 million of these losses (8.3 million in 2016). Concerning the remaining losses to be carried forward, no deferred tax amounts were recognized because of the lack of visibility of future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets in the amount of 2.3 million (2.7 million) relate to companies that reported losses in this year under review or in the earlier reporting year.
Deferred Tax Liabilities
The deferred tax liabilities in connection with intangible assets refer to assets acquired in business combinations and consequently are mainly linked to customer relationships and technologies.
The Group did not record deferred tax liabilities on approx. 480 million (390 million) in cumulative undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be reinvested in these operations. When the dividends are paid out, an amount of 5% of the dividends will be taxed under the French and German taxation rules and, if applicable, with withholding tax. Furthermore, additional income tax consequences could arise in the case of an intermediate holding company.
In fiscal 2017, as in the previous years, the tax effect from hedging instruments, and the deferred tax assets from the recognition of the remeasurements of defined benefit liabilities (assets) and the amount of income taxes incurred by the net investment in a foreign operation were recognized in other comprehensive income. The income taxes recognized in other comprehensive income are disclosed as follows in the table:

The "Receivables from subsidiaries of the Sartorius AG Group" item refers to other companies of the Sartorius Group (please refer to section 32).
In some of the Group's business areas, the Group carries out long-term construction contracts. These customer-specific contracts are recognized by the application of IAS 11, Construction Contracts, based on the percentage of completion method.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items 141

The item "amounts due from customers for contract work" represents the net amount of costs incurred plus recognized profits less recognized losses and progress billings in connection with construction contracts. The aggregate amount of costs incurred and recognized profits | losses for projects in progress on the reporting date is 36,137 K (2016: 29,886 K). For these projects, advance payments of 29,170 K (2016: 26,756 K) were recorded. For this year, the contract revenue for projects in progress is 43,745 K (2016: 23,452 K).
Trade and other receivables were reported so that all discernible risks are covered. The book values of trade receivables and other receivables are representative of their fair value considering the maturity date and the credit risks. In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality from the date the credit was originally granted. There are no significant concentrations of credit risks due to a large base of unrelated customers. Accordingly, it is not necessary to make any further provision to cover risks beyond the allowances already considered.

For trade receivables of 55,318 K (2016: 50,026 K) that were past due on the reporting date, no valuation allowances were made as there was no material change in the creditworthiness of the debtors and it could be expected that they would pay the amounts outstanding. Overall the Group has experienced very low credit losses over the past years. The trade receivables not yet due and other financial assets were not written down as there was no indication of impairment.

22. Issued Capital
The annual ordinary shareholders` meeting on April 5, 2016 approved the following measures that are reflected in the comparative figures in the statement of changes in equity:
­ As of January 1, 2016 the company VL Finance SAS was merged into the group's parent company Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. The impact of this merger on the Group's equity was not material.
­ After completion of the merger it was decided to reduce the par value of each share from 1.00 to (1/6) multiplying the number of shares by 6 from 15,363,365 to 92,180,190.
­ Finally the par value of each share was increased from 0.1667 (rounded amount) to 0.20 by the way of incorporation of reserves. This transaction led to an increase in issued capital by 3,073 K and a respective reduction in reserves. The cost of the capital increase in the amount of 601 K was deducted from reserves.

24. Pension and Employee Benefits Provisions

Defined Contribution Plans
Most of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group companies make payments under defined contributions plans, primarily relating to government-run pension plans. In 2017, the total expense recognized for the defined contribution plans amounted to 19,527 K (2016: 17,532 K).

Defined Benefit Plans
Pension provisions and similar obligations have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements of Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group in accordance with actuarial principles. The remeasurements of defined benefit liabilities (asset) are shown in other comprehensive income according to the standard IAS 19. The actuarial losses, which were transferred to the pension reserves, essentially resulted from a change in the discount rate and totaled ­667 K (­1,574 K in 2016).
An amount of 25,068 K relates in particular to pension provisions for retirement pension plans in Germany. These provisions totaled 25,056 K in 2016 and primarily relate to direct commitments under defined benefit pension plans. Under these commitments, the employees earn benefits for each year of service rendered to the company. The benefits earned depend on the salary level and the age of the respective employees. The pension benefits are generally not funded with assets.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items 143

The assumed discount rates reflect the interest rates payable on the reporting date for high-quality corporate bonds with matching maturities and denominated in the relevant currencies (mainly Euro). If such corporate bonds are not available with matching long-term maturities or are insufficiently available, their matching interest rates are determined by extrapolation.
Measurement of the post-employment benefit obligations is based on the following actuarial assumptions:

For Germany:

The plan assets do primarily refer to insurance contracts in Germany and Switzerland, there are no major equity or debt investments included. The subsidiary in South Korea has deposited an amount of 1.8 million (1.4 million in 2016) to local banks as cash and cash equivalents.

Sensitivity Analysis
An increase | decrease of the actuarial assumptions would have the following impacts on the defined benefit obligations (a positive sign (+) means an increase of the obligation):

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another. Furthermore, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the same method that was applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognized in the statement of financial position (projected unit credit method).

Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group has signed a loan agreement with its parent company Sartorius AG which secures the financing of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group over the long term. The credit volume of this agreement is 300 million euros and the interest rate is variable with a credit margin based on arms'length principles.
The non-current loans and borrowings do not include the liabilities in connection with acquisitions which are presented in the caption "other non-current liabilities".

The derivative financial instruments represented the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward contracts.
The other non-current liabilities includes the non current part of the liability for the remaining purchase price for the cell culture media business of the company Lonza in the amount of 24,960 K. Currently it is expected that this liability will be paid in two tranches in 2018 and 2022.
Furthermore this item includes the liability for phantom units that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in the company AllPure Technologies, LLC (see note 23) amounting to 5,282 K. The purchase price depends on the performance of the activity and is due 2022 at the latest. The expected payments are determined by considering possible developments of future revenue and the amounts to be paid under each scenario. The significant unobservable input in this calculation is the future revenue which was considered at a growth rate of approximately 2.5 million per year on average. An increase (decrease) of the sales revenue by 10% in each of the following years would lead to an increase (decrease) of the liability by 0.6 million (0.6 million).

The non-current provisions comprise mainly provisions for partial retirement and employee anniversary bonuses (included in the item "other"). These obligations arise mainly in German Group companies. The partial retirement plans allow employees to work part-time for 3 - 5 years before their actual retirement.
According to IAS 19 the treatment of severance payments to be earned in future periods must be recognized in profit or loss over the respective period of service. Actuarial gains and losses, as well as past service costs, on these obligations are recognized as income or expense.
Non-current provisions are reported at their present value on the reporting date. The discount rate for employees on the early retirement plan is 0.0% (2016: 0.0%).

The fair values of the financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available on the reporting date and are to be allocated to one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.
Level 1 financial instruments are calculated on the basis of prices quoted on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. In Level 2, financial instruments are calculated on the basis of input factors which are derivable from observable market data or on the basis of market prices for similar instruments. Level 3 financial instruments are calculated on the basis of input factors that cannot be derived from observable market data.

The financial instruments to be recognized at fair value on the reporting date are mainly derivatives in the form of forward contracts and interest rate swaps. They were measured on the basis of their quoted exchange rates and market yield curves (Level 2).
The fair values to be disclosed for financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost, especially liabilities to banks and finance leases, were measured on the basis of the market interest rate, taking the current indicative credit spreads into account (Level 2).
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities to be disclosed approximate the carrying amounts because of their predominantly short-term maturity.

150 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items

The Group recognizes transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchies at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. In the current reporting period there were no transfers between the levels.

C. Capital Risk Management
In the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, capital is managed in order to maximize earnings of those participating in the company by optimizing the ratio of equity to liabilities. Furthermore, we ensure that all Group companies operate under the premise of the going-concern principle.
The financial liabilities detailed above are regarded as managed capital and, furthermore, so are the cash and cash equivalents as well as equity capital.
D. Goals of Financial Risk Management
The Treasury Department of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group is centrally focused in Sartorius Corporate Administration GmbH, a subsidiary of Sartorius AG. This centralized Treasury Department performs services for all companies of the Sartorius Group, including the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group, and coordinates access to national and international financial markets. In addition, the Treasury Department monitors and controls financial risks by internal risk reporting, which analyzes risks according to their degree and scope. Essentially, these risks entail currency, interest rate and liquidity risks.
The Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group strives to minimize the impact of currency and interest rate risks using derivative financial instruments. Hedging transactions and their controlling are carried out by different staff members. Moreover, the Group's Internal Auditing Department regularly monitors the use of such financial instruments. Trading with derivative financial instruments is done for hedging purposes only.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items 151

E. Management of Exchange Rate Risks
The Group is exposed to currency risks as more than one third of sales revenue is generated in U.S. dollars or currencies linked to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, in other foreign currencies. Therefore, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge the net currency exposure resulting from currency translation of the sales revenue. For currency hedging, forward contracts are used.
Forward contracts secure the right, and simultaneously create the obligation, to sell an established foreign currency amount on the exercise date at a specific exchange rate against the euro, independently of the exchange rate actually valid on this date. The profit or loss resulting from the difference between the current and the previously established exchange rate is generally measured as income or an expense in the statement of profit or loss.

The Group's strategy provides for hedging of up to one and a half years. Also, the hedging measures are reviewed at regular intervals in order to adapt them to currency fluctuations.
At the balance sheet date forward contracts have been carried out in an amount of $190 million (2016: $172 million) to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in the EUR | USD exchange rate. This amount covers roughly half of the expected net exposure for the U.S. dollar within the period of two years. Furthermore, other foreign currencies have been hedged in smaller volumes.
The following table shows the forward transactions as well as the target profit forward contracts as of the balance sheet date:

152 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Individual Balance Sheet Items

Derivative financial instruments are measured at the time of acquisition at cost and at fair value on subsequent balance sheet dates. The changes in value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in the statement of profit or loss on the balance sheet date. If the derivative financial instruments serve to hedge against cash flow risk and a qualified hedging relationship exists based on the criteria of IAS 39, the valuation adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income (cumulative amount in 2017: 16.4 million; 2016: ­9.9 million). The amounts recognized in equity are included in the profit or loss in the period in which the hedged transactions affect this result.
If the U.S. dollar would have depreciated 10% against the euro, the equity would have increased by 13.2 million (2016: 25.0 million), the impact on the the result would have been very low (2016: 1.0 million).
Vice versa, if the U.S. dollar would have appreciated 10% against the euro, the resulting impact on the result would have been not significant (2016: - 4.6 million) and on the other comprehensive income - 16.1 million (2016: - - 23.5 million).

A variation of the Swiss Franc (CHF) against the Euro would primarily have an impact on the valuation of the liability in connection with the acquisition of the cell culture media business of Lonza in 2012 (denominated in CHF). An increase of the CHF against the Euro by 5% would lead to an increase of the liability amounting to 2.3 million (2016: 2.3 million), a decrease of the CHF against the Euro by 5% would lead to a decrease of the liability amounting to 2.1 million (2.1 million).

F. Interest Risk Management
Sartorius Stedim Biotech is mainly financed through its parent company Sartorius AG. This major loan is taken out at variable interest rates; therefore the Group continues to be exposed to interest rate risks. To control the interest risk, an appropriate ratio between fixed and variable loans is maintained. Furthermore, the Group concluded interest rate hedges in the form of interest swaps, which cover a part of the loans outstanding at variable interest rates. As a result, the Group receives the particular (variable) interest rate valid on the market and pays a fixed interest rate.
The following table provides an overview of the interest hedging contracts available on the reporting date.

The Group's general hedging strategy is to secure roughly 50% of the risk exposure for a period up to five years. As of Dec. 31, 2017 the raised loans with variable interest rates amount to approx. 110 million and the hedged volume is up to 40 million with end of Term August 2018.

If the market interest rate had been 1.0 percentage point higher, the interest expenses in the statement of profit or loss would have been 0.8 million (2016: 0.5 million) higher. This effect would have been partially compensated by an increase in the fair values of the interest rate swaps by 0.2 million (0.3 million).
With regard to a decrease in interest rates a base interest rate of 0% has been considered. The resulting impact on the financial result would have been - 0.2 million (2016: - 1.1 million) caused by the valuation of the interest rate swaps.

H. Other Risks Associated with Financial Instruments

32. Related Parties
General
The majority shareholder of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. is Sartorius AG, which holds a controlling stake in the company of 74.3% in equity capital ­ and 84.5% of the voting rights. The Sartorius Group itself is organized in two divisions: Bioprocess Solutions (mainly run by the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group) and Lab Products & Services (mainly run by the other companies of Sartorius Group). This structure leads to the fact that the Group holds two subsidiaries in most of the countries and these companies partially share space, staff and other resources. Furthermore, the German group companies carry out various central functions and accordingly deliver services to the worldwide entities (e.g IT support). The company Sartorius Corporate Administration GmbH, a 100% subsidiary of Sartorius AG has incorporated numerous Group functions like Group Finance, HR, IT, Investor Relations, Legal and Central Marketing. These services are charged within the Group and to a significant extent also to Sartorius Stedim Biotech.

The described structures lead to various relations and transactions with related parties. Transactions between Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. and its subsidiaries (presented in Note 6), which are related parties of the company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed under this Note. Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties, belonging to the Sartorius Group, are disclosed below.

Sales, Purchases and Commissions
In certain business areas members of the Sartorius Group act as contract manufacturers for the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group and vice versa. The respective transactions are carried out at arms' length principles and are disclosed in the table below as "sales revenue" and "purchases".

Management Fees and Other Shareholder Costs
One of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A.'s board members is also member of the Sartorius AG Executive Board and is paid by the German parent company. For his services for Sartorius Stedim Biotech a portion of his remuneration is charged to Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A.

Other shareholder functions like Group Financial Reporting, Compliance and Investor Relations are performed by the above mentioned Sartorius Corporate Administration GmbH in Germany. These services have been charged to Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. in the amount of 0.8 million (2016: 0.8 million).
Shareholder Loan
As described in note 25 the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group has raised a loan from its parent company Sartorius AG with a credit volume of 300 million and a current utilization of approx. 109 million (2016: 51 million). The interest charged is based on a variable interest rate plus an arms'-length credit margin.

Administration Charges and Shared Costs
As described above the companies in most of the countries share certain functions and costs. The underlying contracts include mainly subleases for office space and central administrative functions, such as accounting and controlling, human resource management and IT. In this respect, the relevant companies charge rent, salaries, social security costs and other expenses for such services, as well as a prorated profit margin for the services they provide.

Statutory Auditors' Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.
This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.
This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Dear Shareholders,
Opinion
In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders' meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. for the year ended 31 December 31 2017.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
Basis for Opinion
Audit Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities

for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.
Independence
We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January 2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.
Furthermore, the non-audit services that we provided to your Company and its controlled undertakings during the financial year that are not disclosed in the management report or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are listed as follows:
Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters
In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823 9 and R.823 - 7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Statutory Auditors' Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements 159

Goodwill valuation ­ Impairment test
Identified risk
As of 31 December 31 2017, goodwill amounts to 386 M, or 27% of total consolidated assets.
As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, Sartorius Stedim Biotech is an "integrated solution provider" for its customers, and as a result there is only one operating segment from a product and customer perspective: "Biopharma". In addition, as indicated in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, because of the interdependence of the market in which your group operates, the lowest level at which goodwill can be allocated is the Biopharma segment. The goodwill has therefore been fully allocated to the Cash Generating Units (C.G.U.) corresponding to the Biopharma segment.
Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and whenever there are indicators of impairment in accordance with the methods and assumptions described in Notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements. In particular, in view of what has been described above, the impairment test is carried out at the level of the Biopharma segment.
We considered that the determination of the value of goodwill is a key point of our audit given its significance in the consolidated financial statements of your group, and because the determination of the recoverable amount taken into account in the impairment test on the basis of the value in use of the C.G.U. requires the use of estimates and assumptions (including future cash flows, perpetual revenue growth rates and the discount rate) that require significant management judgment.
Responses obtained during our audit
We obtained the impairment test from the C.G.U. group corresponding to the Biopharma segment as well as the forecasts underlying the calculation (4 -year plan).
We assessed the compliance of the company's methodology in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
We also conducted an analysis of how the company has implemented this methodology, including the following procedures:

­ Assess the reasonableness of the key assumptions used to determine the cash flow of the Biopharma segment as well as that used for the perpetual growth rate;
­ Assess, with the support of our valuation specialists, the discount rate used by management. We compared this rate with our own estimates and analysed its various constituent elements;
­ Check the arithmetical accuracy of the impairment test performed by your group.
We have also obtained and assessed the sensitivity analyses carried out by management, as shown in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, we were able to verify that only an extremely large change in the main assumptions could lead to the recognition of an impairment of goodwill.
Lastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the information provided in Notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the Management Report
As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the Board of Directors.
We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Appointment of the Statutory Auditors
We were appointed as statutory auditors of Sartorus Stedim Biotech S.A. by the annual general meeting held on 7 April 7 2015 for KPMG S.A. and on 19 May 2006 for Deloitte & Associés.
As at 31 December 2017, KPMG S.A. was in its 3rd year of the audit mandate without interruption and Deloitte & Associés was in its 12th year.

160 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Statutory Auditors' Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.
Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Objectives and audit approach
Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As specified in Article L.823 - 10 - 1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
­ Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
­ Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.
­ Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.
­ Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.
­ Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
­ Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction,

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Statutory Auditors' Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements 161

supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822 - 10 to L.822 - 14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee [ou autre terminologie retenue par la société pour désigner le comité spécialisé visé à l'article L.823 - 19 du code de commerce] the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Statutory Auditors' Report on the Financial Statements

This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.
This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.
This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Dear Shareholders,
Opinion
In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders' meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. for the year ended 31 December 2017.
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.
The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
Basis for Opinion
Audit Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors'Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

Independence
We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January 2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited nonaudit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.
Furthermore, the non-audit services that we provided to your Company and its controlled undertakings during the financial year that are not disclosed in the management report or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are listed as follows:

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823 9 and R.823 - 7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, concerned the appropriateness of the accounting principles applied, the reasonableness of the significant estimates used and the overall presentation of the accounts.
These assessments were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Statutory Auditors' Report on the Financial Statements 175

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Appointment of the Statutory Auditors
We were appointed as statutory auditors of Sartorus Stedim Biotech S.A. by the annual general meeting held on 7 April 2015 for KPMG S.A. and on 19 May 2006 for Deloitte & Associés.
As at 31 December 2017, KPMG S.A. was in its 3rd year of the audit mandate without interruption and Deloitte & Associés was in its 12th year.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.
Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Objectives and audit approach
Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with

176 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Statutory Auditors' Report on the Financial Statements

professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As specified in Article L.823 - 10 - 1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
­ Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
­ Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.
­ Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.
­ Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

­ Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822 - 10 to L.822 - 14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee [ou autre terminologie retenue par la société pour désigner le comité spécialisé visé à l'article L.823 - 19 du code de commerce] the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

­ to purchase, develop, administrate and manage a portfolio of equity security, securities, voting rights and other social rights in all companies regardless of their activity and this, by all means including by way of setting up of new companies, contribution in kind of any types of social rights, subscription rights, mergers, purchases of other social rights or incorporation of companies;

Financial Year
The financial year, also referred to as fiscal year, covers a period of twelve months, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year (Company bylaws, Heading 1, Article 6).
Share capital
As of 31 December 2017, the share capital of the Company amounts to 18,436,038, divided in 92,180,190 shares of 0.20 fully paid; 74.3% of which are held by Sartorius AG.
Specific Clauses in the Company Bylaws
Form of Shares
Shares may be in nominative or bearer form according to the shareholder's choice. These shares are entitled to be recorded in an account in accordance with French law (Company bylaws, Heading 1, excerpt of Article 1).
Appropriation of Profits
The income statement that summarizes the income and expenses of the reporting year discloses by difference, after deduction of amortization, depreciation and provisions, the profit for said reporting year. At least 5% must be deducted from the annual profit reduced, where appropriate, by prior losses, to set up the legal reserve. This deduction ceases to be obligatory when the legal reserve amounts to one tenth of the share capital. This obligatory deduction resumes when, for whatever reason, the legal reserve falls below this one tenth. The distributable profit comprises the profit for the reporting year less prior losses and amounts transferred to reserves, pursuant to French laws and the company bylaws, and increased by profit brought forward. This profit is distributed among all shareholders in proportion to the number of shares each one holds. The Annual General Shareholders' Meeting may decide to distribute amounts taken from reserves available to it by expressly indicating the reserve from which the transfers are made. However, dividends are disbursed by way of priority from the annual profit for the reporting year. Except for a reduction in capital, no distribution may be made to shareholders when the equity falls below, or would consequently fall below, the amount of the capital together with the reserves that French laws or the company bylaws do not permit to distribute. Revaluation surplus is not distributable.

It may be in- corporated in full or part into the company's capital. However, after transferring the amounts to the reserves, pursuant to French law, the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting may transfer any amount it considers necessary to all available reserves, ordinary or extraordinary reserves, or carry it forward.
Shareholders' Meetings
Convening
Annual (or Ordinary) General Shareholders' Meetings are those convened to take all decisions that do not result in a revision of the bylaws. Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meetings are those called to decide or authorize direct or indirect revisions to the bylaws. Special Meetings bring together the holders of a specific class of share to consider revisions to the rights of this class of share. Decisions made at the General Meetings are binding for all shareholders, even those who are absent, dissenting or legally incapable or incapacitated (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 13). General Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors or, by default, the independent auditors or a person thus empowered. General Meetings are held at the registered office or any other place stated in the notice of convocation (Company bylaws, Heading 3, excerpt of Article 14). The forms and timescale of the notice of convocation are governed by French laws.
Agenda
The notices and letters of call shall indicate the indications required by the law, particularly the agenda, the company electronic address where written questions of Shareholders may be sent and, eventually the mention of the obligation to collect the opinion or the prior approval of the mass of securities Shareholders giving access to the share capital.
The meeting may only deliberate on the matters placed on the agenda. It may, however, remove one or more directors at any time.
One or more shareholders representing the percentage of share capital required by law may, under the conditions and time limits set forth by law, require the inclusion on the agenda of draft resolutions.
In accordance to the Articles R 225 - 71 to R 225 - 74 of the Commercial Code, requests made by the Shareholders to register draft resolutions on the agenda and written questions are sent to the Headquarters by registered letter with recorded

The request of a new item on the agenda must be motivated. The request to register draft resolutions is provided with the text of draft resolutions, which may have a short explanation of reasons. These requests are subject to justification of possession or representation of required Share capital, in accordance to regulatory rules (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Artile 14, excerpt of point 2).
Moreover, in accordance to the Articles L. 2323 - 67 paragraph 2 of the Labor Code, requests of draft resolutions made by the Work Council, to be added on the agenda, are sent in the next 10 days following the publication of the Meeting announcement. (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 14, excerpt of point 2).
If the meeting has been unable to make a valid decision due to a lack of the required quorum, the second meeting and, where appropriate, the second meeting adjourned are called at least ten days in advance in the same form as the first meeting (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 14, excerpt of point 1).
Admission to Meetings -- Powers
Every shareholder has the right to attend General Meetings and to participate in the discussions, in person or by proxy, regardless of the number of shares held, on simple proof of identity and the ownership of shares. The right to participate in a General Meeting is subject to the condition that the shares must be recorded, in the name of the shareholder or the shareholder's appointed broker, either in the nominative share accounts held by the company or in the bearer share accounts held by the authorized broker, by zero hours, Paris time, on the second working day prior to the meeting. The recording or registration of the shares in the bearer share accounts held by the authorized broker must be confirmed by a share certificate provided by the broker. This share certificate must be attached to the postal voting form, the proxy form or the application for an admission pass, issued in the name of the shareholder or on behalf of the shareholder represented by the appointed broker. A certificate must also be supplied to shareholders who wish to attend the General Meeting in person but who have not received an

admission pass by zero hours, Paris time, on the second working day prior to the meeting.
A Shareholder may be represented by another Shareholder, his or her spouse or by the partner with who he or she signed a Civil Partnership. Furthermore, he or she may be represented by any other moral or physical person of his choice in accordance to the Articles L. 225 - 106 to - 106 - 3 of the Commercial Code; in that aim, the representative must present valid proof of proxy.
The legal representatives of shareholders who are legally incapable or incapacitated and individuals representing corporate shareholders take part in meetings, whether or not they are shareholders (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 14, point 3).
All Shareholders may also have a postal voting, using a registration form and sent to the company according to the law and regulations; to be acceptable this registration must be received by the company three days before the date of the Meeting.
In case of remote voting using an electronic vote, or a proxy vote given by electronic signature, this vote is made according to the conditions of the current regulations (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 14, point 4).

The same applies in the event of death or resignation of the permanent representative.
7. If one or more directors' seats become vacant between two general meetings due to death or resignation, the board of directors may proceed to make appointments on an interim basis so as to fill the seats on the Board. These appointments must be made within three months of the vacancy, when the number of directors has fallen below the minimum under the articles of association but without falling below the statutory minimum.
Interim appointments made in this manner by the Board are subject to ratification by the next ordinary general meeting. Failing ratification, the decisions taken or the acts accomplished shall nonetheless remain valid.

Conditions for the Exercise of Voting Rights -- Majority Quorum (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 15)
At Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings, the quorum is calculated on the basis of the shares comprising the share capital and, in Special Meetings, on the basis of all the shares of the class concerned, net of shares not entitled to voting rights by virtue of the law.
In the event of postal voting, only the forms received by the company prior to the meeting will be considered when calculating the quorum, under the conditions and timeframe set by the decree.
The right to vote conferred to shares is proportional to the capital they represent. With an equal par value, every share in capital or income right carries the right to one vote.
In the event that the shares are pledged, the voting right is exercised by the holder of the securities. The issuing company may not validly vote with shares subscribed, acquired or taken in pledge by it; these shares are not taken into account to calculate the quorum.
The voting takes place and the votes are cast by show of hands, or by those sitting and standing, or by roll call, as decided by the officers of the meeting.
Further Information on Voting Rights
There is no limit in the bylaws on voting rights.
A double voting right is conferred to the holders of registered shares that are fully paid up and that have been registered in the name of the same holder for at least four years.
In the event of conversion to bearer form, the converted share immediately forfeits its double voting right. In the event of a capital increase by incorporation of reserves, profits or share premium, this double voting right applies to new shares issued and allocated free of charge to a shareholder on the basis of existing shares that already carry this right (Heading 2, Article 3, of the company bylaws). This revision to the bylaws

184 Supplementary Information Other Information of a Legal Nature

was unanimously passed by the General Shareholders' Meeting in an extra-ordinary session on August 24, 1994. It may be cancelled by a General Shareholders' Meeting convened in an extraordinary session and after ratification by a Special Meeting of the beneficiary shareholders.
As of December 31, 2017, there were 68,862,437 shares with a double voting right out of a total of 68,909,084 shares. Thus, the total voting rights are 137,771,521.
The Annual General Shareholders' Meeting is held at least once a year, within six months of the year end, to consider the financial statements of that year, subject to an extension of this timeframe by a legal decision. The Annual General Shareholders' Meeting may only validly deliberate, upon the first convocation, if the shareholders present -- represented or voting by post -- hold at least one quarter of the shares with a right to vote. No quorum is required upon the second convocation. The meeting decides on the basis of the majority of votes held by shareholders present or represented, including shareholders voting by post (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 16).
Shareholders' agreement
None
Crossing Legal Thresholds
Any shareholder whose shareholdings cross the legal thresholds defined by French law, either upwards or downwards, must declare said crossing by notification of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, pursuant to the law in force. The bylaws of the company do not provide for any additional threshold declarations.
Identification of Shareholders
Within the legal and regulatory framework, the company is authorized to seek the identity of bearer shareholders.

Payment of Dividends
The Annual General Shareholders' Meeting has the power to give every shareholder, for all or part of a dividend payable, the option of receiving this dividend in shares, as provided by French law, or in cash.
The terms of the payment of the dividend in cash are set by the General Meeting or, by default, the Board of Directors. Cash dividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months after the end of the reporting year, unless this timeframe is extended by legal authorization. However, this profit may be distributed as an interim dividend prior to the approval of the annual financial statements when a balance sheet prepared during or at the end of a financial year and certified by the independent auditors discloses that the company has realized a profit since the close of the previous financial year, after recognition of the necessary amortization, depreciation and provisions, as well as after deduction, where relevant, of prior losses and amounts to be transferred to the reserves, as required by French laws or the company bylaws. These interim dividends may not exceed the profit thus defined. No reimbursement of dividends may be required from shareholders unless the distribution was made in violation of legal provisions and the company determines that the beneficiaries were aware of the illegality of this distribution at the time it occurred or could not ignore this nature of the dividends. Where this occurs, the shares in reimbursement are time-barred three years after the payment of these dividends. Dividends not collected within five years of their payment are time-barred (Company bylaws, Heading 3, Article 22).

DIRECTORS' TRAINING

One of the major conditions for appointing a director is his or her abilities, but it cannot be expected a priori that every director has specific prior knowledge of the corporation's organisation and activities.

Yes, conformed to the code's recommendations, the duration of an office term is 3 years. 7 Directors duty of term will be renewed in 2016, the other three will be renewed in 2018.

Terms should be staggered so as to avoid replacement of the entire body and to favour a smooth replacement of directors.
The annual report should detail the dates of the beginning and expiry of each director's term of office to make the existing staggering clear. For each director, it should also indicate, in addition to the list of offices and positions held in other corporations, the director's nationality, age and principal position, and provide a named list of the members of each Board committee.

Yes, these information are reiterated in the Directors biographical presentation and in the Board of Directors composition.

Methods of operation of the committees

When exercising their duties, the committees of the Board may contact the

principal managers of the corporation after informing the company

Compensation policy and allocation of stock option grants and free shares The compensation of executive directors must be appropriate, balanced and fair. Such compensation must strengthen the sense of solidarity and motivation within the company.
While the market is a benchmark, it may not be the sole one. An executive director's compensation depends on the work carried out, the results obtained and also the responsibilities taken on. An executive director bears the ultimate responsibility for the management team, and this warrants higher compensation. The general policy for the award of stock options and performance shares should be debated within the compensation committee, and, on the basis of a recommendation from the committee, approved by the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors must monitor the evolution in all components of the compensation over several years, with regard to corporate performance

Fixed compensation The fixed part may be calculated differently depending on whether the executive director has followed a continuous career within the company or is recruited from outside the company.
In principle, such fixed compensation may only be reviewed at relatively long intervals, e.g. every three years.
Any increases in compensation must be linked to events affecting the company and must take into account performance through other components of the compensation, including fringe benefits.
If, however, the company opts for annual increase of the executive director's fixed compensation, this increase must be moderated and must respect the principle of consistency mentioned in 23.1.

Variable compensation The Board may decide to award executive director's annual or multiannual variable compensation.
These different forms of variable compensation may be cumulative, but this cumulative amount must be decided on the basis of the aforementioned principles, in particular comprehensiveness and proportionality. The variable compensation must be determined by the Board of Directors for a fixed period. The rules governing the determination of the variable compensation must be consistent with the annual or multi-annual assessment of executive directors' performance and with the company's strategy. The variable compensation is a reward for the director's performance and the progress of the company in the period under consideration. The share price must not be the only criteria for measuring this performance.

It is based on quantitative criteria precisely measurable and challenging.

24.2.5

The terms of the variable compensation must be understandable to shareholders, and clear and complete information must be provided each year in the annual report.
The variable compensation must be subject to the achievement of precise and, of course, predetermined objectives.
Quantitative criteria must be simple, relevant, objective, measurable and suited to the corporate strategy.
These criteria must be regularly reviewed in order to avoid any ad-hoc adjustments.

Yes, the company has increased and improved the level of information in the remuneration report that described the targets achievements policy for the annual variable remuneration, and the variable remuneration with multi-year component.

It is also necessary to pay considerable attention to possible threshold effects generated by quantitative criteria. Only highly specific circumstances may warrant the award of an extraordinary variable component.

The qualitative criteria must be defined precisely. For the variable part, when qualitative criteria are used, a limit must be determined for the qualitative part while allowing, where applicable, exceptional circumstances to be taken into consideration.

The variable compensation must be set at a level that is balanced in relation to the fixed part. The variable part is a maximum percentage of the fixed part, and is adapted to the business conducted by the company and predefined by the Board.

Except in justified cases, the award of variable compensation may not only be restricted to executive directors.

In the event that an executive director leaves before completion of the term envisaged for assessment of the performance criteria, the payment of the variable part of the compensation must be ruled out, unless there are exceptional circumstances which can be justified by the Board.

Benefits for taking up a position Benefits for taking up a position may only be granted to a new executive director who has come from a company outside the group. In this case the amount must be made public when it is determined.
NO-competition benefits In the context of implementation of the procedure for related parties transactions as stipulated by law, the conclusion of a NO-competition agreement must be subject to substantial reflection in the compensation committee.

Yes, there isn't a benefit for taking up functions of executive directors
Yes, Mr. Kreuzburg has a post contractual non-competition obligation which is in accordance with German law due to the fact that Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. is controlled by a German company. This obligation lasts for two years after the director has left the Group. During that time, if the non-competition clause is not waived or terminated, the director can claim half of his latest remuneration received at the Company.

The Board must authorize the conclusion of the NO-competition agreement, the length of the requirement for NO-competition and the amount of benefits, taking into account the actual and effective scope of the NO-competition requirement. The decision of the Board must be made public.

The Board has to anticipate, during the conclusion of the agreement, a mention which allows the Board to cancel the agreement when a director leaves.

The Board must announce whether or not the NO-competition agreement will be upheld at the time that the director leaves, in particular when the director leaves the company to claim, or after having claime²d his or her pension rights.

In any event, the NO-competition payment should not exceed a ceiling of two years of compensation (fixed and variable).

When a termination benefit is also paid, the aggregate of these two benefits must not exceed this ceiling (see above).

The supplementary pension schemes mentioned in Article L.137-11 of the Social Security Code for senior executives and executive directors must comply with conditions that prevent abuse.

Yes, the supplementary pension schemes ae according to the responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company.

Supplementary pension schemes with defined benefits must be subject to the condition that the beneficiary must be a director or employee of the company when claiming his or her pension rights pursuant to the applicable rules.

In order to prevent any abuse, it is necessary to impose certain additional rules (without prejudice to schemes closed to new beneficiaries which may not be altered):

the relevant benefit must be taken into account in the overall determination of the compensation on the basis of the general principles stated above;

the group of potential beneficiaries must be materially broader than the sole executive directors;

the beneficiaries must meet reasonable requirements of seniority within the company, for at least two years, as determined by the Board of Directors, to benefit from payments from a pension plan with defined benefits;

each year, the increase in potential rights shall be progressive in relation to the seniority in the scheme and shall only account for a percentage limited to 5% of the beneficiary's compensation. This progression must be described;

the benchmark period taken into account for the calculation of the benefits must cover several years, and it is necessary to avoid over the same period any artificial increase in compensation, aimed at increasing pension benefits;

It is necessary to exclude any schemes giving a right immediately or over a time to a high percentage of the total compensation at the end of the career.

In addition, information on individual potential rights, in particular the reference income and the maximum percentage of this income, which the supplementary pension scheme would confer, must be made public. The percentage may not be more than 45% of the reference income (fixed and variable compensation of thee in the reference period).
