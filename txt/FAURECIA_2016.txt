2 2016 business review The Faurecia group

2.1. The Faurecia group

2.1.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

The Faurecia group is a global leader in automotive equipment. It develops, manufactures and markets original equipment through three main Business Groups: Faurecia Seating (formerly Faurecia Automotive Seating), Faurecia Clean Mobility (formerly Faurecia Emission Control Technologies) and Faurecia Interiors (formerly Faurecia Interior Systems). The Automotive Exteriors business was sold on July 29, 2016 to Plastic Omnium.
Faurecia's offer focuses on two main areas:
c sustainable mobility, requiring in particular weight reduction and emission treatment, regardless of the vehicle type, while taking account of fundamental market changes in terms of power adjustment;
c intuitive in-car experience, associating the new interior architecture of vehicles, including the seats, with other things such as the human-machine commands and connectivity.
Faurecia designs and manufactures equipment that is generally specific to each car model or platform for new car models, and provides them to automakers throughout the anticipated life of the model or platform (usually between five and ten years).
The quality of Faurecia products is widely acknowledged among automakers. It is backed up by the Group's Faurecia Excellence System (FES), a rigorous set of project management procedures and methodologies that enables optimization of design and development programs (Program Management System), and

by the expertise of the Faurecia engineers and technicians who design products and develop technological solutions.
Faurecia boasts a broad geographic footprint, and is one of only a handful of players with the capacity to supply automakers' global programs. The Group estimates that at least a third of the vehicles in the world were originally equipped with at least one product manufactured by one of Faurecia's Business Groups.
As of December 31, 2016, Faurecia employed approximately 100,000 people in 34 countries, spread over 300 plants including 30 research and development centers.
Faurecia analyzes its sales mainly on the basis of value added sales (which correspond to sales excluding monoliths and reflect the real business).
The two main components of the value added sales are product sales (parts and components delivered to automakers) and sales of tooling, research and development, and prototypes.
In addition, the total sales of Faurecia Clean Mobility includes the sales of monoliths, i.e. the components used in catalytic converters in exhaust systems. Monoliths are directly managed by automakers. The Group purchases them from suppliers designated by them and invoices them to automakers on a pass-through basis. They accordingly generate no industrial value added.

2.1.2. CHANGES IN THE GROUP'S BUSINESS

Automotive production grew by 4.7% between 2015 and 2016. It grew in all regions of the world with the exception of South America. Thus, light vehicle production grew by 2.8% in Europe and by 2.0% in North America. It also grew in Asia, where production increased by 7.2%. Conversely, production fell by 10.0% in South America (source: IHS Automotive January 2017).
Following the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2015 with Plastic Omnium, the Automotive Exteriors business was sold on July 29, 2016. However, the composite business (Faurecia Composite Technologies), the Faurecia plant for Smart

in Hambach (France) and two joint ventures in Brazil and China (those entities are consolidated by equity method) were not included in the MoU.
Upon application of accounting rule IFRS 5, the assets and liabilities sold as well as net income (loss) from discontinued operations have been isolated in distinct lines in the consolidated balance sheet and in the income statement (see note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements).
All the results presented below are after application of IFRS 5 for 2015 and 2016.

The Faurecia group

The consolidated sales for 2016 totaled 18,710.5 million, compared to 18,770.4 million in 2015. On a reported basis, Faurecia's consolidated sales between 2015 and 2016 decreased by 0.3%. On a like-for-like basis, sales increased by 2.6% compared to 2015, with an increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year and a growth of 1.8% in the second half of the year.
Sales of products (parts and components delivered to automakers) reached 14,247.1 million compared to 14,218.7 million in 2015. This represented a 0.2% growth on a reported basis. On a like-for-like basis, sales increased by 3.6% (4.2% in the first half, 3.1% in the second).
Sales of tooling, R&D, prototypes and other services totaled 1,366.5 million, versus 1,247.3 million in 2015. This represented a 9.6% growth on a reported basis. On a like-forlike basis, they increased by 11.1%.
Catalytic converter monolith sales (1), products mandated by the customers on which Faurecia is acting as an agent, reached

3,096.9 million in 2016, compared to 3,304.4 million in 2015. They were down by 6.3% on a reported basis and by 5.2% on a like-for-like basis, resulting from a 4.0% decline in the first half-year and a 6.5% decline in the second half-year mainly due to the fall in the price of precious metals included in monoliths.
Value added sales (which are total sales excluding monoliths and which reflect the real activity) in 2016 reached 15,613.6 million, compared to 15,466.0 million in 2015, or an increase of 1.0% on a reported basis. On a like-for-like basis, value added sales increased by 4.3% compared to 2015, with an increase of 5.0% in the first half-year and 3.5% in the second.
Furthermore, in order to keep up with the market trend toward more air quality regulations and fuel savings, the Emissions Control Technologies business has become the Clean Mobility business.

Faurecia Clean Mobility is the world leader in the emissions control market, developing and producing complete exhaust systems, including all components helping reduce emissions as well as components for exhaust system acoustics.
The Clean Mobility business generated total sales of 7,292.2 million in 2016, a decline of 2.6% on a reported basis. On a like-for-like basis, sales were down 0.8%.
Monolith sales reached 3,096.9 million in 2016 compared to 3,304.4 million in 2015 (a decrease of 6.3% on a reported basis and decrease of 5.2% on a like-for-like basis).
Value added sales reached 4,195.3 million in 2016 compared to 4,185.9 million in 2015 (an increase of 0.2% on a reported basis and increase of 2.7% on a like-for-like basis).
Product sales totaled 3,860.0 million in 2016, down 0.5% on a reported basis but up 2.0% on a like-for-like basis. In the second half of 2016, product sales slightly increased on a reported basis (1.0%) and increased by 2.7% on a like-for-like basis.
Clean Mobility sales include the sales of the Faurecia Composite Technologies entities kept by Faurecia after the disposal of Faurecia Automotive Exteriors. Following this change of organization, sales of the composite business, which had been included in the Interiors business when the results of the first half-year 2016 were presented, have been reallocated on a retroactive basis for 2015 and 2016 to the Clean Mobility business.
Faurecia Clean Mobility maintained its position as world market leader, with 175 launches in 2016.
In Europe, 56 launches were carried out, with in particular the launch of the hot and cold end component programs for the gasoline and diesel engines of the Giulia vehicle of the Alfa Giorgio platform. The Terni plant, in Italy, is managing this launch in Europe. The launch in the Koacelli plant in Turkey of the cold end components for the diesel and gasoline engines of the Peugeot 3008 and the hot and cold ends for the diesel engine of the Ford Transit should also be noted.
Faurecia Clean Mobility confirmed its position in Asia, with 66 launches. A new just-in-time assembly plant was opened in Wuhan, for the launch of the cold end components for the SGM Cavalier.
In China, the dedication of Faurecia Clean Mobility's teams led to a substantial rise in its market share among local automakers such as Geely, BAIC, FAW and GAC. The launch of major programs,

such as the hot end components for the 1.0 l gasoline turbo engine of the Honda Eva and for the new 1.5 l Ford gasoline engine is noteworthy. Faurecia Clean Mobility launched its first production line with BAIC for which it will produce the entire line for the 1.5 l gasoline engine of the BAIC BJ20.
In 2016, Faurecia Clean Mobility confirmed its expertise with energy recovery systems by integrating its Exhaust Heat Recovery System (EHRS) on the hot end of the 1.6 l gasoline engine of the Hyndai Ioniq.
In the emerging countries, Faurecia Clean Mobility strengthened its position with 32 launches, including 3 major ones: in Argentina for the Toyota Hilux (cold end components for its two 2.8 l diesel and 2.7 l flex engines), in Brazil for the RenaultNissan vehicles Duster, Sandero, Logan, Oroch and Captur (hot end components for the 1.6 l gasoline engine) and for the Volvo FH (hot end components for the 13 l diesel engine). At the Port Elisabeth plant in South Africa, one should note the launch of the SCR BlueBox®-equipped hot end components for the 2.0 l Diesel engine of the Ford Transit.
In North America, 21 launches were carried out at, among others, the plants in Queretaro and San Jose Chiappa in Mexico, the launch of the hot and cold ends for the 2.0 l diesel and gasoline engine of the Audi Q5, as well as the first cold end for HKMC which will be used in the Hyundai Elentra. Faurecia Clean Mobility will also supply the Chrysler Pacifica with a cold end for its V6 3.6 l gasoline engine.
The Columbus plant in the United States was opened for the launch in 2017 of the Nitro program of Cummins Emissions Solutions (CES).
In 2016, Faurecia Clean Mobility confirmed its position as world market leader, with over 96 new programs won. These program gains show the capacity of Faurecia Clean Mobility to support its international customers with their regional partners on new markets and also acquire new strategic programs.
2016 was also marked by the signature of a joint venture agreement between Faurecia (China) Holding Co. Ltd and Shandong Yinlun Heat Exchange System Co. Ltd. Faurecia, the majority shareholder with 52% ownership in the joint venture, will develop and produce pollution control systems for Weichai Powertrain Air Cleaning Technologies Co. Ltd located in Weifang, China.
Faurecia also signed an agreement with MAAD, a joint venture between the Iranian groups Crouse and Avrand, for the creation

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

2016 business review
Evolution of the Group's activities and sales

of the joint venture Faurecia Crouse Advanced Exhaust System Co. (FCAES) for emission control systems. FCAES, in which Faurecia will hold 50%, will develop and produce emission control systems for the Iranian automotive market. Local production is due to start at the beginning of 2017.
Faurecia increased its holding in the Danish company Amminex from 42% to 91.5%. Amminex's ASDSTM solution, used in Copenhagen buses, stores ammonia in a compact gaseous form in the buses and makes it possible to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide from diesel-powered city buses. Faurecia has also adapted this technology to private cars and light commercial vehicles, in which a more compact system can be installed in the trunk or any other available space.
In 2016, Faurecia Clean Mobility confirmed its leading position in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines. Its SCR BlueBox® innovation, a close position mixed SCR system, is now used in the exhaust system for the 2.0 l Diesel engine of the Ford Transit.
Faurecia Clean Mobility also continues to develop its new generation of electric valves which will enable it to meet automakers' requirements in terms of durability and behavior at high temperatures.
The electric valves can be used either to reduce exhaust noise (acoustic valve) or to vary the pressure in the exhaust system (LP EGR valve or back-pressure valve). As regards the LP EGR valve, Faurecia Clean Mobility will launch its first application on a car manufactured by a European automaker. Recognized for its expertise in exhaust noise reduction, Faurecia will provide the Honda NSX with its electrically controlled acoustic valves. This application adds to the list of already equipped cars, namely FIAT-Chrysler, Ford, Mercedes, Volvo and VW.
It should be noted that Faurecia Clean Mobility won the 2016 Automotive News Pace Award for its Adaptive ValveTM technology, an automatically controlled valve that is activated by the exhaust gas flow and works in parallel with the muffler to reduce the noise from the exhaust system. On vehicles with cylinder deactivation, the adaptive valve neutralizes low-frequency noise so that the driver perceives no difference when shifting from eight cylinders to four, thus improving the driving experience. This valve, developed by Faurecia, is currently used in several pick-ups and SUVs in North America.
The automatically controlled valve completes the range of acoustic valves developed by Faurecia Clean Mobility. It is mainly used in vehicles sold in Asia to reduce exhaust system noise at low engine speeds. The most recent generation was launched in 2016 and is used in Geely Emgrand (China) and Proton Iriz (Malaysia) vehicles.

In order to offer its customers the possibility of customizing the acoustic signature of their vehicles, Faurecia Clean Mobility has for several years been developing Exhaust Dynamic Sound Technologies that make it possible to recreate and customize sound signature for powerful diesel and gasoline engines but also to cancel unwanted sounds that are produced at low engine speeds.
To assist automakers in meeting their objectives in terms of reduction of CO2 emissions, Faurecia Clean Mobility continues to develop innovations aiming to decrease the weight of the cold ends of exhaust systems, including the nickel brazing technology owned by Faurecia, which makes it possible to assemble cold end components with a thickness of less than 1.0 mm.
In 2016, Faurecia Clean Mobility continued to play an active role in the compliance with environmental standards worldwide by supporting two major air quality events in South Korea. Partner of the World Clean Air Congress organized by the International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations (IUAPPA) and of the Better Air Quality conference of the Clean Air Asia NGO, Faurecia intends to remain a major player in air quality improvement by contributing its expertise and emission control technologies.
In addition, following the disposal of the Exteriors business to Plastic Omnium on July 29, 2016, the Composite division took the name Faurecia Composite Technologies and joined Faurecia Clean Mobility. This move was in line with the Group's desire to offer its customers innovative and clean technologies for the vehicles of tomorrow.
Currently present in France with two plants and an R&D center, Faurecia Composite Technologies shows its ambition to move from regional player status to global player by 2025.
Faurecia Composite Technologies is stepping up its efforts, which it began in 2012, to reduce the weight of vehicles, in particular by becoming a leader in the market for carbon fiber structural and semi-structural parts for large-volume applications. In addition, Faurecia participates in the FORCE consortium, which brings together the players involved in the carbon fiber market to make it affordable for all automakers.
The Faurecia Composite Technologies division also presents itself as a cross-functional composite skill center for Faurecia's three businesses, offering its skills and expertise to all of the Group's applications.
Chapter 7 of this Registration Document provides more information on all of the technologies and innovations developed by Faurecia.
The operational excellence of Faurecia Clean Mobility has earned it several awards from automakers (see Chapter 6 of this Registration Document, Section 6.3 "Customer awards").

3.1.1. OPERATING INCOME

Operating income for 2016 was 970.2 million (5.2% of total sales), compared to operating income of 830.0 million for 2015 (4.4% of total sales) (see in particular the consolidated statement of comprehensive income presented in detail in Section 10.1).
Operating income (1) for 2016 also accounted for 6.2% of value added sales compared to 5.4% in 2015. This figure reflects the real profitability of the Group.
The 140.2 million increase in operating income over the full year 2016 compared to 2015 breaks down as follows:
c in Europe, the increase in sales allowed for an improvement of 67.3 million in operating income. This brought operating income to 4.6% of total sales compared to 3.9% in 2015;
c in North America, lower sales were offset by an improvement in operational efficiency leading to an increase in operating income of 25.4 million. Operating income stood at 4.6% of total sales, up compared to 3.9% in 2015;
c in spite of difficult economic and financial conditions, South America finished with an increase of 18.9 million in operating income to -4.3% of total sales compared to -8.5% in 2015;
c in Asia, operating income continued to increase, with an additional contribution of 17.9 million. They accounted for 10.1% of total sales compared to 9.4% in 2015;
c in the rest of the world, South Africa and Iran showed an increase of 10.8 million in operating income. Operating income stood at 8.0% of total sales compared to 3.4% in 2015;

c upon application of accounting rule IFRS 5, the exclusion of the recharge of selling and administrative expenses to discontinued operations (period January 1 to July 29, 2016) generated a non-recurring charge of 15.2 million in 2016 to be compared to 15.1 million in 2015.
In the second half of 2016, operating income totaled 479.9 million (5.2% of total sales). In the second half of 2015, operating income was 446.3 million (4.8% of total sales).
The 33.6 million increase in operating income in the second half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due to:
c in Europe, operating income was relatively stable at 185.9 million, a decrease of 1.8 million. It represented an increase to 4.1% of total sales compared to 4.0% in the second half of 2015;
c in North America, operating income was impacted in the second half-year by the start-up of new programs. It declined by 18.9 million to reach 119.4 million, or 4.6% of total sales compared to 5.1% in the second half of 2015;
c in South America, operating income improved significantly to reach -7.0 million, i.e. an increase of 14.8 million accounting for -2.3% of total sales compared to -9.9% in the second half of 2015;
c in Asia, operating income increased to 170.9 million, an increase of 25.1 million accounting for 10.3% of total sales compared to 9.2% in the second half of 2015;
c in the rest of the world, South Africa and Iran showed an increase of 8.6 million in operating income;

(1) Operating income is the Faurecia group's principal performance indicator. It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:

· income on loans, cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; · other financial income and expense, which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets, the
ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges, changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IAS 39, and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; · taxes.

3.2. Financial structure and net debt

Net increase in cash and cash equivalents stood at 629.7 million, of which 458.5 million of net cash flow and 171.2 million of other investing and financing activities.
The net cash inflow (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements) was 458.5 million over the year compared to a net cash inflow of 302.5 million in 2015. It was attributable to the following:
c the operating income before amortization and depreciation accrual or EBITDA reached 1,639.3 million compared to 1,441.8 million in 2015, due to the increase in operating income for 140.2 million and the increase in depreciation and amortization for 57.3 million;
c restructuring represented cash outflows of 63.5 million compared to 77.0 million in 2015;
c net financial costs represented cash outflows of 132.0 million, versus 208.0 million in 2015;
c the change in working capital requirement, including receivables factoring, represented a positive impact of 162.5 million compared to 153.0 million in 2015. This change consisted in part of an increase in inventories of 151.0 million, a net increase in trade receivables of 6.5 million, an increase in trade payables of 268.6 million and a positive variation of other trade receivables and payables for 38.4 million. (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). The evolution of these balance sheet positions was impacted by exchange rate changes;
c capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and on intangible assets represented cash outflows of 638.0 million, versus 622.7 million in 2015.
Disclosures relative to major investments by business segment and region are provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the 2016 fiscal year (4.2 "Key figures by operating segment"; 4.4 "Key figures by region").
Disclosures relative to key ongoing investments and firm orders for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are provided in Note 31 "Commitments given and potential liabilities" to the consolidated financial statements for 2016:
c capitalized research and development costs represented cash outflows of 406.9 million compared to 308.9 million in 2015;
c income taxes represented cash outflows of 257.7 million, compared to 219.1 million in 2015;

c finally, other cash flow items represented 154.8 million in inflows, compared to 143.4 million in inflows in 2015.
The recurring net cash inflow, restated from exceptional elements (mainly the receivables factoring from Automotive Exteriors for 119 million) amounted to 332.5 million (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements).
The net cash inflow of other investing and financing activities was 171.2 million in 2016. It was attributable to the following:
c the acquisition/disposal of new companies and investments represented net cash inflows of 532.5 million. This includes the Automotive Exteriors business for an enterprise value of 665 million;
c cash flows of discontinued operations represented a cash outflow of 175.0 million;
c dividends paid to shareholders of the parent company represented a cash outflow of 88.8 million compared to 12.8 million in 2015;
c dividends paid to minority shareholders represented 76.2 million in cash outflows compared to 64.5 million in 2015;
c the other factors consisted of an outflow of 21.3 million compared to an outflow of 278.7 million in 2015.
Net debt thus decreased to 341.5 million at year-end 2016, versus 945.8 million at year-end 2015 (see Note 26.1 to the consolidated financial statements).
The shareholders' equity rose from 2,609.5 million at yearend 2015 to 3,157.1 million at year-end 2016, an increase of 547.6 million mainly driven by the net income for the year.
The main elements of long-term financial resources (see Note 26.3 to the consolidated financial statements) are the syndicated credit facility for 1,200 million, signed in December 2014 and renegotiated in 2016, maturing in June 2021 and which was not drawn at December 31, 2016, of 700 million of bonds maturing in June 2022, and 700 million of bonds maturing in June 2023.
490 million of bonds maturing on December 15, 2016 were redeemed early in April 2016. This early redemption eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and the 2022 bonds. The entire long-term debt is no longer subject to guarantees issued by some subsidiaries of the Group.

4 Risk factors Operational risks

The Group takes care to monitor and control risks that may affect the achievement of its objectives. The Board of Directors is accordingly kept informed by the Audit Committee of the main measures taken to watch and monitor risks, the Committee itself being kept informed by the Compliance department, which is required to provide information on Group-wide risks, the nature and individual monitoring of which are described below, at least once a year.
Generally speaking, all the risks identified within the Group are reviewed and discussed by specific bodies and are consolidated by the Group Executive Committee. The executive team of each Business Group is responsible for identifying and managing operational risks inherent to its business which are reviewed every month by its Operations Committee. Financial risks for all Group companies are managed at Group level by the Group Finance department and are reviewed by a special committee as well as locally managed in regional Finance departments via the quarterly review of the accounts for each of the sites in the scope.
Some risks identified as Group-wide are subject to additional review by the Risk Committee.

These risks are associated with safety to persons, quality, program management, liquidity risk, IT risk, the reliability of supplies, asset protection and fire risk, exposure of industrial sites to certain types of natural disasters, international exposure of employees to health and safety risks, the reliability of financial information, compliance, the environment. For the purposes of procedure progress and improvement, the relevance of this list is regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee and the inclusion of new Group-wide risks is submitted to the Audit Committee.
Participants in internal control procedures and their organization are described in greater detail in Section 9.4.3 of the Registration Document.
This chapter presents the main risks to which the Group considers that it is exposed at the date of this Registration Document.
However, other risks that the Group is not aware of at the date of this Registration Document, or which are not considered to date as likely to have a significant unfavorable impact for the Group, its businesses, its financial position, its results or its outlook, may exist or occur.

4.1. Operational risks

4.1.1. RISK OF DEPENDENCE ON THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR

Identification of risk
Specializing in the manufacture of original equipment for its automaker customers, the Faurecia group's business is directly related to the vehicle production levels of these customers in their markets. The cyclical nature that characterizes its customers' business can have a significant impact on the Group's sales and results. The level of sales and automobile output for each of Faurecia's customers depends on numerous parameters, notably the general level of consumption of goods and services in a given market; confidence levels of economic players in that market; buyers' availability to access credit for vehicle purchases; and in some cases governmental aid programs (such as the recent financial support provided to the automotive sector and incentives introduced for the purchase of vehicles).
As such, the Group's sales and net operating income are directly linked to the performance of the automotive industry in the major geographic areas where Faurecia and its customers do business (see Note 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements), especially in Europe (50.0% of total product sales in 2016) in

North America (28.6% of total product sales in 2016) and in Asia (16.9% of total product sales in 2016).
Faurecia's risk is also tied to the commercial success of the models for which it produces components and modules. At the end of a model's life cycle, the risk is also linked to the uncertainty of whether its products will be taken up again for the replacement model. In addition, the orders placed with the Group are binding supply contracts for open orders without any guarantees in terms of volume, that is to say with no guarantee of minimum volume. They are generally based on the life of the vehicle model concerned.
Risk management
As Faurecia's customers include the majority of the world's major automakers, it is totally dependent on developments in the global automotive industry. However, the Group's exposure to customer risk is naturally attenuated by its market share and its diversified international presence.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

4 Risk factors
Operational risks

4.1.2. CUSTOMER RISK AND RISK OF DOWNTURN IN BUSINESS WITH MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Identification of risk
Changes in the automotive sector could accelerate the concentration of automakers, ultimately resulting in the disappearance of certain brands or vehicle models for which the Group produces equipment. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant impact on the Faurecia group's sales, results and future prospects.
Such an impact could also result from a downturn in production from major Group customer facing a slowdown in its activity caused by various situations (for example, but not limited to, allegations against certain automakers concerning emission testing).

Risk management
Faurecia is seeking to optimize the quality and diversity of its customer portfolio.
In 2016, the Faurecia group's five largest automaker customers accounted for 71.8% of product sales (VW 19.1%; Ford 16.9%; Renault-Nissan 15.2%; PSA 13% and GM 7.6%).
The Group also relies on the diversification of its sales by region (see management of the risk of dependence on the automotive sector above), by brand and by model.

4.1.3. CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

Identification of risk
In view of the economic context in the automotive sector, Faurecia cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of its customers may not be able to honor certain contracts or suffer financial difficulties.

Risk management
As of December 31, 2016, late payments represented 135 million or 0.72% of consolidated sales for the year.
Details of trade accounts receivable and other receivables are provided in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

4.1.4. SUPPLIER RISK

Identification of risk
If one or more of the Group's main suppliers were to go bankrupt, or experience an unforeseen stock-out, quality problems, a strike or any other incident disrupting its supplies for which it were liable, this could impact Faurecia's production output or lead to additional costs that would affect the Group's sales, results and overall financial position.
Risk management
The Group uses a large number of suppliers based in different countries for its raw materials and basic parts supplies.

In 2016, out of a total of approximately 8,806 million in purchases (production and indirect purchases) from approximately 3,043 main suppliers, the ten biggest suppliers together accounted for 26% of the Business Groups' combined purchases and 12% of the total consolidated sales.
Purchases from the five biggest suppliers of each of the Business Groups together accounted for 18% of total purchases and 8% of total consolidated sales.
In this same year, purchases from the biggest supplier of each of the Business Groups together accounted for 6% of total purchases and 3% of total consolidated sales.
Faurecia closely monitors the quality and reliability of suppliers' production operations as well as their credit status and sustainability in order to ensure that the Group's supply chain is secure.

4.1.5. RISK RELATED TO ORDER VOLUMES

Identification of risk
As a components producer and components and systems assembler for the automotive industry, and given the high volumes that its customers order, Faurecia constantly has to adapt its business activity to its customers' demands in terms of their supply chain, production operations, services and R&D. Should the Group, or one of its suppliers or service providers, default at any stage of the manufacturing process, the Group could be held liable for failure to fulfill its contractual obligations or for technical problems.
The Group could also be required to make certain investments which may not be offset by customer order volumes.
Risk management
To minimize this risk the Faurecia group's purchasing policy is based on a regularly reviewed panel of suppliers. Suppliers' operational and financial performance is monitored on an ongoing basis so that any restructuring and protection measures that may prove to be required in order to achieve security of supply (quantities and costs) can be successfully taken. Within

this context, Faurecia's purchasing teams help suppliers to expand and to reduce their risks on both an industrial and a financial level, in particular, by providing operational support to improve their efficiency, quality, logistics, and cost control by means of specialist teams working with suppliers on their own premises. These teams also support suppliers in their international expansion. In addition, any new order placed with a supplier is the result of a Sourcing Committee decision following an investigation which includes an assessment of the risks associated with said supplier and supplier panel policy is, furthermore, monitored by a specialist product family purchasing organization.
Quality is also subject to specific management and related risks are assessed using specific indicators covered in monthly reports and improvement plans as described in Section 9.4.4.2 of this Registration Document.
The Group also uses a forward management method (five-year plan, yearly and half-yearly budget, monthly reviews) which enables it to fine-tune its means of production.
The variety of its customer and product mix and the diversification of its geographic locations is also a significant means of moderating this risk.

4.1.6. RISK RELATED TO THE USE OF IT SYSTEMS

Identification of risk
The business processes related to orders, supplies and invoicing are supported by the central ERP (SAP based) for most of the Group's entities. These processes are formalized within procedures that are reviewed regularly for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The tasks must be separated to ensure the safety of the process and the inherent risks.

c implementation of a computerized purchase order validation process at several levels depending on the amount concerned;
c centralized management of supplier standards by a specific team using a validation process with several stages;
c strict separation of the tasks between the different stages of these processes, which is continuously controlled using a dedicated tool to both prevent and detect anomalies.

Risk management
In order to cover the potential risks of deviation from these processes, numerous controls have been implemented, such as:
c management of access rights based on an identity management solution including a validation process for requests and a related audit trail;

4.1.7. RISK RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY

Identification of risk
As part of its external growth policy, Faurecia has made, and may make in the future, acquisitions of varying sizes, some of which have been and may be significant on a Group-wide scale.
These acquisitions entail risks, such as:
c the assumptions of the Business Plans on which valuations are made may prove incorrect, especially in respect of synergies and assessments of market demand;
c Faurecia may not succeed in integrating the acquired companies, their technologies, product ranges and employees;
c Faurecia may not be in a position to retain some key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired companies;
c Faurecia may be forced or decide to terminate pre-existing contractual relationships with costly and/or unfavorable financial conditions; and
c Faurecia may increase its debt with a view to financing these acquisitions or refinancing the debt of the acquired companies.

As a result, the benefits expected from future acquisitions or those already made may not be confirmed within the expected time frames and/or levels and, consequently, may affect the Faurecia group's financial position.
The main acquisitions made by the Group over the last few years are described in Section 11.4 of this Registration Document.
Risk management
The Board of Directors determines the Group's overall strategy. The Executive Management oversees this strategy and allocates the resources required for its implementation.
The team responsible for Business Development, which reports to the Group's Executive Vice-President responsible for strategy is very closely involved in the life of the entities resulting from growth operations (joint ventures, acquisitions) and so takes part in decision-making bodies.
Faurecia also sets aside any provisions that may prove to be required under applicable accounting standards, in particular, for the depreciation of assets.

4.1.8. INTERNATIONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Identification of risk
Due to the international nature of its business activities, Faurecia is exposed to economic, political, fiscal, legal and other types of risks.
The Group's sales are mostly generated in Europe, North America and Asia. The geographic breakdown of sales is provided in Note 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group's activities are exposed to certain risks, including:
c any potential changes to laws or regulations, or to the commercial, monetary or fiscal policies;
c customs regulations, foreign exchange controls, investment restrictions or requirements or any other constraint such as

levies or other forms of taxation on settlements and other payment; and
c difficulties in enforcing agreements, collecting payments due and protecting property through foreign legal systems, in particular, where intellectual property protection is less stringent.
Risk management
The Group relies on the expertise of its Legal, Tax and Finance departments which permanently monitor legislation and regulations in France and abroad via local intermediaries (employees, networks of lawyers, tax specialists, etc.).

4.1.9. COMPETITIVENESS

Identification of risk
The global automotive supply sector is highly competitive. Competition is based mainly on price, technology, quality, delivery and customer service as a whole. There are no guarantees that Faurecia products will be able to compete successfully with those of its competitors. Supply contracts are mostly awarded through competitive bids which take the form of Requests for Quotation (RFQ), and are often subject to renewed bidding when their terms expire.
Without prejudice to Faurecia's ranking, the three main competitors by Business Group are as follows:
c Faurecia Seating:
c Adient (UK), company listed in the United States, a result of the split of Johnson Controls International,
c Lear Corp. (United States), company listed in the United States,
c Magna International Inc. (Canada), company listed in the United States and Canada;
c Faurecia Interiors:
c Yanfeng Automotive Interiors (YFAI) (China),
c IAC (International Automotive Components) (United States),
c Grupo Antolin (Spain);

c Faurecia Clean Mobility:
c Tenneco (United States), a listed company in the US,
c Eberspächer (Germany),
c Boysen (Germany).
Risk management
Innovation and product development represent major challenges for Faurecia and enable it to remain competitive. As a result, gross R&D expenditures totaled 1,021.5 million in 2016 (5.5% of net sales). The share of innovation grew over the same period. It amounted to 120 million.
More than 6,000 engineers and technicians based in 30 centers represent the Group's global R&D community. Five hundred patents were filed in 2016.
In addition, each Business Group monitors the competition on an ongoing basis so that it can respond in the best possible way to calls to tender from automakers and, in particular, to their specific demands for the supply of complex equipment.

Financial and market risks

4.2. Financial and market risks

Given its level of debt, the Group is exposed to significant risks related to liquidity and changes in interest rates. It is also exposed to currency risks as its production sites are located in a large number of countries outside of the euro zone. Faurecia's counterparty risk in relation to its derivatives is not significant as the majority of its derivatives are set up with leading banks

with strong ratings that form part of its banking pool. The Group Finance and Treasury department authorizes any new banking relations and the opening of accounts.
Generally, interest rate and currency risks are managed centrally for the Group as a whole by the Group Finance department.

4.2.1. INTEREST RATE RISK

Identification of risk
Rate risk results from interest rate changes, particularly the impact of a rate hike on the variable portion of the debt which would be reflected by a rise in finance costs.
Risk management
Faurecia manages hedging of interest rate risks on a central basis. Said management is implemented through the Group Finance and Treasury department, which reports to Group Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Finance Committee that meets on a monthly basis.
As a significant part of the borrowings (syndicated credit facility (when drawn), short-term loans, commercial paper as applicable) are at variable rates. The aim of the Group's interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact on earnings

of changes in short-term rates. The hedges arranged comprise mainly euro denominated interest rate swaps. These hedges protect some of the interest payable in 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018 against a rise in rates. The Group's interest rate position based on the nature of the instruments used and the sensitivity of interest expense to short-term rates are disclosed in Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Before taking into account the impact of interest rate hedges, 20.0% of the Group's borrowings were at variable rates as of the end of December 2016, compared with 28.1% as of year-end 2015. The variable-rate debt primarily consists of short-term debt.
The main components of the fixed rate debt are:
c bonds maturing in June 2022, issued in March and April 2015 for a total amount of 700 million;
c bonds maturing in June 2023, issued in April 2016 for a total amount of 700 million.

4.2.2. CURRENCY RISK

Identification of risk
Faurecia is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of certain currencies, particularly due to the location of some of its production sites, as well as the fact that certain subsidiaries purchase raw materials and other supplies or sell their products in a currency other than their functional currency.
The Group is also subject to currency risk linked to the contribution of the subsidiaries, whose accounting currency is not the euro, to the consolidated results of the Group. The sales,

results and cash flows of these subsidiaries, when converted into euros, are sensitive to fluctuations in their accounting currency against the euro.
Risk management
Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements gives the description of the underlying currency positions and the derivative instruments hedging them, as well as the sensitivity of the Group's net income and shareholders' equity to fluctuations against the euro of the various currencies to which it is exposed.

4 Risk factors Financial and market risks

4.2.3. LIQUIDITY RISK

Identification of risk
To finance its investments and its other cash requirements, Faurecia is obliged to access finance sourced from both financial institutions and financial markets.
Risk management
During the 2016 fiscal year, Faurecia continued to reinforce the financial solidity and financing sources.
CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE BONDS
On December 7, 2015, Faurecia announced its intention to reimburse at par value on January 15, 2016 the OCEANE bonds issued in September 2012, with a principal amount of 250 million, maturing on January 1, 2018. Following this announcement, 94.5% of the OCEANE bonds have been converted as of December 31, 2015, and the principal amount of remaining bonds outstanding at this date was 13.7 million. As of January 15, 2016, almost the entire amount has been converted and the residual nominal of 0.2 million has been reimbursed.
2023 BONDS
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.

These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.
The 490 million of bonds maturing on December 15, 2016, and guaranteed by certain Group subsidiaries, were redeemed early ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of the par plus interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million. This early redemption also eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and 2022 bonds.
On June 24, 2016, the 1,200 million syndicated credit facility, set up in November 2014, was renegotiated to extend the maturity to five years as of this date, i.e. June 24, 2021, and to improve its terms and conditions.
In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed, on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2016 this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility includes only one covenant concerning compliance with consolidated financial ratios (instead of two in the previous credit facility): the net debt*/EBITDA ratio** must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
The various components of Faurecia's long-term debt and the maturities of the Group's liquidities are described in Notes 26.2 and 26.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

As is noted in Note 26.3 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2016, Faurecia was compliant with the financial ratio required by the syndicated credit facility:

Ratio Net debt*/EBITDA**

Limit < 2.50

Carrying amount as of 31/12/2016
0.21

* Consolidated net debt. ** Operating income plus depreciation, amortization and funding of provisions for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, corresponding
to the past 12 months.

Financial and market risks

In addition to the above-described bank and bond debt, part of Faurecia's liquidity requirements is met through receivables sale programs. Cash from receivables sold came to 1,047.5 million as of December 31, 2016 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements), including 1,045.9 million from receivables that were sold and derecognized (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).
Lastly, Faurecia regularly issued commercial paper to investors, mainly in France, particularly during the first half of 2016.
In addition, the disposal of the Automotive Exteriors business to Plastic Omnium, for an enterprise value of 665 million, was finalized on July 29, 2016.
On March 15, 2016, Moody's raised Faurecia's rating by one notch from Ba3 to Ba2, while maintaining a positive outlook.

On April 11, 2016, Fitch Ratings also raised the rating by one notch from BB- to BB, with a stable outlook.
As of December 31, 2016, Faurecia had diversified funds with staggered maturities until 2023. On that date, the average weighted maturity of the Group's main long-term financial resources (the bonds maturing in 2022 and 2023, the syndicated credit facility and the other main long-term borrowings), is 5.2 years.
Thus, in view of the Group's current situation, and notwithstanding the possible future consequences of any deterioration in its operations or outlook, Faurecia does not believe itself to be exposed to significant liquidity risk.

4.2.4. RISK RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS

Identification of risk
The Group is exposed to raw material risk via its direct raw materials purchases or indirectly through components purchased from its suppliers.
The Group's operating and net income can be adversely affected by changes in the prices of the raw materials it uses, notably steel and plastics.
In 2016, plastics and steel accounted for approximately 8.3% of the Group's total purchases.
To the extent that the Group's sales contracts with customers do not include systematic price indexation clauses linked to the price of its raw materials, Faurecia is exposed to risks related to unfavorable fluctuations in raw material prices.

Risk management
Efforts are made to reduce this exposure by continually negotiating conditions with customers and strictly managing inventories. Faurecia does not use derivatives to hedge its purchases of raw materials or energy.
Faurecia still has a low level of exposure to this risk however, since a large proportion of the raw material price fluctuation is passed on to customers on a "pass through basis". Faurecia's remaining exposure is, therefore, around 30% of the total raw materials exposure.
A 10% fluctuation in the price of raw materials, not including component purchases, would have a 0.2% impact on operating income (expressed as a percentage of total sales).

4.3. Legal risks

4.3.1. LITIGATION

Identification of risk
As a reminder, on March 25, 2014, the European Commission and the Department of Justice of the United States of America and on November 27, 2014, the Competition Commission of South Africa, initiated an enquiry covering certain suppliers of emission control systems on the basis for suspicions of anti-competitive practices in this segment. Faurecia is one of the companies covered by these enquiries. These enquiries are ongoing.
On March 24, 2016, two class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against several suppliers of emissions control systems, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to Exhaust Systems, and seeking unspecified amounts of civil damages. Faurecia Emissions Control Technologies US, LLC, is one of the companies named as defendants. Faurecia S.A., initially named as an additional defendant, was dismissed from these two class actions further to a Court decision rendered on March 21, 2017. In addition, on November 9, 2016, a third class action was filed in the same District Court.
Except for the Competition Authorities' enquiries and the class actions mentioned above, as of the date of this Registration Document there were no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Group was aware) likely to have, or have had a significant impact on the Group's financial position or profitability in the past twelve months.
In its decision of December 18, 2014, the Enforcement Committee of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) considered that Faurecia S.A. and its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yann Delabrière, had failed to meet certain obligations defined in Articles 223-1, 223-2 and 223-10-1 of the AMF General Regulation pertaining to information related to the Company's objectives for 2012. On the basis of Articles L. 621-15 (paragraphs II (c) and III (c)) of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the AMF fined Faurecia S.A. and its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yann Delabrière, 2 million and 100,000, respectively. On February 26, 2015, Faurecia S.A. and Mr. Yann Delabrière, supported by the Board of Directors of

the Company, lodged an appeal against this decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. In a ruling rendered on June 30, 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal, considering that the decision did not enable an assessment of the proportionality of the fine, decided that the financial penalty imposed on the Company should be overturned and, as a consequence, reduced to 1 million. As regards Mr. Yann Delabrière, the Paris Court of Appeal found no evidence of personal wrongdoing and maintained the penalty solely in his capacity as legal representative of the Company. On August 22, 2016, the Company and Mr. Yann Delabrière lodged a further appeal against this ruling before the French Supreme Court. The proceedings are currently pending before this Court.
Faurecia believes that, in view of the nature and amounts of the claims and litigation that were known or in process at the date of this Registration Document, such disputes would not materially affect its consolidated financial position in the event of an unfavorable outcome.
However, Faurecia cannot guarantee that in the future Group's subsidiaries will not be involved in legal, administrative, or regulatory proceedings, particularly in view of the complex regulatory requirements applicable to the Group; technical failures, or breaches of contract by customers, suppliers or partners.
Situations such as those described above could have a significant unfavorable impact on the Group's operations and/or financial position.
Risk management
Litigation is monitored through quarterly reports prepared by the Legal department.
Adequate provisions have been set aside to cover litigation facing the Group, in accordance with the facts and information available at the balance sheet date. Note 24 to the 2016 consolidated financial statements gives a description of claims and litigation currently in process and indicates the total amount of provisions for litigation.

4.3.2 RISK RELATING TO REGULATORY CHANGE

Identification of risk
Faurecia is exposed, in each country where the Group is present, to any potential changes to applicable laws and regulations.
In this respect, Faurecia benefits in France from the specific regime of tax credits based on the research and development activity conducted in the country. Faurecia cannot be sure that such tax provisions will be maintained in the future.

Risk management
As indicated in Section 4.1.8, the Group relies on the expertise of its Legal, Tax and Finance departments which permanently monitor legislation and regulations in France and abroad via local intermediaries (employees, networks of lawyers, tax specialists, etc.).

4.3.3. INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY RISK

Identification of risk
The Group cannot rule out the risk that its third-party intellectual and/or industrial property rights may not be published or identified to date, or may be disputed by a third party on the grounds of pre-existing rights or for any other reason. Furthermore, for countries outside France the Group ensures that it holds or obtains intellectual and industrial property rights offering the same level of protection as those in France. The same holds true regarding respecting the intellectual and industrial property rights of third parties.
Risk management
Faurecia's proactive research and development policy allows the Group to be at the root of its own innovations and control the patents protecting them. Where possible and when justified

by strategic technological considerations, Faurecia registers patents to protect the intellectual property relating to innovations and developments from Group's research.
Faurecia also considers that its products, modules or systems face a limited and perfectly reasonable risk concerning thirdparty intellectual and industrial property rights. This is primarily due to the Company's policy aimed at obtaining industrial property rights, its specialized services, and its network of experts. No technological dependence was identified. Faurecia uses third-party patents under license in the normal course of business. None of these licenses represent a major industrial or financial risk.
Faurecia considers that it either owns or may validly use all the intellectual and industrial property rights required for its business operations and that it has taken all reasonable measures to protect its rights or obtain guarantees from the owners of third-party rights.

Industrial and environmental risks

4.4. Industrial and environmental risks

Identification of risks
As with any industrial activity, the Group's sites are exposed to various risks: fire, explosion, natural disaster, systems failure, pollution, non-compliance with regulations or stricter regulations applicable or other factors. These types of events may result in the Group incurring additional costs and/or capital expenditure to remedy the situation, to comply with regulations and/or as a result of any fines.

Risk management
Faurecia conducts surveillance and monitoring of its environmental risks as described in Section 9.4 of this Registration Document.
As Faurecia does not have any captive insurance entities, its system for safeguarding assets is based on the implementation and ongoing adaptation of its risk prevention policy and, as described in Section 4.5, its strategy of transferring its principal risks to the insurance market.

4.4.1 ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

Identification of risk
Considering its industrial activity, Faurecia cannot exclude the risk of pollution affecting the environment (soil, water, air).
Risk management
The Group is focused on managing the environmental impact of all its sites, from the planning phase right through to day-to-day on-site operations.
HUMAN RESOURCES
Environmental policies are defined and deployed by the HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) departments for each Business Group. To accomplish their mission, these departments have established a network of HSE Managers for each Division (mainly on a geographical basis), along with HSE coordinators within each Faurecia site. These coordinators bring their expertise to the factory management team, are responsible for implementing procedures, and ensure compliance with regulations and Faurecia standards. This organization also enables good practices to be applied across all sites within a single Business Group and/or across the three Business Groups. In some cases, this feedback can lead to Group regulations.
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The amount of investment in environmental protection, noise reduction and equipment upgrades reported by establishments is available in Section 8.1.2.1.
METHODOLOGY
Environmental risk analysis and control are based on ISO 14001. Figures for ISO 14001 certified sites are available in

Section 8.1.2.1 of this Registration Document. Regular audits by the Internal Auditors and accredited testing laboratories, such as SGS, provide assurance that the environmental management system is properly applied.
On account of their industrial nature, the Group's sites and operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations, as well as to the possible interpretation of such laws and regulations by various authorities and jurisdictions, in the various countries where it operates. Such authorities and jurisdictions are imposing increasingly stringent obligations, restrictions and protective measures in relation, amongst other things, to atmospheric emissions, waste water, the use and handling of hazardous products, waste disposal and pollution control. Each site has to obtain permits, licenses and/ or authorizations or provide prior notifications (for example, in France, in application of legislation on classified installations for environmental protection).
Faurecia's installations must comply with such permits, licenses or authorizations and are subject to regular inspections by the relevant authorities.
Since 2012, Faurecia carefully assesses the environmental impact of its industrial projects, by systematically conducting environmental audits and subsoil investigations when appropriate. Furthermore, in the context of industrial restructuring resulting in plant closures, the Faurecia group systematically assesses the environmental impact and carries out a soil and subsoil investigation when appropriate. In any event, Faurecia ensures that sites are restored in accordance with local laws and the future use of the land.
With regard to the environmental risks associated with chemicals, the Group more than complies with regulatory requirements, in particular, with regard to the handling, storage, use and removal of the products in question. Under the new EU regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), which came into effect on

June 1, 2007, the Group is principally a "downstream user". It works in conjunction with automotive industry subcontractors within federations or associations such as the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) or the French Alliance of Automotive Suppliers (FIEV). This point is discussed

in Section 8.1.1. "Faurecia's products and the environment" of this Registration Document.
The amount of the provisions for environmental risks are indicated in Section 8.1.2.7 of this Registration Document.

4.4.2 FIRE RISK/EXPLOSION

Identification of risk
Due to its business, the Group's plants are exposed to fire risk, mainly linked to the presence of combustible materials (plastic, foam).
Risk management
Faurecia's industrial risk prevention policy aims to reduce accidents caused by fire and to encourage Group sites to achieve excellence in fire safety by obtaining the Highly Protected Risk (HPR) label from Faurecia's insurer. The HPR policy is based on the following priorities: c fire safety audits conducted by the Group's insurer on an annual
basis; 109 sites were audited in 2016, 37 of which were new sites. 91% of active sites have already been subject to an audit.

The sites that have not yet been audited are recent sites that will be audited in 2017. 54% of the audited sites are classified as HPR or pre-HPR, which covers 66% of total capital;
c incorporating fire safety factors into the early stages of any plant design or major refurbishing of existing sites, through fire partitioning and ensuring that adequate fire safety equipment, such as extinguishers, is available;
c analysis and assessment of feedback, fires or simple outbreaks of fire are systematically analyzed and the results of this analysis shared with the plants' HSE network;
c an intranet-based fire safety management system, through which the HPR policy is relayed to the entire Group by placing technical specifications, experience-based information and best practices online;
c a single data platform to manage all audit reports, action plans for improvement, and the audit program in the same place.

4.4.3 RISKS LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Identification of risks
Among the risks associated with climate change, Faurecia cannot, because of its international scope, rule out the risk of exposure of its industrial facilities to extreme climate phenomena (flood, hurricane, storms, etc.). Among the sites within the reporting scope, 57 production sites have been identified as located in a potential flooding zone, three sites are located in a very strong wind zone (zone 3: 213-251 km/h) and one site is located in a very high seismic activity zone.
As its processes do not consume large quantities of water, Faurecia does not consider the risk of drought to be material for its business. Figures on water consumption, in particular the breakdown between water used for processes and for sanitation, are available in Section 8.1.2.4 of this Registration Document.

Risk management
The prevention of natural risks is integrated with the Group's overall industrial risk prevention policy, aiming to reduce accidents linked to natural disasters in partnership with our insurer.
All of the existing industrial facilities are covered by an exposure diagnosis conducted with the technical support of the Group's insurers and reinsurers. The most exposed sites in terms of flooding and seismic activity are the subject of a specific audit by technical experts (partnership with Allianz for the flooding risk and with AXA for the seismic risk): five flood risk audits were carried out in 2016. The purpose of these audits is to define the risks and identify the technical and organizational actions that need to be implemented. The setting up of mitigation

Risk factors
Insurance and coverage of risks

measures (emergency plan, process safety, building safety, etc.) is monitored at Group level with a "mitigation index".
Since 2014, Faurecia systematically checks the exposure of its industrial projects. The natural risks profile of a site is one of the criteria taken into account when deciding on a new location.
In July 2016, Faurecia set up a real-time and around-theclock hydro-meteorological monitoring system covering all of

its industrial facilities. This support service, provided by the company Predict Service, warns sites of coming events via real-time e-mail or SMS alerts. Depending on the alert level, a series of reactions is defined in action sheets so that appropriate measures are taken to prepare for the event and to ensure the safety and resilience of employees. Over the reporting period, 30 alerts were issued, with no on-site injury.

4.5. Insurance and coverage of risks

4.5.1 FIRE, PROPERTY DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE

Faurecia has taken out a fire, property damage and business interruption insurance policy with a co-insurance group of major insurers led by Allianz. On July 1, 2016, a 5% decrease in rates was obtained and the conditions were extended until July 1, 2018. In 2016, the Group paid approximately 6.8 million (inclusive of all tax) for property, casualty and business interruption insurance. This amount was down due to the combined effect of the lower rates and the disposal of the bumpers business.
The coverage for buildings and equipment is based on replacement value. Coverage is organized around a Master policy, which includes direct coverage for the freedom of services area, with local policies for subsidiaries in countries located outside this area. Special coverage has been set up to cover specific risks in certain countries.

Since July 2010, the premiums applicable to the capital at risk (direct loss and annual gross margin) are directly dependent on the HPR classification given to the site following an audit by the insurance company.
In 2015, several moderately serious claims were filed for an estimated total of around 6.2 million: fire and machinery breakdown in an American factory, a client default claim due to flooding in Chennai (India) in December. There was no significant claim in 2016.
Damage insurance is supplemented by builder's risk insurance and insurance covering the transportation of goods or equipment and political risk.

4.5.2 LIABILITY INSURANCE

Since January 1, 2013, the AXA group has been Faurecia's primary liability insurer. Liability insurance covers operating liability, product liability after delivery, including the risk of product recall. Liability insurance takes the form of a "Master" policy combined with local policies taken out in countries where Faurecia has subsidiaries.
Several claims were filed in the United States and in Europe in 2014 and 2016. These claims, which are still being processed, affected the terms and conditions of the liability insurance program.

The Groups' liability insurance schedule also includes specific policies such as environmental liability insurance and coverage of liability for damages resulting from accidents caused by employees' occupational illnesses.
In 2016, the Group paid approximately 6.8 million (inclusive of all tax) in premiums for its civil liability policies.

Safety in the workplace

5.1. Safety in the workplace

Safety in the workplace is one of the key elements of the excellence initiative embodied by the Faurecia Excellence System (FES). It forms part of the personal respect requirement which every facility must satisfy. Faurecia's policy on health and safety in the workplace is based on two main objectives: safeguarding the health of its employees and improving their safety while at their place of work.

Thanks to Faurecia constant commitment to enhancing occupational safety and working conditions, Faurecia has consistently reduced the number of work-related accidents since 2003. To speed up this change, in 2010, Faurecia launched a breakthrough safety plan which, in two years, enabled it to achieve its highly ambitious objective of reducing the frequency of work-related accidents with lost time per million working hours by two thirds.

5.1.1. WORKPLACE SAFETY INDICATORS

The change in the frequency rate of work-related injuries is analyzed in order to measure the effectiveness of actions carried out in this area. To guarantee the same level of workplace safety for all employees, temporary workers are included in the same manner as permanent staff in the following indicators:
c the Group's excellence indicators are FR0t and FR1t. FR0t measures the number of work-related accidents involving a Faurecia employee or temporary worker, with lost time, per million hours worked. FR1t measures the number of workrelated accidents involving a Faurecia employee or temporary

worker, with or without lost time, per million hours worked across the Group. Both indicators are calculated on a rolling six-month basis.
After each FR0t and FR1t accident, a Quick Response Continuous Improvement (QRCI) analysis is performed using a problemsolving method based on the best practices in terms of solving quality problems to ensure that the root causes of the accident are understood, that corrective actions have been effective and that preventative measures are implemented and shared across the various sites.

An FR1t of 1.8 was obtained in 2016, representing an improvement of 80% since 2009.
The rates shown above, calculated on a rolling six-month basis, indicate the accident incidence rates approved as of the end of each fiscal year. For 2016, the results for the first and second half of the year are shown separately.
c In its plants, Faurecia also monitors the FR2t indicator. This indicator measures the number of first aid procedures performed following an incident per million hours worked. This monitoring enables plants that have few accidents, with or without lost time to focus on accident prevention and relevant priorities.

c In 2016, the Group did not report an accident severity indicator because its priority was accident prevention.
c The monitoring of first aid concerns all autonomous production units, combined with application of the QRCI problemsolving method. This has enabled production managers to take greater responsibility for accident investigations and to increase their responsiveness.

5.1.2. SAFETY INITIATIVES FOR SAFER OPERATIONS

Faurecia has fully integrated specific measures from its 2010 breakthrough safety plan into its practices.
It offers its employee network (including temporary employees) HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) training in the thirteen mandatory HSE rules and the thirteen HSE logistics recommendations within special company training programs. The training includes well-targeted theory and practice modules with practical scenarios which allow employees to learn or improve their knowledge of the HSE rules.
As a reminder, the purpose of the Breakthrough Safety Plan is to reduce the number of work-related accidents and serious HSE alerts following work-related accidents by providing training in the Group's various mandatory HSE rules as well as in monitoring the application of these rules.
Faurecia has defined 13 mandatory personal safety-related HSE rules. These rules have been deployed at all Faurecia sites.

Any plant reporting a serious HSE alert or an abnormally high work-related accident rate was audited by the Group's Quality department. An unsatisfactory audit result (level D) systematically results in a report being sent to the Group's Chief Executive Officer. No site has been on level D since the end of 2011. Faurecia ensures that these rules are applied at all the other sites by means of FES production audits.
Applying these 13 rules has made it possible to significantly reduce the number of serious HSE alerts and to achieve the FR0t objective.
In addition to the 13 mandatory HSE rules, Faurecia defined 3 rules on personal protection equipment (3PPE) for all Group sites. The application of these rules and their monitoring via FES production audits is speeding up the rate of reduction of workrelated accidents not resulting in lost time (FR1t).

Safety in the workplace

A film has been made about the 13 mandatory HSE and the 3 PPE rules so as to raise awareness among Faurecia employees. This film, with the help of practical scenarios demonstrating the different rules, is also intended for FES training for managers and was notably used in Europe, North and South America and Asia. In particular, these training courses focused on learning about HSE QRCI.
Three mandatory HSE rules apply to the control of nonproduction operational risks. The first two cover consignment operations (stopping processes, locking and draining energy and blocking gravitational energy), the third requires the application of a "Personal ID" label when working with equipment. This prevents machines being restarted by others, the owner of the personal ID label being the only person entitled to remove it from the machine.
Four rules apply to the protection of personnel during production operations. They cover protection against access to moving parts of machines through the establishment of protective devices such as light curtains, safety mats, radars and fixed barriers. The plant must ensure that the failure of one component of the safety loop will stop the machine automatically. Protective equipment is tested before production begins. If the protective equipment has any faults, the machine must not be used.
The other rules focus on the prevention of falls, finger pinch point injuries, traffic accidents, the bursting of hydraulic circuits, and fires and explosions.
The three rules related to protective equipment require the wearing of helmets during maintenance operations, gloves and cut-resistant sleeves when using cutting elements or handling metal, and thermal protection when working with hot materials. These rules also make it mandatory to wear ear protectors in noisy environments.
Furthermore, each Faurecia plant defines, on an individual basis, the personal protection equipment to be used by its employees or visitors. Faurecia safety footwear and clothing is mandatory in nearly all the plants. Ear protectors are mandatory in plants with high noise levels, as well as, in most cases, safety glasses.
Faurecia further pursues its fire safety initiatives, particularly with the installation of sprinklers. In doing that, the Group not only ensures the safety of its staff, but also reduces the risk of production downtime due to fire.

The analysis of accidents has shown that many are related to work outside the standard production process. For this reason, the plants will now systematically review potential risks for this type of work.
The analysis also showed a relative weakness in logistics areas (58% of the accidents were due to standards not being deployed or correctly respected, and most of the other accidents were mainly due to the absence of risk detection). As a result, Faurecia developed 13 strict HSE recommendations. Five of these relate to plant safety, four to the safety of machine operators, two to vehicles and the last two relate to pedestrians. The Faurecia group has been monitoring the application of these 13 rules in all of its plants. In 2016, deployment began of a new training module intended for the logistics teams.
The actions concerning the safety of contractors (including subcontractors) working at high levels were maintained. The contractor and subcontractor requirement levels have been raised and now require risk assessment, training and verification. A risk assessment is conducted with the contractor in order to detect all risks and devise preventive measures. Contractors are asked to guarantee that all employees (including temporary staff) carrying out tasks at high levels have been trained and are fully qualified. Each contractor must appoint a security manager who will guarantee that all measures devised during the risk assessment are applied and adhered to. As a result, only the contractors who have followed this process are authorized to work on the roofs at Faurecia plants.
As an indication, in 2016, two major actions were implemented within Faurecia Seating:
c the TRUST approach: TR for Training; U for Understanding (verification of the understanding of the training received); ST for Supervision of the Teams (verification that the teams effectively apply the training received while offering the possibility to report anomalies to Management);
c the requirement levels have been raised. Safer and more robust procedures have been deployed to secure the consignment operations and prevent any drift in their implementation.
Within the Faurecia Interiors Business Group, and following several fire starts, the implementation of a comprehensive breakthrough plan to reduce this risk. The two main actions of this plan relate to the reinforcement of the reaction rules and the rules for increasing the safety of machinery.

5.1.3. ERGONOMICS AND WORKING CONDITIONS

Most occupational illnesses reported by employees involve musculoskeletal disorders. To reduce this, Faurecia has taken steps for several years to take the strain caused by workstations into greater consideration and to remedy the situation as much as possible.
Ergonomic reviews of workstations form part of the FES and the Group systematically carries out audits at each of its manufacturing sites on an annual basis.
As a result of these reviews, a variety of solutions have been implemented for manufacturing workstations. The reviews are also used to prepare a list of recommendations that are systematically taken into account during the design of products and manufacturing tools. A number of recommendations from professional ergonomists and Group HSE coordinators are being factored into the Program Management System (PMS).
All of the Group's operations managers and plant managers have been given training in ergonomics as part of the acceleration of the deployment of the FES, which was launched during the

second half of 2009 and continued in subsequent years. The goal of this program is to ensure that these managers play a real leadership role in the continuous improvement process, notably for ergonomics-related issues.
An "Ergonomics" memorandum is available to all Group process engineers and managers in charge of efficiency in manufacturing systems, to provide additional information on analyzing workloads and how to take into consideration the ergonomic constraints of workstations. This memorandum is aimed at providing basic training in this area for people such as members of Health and Safety Committees, who are involved in organizing work schedules or designing workstations.
Within the Faurecia Seating Business Group a new ranking software tool was deployed in 2016 for analyzing dangerous gesture and their impact on workplace strain (AGREPT ­ Analyse des Gestes à Risque et leur Effet sur la Pénibilité au Travail). This software simplifies the rating actions for ergonomists while facilitating the consolidation work at Division and Business Group level.

5.2. Skills development

Faurecia's employees progress within a meritocratic environment where their advancement is dependent on their potential and performance. The Group's growth and development is directly dependent on the commitment levels and skills of its teams and its capacity to set up the best teams of managers and experts, on a worlwide level. Effective management of Human Resources

is, therefore, right at the heart of Faurecia group strategy and is based on three principles: involvement, performance and development. Internal promotion is a key priority. It is based on individual development and makes it possible to capitalize on automotive know-how, expertise and a high level of customer insight.

5.2.1. BEING FAURECIA

Faurecia has inherited a long tradition of technological innovation and manufacturing excellence, although it was created in 1997. Since then, the Group has grown rapidly both organically and through major acquisitions. It is now one of the top global automotive suppliers and employs more than 98,000 people in 33 countries.
During this first phase of its history, the Group has focused on developing systems and processes necessary to ensure that it provides the same level of quality and operating performance to all of its customers around the world.

The Group has now entered a new phase of development, characterized by steadier growth and a greater emphasis on value creation.
With this in mind, in 2016 the Faurecia group continued to deploy its cultural transformation program known as "Being Faurecia", launched in 2014, which aims to redefine the corporate culture and management model. The program seeks to create an environment that promotes an entrepreneurial spirit and autonomous operating teams. Furthermore, Faurecia has redefined its Human Resources development strategy, by revising and improving most of the HR development processes, while continuing to give priority to internal mobility.

The Group's Human Resources policy and social policy

Skills development

Faurecia is positioning itself as a company that is focused on creating value, is customer-oriented, innovative and has management principles based on self-control, the pursuit of excellence and entrepreneurship.
The corporate values are now broken down into managerial values (entrepreneurship, autonomy and accountability) and behavioral values (respect, exemplarity and energy). The Group developed a Code of Management to encourage exemplary behavior within the organization. Relying on practical situations that managers face during their daily activities, this management guide defines the exemplary behavior that is expected from managers.
It has reinforced the decentralized organizational principles. It has also systematically reviewed the decision-making processes, significantly reduced their number and simplified their content in order to effectively increase the teams' selfsufficiency at various levels of the organization.
In 2016, new initiatives were launched within the framework of Being Faurecia. Particular attention has been paid to the

Corporate Training offer. All of the Leadership Development programs have been reviewed, and modules relating to Diversity Management and Compliance have been developed. In this context, the Group's digital training platform was extensively used. Lastly, a program for the development of collaborative working was launched to promote horizontal ways of working within the Company.
The second anniversary of Being Faurecia was celebrated at all Group sites. They have encouraged all staff to take on board the Group values and bear witness to the Group's strong commitment to the success of its cultural transformation.
Finally, in December 2016, a survey was conducted with a representative sample of managers in order to measure the level of adherence and commitment to Being Faurecia within teams. It will be followed by qualitative interviews and later workshops to identify actions to initiate in order to continue the development of Being Faurecia, as a cultural shift of this magnitude necessarily takes time.

5.2.2. TRAINING POLICY

5.2.2.1. Principles
Within the Group, training is considered a strategic investment.
It is a key tool in the implementation of genuine continuous improvement, backed by the Faurecia Excellence System (FES). The training plans focus on ethics, integrity and improving results. In this context, training actions are favored, as are internal training programs.
As training is a tool for development, specific actions are implemented to encourage individual development and to increase team effectiveness.
Training also facilitates the development of the organizational structure and operational principles prevailing within the Group. In this context, the changes induced by the Being Faurecia strategy are gradually incorporated into the Group's training programs.
Lastly, training is a management tool. It is the responsibility of supervisors (identification of needs, communication with interested parties) and is implemented with the support of the Group's Human Resources network.

5.2.2.2. Priorities
The priorities identified in training plans are used to achieve the goals set for different business units. They are structured around the following themes:
c improving plant performance (safety, quality, costs and deadlines) and ensuring optimal production start-up;
c enhancing the attractiveness of customer offerings;
c increasing technological expertise in products and processes;
c increasing the professional qualifications of staff, fostering their career development and enhancing their employability;
c developing managerial skills in line with Faurecia's Leadership Competency Model;
c anticipating and managing identified skills requirements over the medium term;
c strengthening a shared culture focusing on value creation and entrepreneurial spirit, while respecting the fundamentals of Faurecia's internal codes (ethics and management), in particular compliance with competition law;
c ensuring the use of common working methods to increase efficiency;
c developing people's ability to work in an international context.

5.2.2.3. 2016 key figures
During 2016, the training provided throughout Faurecia represented approximately 1.6 million hours.
5.2.2.4. Focus on Faurecia University
2016 was an important development year for Faurecia University. In 2015, three campuses were established worldwide for the purpose of organizing training. The regional universities (North America and Asia) successfully deployed Corporate training and created specific programs dealing with regional issues. In addition to the team in Nanterre, these universities have dedicated teams and premises in Auburn Hills (Michigan) and Shanghai (China).
1. Role and responsibilities of Faurecia University
Faurecia University aims to assist with management development and offer a firm foundation for the cultural transformation the Company has embarked upon.
To this effect, Faurecia University assists managers throughout their careers by:
c ensuring their integration within the Group;
c helping them to acquire functional skills necessary for their professional growth;
c offering training to help them acquire and improve their managerial skills and to develop their leadership skills;
c preparing them for key positions (plant manager, program manager, R&D manager);
c preparing them in advance for taking on leadership responsibilities.
2. Mode of governance
Faurecia University has an Advisory Board comprising the members of the Group's Executive Committee. The Advisory Board met twice in 2016. In addition to these plenary meetings, the members of the Advisory Board have been closely involved in the development of the new programs, and more specifically the Leadership Development program which took off in 2016.
3. Substantially enhanced training offer
The Leadership Development offer was launched in 2016. It concerned over 700 managers in 2016. It covers a full range of leadership skills broken down by themes and levels of responsibility.
The DRIVE program, divided into two levels for managers and experienced managers, was developed around a modular architecture combining fundamental leadership modules and optional advanced modules. Its objective is the acquisition of leadership skills (team management methods, individual skills, etc.). This personalized and customizable program was

designed in collaboration with Impact International, a British firm known for its pedagogical innovations for enhancing leadership skills. It responds to the needs expressed in the individual development plans and is divided into nine multimodal training programs. These multi-modal programs, combining e-learning, coursework, online classes and classroom training, were deployed across the Group in 2016, in Shanghai, Auburn Hills and Nanterre.
The IGNITE program for managers was developed in partnership with London Business School, based on the same architecture as DRIVE, and comprises a basic module focusing on "transformation" and advanced modules on innovation, team management and management of key personnel.
In 2016, Faurecia University also launched the "C3 Excellence" development offer ("Customer, Competitive, Commercial") intended for the sales function. During this training program, the participants are supposed to identify a strategic operational development project for the Company, to work in groups to develop the project, and subsequently to present a Business Plan to members of Senior Management.
In 2016, Faurecia University developed the digital dimension of its training offers, by creating the Learning Lab, an internal training platform open to all managers and professionals of the Group. The Learning Lab offers a varied and innovative learning experience. It tests users by means of a series of questionnaires and provides knowledge in the form of short, animated, dynamic and original videos. The Learning Lab can be used on various devices (PC, tablet and smartphone) and offers social (chat, forum) and entertainment (scores, leaderboard, learning battles) functions. The online courses of the Learning Lab explore the Faurecia fundamentals (FES, Program Management System, operations basics, gender diversity, ethics and compliance, etc.), leadership and management, as well as the new trends in the digital field. Over 13,000 managers and professionals took courses on the Learning Lab in 2016.
The Faur'us platform further adds to the collaborative and social dimension of this learning by offering the possibility of sharing collaborative and open work methods, thus providing access to rich and diverse knowledge and increasing the collective intelligence. Over 700 communities, involving over 10,000 employees daily, were active in 2016.
Lastly, in 2016 Faurecia University received awards for its training programs or training approaches:
c Silver Award for Best Digital Integration;
c Brandon Hall Silver Award for Drive Program;
c Carrefour Award for Best HR/Digital Team.
The Faurecia Automotive Seating, Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Clean Mobility Business Groups rolled out training courses in technical academies dedicated to their specific products and processes.

5.2.3. EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT

The Group's success is closely bound up with its capacity to actively involve all its employees in their work on a day-to-day basis and to create effective and autonomous teams. Employee accountability is one of Faurecia's key performance levers and is also one of the mainstays of the Faurecia Excellence System.
Group employees follow development programs so as to be able to meet their responsibilities. Staff benefit from development opportunities enabling them to increase their level of responsibility, the aim being to constantly improve team skills.
Employees are also encouraged to make an active contribution to continuous improvement. Managers are trained in team leadership so as to be able to effectively support operational efficiency and individual employee development.
Plant Management Committees are key participants in industrial progress. On this basis, they help to make employee empowerment an operational reality and to assist in the deployment of FES tools in plants.
In 2016, a major revision of the training modules was undertaken to enhance the impact of the deployment of employee empowerment:
c the fundamentals of employee empowerment: this module is intended for Plant Management Committees. It aims to develop their role in the day-to-day management of teams by using the FES. The link between the seven basic principles

of employee empowerment and their impact on the business has been improved thanks to the use of digital tools. About 900 people benefited from this module in 2016;
c site Human Resources officers: this module aims to develop current and future Human Resources officers. Following the update of the module, it now focuses on strengthening the links between day-to-day responsibilities and employee empowerment. About 90 HR professionals benefited from it in 2016;
c a new "Mass Online Open Course" (MOOC) platform was launched in 2016. Within this framework, ten modules dedicated to employee empowerment were made available online. At the end of 2016, 1,000 employees had completed them.
In order to maintain a strong improvement momentum within the Company, the employees are encouraged to express their ideas for improvement based on their daily experience. The number of ideas for improvement acted upon remained stable at 13.5 per employee in 2016.
Furthermore, 35% of supervisors at Faurecia have a level of education equivalent to a Bachelor's degree or higher. This is in line with the Group's objective of recruiting young graduates to have sufficient internal talent reserves to secure the long-term pools of autonomous production unit and plant managers.

5.2.4. DEVELOPING THE POTENTIAL OF ENGINEERS AND MANAGERS

Faurecia integrates and develops the potential of its engineers and managers so as to improve their performance and skills and offer them attractive career paths. The effective development of engineers' and managers' potential is at the core of the Being Faurecia program. The Group seeks to continuously improve the performance of its managers and ensure their professional development so that they can realize their potential.
At the same time, the Group constantly adapts its allocation of Human Resources to meet short-term business demands and prepares for the medium-term to ensure that the Group always has best-in-class in terms of managers and technical experts, driven by the pursuit of excellent customer service.
Recruiting and retaining talent
Over the last few years, Faurecia has grown very significantly with almost 100,000 employees, including over 17,000 engineers and managers at the end of 2016.
Over the last four years, the volume of external hires has stabilized, at slightly over 2,000 engineers and managers.

In 2016, hires were mainly carried out in Asia (734), Europe (725), and North America (652); the countries that recruited the most in these three regions were China (372), the United States (345), Mexico (301) and India (257). In parallel, the number of hires remained stable in France (301) and declined in Germany (142 compared to 191 in 2015).
44% of new employees were assigned to production, 26% to sales, R&D and program functions, and 30% to support functions.
In 2016, Faurecia continued to focus on the quality of recruitment to ensure that the Group recruits and retains the employees of tomorrow. To achieve this, the HR teams and managers received extensive training in recruitment techniques in order to select the best candidates.
To ensure the success of newly recruited employees, Faurecia offers all new hires a personal induction program enabling them to find out more about the Company, its values, strategy and organization, and to become acquainted with its culture and operating systems.

Skills development

In 2016, the Group strengthened the deployment of its online tool to help new employees and their line managers throughout the integration period.
Developing and promoting international exposure is essential for a Group that employs 64.5% of its engineers and managers outside Western Europe and carries out 78% of its recruitments outside this region. Within this framework, Faurecia can offer its people many international assignments as well as the opportunity to take part in international projects.
Lastly, a stable employee base is essential for safeguarding our investment in human capital. In 2016, the resignation rate for engineers and managers was 8.4%, slightly up compared to 2015. This rate improved in North America (11.8% vs 13% in 2015), but increased slightly in Europe (5.6% vs 5.0% in 2015). In China, it remained at 8.5%, well below the market average. The resignation rate for senior management positions was 4.2% in 2016.
The employees of tomorrow
In 2016, the Group continued to implement two Faurecia Talent Initiatives in order to attract and retain the employees of tomorrow, two key factors in sustaining the Group's growth.
The aim of the first project was to improve gender diversity at the time of recruitment and for employee development in general.
An action plan was defined by working groups, covering both Group-wide Human Resources issues and the introduction of dedicated social networks, while respecting local cultural particularities. It covers six areas:
c improvement of working conditions, in particular through the deployment of telework and the implementation of conciergetype services, in order to promote a better balance between personal and professional life;
c development of careers for women: the People Review was adapted to integrate a specific chapter on female talent. At the same time, a process was launched to accompany the spouses of expatriate employees through external and individualized support to prepare the best departure, to facilitate cultural and professional adaptation, and to help find local employment;
c the talent acquisition strategy was reviewed: the country recruitment officers reviewed the list of target schools, favoring those with a balanced distribution between men and women. The list of Ambassadors was completed to ensure that women are duly represented. The recruitment agencies were also made aware of the Group's ambition to welcome more female talent. Lastly, the internal training on recruitment now covers the issue of diversity awareness;
c training is a lever for accelerating this cultural change: Faurecia University ensures that diversity management is an integral part of the training provided to managers and also spearheads the implementation of specific programs for

women to enable them to strengthen their influence, their impact and their visibility;
c studies have been launched in key countries to ensure pay equity. The first statistical results showed no major differences but a second more local and more individual study has been launched to correct any differences;
c the women@faurecia network was created to support initiatives in favor of gender diversity. With the support of local representatives, the members of the network organize internal events and also participate in associations and activities.
Implemented in 2016, these actions are starting to bear fruit. The proportion of the number of women increased slightly and now represents 23% of managers and one notes a positive trend as regards front-line positions at the sites (19.7% in 2016 vs 18.5% in 2015), front-line positions in the Divisions (9.2% in 2016 vs 6.5% in 2015) and senior management positions (9.7% of top management in 2016 vs 7% in 2015).
The goal of the second project is to recruit more young graduates. Although 37.4% of new recruits to entry-level management positions were young graduates, which is in line with the sector average, this figure is not high enough to inject the required level of talent into the Group to guarantee its growth. Working groups were set up and tasked with identifying the action the Group could take globally and locally to help it find a way to quickly increase the recruitment rate of young graduates.
To help it reach its target to recruit more young graduates, including female graduates, the Group relies heavily on the VIE international corporate volunteer program. In 2016, the number of international corporate volunteer (Volontariat International en Entreprise, VIE) contracts continued to grow, with 280 signed, compared with 259 in 2015. It is noteworthy that almost 55% of the young engineers and managers who completed their VIE assignments in 2016 were recruited by Faurecia, mainly in France (46%), Germany (31%), and the rest of Europe (10%). Furthermore, seven VIEs were hired in Asia and six in North America.
Consolidating the Group's performance culture and having exemplary leaders
A fair, objective performance assessment is a cornerstone of employee development and a key Being Faurecia concept. In 2016, the Group launched the second campaign of its new performance appraisal system, STAR (Setting Targets, Achieving Results), a global approach combining three components:
c a "management by objective" component that aligns individual performance with business objectives;
c the evaluation of behavior enables the measurement of commitment to the Group's values. They consist of three managerial values (entrepreneurship, autonomy and

Skills development

accountability) and three individual values (respect, exemplarity and energy). A Code of Management was developed to illustrate the behavior expected from managers in the main situations they might face. This Code is intended to be a practical guide for managers to develop exemplary behavior;
c lastly, the managerial skills assessment makes it possible to identify each individual's strengths as well as areas where there is room for improvement so as to construct practical and effective individual development plans. The Code, which describes the managerial skills that must be mastered at each level of the organization, is at the center of performance management and the identification of the potential and development of future leaders.
During the 2016 STAR campaign, particular attention was paid to improving the quality of the interviews in order to enhance the managerial impact of the effort. Three priorities have been defined in this context: improve the quality of the feedback, strengthen the internal equity in terms of performance appraisal, and improve the robustness and monitoring of the development actions.
Developing skills and optimizing career management
The Group's internal promotion policy revolves around offering career opportunities to employees who succeed and demonstrate their potential.
Despite a high recruitment rate, the rate of vacancies filled internally amounted to 58.5% overall in 2016, up slightly on the 2015 figure (54%). The percentage is closer to 86% for Senior Management positions. The results for managerial posts were achieved through the implementation of robust succession planning and individual development plans, based on individual reviews made at least once a year at all levels of the Company (sites, divisions, Business Groups, Group) and on a rigorous use of Faurecia's managerial skills model.
In 2016, 18% of engineers and managers benefited from internal mobility.
In line with the Group's expertise management policy, Faurecia particularly rewards performance in technical and technological areas. The Group offers its experts a specific career program,

which has the added advantage of allowing it to enhance business-specific skills within each product line. In 2016, 33 experts and 2 senior experts were appointed in the product and process engineering businesses. At the end of 2016, Faurecia employed 344 experts.
Fostering talent, an ambitious objective
To prepare the managers of tomorrow, talent identification should start as early as possible. The applicants are offered diverse career paths to realize their potential. These paths include inter-functions/inter-divisions mobility, project work or short-term assignments. The plan aims to help employees step out of their comfort zone and provide them with general management skills.
External assessments are also proposed for current and future leaders, so that each individual may better understand their development potential and make the best career choice. Personal development plans are defined as part of this process. In total, 41 assessments were carried out in 2016.
Alongside these internal activities, a reinforcement plan was rolled out in France, Germany, the United States and China to recruit high-potential applicants for whom an accelerated career path is defined and implemented. At the end of 2016, 14 people were participating in this program.
The Group also places great importance on the international dimension of its Senior Management team, while taking steps to attract, develop and retain local talent across the globe. Today, in keeping with this strategy, 57% of the Group's senior managers are non-French nationals, and 43% of engineers and managers identified as having Senior Management potential are from countries outside Western Europe.
The Executive Committee strengthened its involvement in managing talent. It now assesses the Group's high-potential staff twice a year, with a particular focus on potential executives. In addition to the People Reviews normally organized at the Business Group, Division and functional levels, Key Reservoir Reviews were carried out in North America, Asia and South America in order to develop internal mobility and to optimize local talent management. In 2016, a new process called "Cross BG Point HR" was also set up at Group level in order to develop the mobility of Senior Managers between Business Groups.

5.3.1. AN ENVIRONMENT OF CONTRASTING BUSINESS ACTIVITY BY REGION

In 2016, Faurecia's overall level of business continued to increase due to sustained growth in Europe and Asia and major orders received in South America.
This trend was reflected by continued growth in the workforce which rose from 78,605 at the end of 2015 to 79,818 at the end of 2016 (up 1.5%).
Industrial redeployment initiatives affected 13 sites in 2016, impacting 1,219 jobs in 5 countries, mostly in Europe, North America and South America.
In this context, Europe has seen the number of employees rise slightly, by 2.3%, despite the restructuring plans implemented in western European countries.

In North America, the number of registered employees increased by 1.6%, due to the growth of Faurecia in Mexico. The downturn in business in this region resulted in a reduction in the number of temporary employees.
In South America, the number of registered employees decreased by 1.0% due to an improvement in industrial efficiency.
Lastly, Faurecia, despite the 1.2% decrease in its number of registered employees, continued to grow in Asia, thereby consolidating the growth potential in this market and the good business momentum enjoyed with local and foreign automakers in this region.

5.3.2. GREATER SOCIAL DIALOG AND CONSULTATION WITH EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES

Pursuant to the component on the development of economic and social dialog of the Code of Ethics in force since 2007, complemented in 2014 by the Being Faurecia program, the Group's various entities continued an active policy of dialog and negotiation with employee representatives.
In 2016, this policy resulted in the conclusion of 345 site or company agreements, in 24 countries, including in particular 152 in France, 77 in Germany, 29 in Brazil, 12 in Mexico, 10 in Argentina, 8 in Spain and 6 in the United States, Italy and Uruguay.
30% of these agreements related to wages and benefits, 22% to working conditions and working hours, and 19% to statutory profit-sharing and incentive plans.
More specifically, in terms of targeting increased competitiveness and/or performance, negotiations were successfully concluded in 2016 at a number of sites where this was a key issue to keeping the business going or to winning new programs, thereby

avoiding any new plans for industrial redeployment. As a result, two new competition agreements covering a Spanish site and a French site were finalized within the Group's various businesses. With these new agreements and those entered into in previous fiscal years, this brings to almost 44 the total number of sites covered by competition agreements since 2012.
In addition, in all the countries in which it operates, the Group is keen to implement existing plans so as to reduce the impact on jobs arising from a slowdown in business. For instance, these plans represented the equivalent of 951,747 hours in 2016, an increase on the previous fiscal year. At the same time, in the event of any industrial redeployments, the Group prefers to make use of internal mobility, both on a geographical and cross-divisional level, as well as voluntary redundancy plans. In the event that a site closure is required, the Group endeavors, where this is possible, to put in place re-industrialization projects by providing financial and/or operational assistance to industrial players that are likely to propose redeployment solutions to its

employees. In cases where compulsory redundancies cannot be avoided, providing support for those employees seeking redeployment is a priority.
Created in 2003, the European Works Council is a key body in the Group's economic and social dialog, the preferred forum for exchanges with employee representatives on the Group's strategy, results and outlook.
Following negotiations started in 2015 with the members of the Bureau to extend the European Works Council, an agreement was unanimously signed on January 11, 2016. This agreement entered into force on April 1, 2016 for a period of four years.
Within this framework, the 25 members were apportioned on a prorata basis of the number of employees in the 15 European countries where Faurecia is present. The 25 representatives were then designated or elected in accordance with the provisions in force in their countries. The committee welcomed 9 new representatives alongside the 16 whose terms of office were renewed.

The European Works Council met in plenary session twice; the first time on January 7, 2016 in an extraordinary session in the context of Faurecia's project to sell its Exteriors business to Plastic Omnium, and the second time on May 10 and 11, 2016, in an ordinary session. The Council Board, comprising representatives of the six biggest countries in terms of workforce (i.e. France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic and Poland), met three times during the year.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the last Bureau meeting of the year was held at a site on December 1, 2016. On this occasion, the members of the Council visited the research and development center of Faurecia Interiors as well as the industrial facilities of the Almussafes plant in Spain.
To help the representatives of the European Works Council to carry out their duties in the best possible conditions, it has been agreed to launch a training program that is mainly structured around modules intended to enable the representatives to better grasp the stakes and constraints of the automotive sector. This training should be carried out before the plenary session in 2017.

5.3.3. RESPECT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

Faurecia adhered to the UN Global Compact in 2004. By doing so, the Group committed to abiding by and promoting, in its business practices, a set of values and principles drawn from international texts and conventions relating to human rights, labor standards and the environment. Changes within the Group, the new requirements of customers and new guidelines bearing on corporate social responsibility and sustainable development prompted Faurecia in 2007 to prepare a new version of its Code of Ethics mirroring the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Core Conventions. This Code of Ethics was updated in 2014 as part of the roll out of the Being Faurecia program, intended to strengthen the Group's culture and contribute to the creation of long-term value. The Code of Management, which was established at that time to guide the day-to-day management of teams, customers and also suppliers, translated many of the principles set out in the Code of Ethics into operations. In 2016, Faurecia developed an e-learning tool on the theme of Compliance that enables its managers and professionals to test their knowledge of the Group's current Code of Ethics and Code of Management. After North America and China, deployment continues in Europe.

5.3.3.1. Prohibition of child labor
Faurecia complies with national laws and regulations relating to child labor. It will not employ children under the age of 16, under any circumstances, and complies with the provisions of the ILO regarding the health, safety and morality of young people aged between 15 and 18. The Group ensures that its suppliers and partners adhere to the same principles.
5.3.3.2. Elimination of all forms of forced labor
Faurecia is committed to the free choice of employment and the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor. It ensures that its suppliers and/or partners adhere to the same principles.

Strengthening economic and social dialog

5.3.3.3. Freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining
Faurecia recognizes the existence of trade unions worldwide and the right of workers to form the union organization of their choice and/or to organize workers' representation in accordance with the laws and regulations in force. It undertakes to protect union members and leaders and not to make any discrimination based on the offices held.
The Group is also committed to promoting a policy of dialog and negotiation. Given its decentralized legal and managerial structure, this policy is implemented through collective bargaining agreements signed with the sites, on the one hand, and companies, on the other.

5.3.3.4. Elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation
The Group is committed not to discriminate against anyone, notably on the basis of age, sex, skin color, nationality, religion, health status or disability, sexual orientation, political, philosophical or union-related opinion in its recruitment and career development initiatives. Every employee has the right to work in a healthy environment, free from any form of hostility or harassment qualified as unlawful under the regulations and practices in force in the countries where the Faurecia group operates.
In particular, Faurecia forbids any unlawful conduct construed as sexual or moral harassment, including in the absence of any hierarchical or subordination relationship.

5.3.4. CHANGES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

The total amount of compensation paid, including social contributions, increased by 0.76% across the Group as a whole: 3,059.1 million in 2016, compared with 3,036.0 million in 2015. Meanwhile, the number of employees at the end of the year increased by 1.5% (+3.2% for engineers and managers).
The Group adheres to current minimum wage legislation in each country. Wage negotiations are held in the majority of countries. In 2016, 104 agreements were concluded on wage/

bonus/compensation packages and 67 on profit-sharing/nondiscretionary profit-sharing.
A system of variable compensation, based essentially on operating unit performance, applies in a uniform manner in all countries in which Faurecia operates. At the end of 2016, following the disposal of the Exteriors business, approximately 3,900 out of a total of 16,683 managers and professionals benefited from the system.

Company savings, incentive and profit-sharing bonuses in the development of the Group

5.4. Company savings, incentive and profit-sharing bonuses in the development of the Group

5.4.1. EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS IN FRANCE

In France, the Group has over the past few years implemented several mechanisms to allow employees to accumulate savings.
Since 2004, employees have had access to a Group employee savings plan (PEG) open to amounts distributed under profitsharing and incentive plans, as well as voluntary contributions.
Thirteen funds are available, including Faurecia Actionnariat, a mutual fund investing exclusively in Faurecia stock. At end2016, total funds managed in the employee savings plan (PEG) stood at 48.9 million, of which 26% were invested in Faurecia Actionnariat (2,795 employees).

Employees also have access to the Group retirement savings plan (PERCO), set up in late 2012. Like the employee savings plan, payments into the Group pension savings plan can be made from discretionary and non-discretionary profit-sharing plans as well as voluntary employee contributions. At end-2016, total funds managed in the retirement savings plan (PERCO) stood at 3.4 million.
A defined-contribution pension scheme was also introduced in 2006 for Group executives and was opened up to voluntary contributions from employees in 2013. The various retirement savings plans have more than 88.7 million under management.

5.4.2. INCENTIVE PLANS IN FRANCE

The incentive agreements entered into by the Group's various French companies mostly establish how voluntary incentive payouts are calculated based on two sets of indicators:
c financial indicators at Company level. This part accounts for about 40% of the overall payout and is calculated annually;
c operational performance indicators calculated at site level and selected from among Faurecia Excellence System indicators. This part accounts for about 60% of the overall payout and is calculated half-yearly.

Under these agreements, the payout is capped at 5%-6% of payroll ­ although in exceptional cases it may be raised to 6.7 to 8% if objectives are exceeded ­ and is allocated partly in proportion to salary and partly applied on a uniform basis depending on hours worked.
In 2016, 17.6 million was paid out to employees under the incentive plan (16.7 million in 2015), of which 4.3 million were invested in Group employee savings plans in France (PEG or PERCO).

5.4.3. PROFIT-SHARING IN FRANCE

The mandatory profit-sharing agreements of the various Group companies stipulate, for the most part, that employee profitsharing calculated in accordance with the legal formula must be allocated among employees prorated on the basis of their compensation for the year in question, subject to compliance with regulatory limits.
The amounts allocated to the profit-sharing reserve may be held in a no-access account or invested in the corporate mutual funds

set up in connection with the Group employee savings plan (PEG) or retirement savings plan (PERCO).
In 2016, 8.5 million was paid out to employees under the profitsharing plan (5.7 million in 2015), of which 2.7 million were invested in Group employee savings plans in France (PEG or PERCO).

Administrative efficiency of Human Resources

5.4.4. STOCK OPTION PLANS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS

Faurecia has set up performance share plans for its Senior Management, with a view to promoting motivation and fostering loyalty. It follows a procedure established by the Board of Directors at its meeting of December 17, 2009. The Combined General Meeting of May 27, 2016 authorized the Board of Directors to grant a maximum of 2,000,000 performance shares. Based on this authorization, on July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors allocated a maximum of 989,945 performance shares to 326 beneficiaries, including 36 high-potential managers. The latter include an internal requirement relating to the Group's

net income (after tax) in 2018 and an external requirement comparing net earnings per Faurecia share between 2015 and 2018 with reference to a group of 12 comparable international automotive suppliers. It should be noted that the last six plans were allocated in the same period of the year.
As of December 31, 2016, stock options allocated but not yet exercised totaled 244,200, with a further 2,964,989 performance shares liable to be granted by July 2020, subject to the associated performance requirements.

5.5. Administrative efficiency of Human Resources

The rationalization of the Human Resources IT system begun in 2007 reached another milestone in 2016. GlobalView, the SAP-based payroll and employee management platform, was rolled out in Argentina (960 people), South Africa (1,400 people) and Thailand (660 people) during the first half of the year. At the end of 2016, almost 63,000 employees (in 16 countries) were being paid by GlobalView, 79% of the Group's registered employees. New projects were launched to deploy GlobalView in Poland, Romania and India in 2017. By the end of 2017, 93% of the Group's registered employees will receive their wages through this platform.
The payroll processes were also optimized with a focus on two areas: full outsourcing in the new countries covered by GlobalView and the continued deployment of shared service centers. At the end of the planned deployment, 75% of employees will be paid through a Faurecia shared service center and 25% through an external platform directly managed by the GlobalView provider. This process was backed by the deployment of a Group Manage Payroll Procedure (MPP) in 2015, which was deployed in all Group countries in 2016, in order to handle the internal control and audit of the pay processes by country.
At the same time as rolling out the payroll system, automatic interfaces continued to be set up with the Group's Human Resources reporting, engineers and managers database and

accounting system to improve administrative efficacy and make data more reliable. 80% of the GlobalView perimeter is now interfaced with these different systems.
The optimization of administrative procedures also took another step forward as a result of the implementation of a talent management tool and a tool for managerial assessment of individual performance. In 2015, the corresponding individual development plan was put in place to complete the module, the use of which became widespread in 2016. Human Resources is thus equipped with a modern tool for managing its employees' individual development online. Transparency with regard to employees and their managers is a key factor when it comes to improving managerial processes and information system quality.
Lastly, to streamline its Human Resources Information System (HRIS), and in the continuation of its digital transformation, the Group confirmed the deployment of a project team dedicated to setting up a complete Human Resources suite called "SAP Success Factor", integrated with the payroll platform. This project will result in the establishment of a new global Human Resources management platform, called "PASS", covering all the functional needs of the Human Resources function within the Group by 2018. Every Human Resources employee, manager and partner will thereby have access to a single digital HR management tool across the Group.

Other employee-related data

Total number of employees
The Group's total workforce grew by 3,184 people in 2016, up +3.3%. The proportion of staff employed on open-ended contracts increased from 75.5% to 74.5%. Over the period, the proportion of staff on fixed-term contracts decreased from 6.9% to 6.4%, and the proportion of temporary staff rose from 17.6% to 19%. In 2016, the number of employees grew mainly in Europe (+1,742 people), in Asia (+732 people) and in the "Other" region (+1,090 people, mainly in Morocco).
Registered employees
The Group's registered employees increased by 1,213 people in 2016 (+1.5%). This increase was particularly significant in Europe (+2.3% or +942 people), North America (+1.6% or +294 people) and in the "Other" region (+2.8% or +137 people) due to business growth in these regions.

The number of registered employees decreased by 1% (-42 people) in South America and by 1.2% in Asia (-118 people).
Temporary employees
The number of temporary staff rose by 1,971 people (+11.7%) in 2016. As of the end of December 2016, the percentage of temporary staff was 19%, 1.4 points higher than in 2015. In Europe, the rate rose from 16.3% to 17.3%. It reached 17.1% at the end of 2016 in Western Europe, compared to 17.6% in Central Europe. Growth in the use of temporary labor was most marked in France, Italy and Poland. In North America, this rate decreased from 10.1% to 6.3% due to the decrease in temporary employees (-522 in the United States and -278 in Mexico over the period). Finally, this percentage remained high in Asia (40.3%), the percentage of temporary labor being structurally high in China.

This quality performance was mainly due to the rigorous application of the methods of the Faurecia breakthrough quality plan, as well as to the specific actions linked to the 2016 incidents reduction challenge. This breakthrough plan, launched in 2006, has now reached maturity. Faurecia's major customers now acknowledge that the Group offers one of the highest levels of quality worldwide. Detailed monitoring of specific performance for each customer has been introduced in order to ensure that corrective measures are taken immediately to address any quality issues at a given plant. Every major problem is addressed using a systematic cross-functional approach at the sites in question in order to prevent any recurrence.

Faurecia has used its experience of resolving quality problems to continuously improve its Quick Response Continuous Improvement (QRCI) methodology. QRCI is a management approach whereby all defects must be dealt with through corrective action within 24 hours at the latest, working from an in-depth analysis to pinpoint the root causes of the problems and determine appropriate technical solutions that can be used across all Group businesses. QRCI is applied Company-wide, from production line operators to workshop and site managers, as well as in project development teams and development centers.

Faurecia Excellence System (FES)

6.2. Faurecia Excellence System (FES)

The Faurecia Excellence System (FES) is the framework within which all of the Group's production and operations are organized. The FES is designed to ensure continuous performance improvements for the Group in terms of quality, cost, delivery and safety.
The FES complies with the requirements of quality, environmental and safety standards applicable to the automotive industry (ISO/ TS 16949 and IATF 16949 ­ for July 2017 ­, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001). It also leverages more than 14 years of experience by Faurecia and has continually been enhanced to reflect best practices, both within and outside the Group, from a lean manufacturing perspective.
The FES ensures appropriate operating performance by Faurecia's production sites, wherever they are located and irrespective of local specificities affecting their business activities, by instilling a shared language and shared working methods.
This approach by Faurecia is fundamental because the globalization of the automobile market requires automotive equipment suppliers to guarantee the same level of quality and service everywhere in the world.
In 2014, the new Being Faurecia culture was successfully rolled out to all sites, placing emphasis on their autonomy and accountability with respect to the attainment of targets while maintaining an appropriate level of control. An increasingly pragmatic approach, eschewing dogmatism, is being adopted for FES implementation, thus allowing plants to be managed in a way that reinforces their own responsibility for controls.
Accordingly, the roles of plant managers and operations managers have been clarified to ensure that sales, margin and inventory budget targets are supported by well-established fundamentals: employee safety, quality, timely deliveries, and a shared commitment by staff to high performance. Also in 2014, a new revised standard management chart, including eighteen key performance indicators, was introduced.
In addition to its annual budget, each site now draws up a Plant Improvement Plan (PIP) identifying no more than seven priority areas in need of improvement to put the plant on the path to

achieve the objectives set out in its division's three-year strategic plan. Plant managers perform daily verifications on the ground to ensure that progress toward meeting these goals is on track, that standards are being applied, and that performance shortfalls are remedied quickly by all actors at the appropriate level, in line with the strengthened emphasis on greater responsibility by plants for their own controls.
One practical application of the change in culture introduced by the Being Faurecia initiative is the decision to allocate personnel responsible for the annual program of site audits to carry out coaching activities at some thirty sites where neither the implementation of FES nor operating performance is reaching the desired level. In this way, Faurecia's internal auditors become consultants helping sites to understand the FES and how it is to be used to support performance improvements. This FES training/coaching program ends when the site reaches the level "C ­ Acceptable" and when key performance indicators have reached acceptable levels.
Given this approach, plants having already reached the levels "B ­ Good" or "A ­ Excellent" were not audited again in 2015, but carried out their own self-assessments with assistance, where required, from their division on the basis of the principle of site responsibility for controls mentioned above. In 2017, as in 2016, Faurecia intends to conduct a new Group audit of the Level A and Level B sites with a shortened questionnaire. If the results are not satisfactory, a full audit will be run.
The FES training/coaching program met with considerable success and will be maintained in 2017 to allow the most recently added sites to reach the required level.
At the same time, the Group is continuing the roll-out of a worldwide program of FES workshops in the best-performing plants to train the network of operations managers in FES methods as applied on the ground.
In order to limit the risks when starting new programs, the Group has set up a simplified FES assessment to be carried out for critical programs (high degree of complexity, new sites, new production process) before reaching "gate 3" (i.e. having three to six months left before series production begins).

7 Research and development Market expectations

Innovation and product development represent a strategic challenge for Faurecia. These activities are structured around two main divisions:
c the research and innovation unit, which covers upstream activities prior to program acquisitions. This unit is critical to enabling the Group to provide an appealing and competitive offering to its customers, which it achieves by designing new products and technologies, as well as researching and developing generic products and processes;
c the program engineering unit, which covers vehicle applications. This downstream unit is responsible for ensuring that programs are completed within the required time-frames, cost and quality levels.
As a result, gross R&D expenditures totaled 1,021.5 million in 2016 (5.5% of net sales). The share of innovation grew over the same period. It amounted to 120 million.
More than 6,000 engineers and technicians based in 30 centers represent the Group's global R&D community. Five hundred and one patents were filed in 2016.
To lend a hand to technological development and innovation, Faurecia maintains its open policy towards academia, research laboratories and start-ups. Faurecia makes use of five chairs in manufacturing involving universities in France and Germany and a partnership with Fraunhofer ICT in mechanical electronics, composites, production processes for metal parts, and plastic materials chemistry including biomass and assembly lines. In France, Faurecia is also actively engaged in the work of the technological research institutes known as IRTs, all certified by the French government as part of its "Investment for the Future"

program, such as the IRT Jules Verne in Nantes, where Faurecia represents the French automotive industry, and the IRT M2P in Metz. A similar approach is underway in the United States, with a first partnership with the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII) regarding subjects linked to the industry of the future, and in China.
In 2016, Faurecia developed a start-up research and assessment activity on a world level to detect technological innovations and make investments whenever necessary through a company specifically created for this purpose. This activity goes beyond merely looking for start-ups: it creates an ecosystem for the various subjects of interest in each of the search areas.
Faurecia has developed innovation partnerships with most major global automakers. These partnerships indicate the Company's intention to build long-term close relationships with automakers by offering them the latest innovations, providing potential exclusive arrangements, and better meeting their demands. From the start, these innovations have been associated with target vehicle programs.
Faurecia has also implemented an ambitious deployment and monitoring plan in respect of internal expertise. In 2016, Faurecia had 344 experts who are skilled in the Group's 66 different areas of expertise. Skills sharing, wherever relevant, ensures optimal use of such expertise.
Executive Management's involvement in monitoring innovation plans via Technology Leadership Seminars, Technology Sessions, Executive Technology Reviews, and participation in the Experts' Forum, shows that the Company is committed to technology and innovation, believing these to be key drivers of its success.

7.1. Market expectations

Market trends
To understand the significant market trends, Faurecia consults specialized bodies and also participates in think tanks to translate these trends into principles that can be used directly for its products. The main trends that impact automobiles are the urbanization of populations, the reduction in the consumption and the diversification of energy resources, changes in mobility, connectivity, consumer protection and health and the increased role of women in society. Faurecia takes these "mega" trends into account; most of the time they are translated into the automobile industry through the reduction in consumption and emissions, including electrification, connectivity and autonomous vehicles.

Reduction of fuel consumption
This target is linked to the reduction of greenhouse gases. In 2013, the European Commission adopted average CO2 targets of 95 g/ km (equivalent to approximately 4 l/100 km) for the automotive industry in Europe, effective from the end of 2020, with a planned level of 130 g between 2015 and 2020. This 95 g target is leading automakers to work to improve parameters such as vehicle weight, efficiency of powertrains (engines and transmissions), electrification, rolling resistance and aerodynamics. Faurecia makes a major contribution in the fields of vehicle weight reduction and optimizing powertrain operation, mainly through energy recovery. Currently the European Commission is discussing a level of between 68 g and 78 g per kilometer by 2025/2030 and significant technological developments would be required to achieve this performance level.

Market expectations

Starting September 2017, a new test protocol called the WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures) will gradually replace the existing NEDC (New European Driving Cycle). The new protocol is more representative of actual driving conditions but will impact the test results by between 5% and 15%. Alongside this, the anticipated reduction from the production of diesel vehicles will impact the average emission figures because diesel emits between 10% and 15% less CO2.
Reducing mass will therefore become even more important in terms of a vehicle's overall performance.
Reduction of emissions
Emissions of all combustion-related pollutants are subject to standards that, while specific to each market, are converging towards a drastic reduction. And while reducing fuel consumption has the direct effect of reducing emissions, the use of smaller turbocharged engines results in increased levels of pressure and higher temperatures in combustion chambers, which is damaging in terms of emissions of gas, pollutants and particulates.
Although the European Regulations on pollution emission levels, primarily nitrogen oxides emissions, have been reduced considerably to reach 80 mg in 2015, recent comparisons between Real Driving Emissions tests on the road and the regulatory bench tests have thrown up some significant differences. A compliance factor is now being applied. It enables comparison between regulatory bench tests and real driving emissions tests on the road. The tolerated differences will be 2.1x as of September 2017, and 1.5x as of 2020. A factor of 1.5x on the number of particles has been voted by the European Commission and will also be applied as of September 2017.
The regulations are already more stringent in the North American market than in Europe and apply to both gasolineand Diesel-powered private cars without distinction. As regards the Chinese regulations, they will remain based on the European ones until 2023.
Increasingly widespread in gasoline engines, direct fuel injection allows the engine to work leanly and to limit consumption, but generates particulates that may require treatment in the exhaust system. Since 2014, Faurecia has supplied the world's first particulate filters for gasoline engines as standard equipment.
For Diesel engines, regulatory change combined with high temperatures generating nitrogen oxides will result in the widespread adoption of post-treatment in the exhaust system for such emissions by 2017 in most markets.
Through their high cylinder capacity and their intensive use, the engines of commercial and public works vehicles (Off-Road) are major sources of pollution emission. Thus, in China, although they only represent 5% of total vehicles, they are responsible for

80% of pollution emission. Thanks in particular to the expertise gained through its partnership with Cummins, Faurecia has developed solutions dedicated to these specific markets. The proprietary technology for reducing nitrogen oxides in the gaseous phase (Ammonia Storage and Delivery System ­ ASDS) combined with the existing expertise in particulate capture can already meet the increasingly demanding global emission standards.
Faurecia is able to provide systems integrating the most efficient pollutant and particulate treatment technologies in an optimized volume for all vehicle types.
Connectivity
Connectivity is a fact in our societies and will continue to grow. Mobile phones are now indispensable and there is a need for continuous connectivity in all circumstances. Cars cannot avoid this trend, which, for instance, requires better integration of phones inside vehicles. Vehicle screens will be expected to mirror phone screens. The vehicle itself will become an increasingly connected object, capable of exchanging information with its environment for greater safety during travel, communicating with infrastructures and, in the near future, with other vehicles. Not only does this connectivity enable vehicles to communicate with the outside world, it especially makes it possible to develop predictive systems, such as alternate routes in case of high traffic, and new functions depending on weather conditions and road profiles requiring varying degrees of vigilance. In 2016, Faurecia, aware of the magnitude of the need for connectivity and new on-board functions, and of the necessary evolution in terms of man-machine interfaces, joined forced with Parrot Automotive to become a recognized player in this field.
Autonomous car
One of the major automotive trends is the automation of driving, which may extend to the complete autonomy of the vehicle. It represents a defining challenge for the automotive industry, because it will ultimately decide the driving mode, automated or not, based on the constraints of the road and the will of the driver. Automation will also result in improved passenger safety, thanks to numerous on-board sensors and algorithms. It will make traffic more fluid by taking into account and anticipating traffic realities (traffic intensity, traffic lights, etc.) and allow passengers to make better use of the time spent in the vehicle (work, communicate, relax, study, etc.). This move towards automation began with the integration of driving support tools such as line-crossing alerts and obstacle detection radars. It is now gaining momentum with, as a first step, delegated driving, meaning the vehicle can drive autonomously in particular conditions and on protected roads, while requiring the possibility

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

77

7 Research and development Research and innovation

of rapid vehicle command recovery (approximately ten seconds), as of 2020. As a second step, the automation process will reach more advanced levels as of 2025, with vehicles capable of more autonomous driving requiring them to control and adapt their behavior to the environment, road and conditions. In the third and last step of the process, there will be fully autonomous vehicles under all conditions of use as of 2030. In addition to driver-controlled passenger vehicles with more automated

driving options, new vehicles will be created such as Robot Taxis. The automation of driving opens up considerable prospects for reconfiguration of vehicle interiors, by integrating new use cases as previously described. It will make it possible to offer new and differentiated experiences for passengers, by physically adapting the vehicle interior and adding predictive functions capable of anticipating and satisfying needs. The Cockpit of the Future project is part of this approach.

7.2. Research and innovation

In 2016, Faurecia fine-tuned its innovation plan, to focus on two main areas, under the title "Inspiring Mobility": sustainable mobility and Cockpit of the Future. Sustainable mobility involves weight reduction, air quality, energy recovery, and the development of biosourced materials. The Cockpit of the Future

project involves tailoring comfort to personal needs, intuitive connectivity, the perception of harmony, and safety. These strong avenues for innovation help to refocus the Group's efforts on what creates value for automakers and consumers.

7.2.1. DESIGN APPROACH

Systems approach
Faurecia develops and fits in complete modules such as seats, cockpits and exhaust systems. It develops its own product architectures for each module. Each time new architectures interact with the vehicle, Faurecia works with the automakers to confirm the validity of its proposals. This is particularly the case for the Cockpit of the Future project which involves the interior architecture, comfort and safety.
To accompany the systems approach, Faurecia develops systems engineering in each of the areas covered by the modules it designs.
Product design and process
Product and process design is central to the activity of the Group's engineering teams. Faurecia develops its own rules and design standards. This guarantees a high level of robustness and a competitive advantage.

Its design rules are part of knowledge management, and result in technical training.
Faurecia's systematic search of the best production technologies appropriate to its product portfolio and their adaptation to its requirements represent a second aspect of the product/process performance.
These approaches have allowed the Group to develop lighter, more standardized and more modular products than the competition and given it benchmark price/performance ratios.
The industrial chair of composites with the École Centrale de Nantes (France), the chair of processing methods for metal materials with the Technische Universität Dortmund (TUD, Germany), as well as a chair in polymer chemistry and renewable materials with the University of Freiburg (FMF) and SKZ Würzburg are part of this process.

7.2.2. SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY

Weight reduction
Automakers have two main levers for significantly reducing vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions: powertrain development and optimization and weight reduction. The target is to reduce the vehicle's total weight by 200 to 300 kg, which corresponds to a reduction of 20 to 30 g of CO2 per kilometer.
The introduction of a new WLTC vehicle test cycle in the WLTP test protocol mentioned in Section 7.1 and the fact to be able to achieve CO2 levels of 95 g per kilometer in 2022 and around 75 g per kilometer after 2025, requires optimization vehicle weight which is a key factor.
Faurecia, through the extent of its product scope, research into new materials and manufacturing processes and its expertise in optimizing product/process design, has made weight reduction a priority, as shown by a product range of the highest standard.
The multi-criteria approach allows to combine the effects of a systems approach to product design with the development of new shaping or assembly technologies.
This has resulted in weight reductions in the order of 20% to 30% in new products currently being developed. This corresponds to gains of approximately 60 kg out of the 200 kg represented by Faurecia products. Some of the following products and processes were introduced in 2012. Others have been rolled out since 2013 and started to become standard across the Group in 2014.
Work by successive approaches from an efficient concept in respect of seat frames has allowed weights to be brought down to roughly 10 kg, compared with approximately 14 kg and then 12 kg per frame. Laser welding was a key factor in achieving this. The mechanisms of these frames have currently been reduced in weight by approximately 30% to 40%, setting a new benchmark.
Induction brazing developed to assemble the various parts of the components of exhaust systems is now in mass production, resulting in a gain of 20% to 25% by allowing the use of thinner materials. The proprietary application of this technology in exhaust systems will be gradually extended to numerous other projects. The hydroforming technology developed by Faurecia to reduce the number of parts and optimize thickness can be combined with induction brazing to provide gains of more than 30%. The development of acoustic valves is also a means of reducing the size and weight of mufflers.
Moreover, Lignolight technology (a Faurecia patent), using compressed fibers for between 50% and 90% of the resin,

applied to door panels, improves density by 40% compared with traditional components.
New technologies currently under development will allow further progress. Strategic partnerships with research laboratories, combined with its internal knowledge, will enable Faurecia to become a key player in the development of composites for the automotive industry. Faurecia in this way has mastered all the technologies currently used in mass production, is working on their optimization and is investing in future technologies including thermoplastic resins with reduced cycle times. Mastery of these technologies opens up a new field of business development for Faurecia, with the potential use of composite materials for the structural parts of a scope representing weight of approximately 100 kg. The target reduction is of the order of 40%.
Many other advanced studies are underway with other automakers throughout the world, demonstrating the relevance of Faurecia's proposals in this field.
Furthermore, Faurecia initiated the launch in France of an economic carbon fiber project, known as FORCE, which will ultimately make it possible to offer carbon composite parts for mass-produced vehicles. The project, which involves a consortium of 13 partners, is currently in its second phase and will result in a laboratory pilot line that can produce several kilos of carbon fiber per day.
Size reduction
Reducing product size optimizes passenger space and helps reduce vehicle size. This translates directly or indirectly into a decrease in mass.
In Faurecia Automotive Seating, lighter and less bulky mechanisms mass-produced as from 2013, the use of composites for the back of the front seat and the compliant shell back provide significant space gains in spaciousness of up to 50 mm.
For Faurecia Clean Mobility, the grouping of oxidation, selective catalytic reduction and particulate filtering functions into a module capable of being integrated into the engine environment represents a breakthrough in design and frees up space under the floor. Studies on reducing the length of exhaust systems are underway, allowing the vehicle floor to be made compatible with the additional batteries needed for motor hybridization.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

79

7 Research and development Research and innovation

For the Faurecia Composite Technologies division, within Faurecia Clean Mobility, the aim in particular is to optimize the size of the shock absorbers in order, for example, to reduce the front overhang and give the designer greater freedom while reducing vehicle weight.
Finally, Faurecia Interiors is working on intelligent surfaces which include electronics and plastic technologies to optimize the packaging of the instrument panels, center consoles and door panels.
Energy recovery
Faurecia develops technologies for the recycling of thermal energy available in exhaust systems to be recycled, either directly, in order to heat the cabin or heat up the powertrain or transmission faster, or indirectly, by converting the heat into electricity to power the accessories and potentially hybrid powertrains or into mechanical energy to move the vehicle.
The direct application (known as thermal recycling) resulted in the launch of two new products in 2012: Generation 2 of the underfloor Exhaust Heat Recovery System (EHRS), more compact than Generation 1, and the Exhaust Heat Recovery Manifold (EHRM) which has been fitted in particular to the latest version of the Ford Fusion. These products, applied to conventional and hybrid vehicles, reduce CO2 consumption by 2 to 8 g/km of carbon dioxide on the EU test cycle. Both products are present in the new Hyundai Ioniq hybrid launched in 2016.
For the indirect application with conversion of thermal energy into electric power, two technologies have been considered: thermoelectricity, which uses a semiconducting material crossed by a heat flow to generate electricity, and the generation of mechanical energy from the "Rankine" cycle, which uses vaporized fluid to power a turbine. This mechanical energy is then converted by the turbine into electricity. This generates about 1 to 2 kW of power which reduces CO2 emissions by 4 to 10 g/km.
For trucks using the "Rankine" system, the mechanical energy generated will be directly converted to mechanical energy in the engine crankshaft, thereby creating a power boost of around 10 to 15 kW and reducing CO2 emissions by about 45 g/km.
Air quality
2015 saw the introduction of a statutory European real driving emissions test to measure nitrogen oxide emissions. Mentioned in Section 7.1 the test, known as the RDE (Real Driving Emissions) test, will stipulate a compliance factor between real driving tests and bench tests. As of September 2017, this compliance factor will be 2.1. It will be reduced to 1.5 as of 2020. To achieve the requisite performances levels (80 mg of NOx per kilometer), all

automakers will, at the very least, have to incorporate efficient after-treatment systems with the result that Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) will become standard for all their Diesel vehicles.
On a more general note, Faurecia has the full range of technologies used to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates for diesel engines, regardless of the vehicle (passenger and/or commercial), it being understood that the specifications of these technologies are defined by the automakers, who are also responsible for carrying out the tests.
The underlying principles of these technologies are of two types:
c recycling of gases through the low-pressure loop. The gases burned are reinjected into the cylinders to lower the combustion temperature and oxygen content in the combustion chamber. This loop, known as the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), requires an electric valve that opens on demand. Faurecia has developed its own valve to meet growing market demand;
c direct treatment of gas through Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). Using this process, Faurecia has developed a system for mixing gases using either a liquid catalyst known as AdBlue® or gaseous ammonia directly. Faurecia is developing its own gaseous catalytic system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. The Ammonia Storage and Delivery System (ASDS) process stores ammonia in a compact gaseous form, delivering an improved performance compared with a traditional liquid-form storage system, in particular at low temperature. This system is now in production for trucks and buses.
Faurecia also develops a system that incorporates an oxidation catalyst, a gas mixer with a liquid or gas catalyst (BlueBox), and particulate filters. It moves all of these components closer to the engine, thus substantially increasing the system's temperature and efficiency, in particular under conditions of urban traffic, and to make size and therefore weight gains. This technology enables, in combination with the engine architecture, the auxiliary systems defined by the automaker and the engine calibration (not controlled by Faurecia) to eliminate 95% of nitrogen oxides when using AdBlue® and up 99% when using ASDS and to comply with the 2017 Euro 6.c standard as well as the 2020 Euro 6.d standard.
EGR and SCR technologies are increasingly being used for passenger and utility vehicles (less than five metric tons) in Europe and North America. The most stringent regulations make particulate filters and SCR or EGR systems mandatory for commercial vehicles. Faurecia is on track to conquer these markets. In addition, some applications require innovations such as the Thermal RegeneratorTM. These NOx treatment technologies have already been incorporated into Faurecia's product offering, and are already included in several models that are looking ahead to the Euro 6 standard or similar regulations.

Research and innovation

Furthermore, in 2014, Faurecia supplied the world's first particulate filters for gasoline direct injection engines. This technology will become standard in the upcoming years.
With its expertise in exhaust gas treatment, and taking into account the regulatory changes pertaining to pollutant emissions, Faurecia has entered the market for Off Road vehicles and ships, the latter including engine power ratings of up to 100,000 horses with appropriate post-processing systems. For Faurecia it means extending its product scope and to offer these industries the benefit of its latest technological developments.
Renewable materials
Faurecia develops and incorporates bio-based materials and this is also an effective way of taking up positions that span the entire product life cycle.
In addition to the Lignolight technology described above, natural fibers are a focus for Faurecia. NAFILean technology (NAtural Fiber Injection), which combines natural hemp fibers with polypropylene resin, reduces weight by 25% compared with talcloaded polypropylene. This technology, now in production on the door panels for the new Peugeot 308 and the instrument panel

structures for the new Alfa Romeo Giulia, received the 2014 innovation prize in the green innovation category from CLEPA (European Association of Automotive Suppliers). A massive deployment of this technology is underway. In 2014, an APM (Automotive Performance Material) joint-venture was established with the Interval company in order to produce granules of this material. Faurecia's portfolio includes natural fibers combined with polypropylene fibers. The technology, which is used on the door panels, provides a 20% weight saving compared to the best of all other technologies. The Lignolight technology, applied to a full door panel, uses wood chips compressed with resin which, combined with a molding operation, reduces weight by approximately 30% compared with standard technologies.
The final step is the generation of 100% natural materials for the mass production of semi-structural automotive applications. This was the purpose of the partnership launched in 2012 with Mitsubishi Chemicals. This joint work is based on the modification of polybutylene succinate (PBS), derived from biomass and patented by Mitsubishi Chemicals, allowing it to be made entirely from natural materials. BioAmber provides biosourced succinic acid to both partners. This resin is combined with natural reinforcing fibers to make parts using the injection molding process.

7.2.3. COCKPIT OF THE FUTURE

In future, cars will be more connected, more electrified and more autonomous. These three aspects will bring about a revolution in vehicle interiors as we currently know them. New interior configurations will see the day to meet new needs such as being able to work, relax, communicate and even sleep in some cases. New use cases will emerge depending on the type of vehicle, the passengers, and the nature of occupancy.
The level of vehicle sharing and the requirements for more intuitive, adaptive and cheaper mobility will also play a role.
To meet these challenges, Faurecia, the only automotive supplier capable of providing complete vehicle interiors, has assembled a team dedicated to the Cockpit of the Future with missions to define the best use cases, put them into practice, assess them, and develop related products and technologies.

Various demonstrators were presented at the Paris Motor Show in September 2016, in particular the "Intuition" interior concept, representative of a Level 3 automated vehicle (possibility of letting go of the steering wheel to work or relax and to resume control in five to ten seconds) and the Active Wellness 2.0 seat, which is equipped with sensors that analyze the driver's health and fatigue according to twelve criteria and proposes appropriate solutions such as relaxing or energizing massages or increased heating to enhance the driver's vigilance or to reduce his or her stress level.
Other vehicle automation levels are being studied, such as Level 4, meaning the vehicle can be autonomous on stretches of road (for example on motorways) where drivers may reduce their vigilance level and do other things than drive, even sleep.

7 Research and development Research and innovation

The interior of the vehicle must therefore be physically adapted to these new use cases, while also being predictive in that it can propose solutions or adaptations to anticipate the user's requests, such as preconditioning of the vehicle interior or more complex solutions taking into account external vehicle data with a predictable impact on the interior. The generation and processing of data are key factors of the predictive aspect and can be seen as examples of "machine learning" or artificial intelligence.
The new combinations of interior design, safety and comfort are key elements of the new interiors. Faurecia masters some of them, but is also creating an ecosystem enabling it to advance in these areas.
To become a connectivity player, on December 6, 2016, Faurecia also announced that it was in exclusive negotiations to create a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, one of the leaders in connectivity and infotainment solutions for the automobile industry, in order to develop applications and platforms for connected vehicles. The achievement of this project could lead Faurecia to progressively take control of Parrot Automotive, through an initial stake of 20% in the capital stock, and by 2022, ownership of all Parrot Automotive's shares.
Personalized comfort
Faurecia has always positioned itself as a key partner of automakers in the area of seating comfort. The development of postural comfort software, optimization of the pressure at the occupant-seat interface, and filtration of vibrations from the vehicle floor are all areas upon which Faurecia has built its reputation. The latest innovations relate to the development of multi-hardness foams, which filter the various types of vibrations and optimize seat thickness in order to reduce its height, but they also propose a set of pneumatic systems that adjust the shape of the seat to the occupant and use inflation/ deflation cycles to generate a massage with characteristics that can be adapted as needed.
The need of comfort will increase in the future, as vehicles become more autonomous and passenger activities more varied, ranging from working to sleeping. Faurecia's experts are preparing for this change, for instance by studying motion sickness, the treatment of which will be an essential condition for the success of automated driving, in particular if users wish to read during periods of automated driving.
Lastly, Faurecia will continue to develop its Active Wellness 2.0 seat mentioned above.

Safety
Faurecia is a supplier of components that play an important role in passive safety and thus help save lives or limit injuries to drivers or passengers. Seats help provide about 80% of rear impact protection, about 30 to 40% for frontal impacts and, depending on the automaker, between 30% and 80% for side impacts. The instrument panel incorporates all the issues relating to the deployment of airbags. In the area of pedestrian impacts, bumpers make a decisive contribution in efforts to limit injuries, by devoting attention both to their intrinsic characteristics and to the kinematics of the impact sequence.
Over the years, Faurecia has taken position as a key partner for automakers in this area, initially by emphasizing the importance of safety and then by developing products and expertise that allow the Group to devote research efforts, in a measured and confident manner, to all anticipated changes. Each link in the safety chain is associated with design rules that guarantee the system's performance and its longevity.
The Cockpit of the Future approach evoked above strengthens the need to treat internal vehicle security as a new system that Faurecia needs to manage through selected partnerships, with the aim of advancing solutions linked to new interior configurations and the associated use cases.
Interior harmony and connectivity
Faurecia is the only automotive supplier capable of providing all of the items constituting the visual ambiance of the vehicle's interior: instrument panel, central console, door panels and seats.
In the near future, vehicle interiors will undergo major changes as regards the number and surfaces of screens, the use of noble materials (wood, aluminum, ceramics, etc.), the need for interior reconfiguration in line with the possible activities, and new design standards.
To meet this challenge, Faurecia is implementing a comprehensive methodology bringing together designers, developers and business experts, with the goal of offering unique designs, ensuring the perceived quality of the solutions, and developing suitable technologies.
A concrete example is the merger of decoration, screens and ventilation outlets on the instrument panel, for which Faurecia is developing three-dimensional surfaces in glass integrating screens, driving instruments, command buttons and ventilation outlets, the mechanical part of which is hidden. This innovation was presented at the latest Paris Motor Show in September 2016 and foreshadows the interiors of tomorrow.
Some of these innovations are possible due to the network of start-ups that Faurecia has started to build and operate.

Research and innovation

Furthermore, the innovations linked to the human-machine interfaces meet users' connectivity needs through their smartphones but also through their vehicle which may replicate their smartphone. To become a connectivity player, Faurecia, as described above, entered into a partnership with Parrot Automotive. This investment meets the need for connectivity as well as the need for predictivity to be implemented inside the vehicle in order to anticipate external events and to offer solutions to circumvent or avoid them.

The interior lighting also creates an atmosphere and light signature that can be associated with a driving style or a sense of well-being. Faurecia holds the entire range of technologies that can meet multiple demands and integrate with all types of media. By providing a wide range of materials and technologies, Faurecia allows the creation of varied interior environments for all market segments.

7.2.4. ORGANIZATION OF INNOVATION

The innovation process
Faurecia develops its products and technologies within a structured approach known as process innovation. This process sets out the different stages in maturation from the initial idea to final validation. At each step, a validation committee rules on the transition to the next step.
Monitoring this process makes our innovation more robust, and allows it subsequently to be integrated into vehicle projects with limited risk.
Management of expertise
Faurecia's expertise is structured around skills in 66 areas. In 2016, the expert network comprised 344 experts, divided into three levels: expert, senior expert and master expert. The experts have a career path parallel to that of management and are recognized in the same way in the Company. Experts are primarily responsible for innovation and knowledge structuring, but are also involved in all stages of product and process development so as to ensure technical excellence at all levels.
Partnerships
To expand and enhance its expertise, Faurecia is actively developing new partnerships with suppliers and research institutes.
This is demonstrated by the creation of a chair in composites with the École Centrale de Nantes in 2011, followed by an additional three chairs in 2012: automotive mechatronics with Supélec and ESIGELEC; assembly lines and logistics with the École Centrale de Paris (ECP, France) and the Technische Universität München (TUM, Germany); metal materials and innovative processing with the Technische Universität Dortmund (TUD, Germany) and the most recent chair in 2013 with the University of Freiburg (FMF) and SKZ Würzburg, both located in Germany, for the chemistry of plastics and biomaterials.

In addition, a master agreement was signed in 2012 with Fraunhofer ICT (Germany) on composite production technologies, which further confirmed Faurecia's determination to work with academic institutions to achieve greater mastery of the phenomena encountered and to open other avenues of innovation.
Faurecia is also strongly involved in France in the IRTs (Instituts de Recherche Technologiques ­ Technological Research Institutes) Jules Verne and M2P in order to develop innovative production processes in the field of composite and metal materials, as well as in start-up research through incubators in France and abroad. Specific cooperative actions are also implemented on a caseby-case basis for innovation projects that require technologies related to Faurecia's core business lines.
Investments
In 2016, the continuous innovation work resulted in the filing of 501 patents. Of these 501 patents, 27% were filed by Faurecia Seating, 55% by Faurecia Interiors and 18% by Faurecia Clean Mobility. This result confirms Faurecia's commitment to innovation. These patents pertain to products (approximately 80% of the filings), materials, and manufacturing processes, demonstrating the efforts made to optimize the entire product value chain.
This commitment to research and development is demonstrated regularly by the opening of new research and development centers in various geographic areas and the modernization of historic centers for which technologies have changed.

7 Research and development Engineering and program management

7.3. Engineering and program management

Carrying out innovation and vehicle application projects calls for highly reliable and effective organization of engineering and programs. Faurecia is organized in a way that meets both these requirements.
Engineering
Faurecia currently operates 30 R&D centers worldwide. Each Business Group's research and development is spread across our three main geographic areas: Europe, America and Asia. Since it is structured as a network, it can run global programs and commit as many of its resources as are needed through its worldwide workforce (quantity), or commit the right experts, particularly for innovation or vehicle application projects (quality).
Project Management
Vehicle application programs follow a unique process, bringing together all the participants needed to develop and launch a new, mass-produced product. The Program Management System (PMS) process, describes all the requirements at each phase of the program. Every program is given periodic interim reviews, first by specialists and then at the close of each phase by management, so that its progress can be seen.

The PMS consists of five phases:
c obtain and validate customer needs;
c develop the product;
c test the product and develop the manufacturing process;
c plan and validate production machinery;
c ramp up line speeds and launch mass production.
To track performance throughout the development process and steer it towards excellence, Faurecia has introduced the idea of program management excellence. This new approach involves the foregoing elements plus:
c system audits of the program requirements to ensure disciplined implementation;
c performance indicators, reviewed monthly, to signal future risks.
These various tools have made it possible to significantly improve the programs' performance in terms of finance, quality, lead times and launches of mass production.
636 programs run by 430 program managers were in development at the end of 2016.

Other information, including workforce-related disclosures, are provided in Chapter 5 of this Registration Document.

8.1. Faurecia and the environment

8.1.1. FAURECIA'S PRODUCTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Many different approaches are used by Faurecia to help reduce its environmental footprint and to position the Company as a sustainable mobility player. These range from weight reduction, limiting emissions of noxious gases, and lowering noise levels to exhaust energy recovery, the development of products made from biosourced materials.
Thus, Faurecia takes environmental factors into account at all stages in the product life cycle, from the initial design to end-of-life management, including the environmental impact of its production sites and the potential for collaboration with suppliers.
From product design to manufacturing, Faurecia's approach aims to:
c reduce the environmental impact of vehicles through its products;
c ensure the recyclability of its products and promote the use of recycled materials;
c control the use of chemicals, and reduce their use;
c manage consumption of materials.
In this context, Faurecia's approach builds on different design and support tools to help it meet legal requirements.
8.1.1.1. Approach
PRODUCT APPROACH
From product design to the technical expertise provided to automakers, Faurecia's process spans three areas:
c lowering vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) thanks to weight and volume reduction and improvements to energy efficiency (for example, by using energy recovery techniques);

c controlling polluting gas emissions;
c increasing the use of biosourced materials.
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Section 7.2.2. of this Registration Document includes a description of the action taken by Faurecia in this area.
Controlling polluting gas emissions
Section 7.2.2 of this Registration Document also describes action taken by the Group with regard to control of emissions.
Emissions other than those generated by vehicles have long been studied by the Group and taken into account in its product development processes. These involve volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can adversely affect vehicle interior air quality, abbreviated as VIAQ. As part of its commitment to reducing these emissions, the Group is developing or designing low-emission materials or products for Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Seating. In collaboration with its suppliers, the Faurecia Composite Technologies division, within Faurecia Clean Mobility, is developing new polyester resin or styrene-free vinyl ester based materials with the aim of reducing VOC associated emissions both in its plants during part manufacturing and in vehicle interiors.
In this context, Faurecia also takes part in working groups on VIAQ (Vehicle Interior Air Quality) at the United Nations level, in collaboration with manufacturer representatives; these groups aim to monitor the health of people on-board and continuously improve Faurecia's and the automobile industry's knowledge in measurement methodologies and the impact of Group products present inside vehicles.
Using biosourced materials
Section 7.2.2 of this Registration Document contains information on the use of biosourced materials.

Faurecia and the environment

RECYCLABILITY AND THE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS
Faurecia includes recyclability and the use of recycled materials in its environmental approach. This includes anticipation of the end-of-life phase and optimization of production waste recovery.
Recyclability
European Directive 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 on endof-life vehicles stipulates inter alia that vehicles will have to be 95% recoverable by weight, of which 85% will have to be actually reusable or recyclable, by January 1, 2015.
Given such onerous regulatory requirements, automakers are placing ever-greater demands on their suppliers in terms of end-of-life product recyclability.
All of Faurecia's Business Groups are affected by these obligations and, depending on the characteristics of the component in question, have implemented plans and solutions to ensure that end-of-life products are processed as efficiently as possible in the future.
As regards current solutions, an innovative product must be measurable both in terms of improved technical and economic performance and its carbon footprint. Faurecia is committed to a process of forecasting and recovering future end-of-life products. Selective trials overseen by Faurecia comprise the first phase of a comprehensive approach by the automotive sector in partnership with industrial firms, academia and auto "clusters", to forecasting volumes of materials available for recycling in the future.
Faurecia Interiors, after performing tests on the recycling and recovery of complex products via disassembly, has begun similar operations after shredding vehicles. Industrial-scale recyclability studies and tests have been undertaken with certain car-shredding plants, both on existing products and materials being developed, including agro-composites. For example, the NAFCORECY (NAtural Fiber COmposites RECYcling) project was able to demonstrate, with the help of European companies specialized in recycling, that parts made of NAFILean (polypropylene with natural fibers) can be processed with postshredding technologies for end-of-life vehicles or recycling technologies used for industrial waste.
Research work within the Faurecia Composite Technologies division has focused on developing new materials/procedure couples from Polyamid or Polypropylene type thermoplastic resins. These resins substitute for thermosetting polyester or epoxy resins to enable a shredding recycling circuit to be implemented with the reuse of the shredded materials according to a defined introduction rate to make new reinforced thermoplastic injection parts.
All possibilities for recycling end-of-life products are studied with a view to integrating the best solutions, ensuring reduced environmental impact and taking into account all utilization cycles at the design stage. Faurecia also uses life cycle analysis

to "eco-design" its products, integrating all of the above criteria as early as possible into the innovation and development processes.
Inclusion of recycled materials
Faurecia offers an increasing number of recycled plastic parts.
Within Faurecia Seating, depending on the type and category of vehicle, various components are now partly made of recycled polypropylene. Taking all these components together, recycled plastics can now account for 15-20% of the materials comprising the seats manufactured by Faurecia.
Within Faurecia Interiors, the incorporation of recycled material is taken into account and validated in new product development, with the same constraints and specifications as virgin materials.
In addition, Faurecia maximizes the incorporation of recycled natural fibers (mainly cotton) in its vehicle soundproofing systems.
Within the Faurecia Composite Technologies division, innovation projects aim to use a maximum of carbon fibers from fabric scraps, continuous fibers from current technologies (RTM Preforming) both from the automotive and aerospace industry. These fibers are integrated into SMC (Sheet Molding Compound) or BMC (Bulk Molding compound) type compounds. These materials are then compression formed to obtain structural parts that meet the mechanical specifications required by automakers.
Life cycle analysis studies show that the use of recycled materials can reduce the environmental impact of manufactured products. Faurecia, like its automaker customers, has considerably extended its panel of suppliers of recycled materials. This allows us today to offer increasingly technical applications with increasingly wide material grades.
CONTROLLING THE USE OF CHEMICALS: THE REACH REGULATION
Substance management systems are put in place across the entire supply chain, from suppliers to manufacturing customers, for all products delivered by Faurecia. Among other benefits, this approach gives the Group access to complete information on the substances entering into its products, in order to ensure that all actors in the supply chain comply with regulatory frameworks on chemicals and their safe use, such as the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) regulation. Thanks to this approach, Faurecia also keeps a close watch on new developments in its supply chain in order to investigate substitutes for certain substances when necessary.
Among its initiatives in this area, Faurecia has developed an anticipatory approach to the identification and sharing of information within the supply chain on chemicals or constituents of concern, based on a list of chemicals or constituents considered as potentially of concern for its products and their use. In some cases, such as catalyst protectors in exhaust systems (ceramic fibers), Faurecia has defined an internal procedure that is more stringent than REACH.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

Faurecia and sustainable development

Faurecia and the environment

Faurecia also takes part in work carried out alongside automakers and various industry federations or associations in order to anticipate possible restrictions on the use of substances in the coming years and coordinate efforts to propose alternatives where necessary. The federations and associations involved include the French Vehicle Equipment Industries Alliance (FIEV), the French Automotive Industry Cluster (PFA), the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA), and the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA). Faurecia leads the task force on REACH as well as the one formed to address issues raised by the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL).
MANAGING CONSUMPTION OF MATERIALS
One of the important aspects in reducing the environmental footprint is managing the consumption of materials, through the optimization of product design and the optimization of materials used during the parts industrialization phases and the management of manufacturing processes. The use of product simulation has enabled considerable reductions in the number of prototypes used for destructive testing over the last few years. On the manufacturing side, the simulation of parts transformation processes and the digitalization of production resources to manage variability thus avoiding high scrap levels and breakdowns are tangible examples.
8.1.1.2. Tools for integrating the eco-design approach
For each innovation and development project, the different components of eco-design ­ the presence of substances of concern, recyclability, the environmental footprint and interior air quality ­ are systematically checked by the designer using an eco-design checklist. If necessary, an in-depth study may be carried out (life cycle analysis for an innovation that aims to reduce weight, VOC and odor tests, etc.).

LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS
Faurecia increasingly uses life cycle analysis (LCA) as an engineering tool at various levels to steer its strategic decisions and those of automakers: on its products, on the entire vehicle (from the extraction of materials to delivery to automakers) and on the entire vehicle life cycle (including customer use and recycling).
Framed by international standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, this methodology consists of assessing the environmental impact of products designed and manufactured by Faurecia for use in automobiles. It involves the fullest possible impact assessment, including climate change (including CO2), the consumption of non-renewable resources (oil and coal) and eutrophication.
LCA allows both Faurecia and automakers to:
c make the right design choices for current vehicles (with gasoline or Diesel internal combustion engines) and for those of the future using alternative fuels and with more environmentally-friendly emission control systems;
c assess and avoid impact transfer by focusing on alternative solutions (e.g. by developing a lighter but non-recyclable product).
This is an especially useful innovation tool for evaluating benefits as well as any impact transfers as far upstream as possible through a comprehensive overview of the environmental impacts that paves the way for future innovations. For instance, the measurement of the environmental footprint generated by new products or materials is always supplemented by a detailed LCA, investigating issues of particular relevance (in line with objectives such as weight reduction or lower energy consumption).
It also provides a more in-depth understanding of the environmental choices of an entire industry. Faurecia is therefore heavily committed to developing and using LCA in liaison with automakers and auto sector partners as the means of gaining a shared understanding of environmental challenges.

8.1.2. FAURECIA SITES AND THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES

The scope of this reporting covers production sites (technological plants), assembly sites (called Just In Time sites) and R&D sites, i.e. a total of 234 sites.
In the course of 2016, Faurecia completed the sale of its Faurecia Automotive Exteriors activity. Studies conducted at constant scope between 2014, 2015 and 2016 therefore do not include the sites of this activity. As compared to 2015, thirteen sites have been integrated in the reporting and twenty-four have been excluded.
The evolution of the quantitative indicators is assessed at a constant scope in the whole of this Section 8.1.2 (excluding new acquisitions and site closures). Graphical analysis is calculated on a real scope basis which may explain a difference between the figures and the indicators in the text.

8.1.2.1. A Group and sites committed to an environmental management approach
As a major player in pollution control systems and sustainable mobility, Faurecia is strongly committed to reducing its environmental impact. As early as 2004, the Group adhered to the UN Global Compact principle. Through this signature, it committed itself to respecting and promoting, in its business practices, a set of values and principles derived from international texts or conventions relating to human rights, labor standards and environment. In 2016, Faurecia decided to strengthen its commitment to protecting the environment by setting up an Environmental Committee, led by the Industrial Strategy department, comprising the Customer Relations Director, the three HSE Business Group Directors, Purchasing, Strategy and Innovation, Communication, Risk Management and Loss Control departments. This committee meets monthly and aims to deal with environmental issues in a cross-cutting manner. It enabled the launch of a dialogue, directly linked to its environmental responsibility, with the Group's external stakeholders. The aim was to update the materiality analysis carried out in 2015 and to set up an environmental breakthrough plan by 2017.
The key performance indicators of this plan will be presented and discussed by the Environmental Committee on a quarterly basis.

For each of the four major categories presented in the scheme above, the Environmental Committee identified one or two key players who were then interviewed in order to reinforce the Group's materiality analysis.
Following consultations with internal stakeholders, a list of fifteen issues were identified in 2015. In 2016, consultation with external stakeholders resulted in reducing this list to eight issues. This exercise showed that some themes strongly overlapped.

The main themes highlighted last year are confirmed for 2017 and ar listed below in order of importance:
c establish structured environmental governance with clear objectives;
c promote energy efficiency;
c engage in the circular economy (raw materials and wastes management);
c reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions and their consequences;

8.1.2.1.2. PROMOTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF SITES
Among its objectives, the Group asks its Business Groups to take the necessary steps to enable their production sites to obtain the ISO14001 certification.
In 2016, this approach to the environmental management of production sites progressed: 79.5% of sites have their certification, compared to 75.3% in 2015. Seven new plants were certified during the reporting year. The new version of the ISO 14001 standard, published in 2015, has already been initiated at ten Faurecia Seating sites, four Faurecia Clean Mobility sites and twelve Faurecia Interiors sites. Through this certification, Faurecia is committed to meeting its customers'requirements and demonstrating its environmental performance.
As well as its factories, thirty-eight JIT and R&D sites are ISO 14001 certified.

8.1.2.1.3. INITIATE A STRUCTURED HSE APPROACH AROUND KEY PERFORMANCE ISSUES
Last year, the Faurecia Seating Business Group launched its HSE policy, focusing on energy efficiency and recycling.

In 2016, the two other Business Groups, Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Clean Mobility, published their HSE policy. The main objectives of the sites dedicated to the Interiors activity are to improve their energy efficiency, thereby reducing their CO2 emissions from scopes 1 and 2, to control their risk of soil pollution and to raise their supply chain's awareness in terms of complying with the Faurecia group's HSE rules.
8.1.2.1.4. TRAIN FAURECIA TEAMS AND TEMPORARY WORKERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF THEIR SITE
As soon as a new employee is integrated, whether on a permanent or temporary contract, he/she attends an outreach session in managing the environmental impact on certified sites. This allows the employee to adopt, in its daily tasks, good practices in terms of environmental protection.
The growing number of employees in Asia has encouraged the Business Groups HSE divisions to deploy ISO 14001 training courses as soon as these employees are integrated. This ensures that they are immediately introduced to the Group's environmental practices.
In 2016, more than 32,000 hours of training (+13% compared to 2015) (1) were administered.
Training is mainly carried out internally. The sessions deal with environmental risk management (pollution and regulatory noncompliance), waste classification and management, chemicals management, implementation of natural disaster emergency response plans and also the environmental monitoring of subcontractors' sites.
Environmental training focusing on the environmental impact of the product is also planned for the employees of the Faurecia Clean Mobility Business Group.
The training provided by external organizations consists mainly in acquiring in-house sharp expertise, such as mastering the ISO 14001 certification process.
8.1.2.1.5. STRENGTHEN INVESTMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The principal investments related to environmental protection mainly concern three environmental commitments formulated in the HSE policies of the Business Groups: energy efficiency (buildings insulation, renewal of equipment and adoption of LED lighting), the implementation of structured waste management and pollution control and improved treatment systems for pollutants discharged into the air and water.
In 2016, these investments amounted to  2.435 million.

(1) The calculation of environment training hours does not exclude the effect of staff turnover.

8.1.2.2. Strengthen industrial performance by promoting the circular economy from the design stage to the disposal of equipment
Aware of the challenges related to natural resources, Faurecia constantly seeks to innovate both in its product design and in the management and recovery of the waste generated by its sites.
8.1.2.2.1. OPTIMIZE SUPPLY SOURCES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES
The supply of natural resources and raw materials varies at different stages of a product's life cycle. To anticipate the responsible use of resources right from the design phase, Faurecia carries out, in partnership with customers who wish to do so, a life-cycle analysis (LCA) of the produced part.
These LCAs allow for reflection on:
c lighter-weight automobile parts;
c the possibility to integrate recycled and/or bio sourced material;
c and their recyclability when the vehicle reaches the end of its life.
Faurecia's projects to reduce the environmental footprint of products are described in Chapter 7.
In order to ensure the production of automotive equipment, Faurecia's three Business Groups use several types of raw material from non-renewable resources: metal (1), plastic and synthetic fibers, both of which are derived from petrol.

10 Natural fibers

249 Plastics (recycled)

1,105 Metal
Internal reuse of plastic and fibers scrap Faurecia's manufacturing sites recycle internally on a daily basis, whenever the production waste can be recycled to be directly reintegrated into the production process. Plastics and fibers can be subject to this.
Strengthen purchases of recycled material The use of the recycled material in a vehicle depends both on the thresholds laid down in the manufacturer's specifications and on its impact on the aesthetics of the part, all the more so if this is visible in the vehicle's interior. In 2016, 8% of all plastics purchased by the Group were recycled plastics.
Strengthen the use of bio-sourced raw materials
Fibers Seven Faurecia Interiors plants have orientated all or part of their production process to the use of natural fibers (linen, cotton, hemp, wood, kenaf (2)) in replacement of synthetic fibers derived from petroleum. They represent no less than 25% of the total quantity of fibers used by the Group.
Wood A Spanish site, belonging to the Faurecia Interiors Business Group, producing interior wooden parts uses waste generated by the furniture and pallet industry as raw material.

(1) To make the data more reliable (see Independent Verifier's Report in 2015), a detailed analysis was carried out at 22 sites representing 80% of the total amount of metal materials purchases from the Business Group concerned. Five other sites underwent a detailed analysis of their metal consumption. The corrections made had an impact on the overall data. The 2016 data therefore cannot be compared with the 2015 data.
(2) Kenaf is related to jute. Its spiny stems, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, are often, but not always, branched. The leaves of 10 to 15 cm in length are of variable shape, those at the base are lobed and those at the top are lance-shaped.

8.1.2.2.2. OPTIMIZE THE USE OF SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE TREATMENT PROCESSES
In order to preserve the resources needed for their production process (energy and raw material) as much as possible, Faurecia's industrial sites try to recycle and recover a maximum amount of the waste generated throughout the production chain.
In 2016, Faurecia sites record the following waste reprocessing rates:
c 58% of waste is recycled (+3% compared to 2015);
c 14% of waste is reclaimed through energy recovery (stable compared to 2015).
Scrap metal, aluminium and plastic are melted down before they can be re-used; carton is reshaped and paper is reprocessed. These materials then go to new industries.

230,000

212,387

215,921

217,606

180,000

In 2016, the sites generated 214,503 tons of waste (+1.72% compared to 2015 due to an increase in activity). Non-hazardous waste constitutes 62% of the waste generated by the Group. Almost all of the metal waste is recycled by the sites. In fact, the scrap is sent to the foundry before being resold on the market, contributing to the circular economy logic.
Since June 2015, the HSE policy of the Faurecia Seating Business Group commits the sites to zero waste disposed to landfill. In 2016, priority has been given to hazardous waste. Seven sites have reduced the amount of hazardous waste going to landfill by an average of 11% compared to 2015.
The launch of the "Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain" approach enabled Faurecia to review the recycling practices for metallic waste to ensure that these wastes are sent to a recycling branch and that it is bought back at the current tariff existing in the country where they are located. This approach will allow the Group to manage the practices of each site and improve their efficiency.

8.1.2.3. Commit to reducing its carbon footprint activities
8.1.2.3.1. CARBON INVENTORY ACROSS ALL FAURECIA ACTIVITIES
Less than a year after its adoption on December 12, 2015 at COP21, nearly eighty countries, including France, China, the United States, India and Canada, have ratified the first universal climate agreement, paving the way for a new development model.
It is in this context that French Decree n° 2016-1138 of August 19, 2016, pursuant to Law n° 2015-992 of August 17, 2015 on the energy transition for green growth, strengthened the content of report provided for by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Code of commerce, concerning information on the impact

of the Company's activity and the use of the goods and services it produces, on climate change. On the latter point, the Decree extends the scope of expected information to relevant direct and indirect emission sources throughout the Company's value chain, i.e. upstream and downstream of its activity.
In 2016, in order to meet this obligation and eventually to include it in the overall approach of its future carbon strategy, Faurecia estimated the emissions from its scope 3 activities in addition to the 1 and 2 scopes which it has measured since 2012. For each scope 3 emission source, in line with the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, Faurecia favoured a socalled conservative approach. The assumptions and values used, especially in the case of data uncertainty, tend to overestimate emissions. Two sources are largely dominant in Faurecia's emissions: the use of products sold (1) and the purchase of products and services.

Emission sources
Energy consumption (scope 1)
Energy purchases (scope 2)
Purchases of goods and services*
Use of products sold*
* Significant sources.
The conclusions of this estimate confirm Faurecia's strategic priorities, its actions to reduce the weight of components and subassemblies, and the widespread use of natural bio-sourced or recycled materials (see Section 8.1.1 Faurecia Products and the environment).
To enable the Group to define a low-carbon roadmap in line with a reduction in its emissions, a detailed carbon inventory relating to the operational scope will be set up in 2017. The key performance indicators will be measured and communicated to the management every three months.
Faurecia has measured emissions related to energy consumption (scope 1) and energy purchases (scope 2) since 2012. Concerning the 2016 scope, 23 sites must publish their greenhouse gas balance sheet under Article 75 of the Grenelle 2 Act.

Faurecia and the environment

In line with efforts made since 2012, and in compliance with the international regulations relating to the Montreal Protocol which prohibits R22 refrigerant gas use in Europe since January 1, 2015, the Faurecia sites have continued to reduce their use of this gas (-60% compared to 2015). Eighteen sites are continuing their efforts to remove this refrigerant gas from their processes.
Calculation methodologies
Direct greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in CO2 equivalent. Emissions from fuel consumption are calculated using the international emission factors recommended by the French Administration (Decree of October 31, 2012 and European Decision n° 2012/601 for CO2 and Circular of April 15, 2002 for other gases).
Fugitive emissions are calculated using emission factors from the 5th report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Indirect electricity-related emissions are calculated from emission factors published by the IEA (International Energy Agency® version 2013).
The diagnosis of the significant emission stations, carried out by Carbone 4, was established in accordance with the international reference system of the GHG Protocol.

8.1.2.3.2. PROMOTE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE SITES
In 2016, energy consumption reached 1,846 million MWh (-2% compared to 2015). Electricity accounts for 70% of the total energy consumed by the Group. The Faurecia Interiors Business Group consumes 55% of the Group's total energy due to the injection molding machines that make up its production equipment.

Encourage energy savings
The implementation of an energy management system has committed the sites to developing their competences regarding the sources of potential savings on their site, whether they are related to the equipments' performance, or daily operating procedures. Ten sites are certified or undergoing ISO 50001 certification.
Fifty-four energy audits were carried out during the reporting period, covering thirty Faurecia Interiors sites, eighteen Faurecia Seating sites and eight Faurecia Clean Mobility sites.
With a view to capitalizing on the results of these audits, the Group has, on the basis of the action plans issued to each site, drawn up a document listing all the good practices relating to a site's energy management. Depending on the equipment used on the sites, several measures are recommended. In particular, the document mentions the installation of a variable speed drive on an electric motor which can save energy by between 10% and 60%. For sites equipped with a boiler room, the regulation of the water temperature according to the outside temperature can also generate an energy saving (10% on average). The rational use of the energy resource can also involve the recovery of condensation heat from a boiler room or an air compressor, previously equipped with a heat transformer, to produce domestic hot water.
In 2016, one hundred and eighteen sites (including eighty-six production sites), representing 50% of the sites included in the reporting scope, set up initiatives to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings and production tools. In total, the sums invested represent more than  4 million.
The actions most frequently cited by the sites are: installation of intelligent and energy efficient lighting and heating systems, standby modes for machines and equipment at weekends, installation of motion detectors, LED lighting, eliminating compressed air leaks...

Faurecia and the environment

Encourage the reuse of energy sources and enhance renewable energy consumption
The electricity supply contracts for the sites are for an electrical mix, the share of which varies according to the country of production. In total, 9% of electricity comes from renewable sources at Group level, i.e. 114,029 MWh (+69% (1) compared to 2015).
8.1.2.4. Minimize air, soil and water releases
8.1.2.4.1. BETTER CONTROL OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EMISSIONS (VOCS)
Faurecia is committed to limiting airborne emissions of regulated Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which are subject to specific rules as they contribute in the formation and accumulation of harmful compounds -such as ozone ­ in the environment. In 2016, the VOC emissions balance is at 1,638 tonnes.
The sites from the Business Group Faurecia Interiors are the Group's main source of VOC emissions (72%), due to activities requiring significant use of glues and paints. Eight sites (9% of Faurecia Interiors sites) account for nearly 70% of VOC emissions.
To reduce its airborne emissions, the Business Group Faurecia Interiors gives priority to the use of water-based paints and adhesives thereby reducing the use of solvents.
Calculation methodology
The annual reference emissions on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) is calculated using the Solvent Management Plan (SMP) required by the European Council Directive 1999/13/ EC of March 11, 1999 on the reduction of volatile organic compounds emissions caused by the use of organic solvents in certain activities and facilities. The SMP is a mass balance for quantifying the inputs and outputs of solvents in an installation.
8.1.2.4.2. WATER CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS INTO WATER
Water is mainly used in the cooling of produced parts (44%), the rest being consumed directly in production processes and for sanitary use.

DISTRIBUTION OF WATER CONSUMPTION, PER USE (100% OF THE REAL 2016 SCOPE)

41% Domestic use

75% of groundwater withdrawals are due to two sites with open cooling circuits, i.e. water is released directly into the natural environment, after controlling its temperature, so as not to impact the availability of water resources at the local level. Neither of these sites identified water restriction issues during 2016.
In 2016, two sites announced that they could be periodically exposed to water shortages. The first is located in France and is subject to a prefectural decree as its main source is a river. This site has not reached the threshold above which it must stop withdrawing water. The second, located in India, had to pay particular attention to its consumption due to a low water inflow,

(1) This significant variation between 2015 and 2016 is mainly related to a better gathering of information in 2016 and to a stronger part of renewal energies in the worldwide electrical mix.

normally assured by the monsoon phenomenon. Employee awareness, a rational use of the resource and temporarily stopping the watering of green areas made it possible to mitigate the problem.

Water discharge
In parallel with the discharge of these cooling waters (35% of the total water discharged in 2016), other water discharges, contaminated during their use, are systematically treated before evacuation, either via the collective network (53% in 2016), or via a treatment plant directly installed on the site (12% of the water discharged in 2016).
63% of production sites are subject to self-monitoring by local authorities to monitor the quality of wastewater discharge. Of these sites, 81% meet the requirements for aqueous discharge. Any non-conformity that is detected is appropriately treated to prevent recurrence.

8.1.2.4.3. SOIL RELEASES
Any accidental spill is framed in a plan to prevent the risk of soil pollution for all of the Faurecia sites. ISO 14001 certified sites systematically integrate it into their management system. This risk, inherent in the industrial activity of a site, is well understood by the Faurecia sites and their operators who are trained to react in the event of accidental leakage.
Through the Business Group's HSE policy, Faurecia Interiors sites are invited to control risks relating to soil and groundwater pollution. They are also strongly encouraged to do so through environmental Due Diligence.
13.7% had soil and groundwater analyses carried out by an expert body during the reporting period (including 19.4% of Faurecia Clean Mobility sites, 13.9% of Faurecia Seating sites and 7.23% of Faurecia Interiors sites).

Pursuant to French Decree n°2012-633 of May 3, 2012, Faurecia has identified two French sites subject to the obligation to provide financial guarantees for their safety. In 2016, the amount of these guarantees was 221,826 for the two sites in question.
8.1.2.5. Mitigating the environmental risks related to suppliers
Preserving the environment is one of the founding principles of the sustainable procurement procedures introduced by Faurecia, called "Buy Beyond". These procedures are based on the Group's Code of Conduct, which sets out the environmental requirements to be met by Faurecia's suppliers and service providers.
More information on Faurecia's environmental specifications with regard to its suppliers, as well as their assessments, is provided in Section 8.2.3.
8.1.2.6. Integrate sustainably in the territories where Faurecia is located
8.1.2.6.1. PREVENT NATURAL HAZARDS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Faurecia has a strategy to adapt to climate change in order to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of the industrial installations to the vagaries of the climate and to optimize their resilience to these risks. The "Natural Risk" profile was evaluated for 100% of the sites in the scope. However, the models used do not yet incorporate the projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
All the elements relating to the prevention and management of natural risks are described in the Section 4.4 "Industrial and environmental risks".
8.1.2.6.2. REDUCING THE IMPACT OF THE SITES ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
1. Reduce the impact of sites close to a protected area
90% of the entities in the reporting scope are located in urban or industrial areas. Twenty-three sites, including sixteen production sites, six assembly sites and one R&D site, are located within three kilometers of a protected area. These protected areas close to the Faurecia sites are Natural Areas of Ecological Fauna and Flora Interest type 1 or 2, areas that protect species becoming or already endangered (leopard, ground squirrels, terrestrial squirrels...), and natural water area (rivers and streams) protection zones. 78% of these sites are located in Europe, 18% in Latin America, and 5% in the United States.

In China, an initiative, more commonly known as "Green Community", took place in March 2016 for the second consecutive year to raise awareness of environmental protection among employees and their families. Twenty-eight sites (twenty-six last year) participated in activities directly related to this theme: planting trees, promoting environmental protection concepts and collecting electronic waste.
In June 2016, the Chinese headquarters launched the first "FAUR'kids Class" programme. In addition to their usual school curriculum, children can attend these classes which focus on environmental protection. These courses have allowed children to design works of art from discarded materials to increase their awareness of waste recycling and reuse.

2. Reduce noise and olfactory nuisance In 2016, a Faurecia Interiors site reported three official complaints that it had received from local residents concerning the quality of the air leaving the plant, the noise generated by the production tool and the road traffic generated by the site's employees.
Corrective actions have been set up or will be implemented in 2017, including the installation of a thermal oxidizer to deal with high volatile organic compound flows and the reorganization of the car park to limit its noise impact.
8.1.2.7. Provisions
In 2016, provisions for environmental risks were set up for an amount of K4,825. Provisions are mainly related to site remediation costs

8.2.1. TERRITORIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF FAURECIA'S BUSINESS

8.2.1.1. On employment and regional development
Over the last few years, Faurecia has grown very significantly with almost 100,000 employees, including over 17,000 engineers and managers at the end of 2016.
Over the last four years, the volume of external hires has stabilized, at slightly over 2,000 engineers and managers. In 2016, hires were mainly carried out in Asia (734), Europe (725), and North America (652); the countries that recruited the most in these three regions were China (372), the United States (345), Mexico (301) and India (257). In parallel, the number of hires remained stable in France (301) and declined in Germany (142 compared to 191 in 2015).
Developing and promoting international exposure is also essential for a Group that employs 64.5% of its engineers and managers outside Western Europe and carries out 78% of its recruitments outside this region. Within this framework, Faurecia can offer its people many international assignments as well as the opportunity to take part in international projects.
8.2.1.2. On neighboring or local populations
Faurecia's ambition is to purchase materials as close as possible to its sites in order to help develop local industry, and minimize the associated impacts (logistical, environmental, etc.). For

purchases of mass-produced parts, the percentage of purchases made locally is between 89% and 95% depending on the location of Faurecia's production sites.

8.2.2. FAURECIA'S STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

8.2.2.1. How the Company communicates with these persons or groups
Faurecia has developed and maintains the conditions and tools for dialog with a number of interested parties or stakeholders in its business.
FAURECIA AND ITS RESEARCH PARTNERS
To support technological development and innovation, Faurecia carries out an open policy towards academia, research laboratories and start-ups.
Thus, Faurecia makes use of five chairs in manufacturing involving universities in France and Germany and a partnership with Fraunhofer ICT in mechanical electronics, composites, production processes for metal parts, and plastic materials chemistry including biomass and assembly lines. In France, Faurecia is also actively engaged in the work of the technological research institutes known as IRTs, all certified by the French government as part of its "Investment for the Future" program, such as the IRT Jules Verne in Nantes, where Faurecia represents the French automotive industry, and the IRT M2P in Metz.
In 2016, Faurecia developed a start-up research and assessment activity on a world level to detect technological innovations.
Other partnerships are presented in Section 7.2.4 of this Registration Document.
FAURECIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
Faurecia bases its growth on socially responsible actions and behavior across all ts businesses and all the countries in which the Group has its plants, suppliers and sub-contractors. In view of this, Faurecia builds close, long-term relationships with its suppliers, based on mutual growth and benefit. Faurecia believes that the principles of social, environmental and economic responsibility are critical criteria for the award of contracts to its suppliers.
Great importance is placed on communication and transparency to ensure strategic alignment with partners. Conventions are regularly held, with the official presentation of performance awards in different areas (Quality, Innovation, CSR ­ Corporate Social Responsibility, etc.). Faurecia has close relationships with its suppliers and organizes Strategic Supplier meetings, in which attendees share and discuss strategies to be pursued to strengthen mutual development, and Innovation days aimed at exploring, identifying, promoting and developing new innovation ideas.
As described in Section 8.2.3, Faurecia assesses the reliability of its suppliers not only in terms of product quality, but also in terms of meeting corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria (see Section 8.1.2.5).

Faurecia thus communicates with its suppliers and subcontractors to raise their awareness of sustainability issues. As such, the Suppliers section of the Faurecia website has a page devoted exclusively to information and requirements in terms of compliance by its current and potential partners with the Group's "CSR" criteria.
FAURECIA AND ITS CUSTOMERS
Faurecia has very close relationships with virtually all major global automakers. It also works closely with its customers to develop the design and functionality of the product range on offer.
The research and innovation unit thus covers upstream activities prior to program acquisitions. This Unit is critical to enabling the Group to provide an appealing and competitive offering to its customers, which it achieves by designing new products and technologies, as well as researching and developing generic products and processes.
The program engineering unit covers vehicle applications. This downstream unit is responsible for ensuring that programs are completed within the required time-frames, cost and quality levels.
Vehicle application programs follow a unique process, bringing together all the participants needed to develop and launch a new, mass-produced product. The Program Management System (PMS) process, describes all the requirements at each phase of the program. Every program is given periodic interim reviews, first by specialists and then at the close of each phase by management, so that its progress can be seen.
The PMS consists of five phases:
c obtain and validate customer needs;
c develop the product;
c test the product and develop the manufacturing process;
c plan and validate production machinery;
c ramp up line speeds and launch mass production.
To track performance throughout the development process and steer it towards excellence, Faurecia has introduced the idea of program management excellence. This new approach involves the foregoing elements plus:
c system audits of the program requirements to ensure disciplined implementation;
c performance indicators, reviewed monthly, to signal future risks.
These various tools have made it possible to significantly improve such programs' performance financially and in terms of quality, lead times and launches of mass production.

In addition, Faurecia's production sites regularly receive awards from their customers.
FAURECIA AND ITS INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL PARTNERS
Faurecia is always looking to develop new partnerships and strengthen existing ones.
On November 29, 2016, Faurecia announced the signature of a joint venture with Borgward, the German premium automaker, with the creation of a joint venture in China, "Borgward Faurecia (Tianjin) Automotive Systems Co., Ltd" to develop and produce the full range of automobile seat components and the creation of a technical center for product development, after sales and technical support.
In Iran, Faurecia also signed:
c on October 2, 2016, a joint venture agreement with Azin Khodro, an Iranian partner, resulting in the creation of the joint venture "Azin Faurecia Interior Systems Company (AFISCo)" to develop and produce instrument panels, door panels, central consoles and interior acoustics for vehicle interior systems, with production due to be launched in early 2018;
c on December 2, 2016, a joint venture agreement with MAAD, an Iranian partner, resulting in the creation of a joint venture "Faurecia Crouse Advanced Exhaust System Co.". This joint venture will develop and produce emissions control systems for the Iranian automobile market, with production due to start at the beginning of 2017.
The existing Iranian joint venture "Faurecia Automotive Parts Seating Company (FAPSCO)" will extend its activities to complete seats, seat structures and covers in the country beyond its current customer, Renault, to serve Peugeot, Iran Khodro and other automakers.
Faurecia's three businesses are now present in Iran through these three joint ventures.
To become a connectivity player, on December 6, 2016, Faurecia also announced that it is in exclusive negotiations to create a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, one of the leaders in connectivity and infotainment solutions for the automobile industry, in order to develop applications and platforms for connected vehicles. The completion of this project could lead Faurecia to progressively take control of Parrot Automotive, through an initial stake of 20% in the capital stock, and by 2022, ownership of all Parrot Automotive's shares.
Lastly, on December 13, 2016, Faurecia announced that it had increased its stake in the Danish Company, "Amminex" with which it has worked closely since mid-2009 to 91.5% from 42% held previously. Amminex has developed an ammonia storage and diffusion system (ASDSTM) which has shown its effectiveness in eliminating nitrogen oxide (NOx) in diesel engines. Faurecia intends to intensify the development of this technology both for commercial and personal vehicles. Faurecia is also seriously looking into other applications for ASDSTM,

such as for agricultural vehicles, earthmoving machinery and the high-power engines used in boats and ships.
FAURECIA AND THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY
All of Faurecia's shareholders are given full, clear and transparent information which is tailored to their specific needs and provides them with an objective view of the Group's growth strategy and earnings performance. This financial communication policy is aimed at ensuring that all shareholders have access to the information required in accordance with customary market practice.
A wide variety of documents is made available to the public, including regulated information, covering all of the Group's business activities, its strategy and financial information including the Registration Document, interim financial reports, the bylaws and the internal rules of Faurecia's Board of Directors. All these documents are readily accessible on the Group's website www.faurecia.com, in French and English, and upon request from Faurecia's Investor Relations department. Shareholders can also automatically receive documents, such as the annual report, corporate brochures and press releases, through a free subscription service by e-mailing shareholders@ faurecia.com.
Faurecia regularly publishes the annual and period disclosures required by regulations for listed companies in the French legal gazette, the BALO (Bulletin des annonces légales obligatoires). This information is supplemented by press releases for both the financial community and the general public regarding matters that are of major importance in understanding the Company's strategy. In addition, periodic meetings are held on an interactive basis with financial analysts and business journalists in order to give updates on the Group's goals, products and results.
In 2016, Faurecia organized over 450 large-scale and individual meetings in 19 countries, which allowed for direct dialog to take place with nearly 1,000 institutional investors and financial analysts. Themed presentations were also organized for analysts, investors and asset managers.
Shareholders also have a dedicated area on the Faurecia intranet where they can find out about the Group's employee savings plan.
Annual reports presented and filed as Registration Documents with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) and interim financial reports are broadly circulated within the financial community.
FAURECIA AND CERTIFICATION BODIES
Amongst these objectives, the Group asked its Business Groups to start implementing the actions required to obtain ISO 14001 certification for the production sites.
In 2016, this environmental management approach for production sites progressed: 79.5% of the sites are now certified compared to 75.3% in 2015. Seven new plants were certified

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

Faurecia and sustainable development

Societal action

during the reporting year. The new version of the ISO 14001 standard, published in 2015, has already been introduced within 10 sites of Faurecia Seating, 4 sites of Faurecia Clean Mobility and 12 sites of Faurecia Interiors. Through this certification, Faurecia commits to meeting its customers' requirements and to show its environmental performance.
In addition to its plants, thirty-eight JIT and R&D sites are ISO 14001 certified.
In addition, the implementation of an energy management system commits the sites to acquiring increased skills to identify potential energy savings on their sites, both in terms of machine and equipment performance or the site's daily operating modalities. Ten sites are certified or in the process of being certified ISO 50001.
FAURECIA AND THE EDUCATION SECTOR
In the many countries in which the Group operates, Faurecia has established privileged partnerships with schools, universities and other higher education establishments, whose geographical locations and training offer best meet its requirements. Alumni of these institutions, now working for Faurecia play a key role in communicating on the Group's internship opportunities and possible career paths to students. Faurecia also takes part in numerous events for students around the world every year, including student rallies, job fairs, presentations of the Group's business activities at schools and various types of workshops and case studies. The Group also organizes a number of visits to its sites each year to introduce its business activities to students.
Lastly, some countries have put in place specific programs to support the integration of young graduates hired to their first job within the Group: the STAR program in Germany, the "Fresh Graduates" program in China and the VIE international corporate volunteer program offered to young graduates or professionals from France and other EU countries are just a few examples.
8.2.2.2. Partnerships or sponsorship
Around the world, Faurecia's sites and employees frequently take part in many community-based initiatives. The Group has listed all these programs under a common banner: FUELS ("Faurecia Unites its Employees around Local Soldarity actions").

The FUELS program was created in North America in 2010, where it first took the form of an annual food collection. Given the success in the United States, Canada and Mexico, Faurecia extended the program to other countries where the Group operates.
Rolled-out at Group level, the program was also expanded to include more local economic, social and cultural issues.
In 2016, 14 FUELS campaigns were carried out in ten countries worldwide, and in total, Faurecia's sites launched over 25 other corporate initiatives. The main causes defended are as follows:
c Aid to children: There are many programs and campaigns, such as collections of toys, clothes and school supplies and donations or volunteer lessons. Some actions can be outlined: the Green IT classrooms in China that have equipped classes with computers, bottle top collections in Spain, and bicycle races in Mexico (Night Race) to help children with serious or rare pathologies.
c Fight against hunger: this is the cornerstone of the FUELS programs and one of the causes that mobilizes the most people, with the targets exceeded each year. Faurecia's employees help local food banks to collect and distribute meals; they team up with local farmers to provide low-cost fresh produce and make donations to purchase meals for disadvantaged families. The participating countries are France, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United States, Canada and India.
c Health promotion: this theme, which is often cross-cutting with the other campaigns, goes hand in hand with improving living conditions for the most disadvantaged people in other areas, such as poverty and the environment. The sites help collect and give funds to support medical institutions in fighting against rare diseases and cancer, and to raise awareness of public health problems. The participating countries are Germany, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Poland.
Other initiatives, not described in this section, have been implemented in the areas of education, gender equality, medical research and awareness raising in environmental issues.

8.2.3. SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS

8.2.3.1. The inclusion of social and environmental issues in the purchasing policy
Faurecia's Code of Ethics, the operational principles of which are outlined in Section 8.2.4.1, defines the behavioral principles that apply daily to all Faurecia staff in their internal and external relations and to its partners, and sets out the way the Group intends to put into practice its values of respect for customers, shareholders, employees and the environment.
The roll-out of the sustainable purchasing policy, "Buy Beyond", launched by Faurecia Interiors in 2013, continued in 2016 within the Group's Purchasing teams. Accordingly, as mentioned in Section 8.2.2.1, Faurecia is committed to basing its growth on socially responsible actions and behavior across all of its businesses and in all countries where the Group has internal and external operations. In view of this, Faurecia is committed to building close, long-term relationships with its suppliers, based on mutual growth and benefit.
Faurecia believes that the principles of social, environmental and economic responsibility are major criteria for the award of contracts to its suppliers. It is essential for Faurecia that its suppliers meet standards of behavior that are consistent with and reflect its own commitments.
Consequently, the Company requires its suppliers to comply with the responsible purchasing policy, through the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Subcontractors, implemented by Faurecia in 2013, in their own organization and global supply chain. Supplier quality audits, which are a prerequisite to joining Faurecia's panel of suppliers also include CSR issues.
This Code of Conduct is systematically integrated in the mandatory consultation documents sent to suppliers. Faurecia has strengthened its "Buy Beyond" responsible purchasing policy to ensure its wider deployment and to promote compliance with the Code of Conduct among its suppliers. Building on its success within Faurecia Interiors, this approach is being further rolled-out by all the Group's Purchasing teams, as well as its suppliers. In order to integrate sustainability into their processes, each team sought the assistance of an external CSR partner in order to better understand, verify and optimize

the practices of its suppliers in terms of social, environmental and economic responsibility. This external assessment of CSR compliance by the Group's suppliers, which is in keeping with the organization and requirements laid down in the Code of Conduct, also ascertains compliance with REACH and conflict minerals regulations. At the end of 2016, Faurecia Interiors evaluated the CSR performance of over 850 suppliers, representing 90% of its direct purchases, and around 300 additional suppliers were assessed by the other Business Groups
These assessments are incorporated into the purchasing process, are routinely taken into account in the award of contracts and are also included in the criteria for performance evaluation of suppliers.
Faurecia is also training its Purchasing and Supplier Quality teams, who are tasked with the implementation of the responsible purchasing policy, which involves both training efforts focusing on internal purchasing teams as well as monitoring progress made on CSR issues by suppliers. Faurecia Interiors has implemented ambitious improvement targets in CSR maturity for its partners and supports them in drafting and monitoring their action plans whilst providing support to achieve them.
The "Buy Beyond" purchasing policy is one of the strategic focuses to accelerate value creation and competitiveness, and within Faurecia Interiors, compliance with this purchasing policy and its scoring with the external partners is now mandatory before awarding contracts.
With respect to diversity, in North America (USA and Canada), Faurecia has integrated diversity management within its purchasing policy, thus responding to the growing demand from its customers to expand job opportunities to company-creating women and minorities. A diversity management department was created in 2011 to reinforce Faurecia North America's efforts in this area. Its main objective is to increase the use of certified companies, either managed by minorities (MBE certified) or women (WBE certified) and to offer them genuine opportunities for growth and expansion. In return, this policy enables Faurecia to meet the expectations of its customers in terms of diversity. The diversity of its suppliers comes under the "partnership" category and is one of the assessment criteria used by its customers.

8.2.3.2. The extent of subcontracting and the inclusion in dealings with suppliers and subcontractors of their social and environmental responsibility
The fundamental commitments demanded of Faurecia's suppliers relate to compliance with laws and responsible supply chain management, as illustrated in the diagram below:

Environment
Environmental policy Innovation and product life cycle
Presentation of resources Prohibited substances
Reduction of CO2 emissions

Society
No child labour No forced labour
Fair wages Appropriate work hours
Non-discrimination Freedom of association
Health and safety

Economy
Total ban on corruption Transparency and good faith
in commercial practices

Substance management systems have also been put in place across the entire supply chain, from suppliers to manufacturing customers, for all products delivered by Faurecia. Among other benefits, this approach gives the Group access to complete information on the substances entering into its products, in order to ensure that all actors in the supply chain comply with regulatory frameworks on chemicals and their safe use, such as the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) regulation and that relating to conflict minerals. The Group constantly monitors regulatory developments relating to substances and works to prepare compliance with regulations due to enter into effect that will have an impact on its business activities around the world, sharing this information and related recommendations with all its entities.

For instance, Faurecia Interiors is currently pursuing an anticipatory approach to the identification and sharing of information within the supply chain on chemicals or constituents that may be impacted, based on a list of chemicals or constituents considered as potentially of concern for its products and their use. Apart from REACH, this approach is also applied in connection with Faurecia's responses to the annual questionnaires received from its customers relating to the producers and countries of origin of minerals covered by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank law on conflict minerals.
Change in subcontracting is quantified by indicators provided in Section 5.6 of this Registration Document.

8.2.4. FAIR PRACTICES

8.2.4.1. Action to prevent corruption
Faurecia is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact. Consequently, the Group is committed to aligning its operations and strategy with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment, and anticorruption. This commitment is reaffirmed in Faurecia's Code of Ethics. This Code, created in 2005 and revised in 2007, was updated in 2014 as part of the Being Faurecia program intended to reinforce the Group's culture, thus contributing to the creation of long-term value. The Code of Management, which was

established at that time to guide the day-to-day management of teams, customers, suppliers, etc., translated many of the principles set out in the Code of Ethics into operations. Each new employee receives a copy of the Code, which is available in the Group's main working languages and may also be accessed on the Group's corporate websites and intranet sites.
It is part of the Faurecia Core Procedures (FCP), and aims to develop the accountability and involvement of Group employees. During Internal Audits, auditors systematically check that everyone working at the plant is familiar with the Code.

Societal action

This Code is structured around four themes: compliance with fundamental rights, fostering economic and social dialog, building skills, ethics and rules of conduct. It also includes an alert procedure if the Code of Ethics is breached.
OVERVIEW OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF CONDUCT
Use of funds, services or Group assets
Any funding of political activity is forbidden, as are any unlawful payments to public authorities or officials. Assets, liabilities, expenses and other transactions made by Group entities must be recorded in the books and financial statements of these entities, and should be kept truthfully and accurately, in accordance with the applicable principles, rules and laws.
Relationships with customers, providers or suppliers
Acceptance of gifts and entertainment from customers and/or suppliers is subject to limits. As such, it is prohibited to accept any gift or gratuity from customers or contractors worth over 100 per year and per business partner, regardless of type.
Furthermore, the payment of any amount in cash, in kind or otherwise to any customer or supplier representative in order to obtain either a contract or a business or financial advantage is prohibited.
The selection of suppliers must be based on quality, need, performance and cost. As stated in the current Purchasing procedures, agreements between the Group and its authorized representatives, agents and consultants or any other contractor must clearly state the actual products/services to be supplied, the basis for compensation or price and all other terms and conditions. This rule also prohibits any investment in suppliers and any purchase of property or service from providers or customers for personal use.
Compliance with competition law
Faurecia aims to adhere strictly to the applicable regulations in all the countries where it operates, including the prohibition of reaching agreements, deals, plans, arrangements or coordinated conduct between competitors in respect of prices, territories, market shares or customers.
Confidentiality
This rule covers both the confidentiality of personal information of employees and that of the assets, documents and data of Faurecia.
Loyalty and exclusivity
It is incumbent on employees and executives of the Group to exercise their work contract faithfully.

Conflicts of interest
Employees shall not draw any personal advantage from a transaction carried out on behalf of a Group company, notably with customers and suppliers.
An employee must also not attempt to select or organize the selection of a company, in particular as a supplier, in which either the employee, an associate or a family member has, directly or indirectly, a financial interest.
Safeguarding Group assets
Group employees and managers are responsible for the proper use of the assets and resources of the Group, including those related to intellectual property, technology, equipment and computer media, software, real estate, equipment, machinery and tools, components, raw materials and liquidities.
WHISTLE-BLOWING PROCEDURE
The Code provides a mechanism for the purpose of managing violations.
Any employee who becomes aware of a breach of the rules set out in the Code may use an internal alert procedure; they may refer to their line manager or HR Director verbally or in writing.
Depending on the nature and importance of the events reported, additional investigations may be launched, an inquiry may be set up or an Internal Audit decided upon.
A strengthened alert procedure can also be launched if the events relate to serious risks for the Group in terms of accounting or financial aspects and anti-corruption efforts. Events which jeopardize the physical or moral integrity of an employee may also be included in the scope of this procedure, which involves an outside body being brought in which the Group has tasked with gathering data and beginning procedures.
If circumstances warrant, the organization contacts the Faurecia group's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who can ask the Group's Chief Compliance Officer to carry out the necessary investigations.
In May 2015, to further strengthen its measures in place to minimize the risk of corruption, Faurecia's Executive Committee indeed decided to create a new Compliance department. This department is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who oversees a network of regional Compliance Officers and other compliance experts within the sales and operating divisions of the Business Groups. The Compliance department's role is to enhance familiarity with the contents of the Code of Ethics and the Management Code within Faurecia. To date, the Compliance department has launched the deployment of an "Ethics" MOOC on the Faurecia "Managers and Professionnals" (M&Ps) community.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

Faurecia and sustainable development

Societal action

Practical guides relating to the disclosure and management of conflicts of interest as well as the internal alert procedure on perceived violations of the Code of Ethics have been distributed via the network of compliance experts. In addition, training sessions were organized at the industrial sites and at the level of Business Group divisions in connection with the verification assignments carried out by the Internal Audit team. Lastly, a mapping of non-compliance risks was prepared and will be included in Faurecia's overall risk mapping process. The Compliance department will coordinate the management of non-compliance risks.
8.2.4.2. Measures taken benefiting the health and safety of consumers
The main trends that impact automobiles are the urbanization of populations, the reduction in the consumption and the diversification of energy resources, changes in mobility, connectivity, consumer protection and health and the increased role of women in society. Faurecia takes these "mega" trends into account; most of the time they are translated into the automobile industry through the reduction in consumption and emissions, including electrification, connectivity and autonomous vehicles.
Vehicles are becoming living spaces in which users expect comfort, quality and seamless connectivity with their personal and professional environments.
Faurecia is a supplier of components that play an important role in passive safety and thus help save lives or limit injuries to drivers or passengers. Seats help provide about 80% of rear impact protection, about 30 to 40% for frontal impacts and, depending on the automaker, and between 30% and 80% for side impacts. The instrument panel incorporates all the issues relating to the deployment of airbags. In the area of pedestrian impacts, bumpers make a decisive contribution in efforts to limit injuries, by devoting attention both to their intrinsic characteristics and to the kinematics of the impact sequence.

Over the years, Faurecia has taken position as a key partner for automakers in this area, initially by emphasizing the importance of safety and then by developing products and expertise that allow the Group to devote research efforts, in a measured and confident manner, to all anticipated changes. Each link in the safety chain is associated with design rules that guarantee the system's performance and its longevity.
The Cockpit of the Future project evoked in Section 7.2.3. strengthens the need to treat internal vehicle security as a new system that Faurecia needs to manage through selected partnerships, with the aim of advancing solutions linked to new interior configurations and the associated uses.
Faurecia also takes part in working groups on VIAQ (Vehicle Interior Air Quality) at the United Nations level, in collaboration with manufacturer representatives; these groups aim to monitor the health of people on-board and continuously improve Faurecia's and the automobile industry's knowledge in measurement methodologies and the impact of Group products present inside vehicles.
Research and development projects undertaken and the consideration of environmental issues in product design are described at length in Chapter 7 and Section 8.1.1 of this Registration Document.
In general, and in accordance with its Code of Ethics relating to fundamental rights, the Group is committed to promoting health and safety at work by implementing policies and methods of active prevention of risks liable to affect the health and safety of employees, to regular monitoring of their proper implementation and to measuring their effectiveness.
In this context, it is particularly committed to empowering its managers and staff in the preservation of health and the prevention of occupational accidents and to organizing the design and development of its products and means of production with a view to achieving the best possible working conditions. All subcontractors working on the premises of Group companies are required to implement these health and safety policies and comply with all applicable local legislation.

8.2.5. OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
The Code of Ethics contains a number of rules on fundamental rights. These rules are described in Section 5.3.3 of this Registration Document.

9 Corporate governance Board of Directors

9.1. Board of Directors

Section 9.1.1. and Section 9.4 constitute the Chairman's report as stipulated by Article L. 225-37 of the French Code of commerce.
In accordance with this Article the aim of the report, prepared by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is to provide an account of the Board's membership, the conditions governing the preparation and organization of its work during 2016, and the internal control and risk management procedures introduced by Faurecia.
The report also indicates any restrictions applied by the Board of Directors to the powers exercised by the Chief Executive Officer and refers to the principles and rules defined by the Board in order to determine the compensation and benefits of the corporate officers, the rules governing the participation of shareholders in Annual Shareholders' Meetings, factors that may be relevant in the event of a tender offer, as well as the

financial risks associated with the impact of climate change and the related reduction measures undertaken by the Company by using a low carbon strategy across its business activities.
It was prepared and drafted in accordance with the law of July 3, 2008 which amended various provisions of French corporate law to align them with European Community law and the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code applicable to listed companies, which the Board of Directors has adopted as its reference framework and which can be viewed on the Medef's website (www.medef.fr).
Lastly, this report was reviewed by the Governance Committee and the Audit Committee at their April 5 and 7, 2017 meetings, was approved by the Board of Directors at its April 11, 2017 meeting and was included in the Registration Document.

9.1.1. MEMBERS, CONDITIONS FOR THE PREPARATION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

9.1.1.1. Composition of the Board of Directors
Pursuant to the applicable laws, regulations and bylaws, the Board of Directors must be made up of at least 3 and at most 15 members.

* As of December 31, 2016. ** This table reflects the participation of Board members in the existing Faurecia committees as of December 31, 2016. *** For details on the situation of each Board member with respect to the independence criteria set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, see the table in
Section 9.1.1.1.2 hereafter

The Board of Directors brings together major managerial, industrial, and financial expertise. Board members contribute to the work and deliberations of the Board of Directors and specialized committees through their diverse experience in the automobile industry and other economic sectors in which the Group does not operate. They also bring their international experience to the Group. They act in the best interests of all shareholders and are fully involved in defining Faurecia's corporate strategy so that they can actively and effectively contribute to and support the decisions of the Board.

The business address of Board members is that of Faurecia.
Neither the bylaws nor the internal rules of the Board of Directors contain rules for staggered terms of office.
The Board has no non-voting Board member.
Information on the expertise and experience of the corporate officers and details of their terms of office and other positions held by them are provided later in this Chapter 9.

9 Corporate governance Board of Directors

9.1.1.1.1. CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
2016 was marked by a major change in the Group's governance, namely the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer as from July 1, 2016.
This change is the result of a process initiated at the Board of Directors meeting of July 23, 2015, which adopted the principle of segregation of duties in accordance with Article 17 of the of the Company's bylaws.
At its April 13, 2016 meeting the Board of Directors subsequently resolved to appoint Yann Delabrière, who had served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since February 16, 2007, as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Patrick Koller, who had served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer since February 2, 2015, as Chief Executive Officer, with both appointments effective as from July 1, 2016.
Patrick Koller, who currently is not a Board member, participates in all Board of Directors meetings by the Board decision of February 11, 2015. His appointment as a Board member will be submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 30, 2017.
Given the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer effective as from July 1, 2016, the internal rules of the Board of Directors were revised to reflect, among others, this new governance structure.
Under the terms of this document, the Chairman's role is defined as follows:
The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the effective operation of the Board and its committees, in accordance with good governance principles.
The Chairman must:
c promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance across the Group, particularly at Board level thus ensuring the effectiveness thereof;
c manage the relations between Board members and the Chairs of the committees and, in this respect:
c promote effective working relations and open communication, and foster en environment that encourages constructive discussions and the sharing of information between Board members and the Chief Executive Officer, during and outside meetings,
c lead and govern the Board so as to create the conditions required for the overall effectiveness of the Board and its members, and ensure that all key and relevant issues are adequately prepared and discussed by the Board of Directors and the various committees in a timely fashion,
c schedule and set the agenda of the Board meetings, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board, to take full account of the

Group's major challenges and issues raised by Board members, and ensure that sufficient time is devoted to thoroughly discuss significant and strategic matters,
c address any conflicts of interest,
c conduct, with the help of the Governance Committee, assessments of the Board of Directors, searches for new Board members and their induction program;
c organize, with the help of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairs of the various committees, the preparation of and chair Annual Shareholders' Meetings, oversee the relations and ensure effective communication with shareholders;
c manage the relationship with the Chief Executive Officer:
c act as a competent advisor for the Chief Executive Officer on all issues regarding the interests and management of the Company,
c ensure that the strategies and policies adopted by the Board are effectively implemented by the Chief Executive Officer; without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Board of Directors and its committees, the Chairman is regularly kept informed by the Chief Executive Officer on all significant events concerning the Company's strategy, in line with the objectives set by the Board of Directors, as well as on major external growth projects, significant financial transactions, societal actions, or appointments of Business Group managers and other key positions within the Company. The Chairman receives from the Chief Executive Officer all information necessary to coordinate the work of the Board of Directors and its committees;
c coordinate or conduct specific projects. In particular, at the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman may represent the Company before stakeholders, public authorities, financial institutions, major shareholders and/or key business partners.
9.1.1.1.2. INDEPENDENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As a reminder, the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which Faurecia follows, provides that at least one third of Board members must be independent in companies with controlling shareholders and half of the Board in other companies, at least two thirds of the members of the Audit Committee must be independent, and the committees responsible for appointments and compensation must have a majority of independent Board members.
As will be detailed below, the composition of the Board and committees of Faurecia is consistent with these recommendations.
Pursuant to the Code, a Board member is independent when they have no relation of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its Group or its management which might compromise the exercise of their free judgment.

Board of Directors

Independence criteria provided for in the Code and reflected in the internal rules of the Board of Directors are as follows:
c not be or have been, in the past five years, an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company; an employee, executive corporate officer or Board member of a company directly or indirectly holding over 10% of its capital stock; an employee, executive corporate officer or Board member of a consolidated subsidiary;
c not be an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds the office of Board member or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (currently or who has held such an office for less than five years) holds the office of Board member;
c not have a business relationship with Faurecia that would represent a significant business activity with the company or the group in which the Board member has an executive management position;
c not have close family ties with a corporate officer;

c not have been the Company's Statutory Auditor in the past five years; and
c not be a Company Board member for more than 12 years.
The Board of Directors, based on the Governance Committee's report, reviews the independence status of each of its members at least once a year and the independence of each new member upon their appointment.
At its meeting of December 21, 2016 and on the recommendation of the Governance Committee which met at the same date, the Board decided that the business relationship condition should be examined using a multi-criteria approach including a qualitative analysis which will be detailed in the Registration Document when necessary.
At its meeting of February 8, 2017 and on the recommendation of the Governance Committee which met on February 6, 2017, the Board of Directors reviewed the situation of each of its members based on the AFEP-MEDEF Code's independence criteria. It used the multi-criteria approach, including a qualitative analysis, in order to assess the business relationship condition.

Board of Directors

9.1.1.1.3. GENDER BALANCE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As of December 31, 2016 the Board of Directors had five women members.
As of that date, the composition of the Board was therefore consistent with the provisions on balanced representation of men and women on Boards of Directors under the AFEPMEDEF Code and the law of January 27, 2011 on the balanced representation of men and women on Boards of Directors and professional equality.
At their Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 30, 2017, the shareholders will be invited to vote on the appointment of an additional woman Board member.
9.1.1.1.4. REPRESENTATION OF EMPLOYEES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As of December 31, 2016, the Board had no members representing employee shareholders or any other employees.
However, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 30, 2017 will be asked to approve an amendment to the bylaws to include a procedure to appoint Board members representing employees, in accordance with Article L. 225-27-1 of the French Code of commerce introduced by the French Employment Protection Act of June 14, 2013 as amended by the French Employment and Labor Relations Act of August 17, 2015.
9.1.1.2. Roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors
In accordance with current legal and statutory provisions, the Board of Directors is a collective body that determines the Company's business strategy and oversees its implementation. Subject to the powers expressly granted to Annual Shareholders' Meetings and within the scope of the Company's purpose, it deals with all matters regarding the proper operation of the Company and settles matters concerning it through its decisions. The Chairman consults it on all Company and Group strategic decisions.
The Board's internal rules detail the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its committees. They describe the roles of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board. They detail the Board's modus operandi and specify that its work must be assessed on an annual basis. The internal rules specify the rights and responsibilities of Board members, particularly regarding the prevention of conflicts of interest, the holding of multiple offices, and the need for strict confidentiality in deliberations as well as diligence when taking part in the Board's work.
Given the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer effective as from July 1, 2016, the internal rules of the Board were revised

to reflect, among others, the new governance structure. This new version that has been applied since July 1, 2016 is made available to the shareholders at the Company's registered office and also online at www.faurecia.com.
The internal rules provide for the following tasks to be performed by the Board of Directors:
c determination of strategic directions:
c determination and control of the implementation of decisions concerning the Company's main economic, social, financial, and technological strategies.
The medium-term direction of the Group's activities is defined by a strategic plan. The draft of this plan is prepared and presented by the Chief Executive Officer before being adopted by the Board of Directors.
In addition, as part of internal procedures, the Chief Executive Officer must obtain approval from the Board of Directors before carrying out any acquisition, disposal, or joint venture project representing a total asset value of over 100 million and/or with sales in excess of 300 million. Likewise, any significant transaction that is not included in the Company's strategic plan must be approved by the Board beforehand;
c governance and management:
c review of governance structure: determination of Faurecia's executive management procedures, creation of committees of the Board of Directors, appointment of their members, determination of their tasks and operating procedures,
c co-optation of and proposals to appoint or reappoint Board members, appointment or reappointment of the Chairman,
c compensation for the Chairman and Board members,
c governance assessment: work of the Board and its committees; review of the independence of Board members,
c appointment or reappointment of the Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officers and determination of their compensation,
c implementation of stock option plans, performance share plans and any other type of long-term compensation, and approval of beneficiaries thereof,
c authorization of agreements and commitments regulated under the French regulations,
c notice prior to the acceptance of a new term of office in a listed company by an executive corporate officer,
c authorization of sureties, endorsements and guarantees, allocation of an annual amount of sureties to be issued by the Chief Executive Officer and determination of the terms and conditions thereof;

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

113

9 Corporate governance Board of Directors

c financial statements and relations with Statutory Auditors:
c approval of the annual parent company financial statements and annual and interim consolidated financial statements and preparation of the Company management and Group management reports,
c verification of the relevance, consistency and proper application of the accounting methods used to prepare the financial statements,
c monitoring of the process for preparing the financial information,
c selection of the Statutory Auditors whose appointment will be submitted for shareholder approval at the Shareholders' Meeting, and verification of compliance with the rules that guarantee their independence especially regarding the amount of their compensation;
c internal control and risk management:
c monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems,
c support to the Chairman in the preparation of the Chairman's report on the internal control procedures implemented by the Company.
In this respect, risk monitoring and control are reviewed at least annually following a presentation by the Audit Committee;
c budget and planning:
c approval of the annual budget,
c periodic review of the Group's business and of budget execution,
c approval of planning items and related reports;
c financial position, financing and security issues:
c quarterly review of the Group's financial and cash position as well as contingent liabilities,
c decision to carry out complex bond and other security issues that are not likely to involve a capital increase, as well as share issues under the authority delegated by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting,
c carrying out transactions impacting the capital under the authority delegated by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting;
c Annual Shareholders' Meeting:
c convening Annual Shareholders' Meetings and setting the agenda.

9.1.1.3 Organization of the work of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets at least four times per year, as provided by the bylaws, to discuss the agenda items listed by the Chairman. The Chairman convenes the Board meetings and communicates their agendas.
The Chief Executive Officer attends Board of Directors meetings.
By way of exception, the Board of Directors meets at least once per year without the Chief Executive Officer in attendance to assess the performance thereof and discuss governance issues.
Sufficient time must be devoted during each Board meeting to usefully and thoroughly discuss the agenda items.
The Chairman, assisted by the Secretary of the Board of Directors, is responsible for communicating the information and documents required for the Board meetings to the Board members in a timely manner.
In this context, it should be noted that the Board's internal rules stipulate that each Board member must inform the Board of Directors of any situation of conflict of interest, even potential, and consequently abstain from participating in deliberations concerning them, or not attend the Board meetings while they find themselves in a situation of conflict of interest, or resign from the Board membership. In case of non-compliance with these rules of abstention or withdrawal, the Board member could be held liable. In case of conflict of interest, the Board member concerned will not receive documentation relating to the Board meeting(s) in question.
No such situations arose in 2016.
Outside their meetings, Board members receive from the Chairman important or urgent information relevant to the Company and the Group. They also receive press releases distributed by the Company.
Any additional information or document requested by a Board member is automatically communicated to all other Board members.
Such information and documents may be provided during a Board meeting should privacy or timeliness considerations so require.
In accordance with the laws, a Board member may specifically designate another Board member to represent them at Board meetings.
Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the meetings of the Board of Directors may take place by video conference or any other means of telecommunication, in particular to allow for the actual participation of Board members who are unable to attend the meetings in person.

114

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

Corporate governance

Board of Directors

In the situation referred to above:
c any Board members who attend the meeting by video conference or any other means of telecommunication are deemed present for the purposes of quorum and majority;
The Board thus duly deliberates if at least half of its members attend the meeting in person or by video conference or any other means of telecommunication;
c the video conference or any other means of telecommunication used must meet the technical specifications that guarantee the effective participation of each attendee. The deliberations must be transmitted in a continuous and simultaneous manner. Adequate arrangements are to be made for the identification of each participant and verification of the quorum; the attendance register for the meetings of the Board of Directors must mention, where applicable, the participation by video conference or any other means of telecommunication of the Board members concerned;
c the meeting minutes must indicate the name(s) of the Board member(s) participating by video conference or any other means of telecommunication. Meeting minutes must also indicate any technical incident relating to video conference or any other telecommunication means that disrupted the meeting, including any interruption and restoration of the remote participation;
c in case of a malfunction of the video conference system or means of telecommunications noted by the Chairman of the meeting, the Board of Directors may duly deliberate and/ or continue the meeting only with the members attending in person, provided that the quorum requirements are met;
c the above provisions do not apply to the adoption of the decisions referred to in Articles L. 232-1 and L. 233-16 of the French Code of commerce related, respectively, to the preparation of the parent company financial statements and management report, and the preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements and management report.
To optimize its discussions, the Board of Directors established committees in accordance with Article R. 225-29 of the French Code of commerce.
Following the assessment of the operation of the Board and its committees for 2015, at its meeting of February 10, 2016 the Board of Directors decided to dissolve the Strategy Committee as from that date, as all the Board members wished to participate in discussions on the Group's strategic directions. This does not preclude the setting up of an ad hoc committee to examine a particular issue.
In addition, at the same February 10, 2016 meeting the Board decided to reorganize the Appointments and Compensation Committee, which had a particularly high workload, into two

new committees: the Governance Committee dedicated to issues related to the composition and operation of the Board of Directors and its committees, and the Management Committee dedicated to issues related to Group managers all the way up to the Chief Executive Officer. These two committees came into force at the end of the Board meeting of July 25, 2016 which adopted the Board's internal rules.
As of December 31, 2016, the following committees were active:
c a Governance Committee, whose role is to deal with all corporate governance issues. In this respect, the committee assesses the Company's governance structure and its executive management procedures, making recommendations where necessary. It may also provide opinions at the request of other Board committees. Furthermore, the committee manages the process for appointing the Board members and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, reviews the overall amount of attendance fees and their allocation among the members, and directs the corporate governance assessment process (assessment of the work of the Board members and committees, assessment of the members' independence status);
c a Management Committee, which focuses on issues related to the selection and compensation, including long-term compensation, of the Company's Executive Management. More generally, this committee deals with issues related to the performance, selection and compensation, including longterm compensation, of the main executives of the Company (Executive Committee members, Senior Management);
c an Audit Committee whose main role is to review the process for approving the annual parent company financial statements and the annual and interim consolidated financial statements, as well as the process for preparing the financial information. It is responsible for maintaining relations with the Statutory Auditors and managing their selection and independence. It also monitors internal control and risk management procedures. The Audit Committee examines the budget, monitors its execution and reviews planning documents. Lastly, it reviews the Group's financial position and planned security issues.
These committees have a purely internal role in preparing some of the Board's deliberations. They issue proposals, opinions, and recommendations within their field of competence.
Each committee has its own internal rules approved by the Board of Directors which sets their composition, membership rules and operating procedures, and specific roles.
The committees report on their work to the Board of Directors after each meeting and perform a self-assessment of their activities on an annual basis.

Board of Directors

9.1.1.4.1 THE BOARD'S WORK IN 2016
In 2016, the Board of Directors met six times with an attendance rate of 93%.
At each of its meetings, the Board of Directors took note of the Group's operating results, business perspectives, and results.
The topics specifically discussed at each of these meetings were as follows:
c At its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the 2015 parent company and consolidated financial statements and decided to propose the payment of a cash dividend of 0.65 per share to the shareholders.
The Board also approved the guidance for 2016.
In this context, it further approved the wording of the press release announcing the earnings for fiscal 2015, and the business and results outlook for fiscal 2016.
It approved a 700 million bond issue in March 2016, as well as the implementation of the share buy-back program authorized by the sixth resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 27, 2016. A total number of 800,000 shares were bought back under this authorization.
The Board reviewed the Company's strategic projects, including potential investments in start-ups developing new technologies.
A number of governance issues were submitted to the Board for consideration.
It approved the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's variable compensation for 2015, the criteria to determine the variable component of his compensation for 2016 and its fixed compensation for 2016.
The Board also approved the Deputy Chief Executive Officer's fixed compensation for 2016 and the criteria to determine the variable component of his compensation for 2016.
The Board discussed the results of the assessment of its work and that of its committees for 2015 and as a result it decided to reorganize its committees as described earlier in this document.
With specific regard to strategy review, it was decided, based on the results of this assessment, that the Board would continue to review the Company's strategic financial plan at its July meeting, the October meeting would remain dedicated to strategy but with heightened emphasis on the Group's strategy in relation to each Business Group, and the major development trends for automotive technologies would be discussed during that same meeting. Furthermore, it was decided that the April meeting of the Board would offer the opportunity to review an interim report on strategy.
Lastly, the Board decided to submit the appointment of Olivia Larmaraud and Michel de Rosen as new Board members for shareholder approval at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of

May 27, 2016, upon the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee.
c At its meeting of April 13, 2016, the Board of Directors examined the sales for the first quarter of 2016 and approved the wording of the related press release.
Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on December 14, 2015 with respect to the proposed sale of the Faurecia Automotive Exteriors Business Group to Plastic Omnium, the Board of Directors received a progress report thereon.
With respect to governance, as indicated above, the Board of Directors resolved to appoint Yann Delabrière, who had served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since February 16, 2007, as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Patrick Koller, who had served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer since February 2, 2015, as Chief Executive Officer, with both appointments effective as from July 1, 2016.
The Board also reviewed the independence of its members.
Furthermore, following the decisions made by the Board at its February 10, 2016 meeting to dissolve the Strategy Committee and create a Governance Committee and a Management Committee to replace the Appointments and Compensation Committee, the Board adopted the internal rules of the two new committees, reviewed the composition of all committees, including that of the Audit Committee, and resolved that these new rules and composition would be effective at the end of the Board meeting of July 25, 2016.
Based on a comparative review of a sample of CAC 40 and SBF 120 companies, the Board also resolved to review the attendance fee cap to be applied from 2016 onwards and, on the one hand, increase the amount of variable fees associated with the meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees and, on the other hand, allocate a higher amount for fixed and variable attendance fees for the Chairmen of the committees.
It adopted the 2015 Registration Document, convened a Combined General Meeting on May 27, 2016, and approved the latter's agenda and resolutions to be submitted to the shareholders for approval.
In this respect, besides the appointments of Odile Desforges, who was shortlisted by the Board of Directors at its meeting of December 16, 2015, Olivia Larmaraud and Michel de Rosen, the Board resolved to ask the Shareholders' Meeting to reappoint Linda Hasenfratz. All these appointments were to be made for four-year terms. The Board also decided to ask the shareholders for an advisory opinion on the compensation components for Yann Delabrière and Patrick Koller in accordance with the Say on Pay principle. Lastly, the Board proposed to submit a resolution for shareholder approval to allocate Company shares, either existing or to be issued, free of charge to employees and/or certain corporate officers.
Furthermore, it reviewed the regulated agreements and commitments authorized in 2015 and those authorized in previous years and remaining in effect in 2015.

In accordance with Article L. 225-37-1 of the French Code of commerce, it also reviewed professional equality and pay and was informed, in accordance with AMF recommendation No. 2013-18, that sustainable development and social and environmental responsibility within the Group had been addressed.
c The May 27, 2016 meeting of the Board of Directors, held prior to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the same date, aimed to approve the responses to the questions submitted in writing by a shareholder.
c At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the consolidated financial statements for the first-half 2016 and the interim management report, reviewed the Group's 2016-2021 strategic plan and carried out the midyear execution analysis of the 2016 budget.
Furthermore, the Board approved the guidance for the firsthalf 2016 and the press release related to these results.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The internal rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that each Board member must inform the Board of any situation of conflict of interest, even potential, relating to issues mentioned in the agenda and draw conclusions therefrom with regard to their term of office. Thus, depending on the case, he should either abstain from participating in deliberations concerning him, or not attend the Board meetings during the time he finds himself in a situation of conflict of interest, or resign from the Board membership.
No such situations arose in 2016.

Thus, to the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, no conflicts of interest had been identified between the duties of each member of the Board of Directors and of Executive Management vis-à-vis the Company in their capacity as corporate officers and their personal interests or other duties.
To the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, there were no arrangements or agreements concluded with major shareholders, customers or suppliers resulting in a member of the Board of Directors or Executive Management being appointed in that capacity.
To the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, no restriction has been agreed to by

Aside from regulated agreements, which are the subject of a report to the General Meeting, no service agreement has been entered into between a member of the Board of Directors and Faurecia or any of its subsidiaries.
The Statutory Auditors' special report on regulated agreements and commitments can be found in Section 12.5.1 of this Registration Document.
TRANSACTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES BY CORPORATE OFFICERS
By the Board of Directors' decision of April 14, 2010, the Company established a Code of Conduct for Group employees and executives who have access to insider information by virtue of their positions and offices, with provisions on the management, ownership and disclosure of such information.
This Code was amended by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 8, 2017 to take into account Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse, effective July 3, 2016.
Under the measures to prevent insider trading within the Group the Code provides, among others, for blackout periods that require corporate officers to refrain from trading in Faurecia shares during certain periods surrounding the publication

of interim results, annual results and quarterly sales. These periods are defined as follows:
c from the date of the annual December meeting of the Company's Board of Directors up to and including the third day following the announcement of Faurecia's annual results;
c within 30 calendar days prior to the announcement of interim results and up to and including the third day following the announcement;
c within 15 calendar days prior to the publication of quarterly sales and up to and including the third day following the publication.
The Code also describes the disclosure requirements for securities transactions, which apply to persons with managerial responsibilities within the meaning of the EU Regulation and to persons closely associated with them, and lists the transactions to be disclosed since the Regulation entered into force.
It points out the existence of a compliance officer ("déontologue") in the person of the Group Chief Financial Officer who, if there is doubt about the type of the planned transaction, will be responsible for issuing an opinion thereon.
It mentions the corporate officers' obligation to hold shares in registered form.
Lastly, more generally, it lists the sanctions for insider trading or disclosure of insider information, with particular reference to Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on Transparency, the Fight against Corruption and Economic Modernization.

Mr. Yann Delabrière has been the Chairman of the Board of Directors since July 1, 2016 and Mr. Patrick Koller has served as Chief Executive Officer since that date.
In 2016, the year in which the Company segregated the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2016, the annual compensation for executive corporate officers was calculated prorata temporis based on the date on which their new duties took effect.

Fixed compensation for 2016 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
By the Board of Directors' decision of February 11, 2015, Mr. Yann Delabrière's annual fixed compensation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was increased to 800,000 as from 2015. The amount has been maintained by the Board of Directors' decision of February 10, 2016.
The 2015 increase from 700,000 to 800,000 was decided upon on the following grounds:
c a review of the situation of a representative sample of listed manufacturers comparable to Faurecia revealed a significant discrepancy (more than 10%) compared to the fixed compensation paid to Mr. Delabrière;
c Mr. Yann Delabrière's fixed compensation had remained unchanged since 2011;
c the 2014 financial results reflected the implementation of a medium- and long-term strategy for Faurecia and a structure that suits this strategy.
Fixed compensation for 2016 as Chairman of the Board of Directors
As from July 1, 2016, the date on which the duties of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer were segregated, Mr. Yann Delabrière's annual fixed compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors was set at 300,000 by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016.
This compensation was established with reference to a compensation analysis conducted by an external consulting firm based on a sample of French listed companies with a segregated governance structure, and by taking into account Mr. Yann Delabrière's responsibilities as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Variable compensation for 2016 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
At its meeting of February 10, 2016 the Board laid down the rules for determining Mr. Yann Delabrière's variable compensation for 2016 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The Board decided that Mr. Yann Delabrière's total variable compensation would range from 0 to 180% of his annual fixed compensation according to the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets.
The achievement of quantitative targets gives right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of his annual fixed compensation.
The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016 are linked to the operating income and free cash flow:
c the operating income set by reference to the 2016 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The operating income will be taken into account for 40%;
c the free cash flow set by reference to the 2016 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The free cash flow will be taken into account for 60%.

Board of Directors

The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2016 budget but are not made public for confidentiality reasons.
At the same meeting and in addition to these quantitative targets, the Board of Directors defined qualitative targets:
(i) the execution of the strategy decided upon by the Board of Directors in October 2015 (50% weighting for this criterion) i.e. ensuring the development of Faurecia's technological capacities through a combination of organic and external growth; selecting and finalizing potential acquisitions ensuring increased technological capacity and creating value for shareholders; increasing investment in start-ups; and
(ii) the execution of the development plans for Asia as presented to the Board of Directors at its December 2015 meeting (50% weighting for this criterion being associated with key

indicators in relation, in particular, to levels of achievement of operating income and sales) i.e. adjusting Faurecia in China to so-called New Normal conditions with a cost structure compatible with the cost positioning of Chinese OEMs, fulfilling the ambitions of international OEMs; securing longterm profitability; developing partnerships with four major Chinese OEMs; rolling out a new method of organization in South Korea and business activities with HKMC; defining and executing the strategy in Japan and in South-East Asia.
Once all or part of the quantitative targets are achieved, the level of achievement of the qualitative targets will determine a multiplier effect of the achievement of 0.70 to 1.20 of the quantitative targets.
Therefore, if the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.

On February 8, 2017, on the recommendation of the Management Committee which met on February 1, 2017 and by applying the principles described above, the Board of Directors set Mr. Yann Delabrière's 2016 variable compensation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the period from January 1 to June 30, 2016 as follows:

Yann DELABRIÈRE
Quantitative targets From 0 to 150% of 100% of the annual fixed compensation* if the levels of achievement of these targets set with reference to the 2016 budget are reached

As regards the execution of the strategy, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017 highlighted the 2016 achievements especially the creation of a team dedicated to the Cockpit of the Future project and the launch of pre-development activities with four customers; the materialization of investments with the announcement of a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, the acquisition of a majority interest in Amminex and investments in various start-ups, including the Finnish company Tactotek.

Board of Directors

Mr. Patrick Koller's compensation Deputy Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016 Chief Executive Officer since July 1, 2016
The components of Mr. Patrick Koller's compensation due or received for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are subject to the opinion of the shareholders pursuant to the recommendation of paragraph 26 § 1 of the AFEPMEDEF Corporate Governance Code of listed corporations of November 2016 are detailed in the explanatory notes to the resolutions included in Chapter 12 of this Registration Document.
Fixed compensation for 2016 as Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Patrick Koller's annual fixed compensation as Deputy Chief Executive Officer was set at 620,000 by the Board of Directors at its meetings of December 9, 2014 and February 11, 2015.
This compensation was established with reference to a compensation analysis conducted by an external consulting firm based on a group of 20 French industrial companies comparable to Faurecia.
Fixed compensation for 2016 as Chief Executive Officer
As from July 1, 2016, the date on which the duties of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer were segregated, Mr. Patrick Koller's annual fixed compensation as Chief Executive Officer was set at 750,000 by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016.
This compensation was established with reference to a compensation analysis conducted by an external consulting firm based on a group of 20 French industrial companies comparable to Faurecia.
Variable compensation for 2016 as Deputy Chief Executive Officer
At its meeting of February 10, 2016 the Board also laid down the rules for determining Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation for 2016 as Deputy Chief Executive Officer.
The Board decided that Mr. Patrick Koller's total variable compensation would range from 0 to 144% of his annual fixed compensation according to the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets.
The achievement of quantitative targets gives right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of 80% of his annual fixed compensation.
The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016 are linked to the operating income and free cash flow:
c the operating income set by reference to the 2016 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150%

(maximum percentage) of 80% of the fixed compensation. The operating income will be taken into account for 40%;
c the free cash flow set by reference to the 2016 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of 80% of the fixed compensation. The free cash flow will be taken into account for 60%.
The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2016 budget but are not made public for confidentiality reasons.
At the same meeting and in addition to these quantitative targets, the Board of Directors defined qualitative targets:
(i) the execution of the strategy decided upon by the Board of Directors in October 2015 (25% weighting for this criterion) i.e. ensuring the development of Faurecia's technological capacities through a combination of organic and external growth; selecting and finalizing potential acquisitions ensuring increased technological capacity and creating value for shareholders; increasing investment in start-ups;
(ii) the execution of the development plans for Asia as presented to the Board of Directors at its December 2015 meeting (25% weighting for this criterion being associated with key indicators in relation, in particular, to levels of achievement of operating income and sales) i.e. adjusting Faurecia in China to so-called New Normal conditions with a cost structure compatible with the cost positioning of Chinese OEMs, fulfilling the ambitions of international OEMs; securing longterm profitability; developing partnerships with four major Chinese OEMs; rolling out a new method of organization in South Korea and business activities with HKMC; defining and executing the strategy in Japan and in South-East Asia;
(iii) the introduction of a simplified and more flexible method of organization, as presented to the Board of Directors at their December 2015 meeting, consisting of the roll out of an approach known as the Lean Functions approach within Faurecia (25% weighting for this criterion) i.e. optimization of functions to achieve internal and external benchmarks; and
(iv) the preparation of a development and succession plan for the executive team (25% weighted on this criterion) i.e. appraising the current executive team; identifying development needs; developing succession plans
Once all or part of the quantitative targets are achieved, the level of achievement of the qualitative targets will determine a multiplier effect of the achievement of 0.70 to 1.20 of the quantitative targets.
Therefore, if the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.
On February 8, 2017, on the recommendation of the Management Committee which met on February 1, 2017 and by applying the

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

9 Corporate governance Board of Directors

principles described above, the Board of Directors set Mr. Patrick Koller's 2016 variable compensation as Deputy Chief Executive Officer for the period from January 1 to June 30, 2016 as follows:

Patrick KOLLER Quantitative targets From 0 to 150% of 80% of the annual fixed compensation* if the levels of achievement of these targets set with reference to the 2016 budget are reached

As regards the execution of the strategy, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017 highlighted the 2016 achievements especially the creation of a team dedicated to the Cockpit of the Future project and the launch of pre-development activities with four customers; the materialization of investments with the announcement of a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, the acquisition of a majority interest in Amminex and investments in various start-ups, including the Finnish company Tactotek.
As regards the execution of the development plans for Asia, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017, formally noted the sharp rise in business in South Korea, the introduction of a new method of organization in Japan, the implementation of so-called New Normal conditions for the three Business Groups in China as well as the amount of new contracts with Chinese OEMs and levels of operating income in Asia that were higher than the targets.
The objective of introduction of a simplified and more flexible method of organization has been reflected by strong measures to optimize functions as well as in the definition of new initiatives followed by the launch of the first actions within the field of the digitalization of operations and the efficiency of R&D.
Eventually, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017 noted that the development and succession plan for the executive team had been defined and presented to the newly created Management Committee.

Variable compensation for 2016 as Chief Executive Officer
On July 25, 2016 the Board of Directors decided that, as from July 1, 2016, Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation as Chief Executive Officer would be based on the achievement of the same quantitative targets as those set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016 for his duties as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. However, as from July 1, 2016 these targets will be eligible for annual variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of the fixed compensation applicable from that date.
In view of the multiplier effect of achieving quantitative targets such as those set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors specified that Patrick Koller's total variable compensation as Chief Executive Officer for the second half of 2016 may vary from 0 to 180% of his annual fixed compensation applicable as from July 1, 2016 at its meeting of July 25, 2016.
At the same meeting, the Board of Directors also specified that the achievement of both quantitative and qualitative targets would be assessed over the entire year 2016 and would apply identically to the variable compensation for the first and second half.

9.2.3. COMPENSATION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The total compensation paid or allocated in 2016 to members of the Executive Committee in office as at December 31, 2016 amounted to 11,271,949.
The compensation of the Executive Committee includes a variable bonus. Performing on target can result in a bonus worth 50% of the base salary. Should targets be exceeded, this percentage can rise to 100% of the base salary. 80% of the bonus is based on targets related to operating income and cash generation within the scope of responsibility, and 20% on the same targets measured across the Group. Within the corporate departments, 100% is based on targets measured across the Group.

If the employment contract of an Executive Committee member is terminated, he or she may receive contractual severance pay of up to 12 months' compensation, depending on their position. This amount is not payable in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Members of the Executive Committee also benefit from the performance share plan instituted by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2016, the plans No. 5, 6, 7 are on-going. They were granted by the Board of Directors' decisions of July 24, 2013, July 28, 2014 and July 23, 2015. Plan No. 8 was granted by the Board of Directors at its July 25, 2016 meeting (see Section 11.4.2.2. of this Registration Document).

9.3. Senior Management

Each of the three Business Groups is organized into geographic divisions ­ Europe, divided when appropriate into North and South Europe, North America, South America, and Asia (China) ­ which manage operations in their region and also coordinate operations with customers headquartered in their region.
The three Business Groups also have a central staff that handles the main operational functions (sales and marketing, programs, manufacturing support, purchasing, quality, Human Resources and finance). These functions are also managed within the geographic divisions by equivalent teams. Additionally, some specialized areas are managed by worldwide product lines within the four businesses, such as seat mechanisms, acoustic treatments and decorative interior trims.
Senior Management at Faurecia consists of all the aforementioned management teams along with the Executive Committee and the key headquarters managers of the manufacturing and quality staff, as well as the Human Resources and Finance departments.

Faurecia Senior Management included 301 members as at December 31, 2016. This is Faurecia's operational management, responsible for the Company's operations, growth and performance. As such, the members of this team have an interest in the short-term results, through a system of variable bonuses. 80% of the bonus is based on targets related to operating income and cash generation within the scope of responsibility, and 20% on the same targets measured for the scope immediately above.
Members of this team also benefit from the performance share plan instituted by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2016, the plans No. 5, 6, 7 are on-going. They were granted by the Board of Directors' decisions of July 24, 2013, July 28, 2014 and July 23, 2015.

Corporate governance
Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

9.4. Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

The Board of Directors determines and controls the implementation of decisions concerning the Company's main strategies, and has the specific task of monitoring the effectiveness of control and risk management systems. In

this context, risk monitoring and control are reviewed at least annually following a presentation by the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors.

9.4.1. REFERENCE FRAMEWORK USED BY FAURECIA

The Faurecia group continues to develop its internal control system by making use of the AMF Reference Framework, as updated on July 22, 2010.
The Group's internal control system is implemented with regard to both its operations and its legal structure.
It applies to all Group subsidiaries consolidated by the global integration method.
The summarized information on Faurecia's internal control procedures provided below is focused on the main areas that could:
c have an impact on financial and accounting information published by the Faurecia group;
c cause damage to the Group's image and reputation;

c expose the Group to regulatory or legal sanctions from the various jurisdictions and competition authorities of the countries in which it operates;
c threaten the Group's employees and ecosystem (risk of kidnapping, natural disasters, epidemics, environmental risks);
c prevent the Group's customers from producing, delaying their production or hindering their product and service performance (critical equipment breakdown, quality risks, delay in product development);
c cause the Group to be unable to continue financing its operations (cash shortage);
c threaten the confidentiality of the information held by the Group on its own behalf (intellectual property, data on technologies, financial data) or with regard to its employees (personal data).

9.4.2. INTERNAL CONTROL: DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES

Within the Faurecia group, internal control is a structure that includes a set of resources, behaviors, procedures and actions with an overall aim of preventing and dealing with risks likely to affect the achievement of its objectives. In this respect, it contributes to the management of its activities, operational efficiency and resource use efficiency, and enables it to take all major operational, financial, and compliance risks into consideration in an appropriate manner.

Faurecia verifies that internal control procedures have been implemented within its subsidiaries. These procedures are adapted to the specific characteristics of the subsidiaries and to relations with Faurecia as parent company.
More specifically, the aims of internal control are to ensure:
c compliance with laws and regulations;
c that the instructions and guidelines set by Executive Management and/or the Board of Directors are applied;

162

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

Corporate governance
Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

9

c that each of the Group's companies' internal processes are functioning correctly, particularly those concerning asset protection;
c reliable financial reporting.
However, internal control cannot give an absolute guarantee that Faurecia's objectives will be achieved. All internal control systems have inherent limitations such as uncertainties in the outside world, the exercise of people's judgment, or the cost/ benefit relationship of implementing new controls.
The Group's internal control system is based on a mapping of risks identified by the Risk Committee with the aim of preventing them; the Internal Audit department uses this same mapping and other types of alerts to define its missions.
In this context, certain risks, considered to be transversal at Group level, are subject to a specific examination by the Risk Committee. These risks are associated with safety to persons,

quality, program management, liquidity risk, electronic data risk, the reliability of supplies, asset protection and fire risk, exposure of industrial sites to certain types of natural disasters, international exposure of employees to health and safety risks, the reliability of financial information, compliance, the environment. For the purposes of procedure progress and improvement, the relevance of this list is regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee and the inclusion of new Group-wide risks is submitted to the Board of Directors' Audit Committee.
The description of the main risks to which the Group considers that it is exposed is presented in Chapter 4 of this Registration Document.
However, other risks that the Group is not aware of at the date of this report, or which are not considered to date as likely to have a significant unfavorable impact for the Group, its businesses, its financial position, its results or its outlook, may exist or occur.

9.4.3. INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURE ACTORS AND ORGANIZATION

Internal control is implemented by both Senior Management and all of the Group's other employees in their daily work in strict compliance with the Group's procedures. The main participants in the internal control system are as follows:
c the Risk Committee which brings together the owners of Group-wide risks at Group level. This Committee is charged with defining, monitoring developments, quantifying, prioritizing, and checking the relevance of these risks with regard to Group objectives. Its deliberations include an evaluation of the usefulness over time of the key indicators of each risk in question as well as the actions required to strengthen their control or management. Finally, the Committee assists the Chief Compliance Officer in preparing and checking risk information for the Board of Directors' Audit Committee;
c Operations Committee meetings are held between the Group's Executive Management and the executive team of each Business Group every month during which all management indicators are reviewed. This Committee particularly focuses on the various key aspects of quality, financial performance, and deadline compliance in programs under development;
c the management and internal control network at Group level (managed by the head of Group internal control), various Business Groups (internal control managers for each Business Group) and the financial management of certain regions (North America, South America, China, Southern Europe, Northern Europe) which aims to strengthen governance, improve procedures (Faurecia Core Procedures),

the IT processes and tools (mainly the Faurecia Core System based on the SAP management software), train managers in all departments on concepts and procedures related to internal control, identify good practices and roll them out in a spirit of continuous improvement.
The head of Group internal control is part of the Group's Finance department. He reports on his work and strengthens the link between the disciplines when attending the Internal Control Governance Board meeting. The main levers of progress set up by this function include: self-evaluation campaigns on all of the management cycles of the business (commercial management, direct and indirect purchasing, inventory management, asset management, payroll management, monitoring standard costs, information systems management, managing expatriates and other personnel transfers, etc.), participation in process improvement projects (transport, Procure to Pay, Order to Cash), training dedicated to internal control including some now registered in the Faurecia University (Faurecia's internal training center) catalog, securing access and rights associated with software, improving IT tools, continuous procedure revision (see 9.4.5 for details on the changes made in 2016);
c the Internal Control Governance Board which meets monthly chaired by the Group's Chief Financial Officer, and with the Internal Audit Director, the VP Financial Control, the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel and the Business Group Chief Financial Officers are also members. Its work is also reviewed at least once a year by the Board of Directors' Audit Committee and the Executive Committee;

Corporate governance
Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

c compliance management under the responsibility of the Chief Compliance Officer (reporting to the CEO), supported by the Regional Compliance Officers for North America, Mexico, Asia and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa). Its mission is to develop a mapping of the risks inherent to the Code of Ethics, to set up appropriate monitoring, to define and roll out a communication, training plan as well as compliance procedures. To roll out the plan, the Compliance department also relies on a network of representatives within each of the operational divisions of the Business Groups;
c the Financing and Treasury department, the Financial Control department, the Quality department, the Legal department, and the Country and Regional Chief Financial Officers which all play a specific role in the internal control process on account of their cross-functional skills;
c the Internal Audit department which assesses the effectiveness of internal control and corporate governance processes, ensures that the Group's procedures comply with the applicable local legislation and regulations, and ensures continuous compliance with procedures and the twelve basic internal control rules via regular controls and checks. In the event of shortfalls, it ensures that corrective measures are taken.
The Internal Audit department is under the responsibility of the Group Chief Financial Officer. Located at the Group's headquarters, it also has regional teams based in France, Germany, the United States and China. Each quarter, it presents its audit plan, the reports carried out and the assessment of its performance to the CEO and Group Chief Financial Officer. It can intervene on all Group processes, anywhere in the world, if need be. It conducts its assignments wholly independently and systematically substantiates its findings with specific facts that have been duly verified. It provides the Executive Management with all of its work and regularly reports to it on the progress of its assignments and the measures taken to reach its objectives. Recommendations sent by the Internal Audit department to the audited sites are monitored by (i) an analysis by questionnaire 3, 6 and 12 months after the final report, (ii) monitoring by the

Operations Committee, and (iii) a post-audit onsite if deemed necessary. In 2005, the Internal Audit department drew up an Internal Audit Charter which defines its roles and mission, its field of competence, and the audit methodology used.
This is complemented by the intervention of external actors, including:
c the Statutory Auditors. In accordance with French company law, Faurecia and Group financial statements are certified by two audit firms which undertake a joint review of the full accounts, the procedures used for preparing them, and also certain Group internal control processes for preparing accounting and financial information. Backed by members of their networks in each of the Group's host countries, these two audit firms perform statutory or contractual audit engagements for all of the Group's fully consolidated companies. Their mission does not directly involve them in internal control or risk management. They take note of them, make use of Internal Audit and internal control reports to improve their understanding of them, and give a wholly independent opinion on their relevance. They present a report including their comments on the Chairman's report regarding internal control procedures for preparing and processing financial and accounting data and certify that other disclosures required by law have been made;
c third-party organizations which carry out the following certification processes for the entire Group over a three-year cycle:
c environment (ISO 14001),
c quality (ISO/TS);
c engineers from fire and property insurance companies who conduct a biennial audit on each of the Group's sites to:
c assess fire risks and any potential impact on production and customers,
c assess whether the prevention and protection measures in place are adequate,
c issue recommendations to reduce risks.

9.4.4. DESCRIPTION OF INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES

Internal control relies on a set of principles and procedures: the Group's culture Being Faurecia, that is based on six key values and on the Code of Ethics and the Management Code, and the Faurecia Excellence System (FES) which is the operational focus, defining the manner in which the Group's employees work throughout the world and structuring the Group's identity.
The documentation on which the internal control system is based, is made up of the following items, which can all be accessed on the Group's intranet:
c the Code of Ethics and the Management Code;
c Manager Empowerment which defines the six general principles for managers in certain key areas: Acquire a new program; Assess Managers and Professionals Decide on Capital Expenditures; Decide on Exceptional Items; Manage Managers and Professionals Compensation; Staff Managers and Professional positions;
c the Faurecia Core Procedures (FCP) are set out within nine processes developed by each Group division respecting a common general framework and apply to all subsidiaries controlled by the Group. They are regularly updated and continually enhanced. Each one has been or will be the subject of regular self-evaluations.
The nine processes are as follows:
c Production Control and Logistics which defines the various production process stages in the factories: preparing for the start-up of new programs or units, planning and controlling the production process, and managing flows,
c Purchasing which covers processes set up with the Group's suppliers with a view to building a sustainable relationship based on excellence,
c Quality and HSE which addresses quality and health and safety of policies,
c PMS (Program Management System) and Engineering which defines the operating rules related to programs, including the different development phases and conditions of transition from one phase to the next,
c Sales and Marketing which includes the procedures to define product offerings and the innovation policy to develop relationships with Group customers and the "Order to Cash" process (customer order processing, monitoring sales prices, manufacturing processes, recovery, processing self-invoicing),
c Communication which defines the principles of external and internal communication,

c Finance which sets a common framework for all Group entities in relation to issues such as financial control, setting objectives and drawing up strategic plans,
c Human Resources which addresses all aspects of Human Resources management,
c Information Technology which deals with all aspects of information systems management (network security, physical and logical access security, installing new software, governance, etc.);
c Faurecia's Alert Management System (AMS) immediately informs Business Group management teams and, according to importance, the Group Executive Committee of any problems encountered in production and program management. This system also ensures a prompt and structured response including problem solving which the organization capitalizes.
The controls implemented in certain key areas are described below.
The financial risks associated with climate change and the measures taken by the Company to reduce them by implementing a low-carbon strategy in all components of its business are described in Sections 4.4 and 8.1 of the Registration Document.
9.4.4.1. Monitoring respect for values within the Group
The Faurecia group is deeply committed to respecting the values of accountability, integrity, and ethical conduct. The Code of Ethics is an integral part of the FCPs. This Code defines the general rules on ethical behavior applicable on a day-to-day basis to all of Faurecia's employees in their relations both inside and outside the Group and with the Group's partners. The Code also describes how the Group seeks to implement its values of respecting customers, shareholders, the people it works with, and the environment. In addition to strengthening the measures already in place, the Code provides for an internal whistleblowing procedure enabling employees to notify Faurecia of any breaches of the law or the Group's procedures. An external whistle-blowing procedure, accessible to all persons who are aware of matters that constitute serious risks for the Group in terms of accounting, financial auditing, and anticorruption, has also been implemented. This procedure allows Faurecia to refer to an independent organization which receives and performs the initial processing provided for in whistle-blowing procedures. If circumstances warrant, the organization contacts the Faurecia group's Chief Executive Officer who can ask the Group's Chief Compliance Officer to carry out the necessary investigations.

Corporate governance
Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

The Code of Ethics has been widely distributed throughout the Group, notably via the intranet, to ensure that all employees can access it and comply with it at all times and in all circumstances. The Code is intended to develop a sense of responsibility and to involve Group employees in the development of ethical values. During Internal Audits, auditors systematically check that everyone is familiar with the Code at factory level.
9.4.4.2 Quality and Safety management of industrial processes, R&D and products
The Faurecia group manages quality and safety process and product risks from new order acquisition phases to manufacturing in the factories. The quality and safety function guarantees this management at all stages of the process. It is present at all levels of organization from the multidisciplinary team developing new programs or the production site up to the Group's management structure.
Specific indicators with monthly reports assess the risks, generate improvement plans, and mainstream actions to prevent major risks at all levels of organization. Every year, annual safety targets are set to further reduce the risks of accidents and quality and to meet customer needs as expressed in the measurement of the performance of their suppliers and operational efficiency.
For major problems, the AMS alert system must be used.
A structured problem solving culture (immediate response within 24 hours and identification of root technical and management causes, Alert Closure) is constantly being developed by Faurecia's management: QRCI (Quick Response Continuous Improvement). Initially deployed to professionally handle quality problems, it has been extended to all opportunities to improve business operations, programs, HSE, scrap, inventory, deliveries, etc.
The Group's quality management has a structure of reviewers that is independent to Business Group operations organizations to conduct reviews on both production sites and R&D centers. They use a precise and rigorous questionnaire to assess the application and maturity of the FES's implementation. Assessment guidelines and Group procedures are regularly updated to reflect the changing needs of customers and weaknesses identified in the organization.
Each production site is rated either "Poor/Satisfactory/ Excellent/Benchmark". If a site is rated "Poor", it is required to prepare a corrective action plan which is presented directly to Faurecia's CEO with a view to reaching a "Satisfactory" level within a maximum of three months.
The Group's Quality department also conducts assessments and/ or provides specific coaching in case of significant deviations

in quality performance on the affected sites and a report and corrective action plan are submitted to Executive Management.
9.4.4.3. Information systems management
To constantly improve the information system, in 2007, the Group implemented an integrated management software package based on the SAP solution (Faurecia Core System) which is installed across almost all the Group's entities (see details in Section 9.4.5). This software package as well as the associated procedures meet the needs and constraints of the local entities as well as those of the Group while guaranteeing the integrity and traceability of the accounting and financial data. A specific project to control the separation of tasks for all entities and areas was deployed during 2016. Preventative and subsequent controls are carried out using this software primarily in order to manage access to sensitive data and ensure strict separation of functional tasks.
In addition to this software, Faurecia also uses the Hyperion application to consolidate financial data to have a complete and uniform picture of the accounting and financial data.
Annual reviews are conducted on the IT and functional environment of these two applications by Ernst & Young Audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, Faurecia's Statutory Auditors. This review covers access to the applications and data, change and project management as well as operations management.
All projects regarding information systems are subject to a specific methodology (PRMS for "Program Reporting Management System") to ensure regular control and monitoring of the projects associated with the strong governance principles and the appropriate tools.
In addition, particular attention is paid to the security and associated processing of computer data. The IT organization endeavors to constantly improve the levels of controls in order to guarantee in particular:
c protection against unauthorized access to connection applications;
c necessary controls to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data;
c the security and restoration if necessary of the data circulating within the information system;
c a separation of responsibilities between network administration, application development and server management;
c the availability of the services and systems.

9.4.4.4. Program control
Program control measures are subject to specific procedures. Each contract signed with a customer represents a program and corresponds to a project which:
c responds to Request for Quotation issued by an automaker for the supply of complex automotive equipment;
c meets set quality, cost, and timeframe objectives;
c meets financial performance targets set by the Group.
The life of a program can stretch to ten years, from the beginning of the development phase (acquisition and industrialization phases) to the end of series life (production).
Every program is subject to control procedures and tools throughout its life. The Program Management Core System (PMCS) lays out a strict succession of steps for the entire duration of a program, from bid processing to the end of product life. Program reviews are carried out monthly within each Division and Business Group to define and monitor action plans.
For each program:
c a prospective financial analysis is carried out in the form of a Business Plan regularly updated from the bid phase to the end of product life, which provides profitability indicators for the program over its life cycle;
c monthly indicators to measure its operating and financial performance are monitored. Each of these indicators is then consolidated by the Group;
c from the AMS (Alert Management System) as described in Section 9.4.4 to identify potential significant program deviations and monitor their resolution;
c from reviews at each phase of development, Gate Review, by the Program Review Committee and throughout the entire program following the process defined by the PMCS.
Each development center is also audited biannually by the Group on a representation sample of programs at different stages of development to formally evaluate the compliance of the PMCS.
Due to numerous program launches in 2016 and 2017, a specific action plan has been implemented involving an assessment of all future Group projects to identify potential risks, and a reinforcement of the existing alert system within the Group.
9.4.4.5. Production and Supply Chain control
The Faurecia group includes over 250 industrial sites throughout the world. Each site is part of a Division, which is part of one of the Business Groups. At each level (site/Division/BG), the Site or Operations Director is responsible for the production process,

which is also supervised by Production Control and Logistics Directors ("PC&L Directors/Managers"), more specifically responsible for the compliance and optimization of physical flow management (procurement, inventories, deliveries). Their task is to achieve the objectives set out in the strategic plan and annual budgets, as well as the principles of excellence described in the FES and the internal control guidelines.
More specifically, their mission consists of:
c ensuring production in accordance with the quality, cost, lead time requirements of Lean Manufacturing;
c managing production personnel in accordance with the "Being Faurecia" principles (autonomy and responsibility);
c managing production using ERP;
c using inventory reduction as a driver for continuous improvement;
c optimizing upstream and downstream flow transportation by taking advantage of the Group's international dimension;
c ensuring inventory reliability by deploying rotating inventories and identifying then reducing inventory discrepancies according to the QRCI method described above.
They are provided with monthly (and even daily or weekly) performance indicators.
Internal control is systematically assessed for compliance with the "Being Faurecia", inventory management and transportation principles during each site audit. In addition, the actors have a constantly changing self-assessment questionnaire in this area at their disposal.
9.4.4.6. Internal control procedures for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information
PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board of Directors is collectively responsible for publishing reliable financial and accounting information.
The Board of Directors' Audit Committee studies and prepares some of the Board's deliberations. It issues proposals, opinions, and recommendations within its field of competence. The Committee only has a consultative role and acts under the authority of the Board of Directors to which it reports whenever necessary and for which it cannot serve as a substitute.
In general, the Committee reviews, when necessary, any financial or accounting matter submitted to it by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Corporate governance
Description of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Faurecia group

It has the specific task of examining the annual and interim parent company and consolidated financial statements for the Faurecia group and reporting to the Board of Directors on the audit mission results, the way in which this mission contributed to the integrity of the financial information and the role that the Committee played in this process.
Executive Management specifically relies on input from the Accounting, Consolidation, Financial Control, and Financial Communications departments.
The Financial Control department prepares monthly consolidated financial statements as well as interim and annual financial information to be published. It ensures that local financial managers properly prepare parent company financial statements in compliance with local regulations. It defines the Group's accounting principles in accordance with IFRS and sees that all subsidiaries follow them. It also prepares Faurecia's financial statements.
Internal control procedures required to produce reliable accounting data are implemented at Group level and if required, locally, to ensure compliance with the accounting and tax rules applicable in each country. Among others, these include physical inventory taking at least once a year and the separation of tasks. The accounting data submitted by each subsidiary is prepared in accordance with the standards set by Group and published as FCPs, which themselves comply with IFRS guidelines.
The following principles are implemented across the Group to prepare financial statements:
c completeness of transaction processing;
c transaction compliance with applicable accounting principles;
c periodic review of assets.
The volume of information involved, the quality and integrity required to process the information, and ever-tighter financial reporting deadlines enabling management to respond quickly and efficiently control operations require the use of effective information systems. Faurecia implemented a Group ERP system built on SAP in 2007 which is now rolled out across all of the Group's accounting platforms and continues to be progressively rolled out across the various Group sites.
The Group's financial statements are prepared using information from each subsidiary which has been entered into the HFM reporting and consolidation system. Each subsidiary's accounting information comprises income statements prepared by nature and destination, a breakdown by business segment, an analysis of current and deferred taxes, a balance sheet, a cash flow statement, and a statement of commitments and contingent liabilities.
Inter-company transactions are entered and reconciled in the HFM reporting tool every month.

The Finance department also uses short and medium term forecasts to verify the value of cash generating units, actuarial reports to assess commitments to employees and retirees, and fair-value measurements of derivative financial instruments confirmed by the Group's banking counter-parties.
For each subsidiary, the head of accounting and the financial controller have access to all the information they require to prepare accurate financial statements in compliance with local standards for statutory financial statements and with Group standards for reporting.
At every interim and annual close, the head accountant is required to prepare an IFRS/local standard compliant reconciliation for equity and profit and loss for each subsidiary.
Instructions are sent to the accountants and financial controllers specifying the closing procedures to be followed every month. Training on reporting tools are regularly provided to newly recruited accounting and financial staff.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS
Off-balance sheet commitments are handled in accordance with a specific identification and valuation process.
Each commitment is tracked by nature. Currency and interestrate risks as well as inter-company financing in foreign currencies are managed at Group-level under the supervision of the Finance department and, if necessary, are subject to hedging. Similarly, any sureties or guarantees granted by Faurecia S.A. are issued and monitored at Group level.
IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF RISKS IMPACTING ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The preparation of full monthly financial statements greatly reduces risks at interim and annual closes, particularly regarding meeting financial reporting deadlines. Any problems are anticipated, inter-company accounts are reconciled each month, specific transactions are accounted for without waiting for the yearly close, and tax calculations are regularly substantiated.
The preparation and review of monthly financial statements and reconciling them with the budget allows each entity to detect any anomalies in the accounts, such as in relation to inventories or cash flows. Implemented in tandem with specific procedures, this process is intended to reduce the risk of errors and fraud.
"HARD CLOSE" PROCEDURE
A hard close is carried out on October 31 every year for interim accounts to anticipate, assess, and validate the main accounting options to be implemented for the yearly close. Similarly, a hard close is carried out in May to anticipate the close for interim financial statements on June 30.

ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL CONTROL TOOLS
The Group has drawn up procedures for preparing and processing financial and accounting information. These procedures comply with applicable accounting principles and are available on the Group's intranet as FCPs. The following figure among the most important procedures:
c a capital expenditure authorization procedure to determine capital spending criteria and name authorized signatories who can commit the Company for amounts up to pre-defined thresholds;
c an authorization procedure for capital increases, capital injections, acquisitions of shareholdings, and intra-group loans;
c a procedure for drafting Program Business Plans;
c a procedure for the acquisition of new programs;
c a procedure for consolidating financial statements.
ORGANIZATION OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
The Group Finance department is responsible for drawing up rules and procedures as well as for the consolidation, Internal Audit and management of the Group's cash position and financing.
The Country or Regional Chief Financial Officers that manage the shared accounting service centers are responsible for:
c the production of the financial and accounting statements for all the units within their scope, in compliance with IFRS and local standards and the closure dates defined by the Group;
c compliance with and improvement to the internal control procedures;
c strengthening the role and skills of the accounting function;
c improving the effectiveness of information systems;
c close collaboration with operational sites within their scope in order to work with them to solve internal control issues and to improve the overall effectiveness of the financial process.
To date, only a few sites remain autonomous for the production of their financial statements (Terni in Italy, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, a joint venture in Iran and two factories in China), but these report to a regional accounting center which controls their operations through reinforced balance sheet reviews.
Internal and financial controllers are stakeholders in the Group's strategy and sales, R&D and industrial activities at all levels and report to site, Division and BG managers. Through their function, they are stakeholders in the definition and achievement of the operational objectives.

This organization between, on the one hand, shared services responsible for producing the financial statements and complying with the standards, and on the other, the controllers considered as co-pilots for the management of operational entities, enables a real separation of tasks and a better development of skills in each role, resulting in better overall effectiveness and improvements to internal control.
FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING REPORTING PROCESS
The reporting processes are intended to provide systems for informing and steering the Group and ensuring maximum effectiveness in risk management (identification, reactivity, prevention). A "reporting glossary" describes the content of all reporting data and procedures explains how reporting should be conducted.
The HFM consolidation system provides for the reporting of both financial information (income statement and balance sheet data) and non-financial information (such as indicators relating to quality, production, purchasing, safety, Human Resources, etc.).
The results consolidation process is secured by applying blocking controls upstream in reporting documents and intermediate controls related to the structure of the reporting system at Group level.
Monthly reporting data includes estimated sales and operating results for each business unit within three days of the month-end as well as definitive data four days after month-end prepared in accordance with Group standards. Every month, the Operations Committee reviews the operating performance and action plans of each Business Group.
BUDGET AND STRATEGIC PLAN
As Faurecia's contracts span several years, it requires a medium-term overview of its financial position to effectively manage risks. The Group draws up a five-year plan each year, in which programs play an essential role, for this purpose. This plan helps clarify the Group's outlook in terms of profitability and required resources. It is consolidated using the same tool and applying the same stringent procedures as for monthly reporting and it is also used to define budgetary targets. The Group Finance department provides economic and financial assumptions and sets specific objectives for each operating unit to be used in the budget. The annual budget is developed by production site, R&D center, and administrative center. It is then broken down into monthly periods using standard schedules and then consolidated.
In order to effectively anticipate short-term changes and improve responsiveness, monthly reporting includes a rolling forecast for the income statement and cash flow statement for the current and subsequent quarters.

FINANCIAL PRESS RELEASES, ANNUAL REPORT, AND REGISTRATION DOCUMENT
The Group's Finance and Communications departments are responsible for drawing up and relaying all of the Group's financial information to the financial markets. Financial communication is transmitted through two main vehicles:
c the annual report and the Registration Document;
c financial press releases.

Preparation of the annual report, which also serves as the Registration Document, is coordinated by the Legal department. A large number of people who are experts in their field contribute to the process ensuring that the document contains broad-ranging and high-quality information. The Registration Document is then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors before it is published.
Financial press releases are systematically reviewed by the Finance department and announcements on the annual and interim accounts and quarterly revenue are also approved by the Board of Directors.

9.4.5. THE INTERNAL CONTROL IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURE WITHIN FAURECIA

During the year the Group continued to improve its internal control procedures:
c shared accounting services are now under the responsibility of the Regional Chief Financial Officers (South Europe, North Europe, North America, South America, Asia, South Africa) which cover the Group's full geographical scope;
c at the end of 2016, the FCS (ERP SAP) management system was rolled out on 94% of the operational and central sites (with 100% of R&D centers and administrative headquarters), thus ensuring quality, uniform administrative, accounting, financial and flow management processes throughout the Group and optimizing the separation of tasks;
c during 2016, all indirect production purchases under 50k were sub-contracted throughout the world (with the exception of China, India and Russia) to an external service provider to make management of the supplier panel more rigorous and guarantee the reception of one, two or three quotes depending on the purchase amounts;
c a multi-disciplinary working group "Procure to Pay" was created during 2016 to identify recurring internal control process failures (management of Master Data, absence of EDI, errors in data, absence of back-office purchasing, etc.) and to define, then deploy a corrective action plan;
c another working group has undertaken to provide a precise description of the tasks in the "Order to Cash" process, stating the respective responsibilities of each department (sales, sales administration, customer accounts, management control, logistics). This group has also covered all aspects of customer self-billing, both for tools and management and reporting methods required to manage it, leading to the

standardization of procedures, the publication of procedures and training documents, and wide-scale training for all actors involved by the end of March 2017 at the latest;
c to limit the possibility of fraud, the procedures for modifying Group supplier bank accounts have been reinforced;
c at the same time, other tools and processes to improve internal control have been and/or will continue to be set up:
c secure payments which from their generation in FCS to the bank concerned must simultaneously fulfill two criteria: on the one hand, the protection of files in transit and on the other, data encryption. These two criteria must now be simultaneously fulfilled across the Group with the exception of:
c Spain, Portugal, Korea, Brazil, Thailand and South Africa that do not fulfill the second criterion of data encryption,
c Turkey and Japan that fulfill neither criteria.
All these shortcomings will be corrected during 2017,
c an FCS module to selectively monitor certain transactions carried out in the tool was activated with computer populations likely to conduct sensitive transactions from time to time (supplier invoices, payment, etc.) on behalf of users,
c a tool to optimize the management of the SOD (Segregation of Duties) matrix and the roles of users in FCS was rolled out in 2016 and has significantly reduced the number of conflicts with the principles of task separation,

170

c a GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) application entered into production at the start of 2016, which includes:
c a secure "Internal Audit" module (mission planning, preparation, execution),
c an "Internal Control" module (managing questionnaires and self-evaluation campaigns, harnessing results, monitoring action plans),
c a new generation IAM (Identity Access Management) tool to centralize access rights and profile management impacting multiple applications entered into production in 2016,
c the self-evaluation campaigns conducted in 2015 (inventories, sales, purchasing, payroll) were completed in 2016 by the following cycles: assets, inventories (new campaign), standard costs, then in 2017 by IT management, R&D and program management, accounting and financial reporting. Thanks to the new GRC tool described above, improvement plans resulting

from these campaigns can now be consulted on-line by the internal controller network,
c numerous videos, questionnaires and training tutorials ("MOOC") can be consulted now or in the near future on the Faurecia University intranet site. Training with some of these MOOC (up to the certification) is or will be made compulsory by the Executive Management once they are available on-line:
c Code of Ethics: already on-line and compulsory for all managers,
c internal control principles (twelve videos): on-line at the end of 2016 and compulsory for all managers,
c antitrust: on-line at the beginning of 2017 and compulsory for all sales, purchasing and program managers,
c the responsibility for managing the sites, divisions and network of internal auditors were reinforced in 2016 with respect to the figures given for internal control for all sites.

Faurecia S.A. and its subsidiaries ("Faurecia") form one of the world's leading automotive equipment suppliers in three vehicle businesses: Seating, Clean Mobility and Interiors.
Faurecia's registered office is located in Nanterre, in the Hauts-de-Seine department of France. The Company is quoted on the Eurolist market of Euronext Paris.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by Faurecia's Board of Directors on February 8, 2017.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

10 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements of the Faurecia group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB, as adopted by the European Union and available on the European Commission website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_ en.htm
These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as the related International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations.
The standards used to prepare the 2016 consolidated financial statements and comparative data for 2015 are those published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) as of December 31, 2016, whose application was mandatory at that date.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Since January 1, 2016 Faurecia has applied the amendments to standards IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 38 and IFRS 11 and the amendments and revisions to the existing standards which have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
However, Faurecia has not undertaken any early application of the new standards, amendments or interpretations whose application is mandatory from December 31, 2016, irrespective of whether or not they are adopted by the European Union. The impact analysis of these standards and amendments is in progress.
In particular, as regards IFRS 15, Faurecia carries out an in depth analysis of contracts and sales transactions in order to identify and assess any change to the presentation of the sales figure and the rules for recognition over time. As regards IFRS 16 and IFRS 9, analyses are in progress to identify the impact of the standards.
On the basis of the analysis related to IFRS 15, Faurecia should operate as an agent for monoliths sales.
Indeed, these components are used in catalyst and their technical specifications are directly settled between automaker and monoliths producer. Thus, they are bought by Faurecia to be integrated to emission control systems sold to automakers without added value. So Faurecia would operate as an agent, then monolith sales would be recorded at net value in the income and total sales would be only added-value sales, as defined by Faurecia.
The accounting principles applied are given in each note hereafter.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions when measuring certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations. These estimates and assumptions are primarily used when calculating the impairment of property, plant and equipment,

intangible assets and goodwill, as well as for measuring pension and other employee benefit obligations. They are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The results of the sensitivity tests performed on the carrying amounts of goodwill and provisions for pensions and other employee benefits are provided in Notes 10 "Goodwill" and 25.2 "Provisions for pensions and other post-emplyment benefits", respectively. In addition, Note 11 "Intangible Assets" describes the main assumptions used for measuring intangible assets.
1.A Consolidation principles
Companies over which the Group exercises significant influence and which are at least 20%-owned are consolidated where one or more of the following criteria are met: annual sales of more than 20 million, total assets more than 20 million, and/or debt more than 5 million.
Non-consolidated companies are not material, either individually or in the aggregate.
Subsidiaries controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 50% of a company's voting rights, and may also arise as a result of shareholders' agreements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated as of the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are no longer consolidated as of the date that control ceases.
Companies over which the Group exercises significant influence but not control, generally through a shareholding representing between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method.
The Faurecia group's financial statements are presented in euros.
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is generally their local currency. The assets and liabilities of these companies are translated into euros at the year-end exchange rate and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in equity.
However, certain companies located outside the euro or the USdollar zone and which carry out the majority of their transactions in euros or US dollars may, however, use euros or US dollars as their functional currency.
All material inter-company transactions are eliminated in consolidation, including inter-company gains.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method are not significantly different from those applied by the Group.

1.B Recent events
2023 BONDS ISSUE On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
REDEMPTION OF 2016 BONDS In November 2011 and February 2012, Faurecia had issued 490 million worth of bonds, due December 15, 2016. These bonds carried interest at 9.375% and benefited from a guarantee from certain Group subsidiaries. They were redeemed early ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of the par plus

interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million. This early redemption also eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and 2022 bonds.
RENEGOTIATION OF SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.
DIVESTMENT OF FOUNTAIN INN PLANT
Fountain Inn activities for BMW have been sold to Yanfeng Automotive Interiors June 30, 2016. The plant sales were 226 million in 2015 and 115 million in 2016.

NOTE 2 CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

2.1 Sale of Faurecia Automotive Exteriors to Plastic Omnium
On July 29, 2016, Faurecia completed the sale to Plastic Omnium of its Automotive Exteriors branch for 665 million (enterprise value).
The divestiture commitment made by Plastic Omnium towards the European Commission did not have any impact on the sale of the business by Faurecia nor on the price of the transaction.
In accordance with the sale and purchase agreement, a procedure for determining any potential price adjustment based on the FAE accounts at closing date is ongoing and is subject to a contradictory expertise initiated by Plastic Omnium.
As at December 31, 2016, the capital gain net of tax has been recorded within "Net profit from discontinued operations".

CAPITAL GAIN ON THE SALE OF AUTOMOTIVE EXTERIORS
In accordance with IFRS 10, the capital gain on the sale of the Automotive Exteriors activity was calculated as the difference between:
c the total transaction price received on closing date minus acquisition variations, transaction costs and future estimated liabilities; and
c the value of Automotive Exteriors' net assets, as recorded in Faurecia's Consolidated Financial Statements as at July 29, 2016.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In compliance with IFRS 5, the line "Net profit from discontinued operations" presented in Consolidated Income Statement, amounted to 188.3 million, includes:
c the operations of Automotive Exteriors activities from January 1, 2016 to July 29, 2016 for 39.7 million;
c the capital gain net of tax on the sale with respect to these activities and the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal for 148.6 million.

c Interiors (design and manufacture of instrument panels, complete cockpits, door panels and modules, and acoustic systems), including the plant in Hambach.

186

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

10 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements

These business units are managed by the Group on an independent basis in terms of reviewing their individual performance and allocating resources. The tables below show reconciliation between the indicators used to measure the performance of each segment ­ notably operating income ­ and the consolidated financial statements. Borrowings, other operating income and expense, financial income and expenses, and taxes are monitored at the Group level and are not allocated to the various segments.
4.1 Accounting principles
Sales are recognized when the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the modules or parts produced are transferred. This generally corresponds to when the goods are shipped.
For development contracts or the sale of tooling, sales are recognized when the technical stages are validated by the customer. If no such technical stages are provided for in the contract, sales are recognized when the related study is completed or the tooling is delivered.
Operating margin is the Faurecia group's principal performance indicator.

It corresponds to net income of the fully consolidated companies before:
c other operating income and expenses, corresponding to material, unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization costs and early retirement costs, the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business, the closure or sale of an industrial site, disposals of non-operating buildings, impairment losses and reversals recorded for property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, as well as other material and unusual losses;
c income on loans, cash investments and marketable securities;
c finance costs;
c other financial income and expenses, which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets, the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges, changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in IAS 39, and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;
c taxes.

NOTE 8 CORPORATE INCOME TAX

Deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method for temporary differences arising between the tax bases for assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts on the consolidated financial statements. Temporary differences mainly arise from tax loss carryforwards and consolidation adjustments to subsidiaries' accounts. Deferred taxes are measured using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Corporate income tax can be analyzed as follows:
(in  millions)
Current taxes c Current corporate income tax Deferred taxes c Deferred taxes for the period
TOTAL

Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available in the short or medium term against which the temporary differences or the loss carry forward can be utilized.
Where appropriate, a deferred taxes liability is booked to cover taxes payable on the distribution of retained earnings of subsidiaries and associates which are not considered as having been permanently reinvested and for which the Group is not in a position to control the date when the timing difference will reverse.

NOTE 9 EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury stock.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts net income attributable to owners of the parent and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares (including stock options, free shares and convertible bonds).

NOTE 10 GOODWILL

In case of a business combination, the aggregate value of the acquisition is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value determined at their acquisition date.
A goodwill is recognized when the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree exceed the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once a year and more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs). A CGU is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that

generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the level within the operating segment at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The Group has identified the following CGUs:
c Seating;
c Clean Mobility;
c Interiors.
The carrying amount of assets and liabilities thus grouped is compared to the higher of its market value and value in use, which is equal to the present value of the net future cash flows expected, and their net market value including costs of disposal.

Cash-generating units and impairment tests
Impairment tests are carried out whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment testing consists of comparing the carrying amount of an asset, or group of assets, with the higher of its market value and value in use. Value in use is defined as the present value of the net future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or group of assets.
The assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (Cash-Generating Units, or CGUs).
Impairment tests are performed on each group of intangible assets (development costs) and property, plant and equipment attributable to a customer contract. This is done by comparing the aggregate carrying amount of the group of assets concerned with the present value of the expected net future cash flows to be derived from the contract.
An impairment loss is recorded when the assets' carrying amount is higher than the present value of the expected net future cash flows. A provision is also recorded for losses to completion on loss-making contracts.
In case of a triggering event, impairment testing is also carried out on general and corporate assets grouped primarily by type of product and by region.
The cash inflows generated by the assets allocated to these CGUs are largely interdependent due to the high overlap among various manufacturing flows, optimization of capacity utilization, and centralization of research and development activities.
Manufacturing assets whose closure is planned are tested independently for impairment.

The cash flow forecasts used to calculate value in use were based on the Group's 2017-2019 strategic plan which was drafted in mid-2016. The volume assumptions used in the 20172019 strategic plan are based on external information sources.
The main assumption affecting value in use is the level of operating income used to calculate future cash flows and particularly the terminal value. The operating margin assumption for 2019 is 6.4% for the Group as a whole.
Projected cash flows for the last year of the Strategic Business Plan (2019) have been projected to infinity by applying a growth rate determined based on analysts' trend forecasts for the automotive market. The growth rate applied for the year-end 2016 test was 1.4% (1.5% applied for 2015).
Faurecia called on an independent expert to calculate the weighted average cost of capital stock used to discount future cash flows. The market parameters used in the expert's calculation were based on a sample of 25 companies operating in the automotive supplier sector (7 in Europe, 9 in North America and 9 in Asia). Taking into account these parameters and a market risk premium of 7.25% on average, the weighted cost of capital stock used to discount future cash flows was set at 9.0% (on the basis of a range of values provided by the independent expert) in 2016 (9.5% in 2015). This rate was applied for the impairment tests carried out on all of the Group's CGUs. They all bear the same specific risks relating to the automotive supplier sector and the CGUs multinational operation does not justify using geographically different discount rates.
The tests performed at year-end 2016 did not show any indication of further impairment in goodwill.

NOTE 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

A. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
The Faurecia group incurs certain development costs in connection with producing and delivering modules for specific customer orders which are not considered as sold to the customer, especially when paid for by the customer on delivery of each part. In accordance with IAS 38, these development costs are recorded as an intangible asset where the Company concerned can demonstrate:
c its intention to complete the project as well as the availability of adequate technical and financial resources to do so;
c how the customer contract will generate probable future economic benefits and the Company's ability to measure these reliably;

c its ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the contracts concerned (costs to completion).
These capitalized costs are amortized to match the quantities of parts delivered to the customer, over a period not exceeding five years except under exceptional circumstances.
Research costs, and development costs that do not meet the above criteria, are expensed as incurred.
B. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets include development and purchase costs relating to software used within the Group ­ which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of between one and three years ­ as well as patents and licenses.

Intangible assets break down as follows:

The book value of development costs allocated to a customer contract as well as the associated specific tooling is compared to the present value of the expected net future cash flows to be derived from the contract based on the best possible estimate

of future sales. The volumes taken into account in Faurecia's Business Plans are the best estimates by the Group's Marketing department based on automakers' forecasts when available.

NOTE 12 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, or production cost in the case of assets produced by the Group for its own use, less accumulated depreciation.
Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except when they increase productivity or prolong the useful life of an asset, in which case they are capitalized.
In accordance with the amended version of IAS 23, borrowing costs on qualifying assets arising subsequent to January 1, 2009 are included in the cost of the assets concerned.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

Buildings

Specific tooling is produced or purchased specifically for the purpose of manufacturing parts or modules for customer orders, which are either a) not sold to the customer, or b) paid for by the customer on delivery of each part. In accordance with IAS 16, this tooling is recognized as property, plant and equipment.
It is depreciated to match the quantities of parts delivered to the customer over a maximum of five years, in line with the rate at which models are replaced.
Investment grants are recorded as a deduction from the assets that they were used to finance.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee are recorded under assets at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The recognized assets are subsequently depreciated as described above. An obligation of the same amount is recorded as a liability.

Inventories of raw materials and supplies are stated at cost, determined by the FIFO method (First-In, First-Out).
Finished and semi-finished products, as well as work-inprogress, are stated at production cost, determined by the FIFO method. Production cost includes the cost of materials and supplies as well as direct and indirect production costs, excluding overhead not linked to production and borrowing costs.

Work-in-progress includes the costs of internally-manufactured specific tooling or development work which is sold to customers, i.e. where the related risks and rewards are transferred. These costs are recognized in the income statement over the period in which the corresponding sales are made, as each technical stage is validated by the customer, or when the tooling is delivered if the contract does not provide for specific technical stages.
Provisions are booked for inventories for which the probable realizable value is lower than cost.

NOTE 21 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include current account balances in the amount of 1,315.3 million (compared to 718.8 million in 2015) and short-term investments in the amount of 246.9 million (compared to 213.7 million in 2015), or a total of 1,562.2 million as of December 31, 2016.
These components include current account balances and units in money market funds that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are not subject to a significant risk of impairment in the event of changes in interest rates. They are measured at fair value and variances are booked through P&L.

The carrying amount of marketable securities is almost identical to market value as they are held on a very short term basis.
Net cash flow, as mentioned in the comments on the business review and the consolidated financial statements, represents the net financing surplus adjusted for acquisitions of investments and business net of cash acquired and for changes in other investments and non-current assets. Net cash flow amounts 458.5 million as of December 31, 2016 (of which recurring 332.5 million) compared to 302.5 million in 2015.

22.2 Share-based payment
A - STOCK OPTIONS Faurecia has a policy of issuing stock options to the executives of Group companies. Options are measured at fair value as of the grant date using the Black & Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock options is recognized in payroll costs on a straight-line basis

over the vesting period (the period between the grant date and the vesting date), with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
As of December 31, 2016, a total of 244,200 stock options were outstanding.
The exercise of these options would result in increasing:
c the capital stock by 1.7 million;
c additional paid-in capital by 9.2 million.

Details of the stock subscription option plans as of December 31, 2016 are set out in the table below:

B - FREE SHARE GRANT
In 2010 Faurecia implemented a share grant plan for executives of Group companies. These shares are subject to service and performance conditions.
Free shares are measured at fair value by reference to the market price of Faurecia's shares at the grant date, less (i) an amount corresponding to the expected dividends due on the

shares but not paid during the vesting period and (ii) an amount reflecting the cost of the shares being subject to a lock-up period. The fair value is recognized in payroll costs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The amount recognized for the period is an expense of 17.8 million, compared to 9.9 million in 2015.

LITIGATION
On March 25, 2014, the European Commission and the Department of Justice of the United States of America and on November 27, 2014, the Competition Commission of South Africa, initiated an enquiry covering certain suppliers of emission control systems on the basis for suspicions of anticompetitive practices in this segment. Faurecia is one of the companies covered by these enquiries. These enquiries are ongoing. Furthermore, on March 24, 2016, two class actions were filed against several suppliers of emissions control

systems, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to Exhaust Systems, and seeking unspecified amounts of civil damages. Faurecia Emissions Control Technologies US, LLC is one of the companies named as defendants, and Faurecia S.A. has been named as an additional defendant. On November 9, 2016, a third class action was filed. In the event anti-competitive practices are proven, possible sanctions include fines, criminal charges or civil damages. The Group is at present unable to predict the consequences of such inquiries and class actions, including the level of fines or sanctions that could be imposed: therefore, no accruals were accounted for as December 31, 2016. There are no other claims or litigation in progress or pending that are likely to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial position.

25.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits
Group employees may receive, in addition to their pensions in conformity with the applicable regulations in the countries where the Group companies employing them are located, additional benefits or post-retirement benefit obligations. The Group offers these benefits through either defined benefits or defined contribution schemes.
The valuation and accounting methodologies followed by the Group are the following:
c for defined contribution schemes, costs are recognized as expenses based on contributions;
c the liability for defined benefit schemes is determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method

according to the agreements effective in each concerned Group company.
The valuation takes into account the probability of employees staying with the Group up to retirement age and expected future compensation levels as well as other economic assumptions (such as the inflation rate, the discount rate) for each concerned zone or country. These assumptions are described in Note 25.2.
Benefit obligations are partially funded by contributions to external funds. In cases where the funds are permanently allocated to the benefit scheme concerned, their value is deducted from the related liability. An excess of scheme assets is only recognized in the balance sheet when it represents future benefits effectively available for the Group.

Periodic pension and other employee benefit costs are recognized as operating expenses over the benefit vesting period. Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefits scheme are recognized in other comprehensive income. In case of a change in regime, past service costs are fully recognized as operating expenses, the benefits being fully acquired or not.

The expected rate of return of defined benefits scheme assets is equal to the discount rate used to value the obligation. This return is recorded in "Other financial income and expense".
The other post employment benefits mainly cover seniority bonuses as well as health care benefits. The obligation is valued using similar methodology, assumptions and frequency as the ones used for post employment benefits.

PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
A - Description of the schemes
In France, the supplementary pension scheme comprises a defined benefit plan for all managerial employees granting a rent relating to salary tranche C.
In the United States, the three defined benefits pension schemes are all closed to new participants, respectively since 1996, 2002 and 2011. The first scheme covers 705 participants, the second one 366 and the third one 1,029.
In Germany, the main defined benefits pension scheme still open covers 5,363 participants. The benefit granted is based on the number of years of service, starting after 15 years.
A specific supplementary pension scheme for Executive Committee members who have an employment contract with Faurecia S.A. or any of its subsidiaries, comprising a defined benefit scheme for French members and a defined contribution scheme for foreign members was approved by the Board of Directors on February 11, 2015. It guarantees an annuity based on the reference salary, the Group's operating income, and the budget approved by the Board of Directors.

B - Assumptions used The Group's obligations under these schemes are determined on an actuarial basis, using the following assumptions:
c retirement age between 62 and 65 for employees in France;
c staff turnover assumptions based on the economic conditions specific to each country and/or Group company;
c mortality assumptions specific to each country;
c estimated future salary levels until retirement age, based on inflation assumptions and forecasts of individual salary increases for each country;
c the expected long-term return on external funds;
c discount and inflation rates (or differential) based on local conditions.

Note: the iboxx AA rate has been used as reference to determine the discount rate of the euro zone. The decrease in discount rate generated actuarial gains and losses which have been recorded in other comprehensive income according to IAS 19R.

In France, pension liability increased by 27.9 million at yearend compared to the previous year. This increase breaks down as follows:
c +14.1 million relating to service cost and interest cost for 2016;

c -7.1 million relating to lump-sum retirement bonuses and rights to capital stock for supplementary pension schemes;
c -0.2 million relating to employee reduction plans;
c +21.1 million resulting from actuarial gains and losses, including 16.6 million relating to the discount rate, 4.5 million relating to experience.

F - Pension benefit obligations: sensitivity to changes in discount rate and inflation rate in main scope The impact of a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate and in the inflation rate for the projected benefit obligation is as follows:

26.3 Financing
The main components of Faurecia financing are described below:
2016 BONDS
In November 2011 and February 2012, Faurecia had issued 490 million worth of bonds, due December 15, 2016. These bonds carried interest at 9.375% and benefited from a guarantee from certain Group subsidiaries. They were redeemed by anticipation ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of par plus interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million. This early redemption also eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and 2022 bonds.
2022 BONDS
In 2015, Faurecia issued bonds, due June 15, 2022, carrying annual interest of 3.125%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2015.
A first part of these bonds has been issued on March 17, 2015 for 500 million. An additional 200 million bond was issued on April 9, 2015, with the same due date and same coupon, at 100.25% of the nominal value. On May 19, 2015, the bonds of this second tranche were wholly assimilated to those issued on March 17, 2015.
They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA after certain adjustments is lower than twice the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to those of the syndicated credit loan.
They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds. The bonds benefit from guarantees from some group affiliates; the entities providing these guarantees are the same as those that guarantee the bonds due December 2016. These guarantees have been eliminated with the full redemption of these 2016 bonds.

2023 BONDS
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.
These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.
SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.
In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed, on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2016 this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility includes only one covenant concerning compliance with consolidated financial ratios: net debt*/ EBITDA** must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.

* Consolidated net debt. ** Operating income plus depreciation and funding of provisions for impairment of property, plant equipment and intangible assets, corresponding to the past 12 months.

2018 OCEANE
On September 18, 2012 Faurecia had issued 250 million worth of OCEANE bonds convertible into and/or exchangeable for new or existing shares, due January 1, 2018. These bonds of a principal amount of 19.48 carried interest at 3.25%.

On December 7, 2015, Faurecia announced its intention to reimburse the OCEANE bonds at par value on January 15, 2016. Following this announcement, 94.5% of the OCEANE bonds have been converted as of December 31, 2015, and the principal amount of remaining bonds outstanding at this date was 13.7 million. As of January 15, 2016, almost the entire amount has been converted and the residual principal amount of 0.2 million has been reimbursed.

* No financial instruments were transferred between categories in 2016. ** All of the instruments in this category are financial assets or liabilities designated on initial recognition. *** The fair value of the 2018 OCEANE was established on the basis of the year-end valuation (Dec. 31, 2015) of 46.0 at 32.3 million. In the balance
sheet, OCEANE are recorded, on the one hand, as an amount of the component for bonds with no conversion option and, on the other hand, as a registered component of shareholder's equity that represents the value of the conversion option. The fair value of the bonds, excluding accrued interest, was established on the basis of the year-end market value (Dec. 31, 2015): for the 2016 bonds quoted 108.296% of par, at 530.7 million and for the 2022 bonds quoted 98.916% of par, at 692.4 million.

The main measurement methods applied are as follows:
c tems accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, as well as hedging instruments, are measured using a valuation technique based on rates quoted on the interbank market, such as Euribor and exchange rates set daily by the European Central Bank;

c financial liabilities are primarily recognized at amortized cost calculated using the effective interest rate method;
c the fair value of trade receivables and payables related to manufacturing and sales operations corresponds to their carrying value given their very short maturities.

NOTE 30 HEDGING OF CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RISKS

30.1 Transactions in foreign currencies and derivatives
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables and payables are converted at the year-end exchange rate. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in the income statement as operating income or expenses for operating receivables and payables, and under "Other financial income and expenses" for other receivables and payables.
Faurecia uses derivative instruments traded on organized markets or purchased over-the-counter from first-rate counterparties to hedge currency and interest rate risks.
They are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet.
30.2 Hedging of currency risks
Currency risks relating to the commercial transactions of the Group's subsidiaries are managed centrally by Faurecia using forward purchase and sale contracts and options as well as foreign currency financing. Faurecia manages the hedging of currency risks on a central basis, through the Group Finance and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.

Currency risks on forecasted transactions are hedged on the basis of estimated cash flows determined when budgets are prepared, validated by Executive Management; these forecasts are updated on a regular basis. The related derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges when there is a hedging relationship that satisfies the IAS 39 criteria.
Subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the euro are granted inter-company loans in their operating currencies. Although these loans are refinanced in euros and eliminated in consolidation, they contribute to the Group's currency risk exposure and are therefore hedged through foreign exchange swaps.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge future revenues is recorded in equity and recorded to operating income when the hedged revenues are received.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge trade receivables and payables are recorded as operating income or expense.
The portion of the change in fair value of these hedges that is ineffective (time value of the hedges) is recorded under "Other financial income and expenses" together with changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge other receivables and payables.

those qualifying and not qualifying as fair value hedges) and (ii) the effect on equity of the change in the intrinsic value of hedging instruments for derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges.

30.3 Interest-rate hedges
Faurecia manages hedging of interest rate risks on a central basis. Such management is implemented through the Group Finance and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate hedges are recorded directly in "Other financial income and expenses" when the

hedging relationship cannot be demonstrated under IAS 39, or where the Group has elected not to apply hedge accounting principles.
The table below shows the Group's interest rate position, with assets, liabilities and derivatives broken down into fixed or variable rates. Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and interest rate hedges include interest rate swaps as well as in-the-money options.

The main components of the fixed rate debt are:
c bonds maturing in June 2022, issued in March and April 2015 for a total amount of 700 million;
c bonds maturing in June 2023, issued in April 2016 for a total amount of 700 million.
A significant part of the gross borrowings (syndicated credit facility, sale of receivables, short-term loans, commercial paper as applicable) are at variable or renewable rates. The aim of the Group's interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact of

changes in short-term rates on earnings. The hedges arranged comprise mainly euro-denominated interest rate swaps. In order to benefit from historically low interest rates, 2- and 3-year maturity hedges have been set up. These hedges cover a part of the interest on variable rate borrowings, due in 2017 and first quarter of 2018, against a rise in interest rates.
Interest rate hedging instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. Such value is determined based on measurements of market data, confirmed by banking counterparties.

A part of the Group borrowings being at variable rates as stated in Note 26.4, a rise in short-term rates would therefore have an impact on financial expense.
The sensitivity tests performed, assuming a 100 bp increase in average interest rates compared to the rate curve as of

December 31, 2016 show that the effect on net financial expense (before taxes) would not be significant, taking into account the profile of the Group's borrowings and derivatives in place as of December 31, 2016.

30.4 Counterparty risk on derivatives

Faurecia's counterparty risk connection with its derivatives is not significant as the majority of its derivatives are arranged with banks with strong ratings that form part of its banking pool.

10.7.Statutory Auditors' Report on the consolidated financial statements
This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The Statutory Auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.
To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2016, on: c the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Faurecia; c the justification of our assessments; c the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
I - Opinion on the consolidated financial statements
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at December 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
II - Justification of our assessments
In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: c Note 2.1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting principles applied to calculate the capital gain on the
sale of the Company's Automotive Exteriors activity to Plastic Omnium and the accounting treatment of assets held for sale and discontinued operations, in accordance with IFRS 5. We verified the appropriateness of these principles, their correct application and the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in that Note. c Your Company performs impairment tests on goodwill at each reporting date and also assesses whether fixed assets show any indication of impairment, based on the methods described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding cash flow forecasts and assumptions applied by your Company. We also verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Note 10.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

10 Consolidated financial statements Statutory Auditors' Report on the consolidated financial statements

c Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements concerning corporate income tax specifies that deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. Our work consisted in verifying that this method had been correctly applied and reviewing the forecasts and assumptions supporting the probability of recovering these deferred tax assets.
c As part of our assessment of the accounting principles used by your Company, we verified the methods used to capitalize and amortize development costs. We also verified the recoverable amount of these assets and the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.
III - Specific verification
As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information presented in the Group's management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Legal and financial information
Faurecia parent company financial statements and management report

11.1. Faurecia parent company financial statements and management report

11.1.1. FAURECIA MANAGEMENT REPORT

Management report of the parent company
Faurecia S.A., is a holding company which directly and indirectly provides financial, accounting, IT, executive management and administrative services to companies in the Group.
Sales rose significantly in 2016, increasing to 302.2 million from 253 million the previous year, in line with continued growth in the Group's business. Since 2010, the parent company, Faurecia S.A., has had a pivotal role for the rebilling of services to Group entities. It also centralizes all of the Group's cash management activities.
In addition to providing services to Group subsidiaries, Faurecia invoices trademark royalties, calculated as a proportion of the subsidiaries' sales. These royalties, extended since 2015 to all companies wholly owned by the Group, totaled 93 million in 2016, versus 86.5 million in 2015.
Results of operations
The Company ended 2016 with an operating profit of 26.4 million, compared with 56.8 million in 2015.
Net financial income totaled 39.9 million compared to net financial income of 152.8 million in 2015.
This change is due to the following: the fact that 2015 had been positively impacted by the absorption of the company Financière Faurecia through the transfer of all assets and liabilities, in the amount of 22.3 million; the drop in net reversals of provisions for foreign exchange losses, totaling 1.6 million versus 29.4 million in 2015; no reversal of provisions on equity investments versus a reversal of 20.1 million in 2015; the drop in the amortization of bond issue premiums, amounting to 1.9 million versus 15.8 million in 2015; and an increase in the amortization of the bond redemption premium, amounting to 31.5 million versus 20.2 million in 2015.
In 2016, the Company posted net non-recurring income of 8.1 million, versus a loss of 2.9 million in 2015.
Tax income amounted to 25.6 million, compared with 19.3 million for fiscal year 2015. This corresponds to the

tax income recognized from the positive earnings of French subsidiaries that are part of the consolidated tax group.
Net income for the fiscal year showed a profit of 100 million. This compares with a profit of 226 million in 2015.
Financial structure and net debt
The principal operations which affected the Company's financial structure are as follows:
On December 7, 2015, Faurecia announced its intention to reimburse at par value on January 15, 2016 the OCEANE bonds issued in September 2012, with a principal amount of 250 million, maturing on January 1, 2018. Following this announcement, 94.5% of the OCEANE bonds have been converted as of December 31, 2015, and the principal amount of remaining bonds outstanding at this date was 13.7 million. As of January 15, 2016, almost the entire amount has been converted and the residual nominal of 0.2 million has been reimbursed.
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.
They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA after certain adjustments is lower than twice the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to those of the syndicated credit loan. No guarantees were issued by Group subsidiaries in this respect.
In November 2011 and February 2012, Faurecia had issued 490 million worth of bonds, due December 15, 2016. These bonds carried interest at 9.375% and benefited from a guarantee from certain Group subsidiaries. They were redeemed early ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of the par plus interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million.

This early redemption eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility of 1,200 million (below) and the 3.125% bonds maturing in 2022, issued in March and April 2015 for a total of 700 million.
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia had signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.
This credit facility includes only one covenant concerning compliance with consolidated financial ratios: net debt*/ EBITDA** must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2016 this credit facility was not drawn.
At December 31, 2016, the shareholders' equity in the Company before distribution of the period's earnings amounted to 3,049.4 million compared to 3,020.7 million at the close of 2015. It thus increased by 28.7 million.
At December 31, 2016, Faurecia's financial resources amounted to 206.4 million, taking into account its gross debt, net of available funds, marketable securities and advances net of intra-group cash and loans, compared with net cash and cash equivalents of 80.8 million at December 31, 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, 4.91% of the Company's debt was at floating rates. The Company hedges its exposure to changes in interest rates on this debt through interest rate derivatives.
Trade accounts payable equaling 20.7 million do not include invoices past due; these break down as follows:

11.1.2.3. Notes to the 2016 parent company financial statements
NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The annual financial statements were established in accordance with the general principles for preparing and presenting annual financial statements (ANC Regulation No. 14-03 of June 5, 2014), relating to the PCG [Plan Comptable Général (General Accounting Plan)], amended by the regulations of the Comité de la Réglementation Comptable [Accounting Regulations Committee] and the Autorité des Normes Comptables [Accounting Standards Authority]. The main policies applied are as follows:
1.1 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition or production cost. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: c buildings: twenty to thirty years; c building improvements, fixtures and fittings: seven to ten
years; c other fixtures and fittings: ten years; c office equipment and computers: three to five years; c software: one to three years; c furniture: ten years.
1.2 Investments
Gross value is equal to contribution value or cost. A provision is made if the value in use of a security is lower than its entry value. Value in use is based on the subsidiary's revalued net assets, profitability and future outlook. For investments intended to be sold, value-in-use estimates also take into account prices at which prior transactions were carried out, if any.
1.3 Marketable securities and related receivables
Marketable securities are stated at the lower of cost or market value.

1.4 Foreign currency transactions
Unhedged payables and receivables in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. At the balance sheet date, they are remeasured at the year-end exchange rate. Gains or losses resulting therefrom are recognized under "Unrealized foreign exchange losses" for unrealized losses and under "Unrealized foreign exchange gains" for unrealized gains. Hedged payables and receivables are translated at the hedging rate.
1.5 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at their nominal value.
1.6 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits
The vested rights of employees under supplementary pension and retirement bonus plans are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The valuation takes into account the probability of employees staying with the Company up to retirement age and expected future compensation levels. In cases where the funds are permanently allocated to the benefit plan concerned, their value is deducted from the related liability.
1.7 Non-recurring items
Unusual or non-recurring items are included under "Nonrecurring income" and "Non-recurring expense".
1.8 Financial instruments
Interest-rate risks are hedged, where appropriate, using financial instruments traded on organized or over-the-counter markets. Hedging gains and losses are recognized on a symmetrical basis with the loss or gain on the hedged item.

NOTE 2 HIGHLIGHTS AND POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

2023 bonds issue
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
Redemption of 2016 bonds
In November 2011 and February 2012, Faurecia had issued 490 million worth of bonds, due December 15, 2016. These bonds carried interest at 9.375% and benefited from a guarantee from certain Group subsidiaries. They were redeemed early ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of the par plus

interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million. This early redemption also eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and 2022 bonds.
Renegotiation of syndicated credit facility
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions. No significant post-balance sheet events have occurred.

(1) Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits cover the following costs payable by the Company on retirement of employees: c post-retirement benefit obligations; c supplementary pensions paid to some employees.

For the latter, it is freed of its commitments by a capital stock deduction that covers the annuity for the insurance company, which is responsible for the service; the deduction is made from a fund established to cover pension benefits which are not yet fully acquired. Consequently, the Company has no further pension commitments towards former employees.

PROVISIONS

The actuarial valuation was carried out by independent actuaries. The calculations were based on a discount rate of 1.5% and an inflation rate of 1.8%.
The change in the provision in 2015 was mainly due to the commitment relating to the specific supplementary pension scheme for Executive Committee members, comprising a defined benefit plan for members who are French nationals and a defined contribution scheme for those who are foreign nationals, which was approved during the year. It guarantees an annuity based on the amount of the reference salary.

The main components of Faurecia financing are described below:
2016 bonds
In November 2011 and February 2012, Faurecia had issued 490 million worth of bonds, due December 15, 2016. These bonds carried interest at 9.375% and benefited from a guarantee from certain Group subsidiaries. They were redeemed early ("make-whole") on April 12, 2016 at 106.34% of the par plus interest accrued at that date, for a total amount of 536 million. This early redemption also eliminated the guarantees on the syndicated credit facility and 2022 bonds.
2022 bonds
In 2015, Faurecia issued bonds, due June 15, 2022, carrying annual interest of 3.125%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2015.
A first part of these bonds has been issued on March 17, 2015 for 500 million. An additional 200 million bond was issued on April 9, 2015, with the same due date and same coupon, at 100.25% of the nominal value. On May 19, 2015, the bonds of this second tranche were wholly assimilated to those issued on March 17, 2015.
They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA after some adjustments is lower than two times the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to the ones of the syndicated credit loan.

They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds. The bonds benefit from guarantees from some Group affiliates; the entities providing these guarantees are the same as those that guarantee the bonds due December 2016. These guarantees have been eliminated with the full redemption of these 2016 bonds.
2023 bonds
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.
These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.
Syndicated credit facility
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.

Legal and financial information
Faurecia parent company financial statements and management report

In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed, on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2016 this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility includes only one covenant concerning compliance with consolidated financial ratios: the net debt*/ EBITDA** must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.

2018 OCEANE
On September 18, 2012 Faurecia had issued 250 million worth of OCEANE bonds convertible into and/or exchangeable for new or existing shares, due January 1, 2018. These bonds of a principal amount of 19.48 carried interest at 3.25%.
On December 7, 2015, Faurecia announced its intention to reimburse the OCEANE bonds at par value on January 15, 2016. Following this announcement, 94.5% of the OCEANE bonds have been converted as of December 31, 2015, and the principal amount of remaining bonds outstanding at this date was 13.7 million. As of January 15, 2016, almost the entire amount has been converted and the residual nominal of 0.2 million has been reimbursed.

The Statutory Auditors' report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.

These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
I. Opinion on the financial statements
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.

11.4. Additional information on Faurecia

11.4.1. BACKGROUND

Origins
1891. The first automobiles, in the modern sense, are made, powered by gasoline engines. The first steel tubes follow, patented by Peugeot. They are produced mainly at Audincourt, in the Doubs region of eastern France.
1914. Bertrand Faure opens his first workshop, making seats for Paris trams and underground trains, at Levallois-Perret.
1929. Bertrand Faure acquired the license for the Epeda process, enabling the Company to improve its seats for the automotive industry and develop a new product, the spring mattress. Both businesses took off significantly after the Second World War. Bertrand Faure clients include Renault, Peugeot, Citroën, Talbot, Panhard-Levassor, Berliet and Simca.
1950. Bernard Deconinck, son-in-law of Joseph Allibert, founder of the Allibert company in Isère (eastern France) in 1910, decides to invest in a huge injection press, imported from the USA, able to mold large plastic parts in a single piece. He changed his customer base from refrigerator manufacturers to the automotive industry.
1955. The Frères Peugeot company, with subsidiaries including Peugeot et Cie, started producing automotive equipment. The companies diversified over the years, making seats, exhaust systems, and steering columns. They extended operations outside France, dropping some products to concentrate on new lines.
1972. François Sommer, grandson of Alfred Sommer, merged his automotive floor coverings company with that of Bernard Deconinck's company, Allibert. They combined their know-how in textiles and plastics to found the Sommer Allibert group.
In the early 1980s, Sommer Allibert invested heavily to meet the needs of the automotive industry and became a leading specialist in interior vehicle fittings for all of the major automakers. International expansion followed, with the acquisition of Spainbased Lignotock, and an extended presence in Germany from 1993.
1987. Cycles Peugeot merged with Aciers & Outillages Peugeot to form Ecia (Équipements et Composants pour l'Industrie Automobile), the PSA Peugeot Citroën group's specialist automotive equipment subsidiary. Over the next ten years, Ecia underwent concentrated industrial and geographical development.

1990. Epeda Bertrand Faure, a company having started out manufacturing seats for transport vehicles such as automobiles, railroad passenger cars, and trams, gradually diversifies into various business segments: first of all, bedding with the Epeda and Mérinos brands, then luggage with Delsey in 1982, and lastly aeronautics with Ratier-Figeac in 1987. Nevertheless, its core business was still manufacturing components for car seats, particularly for the French market. From 1977, it acquired businesses in Portugal, Spain and Canada and gained a toehold in Germany, but the Company's international expansion entered a new phase in 1990 when it acquired the Rentrop group in Germany. Epeda Bertrand Faure then became the European leader in automotive seating. Throughout the 1990s until 1998, the Company concentrated its expertise in automotive equipment, selling off its other businesses in bedding (Epeda and Mérinos), aeronautics (Ratier-Figeac) and luggage (Delsey).
1992. Ecia sold its cycle business, then its tool business the following year and made significant acquisitions in companies specializing in exhaust, with Tubauto and Eli Échappement in France, Leistritz Abgastechnik in Germany and Silenciadores PCG in Spain. Ecia then became the European leader in exhaust systems. At the same time, its Automotive Seating Division joined forces with the Spanish automotive equipment supplier Irausa to form Ardasa. The Company supplied exhaust systems, seats, interior fittings and front ends to Volkswagen, Renault, Daimler Chrysler, Opel, Honda and Mitsubishi.
December 11, 1997. Ecia made a friendly takeover bid for Bertrand Faure, bringing its direct and indirect stake in the Group to 99%. While Bertrand Faure sold its luggage (Delsey) and aeronautics (Ratier-Figeac) businesses, Ecia sold its motorcycle business (Peugeot Motocycles) to the PSA Peugeot Citroën group in 1998.
June 1, 1999. Ecia and Bertrand Faure merged giving birth to the Faurecia company, resulting in the PSA Peugeot Citroën group holding a 52.6% stake in Faurecia by the end of 1999. Faurecia then reported sales of over 4 billion, with a workforce of 32,000. Apart from boosting its size and its global position in automotive seating, Bertrand Faure also provided Ecia with a broader geographical and commercial presence, especially in Germany, where the Company had strong links with automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW.

Late 1999. The Faurecia group developed its exhaust systems business in North America by acquiring the US company AP Automotive Systems.
October 2000. Faurecia purchased Sommer Allibert. The PSA Peugeot Citroën group finances the transaction, thus increasing its shareholding in Faurecia to 71.5%. Well established in Germany and Spain, the Group commanded a significant European market share for vehicle interior fittings, especially door and instrument panels and acoustic modules.
2001. The acquisition of Sommer Allibert was completed with a public offer to buy out Sommer Allibert's minority shareholders. The resulting Group has sales of 9.6 billion. Faurecia then bought out the remaining minority shares held by external shareholders in Sommer Allibert's German subsidiary SAI Automotive AG.
2002. The Faurecia group acquired 49% of the South Korean catalytic converter maker Daeki Industrial, number two in its market. The same year, Faurecia formed a joint venture with the Taiwanese automotive equipment company GSK, with a view to making seats at Wuhan, in China.
2003. Faurecia followed up these acquisitions by buying the South Korean exhaust systems company Chang Heung Precision, which had market share of over 20%. This gave Faurecia's Exhaust Systems business a manufacturing presence in all continents. In Europe, the Group signs an agreement with Siemens-VDO, which strengthens and expands their joint venture (SAS): this company assembles cockpits for BMW, Daimler Chrysler, the Ford group, Renault-Nissan and the Volkswagen group.
2005. The Group strengthened its presence in Korea by increasing its shareholding in Daeki (specializing in exhaust systems for Hyundai) to 100%, and signed a joint-venture agreement with the South Korean company Kwang Jin Sang Gong (specializing in door modules for Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors).
2007. The Group took over the bumper activity of Cadence Innovation France, thus strengthening its market position in this sector in France.
2009. Faurecia acquired Emcon Technologies (formerly Arvin Industries), and became the world leader in exhaust systems. This business combination strengthens Faurecia's position with automakers in Germany (as Arvin Industries acquired Zeuna Stärker in 1998), the USA (particularly Ford), South America, India and Thailand. It gave Faurecia a route into the niche commercial-vehicles market (trucks and off road). With this allequity acquisition, One Equity Partners, (JP Morgan Chase & Co.'s private equity arm) holds a 17.3% stake in Faurecia and PSA Peugeot Citroën's interest was reduced to 57.4%.
Faurecia bought out its joint-venture partner Tata to become the sole owner of Taco Faurecia Design Center. The company was renamed Faurecia Automotive Engineering India and became Faurecia's development center in India.

2010. Faurecia becomes the European leader in automotive exterior parts by acquiring the German activities of Plastal, and subsequently Plastal España S.A.. With these transactions, the Faurecia Automotive Exteriors Business Group enlarges its customer base, which now includes Ford and Germany's four premium automakers, upgrades its product range, and strengthens both its industrial presence and its R&D capacity. It was able to expand internationally, setting up a joint venture in China with Huaxiang, supplier of exterior parts to FAWVolkswagen.
By acquiring an 18.75% stake in the Chinese automotive equipment supplier Changchun Xuyang Industry (Group) Co., Ltd., Faurecia expands the range of products and services supplied in the following strategic fields: complete seats, interior systems, acoustic modules, and interior upholstery. A strategic alliance with the Geely and Limin groups marks a significant new development stage for Faurecia Interior Systems and Faurecia Automotive Exteriors in China.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, Faurecia Automotive Seating bought the "seat comfort technology" business of the German company Hoerbiger Automotive Komfortsysteme GmbH, and diversified its technological offer in seating systems.
Finally, to strengthen the technological prowess of Faurecia Interior Systems, the Group acquired Angell-Demmel Europe GmbH, the world leader in decorative metal parts for automobile interiors.
2011. In January, Faurecia takes a 21.2% stake in the Danish company, Amminex A/S, thus strengthening its technology towards diesel-emission control.
Faurecia also reinforced its presence in China by signing, in January, a new joint venture agreement with Ningbo Huazhong Plastic Products Co. Ltd to make exterior automobile parts; and, in June, by enlarging the scope of its cooperation with the Changchun Xuyang group. This allowed it to develop locally, specifically with the FAW group. In July, it signed an agreement with the Economic and Technological Development Zone of Yancheng for an investment project allowing Faurecia to develop its seat-mechanism activity.
In November, Faurecia launches a 350 million bond issue maturing in December 2016. (The issue is supplemented by another 140 million issue in February 2012 with the same maturity date). Another syndicated line of credit is arranged for 1,150 billion, in two tranches: A (690 million) and B (460 million), maturing in November 2014 and November 2016 respectively.
2012. On May 3, Faurecia announced its acquisition of the Ford ACH interior components plant in Saline, Michigan (USA). This plant supplied cockpit modules, instrument panels, door panels and central consoles for 12 automotive programs assembled in 8 Ford plants across North America.

The transaction followed the previous acquisitions of Plastal Allemagne and Plastal Espagne in 2010, and included the manufacturing and assembly plant and the operational headquarters in Hambach (France).
On September 10, Faurecia issues convertible bonds (OCEANE), maturing on January 1, 2018. After exercising an over-allotment option on September 12, 2012, it raises 249,999,989.00 (12,833,675 bonds).
On November 29, Faurecia launched a level 1 ADR program listed on the "over-the-counter" (OTC) market in the USA. Each Faurecia ordinary share (listed on the NYSE Euronext Paris market) comprised two ADR shares.
2013. On April 10, Faurecia Interior Systems signed a joint venture agreement with the Thai component manufacturer Summit Auto Seats to support Ford in its development in SouthEast Asia, particularly in Thailand.
On April 22, Faurecia and Chang'an Automobile Group, one of the largest automakers in China, signed a joint-venture agreement.
On November 19, Faurecia and Magneti Marelli announced their agreement to cooperate in designing, developing and manufacturing HMI products for vehicle interiors. The agreement will enhance the added value of interior solutions for the vehicles that Faurecia and Magneti Marelli supply to automakers and end customers.
On December 30, Faurecia redeemed early the OCEANE bonds maturing on January 1, 2015 (ISIN FR0010827055). Bond-holders opted virtually unanimously to convert their bonds into Faurecia shares: 11,284,793 shares (99.83% of the total outstanding) were converted into 11,736,190 new Faurecia shares.
2014. On January 29, Faurecia announced the establishment, with the Japanese automotive equipment manufacturer Howa, of a joint venture called Faurecia Howa Interiors, for the production in Mexico of interior systems for Renault-Nissan. The agreement signed opens up new commercial prospects for Faurecia: with Nissan in Mexico, Thailand, Spain, Brazil and in South Africa.
On October 3, Faurecia announced the establishment of 50:50 joint venture with Interval, a major French agricultural cooperative.

This agreement resulted in the establishment of Automotive Performance Materials (APM), which aims to develop and produce biosourced raw materials in order to continue Faurecia's drive to reduce vehicle weight while respecting the environment.
Note that in 2014 Faurecia celebrated 20 years of presence in China. It was also the year in which Faurecia returned to the Paris Motor Show after an absence of 12 years.
2015. On March 27, Faurecia and Dongfeng Hongtai, a subsidiary majority owned by Dongfeng Motor Corporation, one of the largest automotive groups in China, enter into a broad partnership agreement covering all of Faurecia's business activities. The first result of this partnership is the formation, in May 2015, of two joint ventures, one with a view to the development, manufacture and delivery of automotive interior components (Dongfeng Faurecia Automotive Interior Co., Ltd.) and the other with a view to the development, manufacture and delivery of automotive exterior components (Dongfeng Faurecia Automotive Exterior Co., Ltd.).

On October 2, Faurecia and Azin Khodro signed a partnership agreement for the set-up of a joint venture in Iran (Azin Faurecia Interior Systems Company), to develop and produce instrument panels, door panels, central consoles and acoustic modules, with production due to be launched in early 2018.
On November 29, Faurecia and German premium automaker Borgward signed a partnership agreement for the set-up of a joint venture (Borgward Faurecia Auto Systems Co., Ltd) in Tianjin, China, to jointly develop and produce complete automotive seats for the new Borgward vehicles.
On December 2, Faurecia signed a partnership agreement with MAAD, an Iranian joint venture made up of the Iranian groups Crouse and Avrand, for the purpose of setting up another joint venture, Faurecia Crouse Advanced Exhaust System Co. to develop and produce emission control systems for the Iranian automobile market. The start of production is scheduled for the beginning of 2017.
On December 6, Faurecia announced that it had entered into exclusive talks with Parrot Automotive, one of the leaders in

connectivity and infotainment solutions for the automotive industry, in view of developing applications and platforms for connected vehicles. The first step would consist in acquiring a 20% stake in Parrot Automotive. Faurecia could increase its stake to 50.01% as from 2019 and acquire all Parrot Automotive shares by 2022. If the talks are successful, the project would be launched in the first half of 2017.
On December 13, Faurecia, who had been working in close collaboration with Danish company Amminex since mid-2009 and held 42% of its capital stock, announced that it had increased its stake in this company to 91.5%. The remaining shares are held by the Danish foundation Nordea-fonden. Amminex has developed an ammonia storage and delivery system (ASDSTM) which has shown its efficiency in eliminating nitrogen oxides (NOx) in diesel engines. By increasing its stake in this company, Faurecia intends to step up the development of this technology for utility vehicles, trucks and passenger vehicles. Faurecia is also seriously looking into other applications for ASDSTM, such as for agricultural vehicles, earthmoving machinery and the highpower engines used in boats and ships.

FISCAL YEAR
The Company's fiscal year covers the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31.

DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS
Income available for distribution corresponds to net income for the year, less any losses carried forward from prior years and any amounts appropriated to reserves in compliance with the law or the bylaws, plus any retained earnings.
Out of this income, the General Meeting determines the portion attributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and deducts the amounts it considers appropriate to allocate to any reserve funds or to carry forward.
However, except in the case of a capital stock reduction, no distributions may be made to shareholders if the Company's shareholders' equity represents ­ or would represent after the planned distribution ­ less than its capital stock plus any reserves which, according to the law or the bylaws, are not available for distribution.
The General Meeting may also decide to distribute amounts deducted from optional reserves in order to pay or increase a dividend or pay a special dividend.
The Company's bylaws provide that the Ordinary General Meeting approving the financial statements for the year may also decide to offer each shareholder the option between the payment of the dividend or the interim dividend in cash or in shares.
DIVIDENDS ­ STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
Dividends not collected within five years of the payment date will be time-barred and paid over to the French Treasury.
REGISTRAR AND PAYING AGENT
The registrar and paying agent for Faurecia shares is Caceis Corporate Trust, 14, rue Rouget-de-Lisle, 92862 Issy-lesMoulineaux Cedex 9, France.

A continually updated sched all of the Group's financial events, including the date of the General Meetings, is available on Faurecia's website at www.faurecia.com.
The right to participate in General Meetings shall be substantiated in accordance with the current statutory provisions.
The rights of shareholders, which may only be amended in accordance with the conditions laid down by French law, are not affected by any other provision of the bylaws.
VOTING RIGHTS
The Company's bylaws do not provide for any restrictions on voting rights. Voting rights at Ordinary, Extraordinary and Special General Meetings are exercisable by the beneficial owner of the shares.
DOUBLE VOTING RIGHTS
The bylaws assign double voting rights to all fully paid-up shares that have been registered in the name of the same holder for at least two (2) years. In the case of a bonus share issue paid up by capitalizing retained earnings, income or additional paidin capital, the bonus shares allotted in respect of registered shares carrying double voting rights will also carry double voting rights as from the date of issue. This double voting right may be canceled following a decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting and after having informed a special meeting of the beneficiary shareholders.
Shares that are transferred or converted to bearer form are stripped of double voting rights. However, double voting rights are not lost and the above-mentioned two-year period continues to run when shares are transferred following the liquidation of a marital estate, or by way of an inheritance or in the form of an inter vivos gift to a spouse or a relative in the direct line of succession.
EQUITY THRESHOLDS THAT MUST BE DISCLOSED TO THE COMPANY
Under Article 29 of the bylaws, when any natural person or legal entity, acting alone or with others as defined in Article L. 23310 of the French Code of commerce, owns or ceases to own a number of shares so that the capital stock or voting rights held cross a threshold of 2% or any multiple of 2% (or when the holding crosses the thresholds defined in the law and regulation), that person must notify the Company by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt of the total number of shares and voting rights he or she holds, within four (4) trading days of the threshold being crossed. This applies in addition to the obligations relating to crossing legally-defined thresholds.
In the case of failure to comply, at the request of one or several shareholders present or represented at the meeting with combined holdings representing at least 2% of the capital stock or voting rights, the undisclosed shares will be stripped of voting rights. Said request must be recorded in the minutes of the General Meeting.

This provision supplements the statutory requirements concerning disclosure thresholds in Article L. 233-7 of the French Code of commerce.
The rights of shareholders, which may only be amended in accordance with the conditions laid down by French law, are not affected by any other provision of the bylaws.
AGREEMENT THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD CHANGE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY OR THAT COULD DELAY, POSTPONE, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL
To the best of the Company's knowledge there are no arrangements in place whose operation could result in a change in control of the Company at a future date.
There are currently no deeds, bylaws, charters, regulations or provisions in place that could delay, postpone or prevent such a change in control.
AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY WHICH ARE AMENDED OR TERMINATED IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
The syndicated loan agreement entered into by the Company on December 15, 2014 includes an acceleration clause under which ­ subject to certain conditions ­ each bank may require immediate payment of outstanding sums in the event of a change of ownership of the Company.
The bonds issued, firstly on March 17 and April 9, 2015 and secondly on April 1, 2016, provide for early repayment in the event of a change of control.
None of the above transactions include a minimum Peugeot S.A. shareholding clause.
MEASURES TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL IS NOT EXERCISED IN AN ABUSIVE MANNER
The Company is controlled in the sense of Article L. 233-3 of the French Code of commerce, as shown in the table breaking down ownership in Section 11.3.2.

MAJOR CONTRACTS
To date, Faurecia has not entered into any major contracts that would entail a significant obligation or commitment for the Group, other than those that fall within the ordinary course of business.
DEPENDENCE
Faurecia is not currently dependent on any patents or manufacturing processes owned by third parties or on any specific supply contracts to conduct its business.
In the automotive-industry sector in which Faurecia operates, subcontractors do not generally define the technical specifications for subcontracted parts. When on rare occasions subcontractors are in a position to do this, the Group's policy is to contractually arrange for the subcontractor concerned to transfer the relevant design work in order for it to be used in conjunction with other services.
SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The Group's 300 manufacturing sites, including 30 research and development centers spanning 34 countries worldwide, enable it to maximize its local presence and implement its just-in-time delivery strategy. None of its manufacturing equipment taken on an individual basis represents a material value in relation to

the property, plant and equipment of the Group as a whole. They are mostly dedicated to client programs. As a result, utilization rates are largely dependent on business levels. With very few exceptions, utilization rates for equipment and facilities are not monitored centrally or systematically.
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information on the Group's property, plant and equipment.
FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT A PUBLIC OFFERING
The information provided by Article L. 225-100-3 of the French Code of commerce is mentioned in Sections 9.1.1, 11.3.2, and Sections 11.4.2.1 and 11.4.2.2 of this Registration Document.
11.4.2.2. Additional information on the Company's capital stock
As of December 31, 2016, the Company's capital stock amounted to 966,250,607, divided into 138,035,801 fully paid-up shares with a par value of 7 each, all of the same class. Excluding shares with no voting rights, they represented 202,307,063 theoretical voting rights and 201,499,847 exercisable voting rights. No shares have been issued that do not represent the Company's capital stock.

Performance shares
Faurecia's Senior Management, which comprises around 300 people, and the Chief Executive Officer benefit from the performance share plans set up by the Company.
The Company's policy in this respect is based on simple, transparent, enduring principles. Thus:
c performance shares have been granted annually since 2010 at the same periods, involving, since that year, an internal performance condition and a presence condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
c since 2013, the conditions have also included an external performance condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
c since 2013, the vesting period applicable to the plans has been 4 years as from their grant date for all French and foreign beneficiaries; the plans comprise no holding period;
c the number of shares that may be granted to the beneficiary under each plan is determined using an external benchmark from which are deduced a minimum number of shares (50%) and a maximum number (130%). In all cases, the final grant depends on the fulfillment of performance and presence conditions.
The performance conditions are the following:
c 60% fulfillment of an internal performance condition related since 2016 to the Group net income after tax (before 2016, Group net income before tax), before taking into account any exceptional events. This internal condition is assessed by comparing the net result of the third fiscal year after the allocation date of the performance shares against the one as forecasted in the Group's medium-term plan reviewed and

approved by the Board of Directors on the allocation date of the performance shares; and
c 40% fulfillment of an external performance condition, i.e., growth of the Company's net earnings per share assessed between the last fiscal year before the allocation date of the performance shares and the third fiscal year ended after the allocation date of the performance shares. This condition is assessed against the weighted growth of a reference group made up of twelve comparable international automotive equipment suppliers over the same period.
The reference group is made up of the following European and North American automotive equipment suppliers:
c Autoliv (Sweden)
c Autoneum (formerly Rieter) (Switzerland)
c Borg Warner (United States)
c Continental (Germany)
c Delphi (United States)
c GKN (United Kingdom)
c Adient (United States)
c Lear (United States)
c Magna (Canada)
c Plastic Omnium (France)
c Tenneco (United States)
c Valeo (France)
This group generally remains stable but may be modified in the event of a major change concerning one of its members.

Convertible or exchangeable bonds (OCEANE)
On September 18, 2012, based on the authority given to the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of May 23, 2012, the Board of Directors' decision on August 31, 2012, and subsequent decisions by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on September 10 and 12, 2012, Faurecia issued 12,833,675 bonds maturing on January 1, 2018 (gross issue value 249,999,989).
The unit nominal value for the bonds was set at 19.48 and they are redeemable at par on January 1, 2018. The bonds bear annual interest of 3.25% (i.e. 0.63 per year and per bond) payable on January 1, each year, as from January 1, 2013.
On December 7, 2015, Faurecia announced its decision to proceed with the early redemption of all 8,479,891 outstanding bonds, effective January 15, 2016.
Until January 6, 2016 inclusive, holders of OCEANE bonds had the option of either converting them into shares, at the rate of 1.02 Faurecia shares for each OCEANE redeemed, or receiving a cash payment, on January 15, 2016, of 19.504 per OCEANE including accrued interest.
Within this early redemption procedure, bond-holders opted virtually unanimously to convert their OCEANE bonds into Faurecia shares: 8,454,791 OCEANE bonds (99.83% of the total outstanding) were converted into 8,623,867 new Faurecia shares.
As of December 31, 2016, there were no OCEANE bonds outstanding.
TRADING BY THE COMPANY IN ITS OWN SHARES DURING 2016 (ARTICLE L. 225-211 OF THE FRENCH CODE OF COMMERCE)
The General Meeting of May 27, 2016 authorized the implementation of a share buy-back program, superseding that authorized in the tenth resolution of the General Meeting of May 27, 2015.
TREASURY STOCK (EXCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY CONTRACT)
In 2016, the Company bought back 800,000 shares at the average price of 31.56 (weighted gross price).
Trading costs amounted to 15,150.25 excluding VAT.
The value of these shares, measured at their purchase price, totals 25,250,413.39.
These 800,000 shares were purchased to cover the performance share plans. None of the 800,000 shares purchased in 2016 were used in 2016 and none of them were re-allocated.
At December 31, 2016, the Company held 807,216 treasury shares, i.e. 0.59% of the Company's capital stock on that date (see Note 22.3 to the consolidated financial statements).

LIQUIDITY CONTRACT
Since April 27, 2009, Faurecia has been implementing a liquidity agreement that complies with the AMAFI Code of Ethics.
In 2016, under this liquidity agreement, 1,852,378 shares were purchased, i.e. 1.34% of the Company's capital stock, for a total of 60,674,094.37, while 1,852,378 shares were sold for a total of 60,804,471.22.
As of December 31, 2016, assets in the liquidity account relating to the liquidity agreement comprised 0 shares and 4,690,527.96 in cash.
In 2016, the capital gain made through the liquidity agreement amounted to 130,376.85. Management fees for the liquidity agreement came to 100.00 in 2016.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUY-BACK PROGRAM
(Defined according to Article 241-2 of the AMF's General Regulation)
A new share buyback authorization will be submitted to the General Meeting of May 30, 2017, with the following terms and conditions:
Resolution eighteen ­ Authorisation to the Board of Directors aiming to allow the Company to buy back its own shares pursuant to Article L. 225-209 of the French Code of commerce, duration of authorisation, purposes, conditions, ceiling, suspension during public offerings
The General Meeting, after having read the report by the Board of Directors, authorises the latter, for a period of eighteen months, in accordance with Articles L. 225-209 and subsequent of the French Code of commerce, to purchase company shares, in one or several instalments, as such times that it deems appropriate, capped at 10% of the total number of shares in the Company's share capital, adjusted to take into account any possible increase or decrease in the share capital that may occur during the program.
This authorisation terminates the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Combined General Meeting of May 27, 2016 (ordinary resolution eleven).
Acquisitions are authorised in order to:
c support the secondary market or the liquidity of Faurecia shares, through an investment service provider under a liquidity contract, in accordance with the AMAFI (French association of stock markets) Code of Ethics, as allowed by regulations;
c retain the shares purchased and use these shares for exchange or payment at a later stage, as part of any possible external growth transactions;
c hedge stock option plans and/or free grant of shares plans (or similar plans) to the benefit of employees and/or Group corporate officers, as well as all allocations of shares as part of a group or company savings plan (or similar plan), under a profit-sharing plan and or any other form of allocation of shares to the benefit of the Group employees and/or corporate officers;

11 Legal and financial information Additional information on Faurecia

c hedge securities giving access to the allocation of Company shares subject to the regulations in force;
c cancel the shares acquired, if applicable, subject to the current or future authorisation of an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Such shares may be purchased by any means, including by acquiring blocks of shares, and at such times deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors may not, without the prior authorisation of the Annual General Meeting, use this authorisation during a public offering launched by a third party, involving company shares, until the end of the offering.
The company reserves the right to use optional mechanisms or derivatives products subject to the applicable regulations.
The maximum purchase price per share is defined as 60 (sixty euros). In the event of transactions affecting the share capital,

in particular division or regrouping of shares or allocation of free shares, the aforementioned amount will be adjusted in the same proportions (multiplication coefficient equal to the ratio of the number of company shares prior to the transaction to the number of shares after the transaction).
On this basis, and for information only, the maximum amount, which the Company would pay, assuming a maximum purchase price of 60 (sixty euros), would amount to 779,781,840 on the basis of the share capital on December 31, 2016 (consisting of 138,035,801 shares), taking into account the 807,216 company treasury shares on this date.
The General Meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors, with a sub-delegation option in accordance with legal provisions, to carry out these operations, set the conditions and procedures thereof, enter into all agreements and carry out all of the required formalities.

1.4 Principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding compensation to the executive and non-executive corporate officers (6th and 7th resolutions)
The principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding compensation to the executive and non-executive corporate officers as required by paragraph 1 of Article L. 22537-2 of the French Code of commerce derived from French Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016, on transparency, anticorruption measures and the modernization of the economy are described below; these paragraphs constitute the report referred to in the aforementioned Article presenting the sixth and seventh resolutions for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer respectively.
In this regard, Faurecia's Board of Directors, acting on the recommendations of the Governance Committee for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and on the recommendations of the Management committee for the Chief Executive Officer, with both committees being comprised of a majority of independent Board members, ensures the enforcement of the principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of listed corporations regarding the determination of the compensation of executive and non-executive corporate officers of companies whose securities are traded on a regulated market.
Under these circumstances, upon the separation of the functions of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer that took effect on July 1, 2016, the Board of Directors reexamined the compensation of the Company's executive and non-executive corporate officers in their entirety.
PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING, ALLOCATING AND AWARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (6th RESOLUTION)
In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors ensures in particular that the compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is adapted to the missions given, consistent with good market practices and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders in the Company's business.
On this basis and within the context of the separation of the functions of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer that took effect on July 1, 2016, the Board of Directors, on the recommendations of the Governance Committee, decided that the annual fixed compensation is the only element of the compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, with the exclusion of any other compensation.
Hence the Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive any variable compensation, termination payment or noncompetition indemnity, nor does he collect attendance fees. Moreover, the Board of Directors does not plan to pay any exceptional compensation.

The Board of Directors has not set any rules regarding the frequency of review of the fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors; however, it is understood that in practice the Board of Directors reviews this compensation annually.
To do this, the Board of Directors refers to a comparative compensation analysis prepared by an outside consultant based on a sample of French listed companies that have a separated governance structure, and it takes into account the current Chairman's profile and his role as it appears in the Board of Directors' internal rules and that is described as follows:
"The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the effective operation of the Board and its committees, in accordance with good governance principles.
The Chairman must:
c promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance across the Group, particularly at the Board level, thus ensuring the effectiveness thereof;
c manage the relations between Board members and the Chairs of the committees and, in this respect:
c promote effective working relations and open communication, and foster an environment that enables constructive discussions and the sharing of information between Board members and the Chief Executive Officer, during and outside meetings,
c lead and govern the Board so as to create the conditions required for the overall effectiveness of the Board and its members, and ensure that all key and relevant issues are adequately prepared and discussed by the Board of Directors and the various committees in a timely fashion,
c schedule and set the agenda of the Board meetings, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board, to take full account of the Group's major challenges and issues raised by Board members, and ensure that sufficient time is devoted to thoroughly discuss significant and strategic matters,
c address any conflicts of interest,
c conduct, with the help of the Governance Committee, assessments of the Board of Directors, searches for new Board members and their induction program;
c organize, with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairs of the various committees, the preparation of and chair Annual Shareholders' Meetings, oversee the relations and ensure effective communication with shareholders;
c manage the relation with the Chief Executive Officer:
c act as a competent advisor for the Chief Executive Officer on all issues regarding the interests and management of the Company,
c ensure that the strategies and policies adopted by the Board are effectively implemented by the Chief Executive Officer; without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Board of Directors and its committees, the Chairman is regularly

298

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Explanatory notes to the resolutions

provided information by the Chief Executive Officer about significant events concerning the Company's strategy, in line with the objectives set by the Board of Directors, as well as about major external growth projects, significant financial transactions, societal actions, or appointments of Business Group managers and other key positions within the Company. The Chairman receives from the Chief Executive Officer all information necessary to coordinate the work of the Board of Directors and its committees;
c coordinate or conduct specific projects. In particular, at the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman may represent the Company before stakeholders, public authorities, financial institutions, major shareholders and/or key business partners."
PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING, ALLOCATING AND AWARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (7th RESOLUTION)
In accordance with the principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of listed corporations, the Board of Directors makes sure to structure the various elements of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, who is not an employee, so as to view his actions on a long-term basis and enable an alignment of his interests with the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
On this basis and as part of the separation of the functions of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which took effect on July 1, 2016, the Board of Directors, on the recommendations of the Management Committee, decided that the Chief Executive Officer's compensation would be structured as follows:
Compensation
The Chief Executive Officer's compensation is based on three main components, among which the variable portion is predominant, and the Board of Directors does not anticipate the payment of an exceptional compensation:
c fixed compensation:
The Board of Directors has not set any rules regarding the frequency of review of the fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer; however, it is understood that in practice the Board of Directors reviews this compensation annually.
To do this, the Board of Directors refers to a comparative compensation analysis prepared by an outside consultant based on a set of twenty comparable French manufacturers;
c annual variable compensation:
For annual variable compensation, the performance conditions incorporate quantitative targets, which are predominant, and qualitative targets that may increase or reduce the variable compensation, it being understood that the award of variable compensation subject to performance conditions is not reserved solely for the Chief Executive Officer.

Therefore, the Chief Executive Officer's variable compensation may range from 0% to 180% of his annual fixed compensation depending on the achievement of the quantitative and qualitative targets:
c the quantitative targets entitle the Chief Executive Officer to variable compensation ranging from 0% to 150% of the annual fixed compensation.
These quantitative targets are connected to operating income and free cash flow:
c the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to variable compensation of between 0% and 150% (maximum percentage) of his fixed annual compensation, depending on the operating income set with reference to the budget for a given year, being understood that achievement of budget means the target being realized at 100%. Operating income accounts for 40%,
c the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to variable compensation of between 0% and 150% (maximum percentage) of his fixed annual compensation, depending on the free cash flow set with reference to the budget for a given year, being understood that achievement of budget means the target being realized at 100%. Free cash flow accounts for 60%.
The expected levels of achievement of these targets are set by the Board of Directors with reference to the budget for a given year but are not made public for confidentiality reasons,
c the quantitative targets are set each year by the Board of Directors. They cover strategic objectives, business development objectives and/or managerial objectives, each one is weighted and when possible they are associated with quantitative indicators.
If some or all of these quantitative targets are met, the qualitative targets met are used to determine a multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. If the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.
It must be noted that in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article L. 225-37-2 of the French Code of commerce, the payment of the variable compensation elements outlined above depends on the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting approving the compensation elements in question for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, under the terms and conditions stipulated by Article L. 225-100 of said Code;
c long-term variable compensation (performance shares):
The Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the performance share plans established by the Company which are subject to performance conditions and a presence condition identical to those set for all beneficiaries of the plans (namely, members of the Senior Management, of whom there are approximately 300). At the end of the grant period of each plan, the Chief Executive Officer must hold a minimum percentage, which is determined by the Board of Directors, of shares that are allocated under the plan in question, until the end of his term as Chief Executive Officer.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

299

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Explanatory notes to the resolutions

The Company's policy in this regard is based on simple, transparent, enduring principles. Thus:
c performance shares have been allocated annually since 2010 at the same periods, involving, since that year, an internal performance condition and a presence condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans,
c since 2013, the conditions have also included an external performance condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans,
c since 2013, the vesting period applicable to the plans has been four years as from their allocation date for all French and foreign beneficiaries; the plans comprise no holding period,
c the number of shares that may be granted to the beneficiary under each plan is determined using an external benchmark from which are deduced a minimum number of shares (50%) and a maximum number (130%). In all cases, the final allocation depends on the fulfillment of performance and presence conditions.
The performance conditions are the following:
c 60% fulfillment of an internal performance condition related since 2016 to the Group net income after tax (before 2016, Group net income before tax), before taking into account any exceptional events. This internal condition is assessed by comparing the net result of the third fiscal year after the allocation date of the performance shares against the one as forecasted in the Group's medium-term plan reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on the allocation date of the performance shares, and

c 40% fulfillment of an external performance condition, i.e., growth of the Company's net earnings per share assessed between the last fiscal year before the allocation date of the performance shares and the third fiscal year ended after the allocation date of the performance shares. This condition is assessed against the weighted growth of a reference group made up of twelve comparable international automotive equipment suppliers over the same period.
The reference group is made up of the following European and North American automotive equipment suppliers:
c Autoliv (Sweden)
c Autoneum (formerly Rieter) (Switzerland)
c Borg Warner (United States)
c Continental (Germany)
c Delphi (United States)
c GKN (United Kingdom)
c Adient (United States)
c Lear (United States)
c Magna (Canada)
c Plastic Omnium (France)
c Tenneco (United States)
c Valeo (France)
This group generally remains stable but may be modified in the event of a major change concerning one of its members.

The Company's long-term compensation practices are reexamined on a regular basis to ensure their compliance with good market practices.
Pension
The Board of Directors also decided to grant to the Chief Executive Officer the same pension scheme as for the members of the Executive Committee.
This scheme is made of an additional defined contribution pension scheme available to all Group managerial staff in France and an additional defined benefits pension scheme.
In accordance with French law, this additional defined benefits pension scheme is subject to performance conditions.
The Board of Directors has also decided that the annual amount of the total pension annuity paid to the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the compulsory and additional Group schemes may not exceed 45% of his reference compensation, defined as being equal to the annual average of the total gross compensation collected within the Company during the three calendar years preceding the termination of service or departure from the Executive Committee.
In this regard, the total annual gross compensation includes the annual base compensation and all bonuses and variable

elements of compensation pertaining to the three calendar years preceding the date of the termination of service, aside from any severance packages, exceptional compensation, sums granted under plans such as performance shares plans, benefits in kind and reimbursement of business expenses, contributions paid by the Company to fund additional pension schemes and personal risk insurance and any other allowances paid by the Company.
Additional defined contribution pension scheme:
The Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension scheme (Article 83 of the General French Tax Code), which is available to all Group managerial staff in France who have completed at least one year of service at the time of their retirement.
This scheme applies to the A and B brackets, amounting to 1% for the A bracket and 6% for the B bracket of the pay without the beneficiary's participation.
Additional defined benefits pension scheme (Article 39 of the General French Tax Code) subject to performance conditions:
The Chief Executive Officer is eligible for an additional defined benefits pension scheme that includes two parts:
c a part that is available, subject to eligibility conditions, to all Group managerial staff in France who have at least five years' seniority upon their retirement.

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

301

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Explanatory notes to the resolutions

Benefits are calculated solely on the basis of bracket C and potential rights increase each year by 1% of this bracket being understood that the reference compensation taken into account upon retirement is the average of the annual compensation collected during the preceding three years in bracket C.
With regard to the Chief Executive Officer, the benefit of this scheme is backed up by the following performance condition, which is tied to his annual variable compensation:
c in case of 80% or greater achievement of the annual variable compensation targets, a 1% increase in potential rights (restricted to bracket C of the compensation) will be granted for the fiscal year in question,
c in case of 80% or lower achievement of the annual variable compensation targets, the increase in rights will be reduced proportionally to the achievement of the targets (e.g., a target that is 30% achieved will result in a 0.30% increase in potential rights);
c an additional part decided by the Board of Directors of February 11, 2015, in favor of Faurecia's Executive Committee members holding an employment contract (current or suspended) or a term of office in France, who have been on the Executive Committee for a minimum term of three calendar years as of the implementation of this scheme or accession to the Executive Committee.
The Company guarantees French beneficiaries an annual annuity level determined according to the Company's operating income, in relation to the budget, as approved by the Board of Directors based on the formula:
 Xi* R R = annual reference compensation (as defined in the preamble in the paragraph "Pension")
Xi = entitlement for each year of seniority (i) equal to:
c 3% if the operating income for the year is strictly more than 105% of the budgeted operating income,
c 2% if the operating income for the year is between 95% and 105% of the budgeted operating income,
c 1% if the operating income for the year is strictly less than 95% of the budgeted operating income.
The operating income for year N is defined based on the income statement as of 12/31/N approved by the Board of Directors in year N+1 and the initial budget for year N approved by the Board of Directors in year N-1.
Each year, the Board of Directors therefore decides how much should be granted, following approval of the financial statements.

In any event, on retirement, the annual pension paid under this plan plus any rights granted by other supplementary plans implemented by the Faurecia group are subject to two limits in addition to the 45% limit referred to in preamble:
c the sums paid by the Group must not exceed 25% of the reference compensation,
c the sums paid by the Group are capped at 8 times the annual social security limit.
Should either of these limits be exceeded, the relevant pension will be reduced accordingly.
Termination payment
The Chief Executive Officer is also the beneficiary of a termination payment, the Board of Directors having decided that the CEO can not be an employee and as a consequence can not enjoy the protective regime attached to such status.
This payment is backed by granting conditions in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:
c the payment is due in case of termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office on the Company's initiative, subject to his not being terminated due to willful misconduct or gross negligence;
c the payment is not be due in case of resignation or retirement;
c the payment is subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions:
c achievement of a positive operating income during each of the three fiscal years preceding the termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office,
c achievement of a positive net cash flow during each of the three fiscal years preceding the termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office;
c the amount of the payment is equal to 24 months of the reference salary (fixed compensation and variable targetbased compensation) insofar as both of the conditions described above are met during each of the three fiscal years in question; in practice, this is equal to the fulfillment of six criteria;
c should one of the six criteria not be met, the termination payment is reduced proportionally by 1/6 and may equal to 0 should none of these six criteria be fulfilled;
c should the Chief Executive Officer's term of office be shorter than three years, the method of calculating the termination payment is identical, but the number of criteria is adjusted to take into account the actual length of the term of office.
Finally, the Chief Executive Officer is eligible for a company car and the medical/life/disability insurance scheme established within the Company.

In 2016, the year in which the Company separated the function of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2016, the annual compensation for executive and non-executive corporate officers was calculated pro rata temporis based on the date on which their new duties took effect.

The elements of compensation due or granted for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, to Mr. Yann Delabrière in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016 and that are submitted to the shareholders for their opinion in the eighth resolution are set out in the table below:

Fixed compensation

Amounts
400,000 (amount paid for the period from January 1, to June 30, 2016)

Presentation
By the Board of Directors' decision of February 11, 2015, the annual fixed compensation of Mr. Yann Delabrière as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was increased to 800,000 as of fiscal year 2015, and it was maintained at that amount by the Board of Directors' decision of February 10, 2016. The 2015 increase from 700,000 to 800,000 was decided upon the following grounds: c a review of the situation of a representative sample of listed
manufacturers comparable to Faurecia revealed a significant discrepancy (more than 10%) compared to the fixed compensation paid to Mr. Delabrière; c Mr. Yann Delabrière's fixed compensation had remained unchanged since 2011, and; c the 2014 financial results reflected the implementation of a mediumand long-term strategy for Faurecia and a structure that suits this strategy.

Presentation
At its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors set the rules for determining Mr. Yann Delabrière's variable compensation for 2016 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board decided that Mr. Yann Delabrière's variable compensation may range from 0% to 180% of his annual fixed compensation depending on the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets. The achievement of the following quantitative targets entitles him to a variable compensation ranging from 0% to 150% of his annual fixed compensation: c 40% of his variable compensation is based on operating income set by
reference to the 2016 budget; c 60% is based on the free cash flow set by reference to the 2016 budget. On the recommendation of the Management Committee on February 1, 2017, the Board of Directors meeting of February 8, 2017, reviewed the extent to which these quantitative criteria had been met: c as regards the operating income, the Board of Directors formally noted
that 141% of this initial quantitative target had been achieved; c as regards free cash flow, the Board of Directors formally noted that
140% of this second quantitative target had been achieved. As a result of these two achievements, 140.4% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached; this entitles to quantitative variable compensation of 561,600 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed. On February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors then reviewed the achievement of the qualitative targets set by the Board on February 10, 2016, which, if some or all of these targets are met, are used to determine a multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. If the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account. Therefore: c as regards the execution of the strategy decided upon by the Board of
Directors in October 2015 (50% weighting for this criterion) i.e. ensuring the development of Faurecia's technological capacities through a combination of organic and external growth; selecting and finalizing potential acquisitions ensuring increased technological capacity and creating value for shareholders; increasing investment in start-ups, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017, highlighted the 2016 achievements especially the creation of a team dedicated to the Cockpit of the Future project and the launch of pre-development activities with four customers; the materialization of investments with the announcement of a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, the acquisition of a majority interest in Amminex and investments in various start-ups, including the Finnish company Tactotek. The Board of Directors considered that 100% of this criterion has been met;

c as regards the execution of the development plans for Asia as presented to the Board of Directors at its December 2015 meeting (50% weighting for this criterion being associated with key indicators in relation, in particular, to levels of achievement of operating income and sales) i.e. adjusting Faurecia in China to so-called New Normal conditions with a cost structure compatible with the cost positioning of Chinese OEMs, fulfilling the ambitions of international OEMs; securing long-term profitability; developing partnerships with four major Chinese OEMs; rolling out a new method of organization in South Korea and business activities with HKMC; defining and executing the strategy in Japan and in South-East Asia, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017, formally noted the sharp rise in business in South Korea, the introduction of a new method of organization in Japan, the implementation of so-called New Normal conditions for the three Business Groups in China as well as the amount of new contracts with Chinese OEMs and levels of operating income in Asia that were higher than the targets. The Board of Directors considered that 120% of this criterion has been met.
As a result, the Board of Directors considered that the standard achieved in relation to these two qualitative targets was such that a multiplier of 1.10 should apply to the two quantitative targets. On this basis, at its February 8, 2017, meeting, the Board of Directors determined a variable compensation for Mr. Yann Delabrière in his role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016, for the period from January 1 to June 30, 2016, equal to 400,000 x 100% x 140.4% x 1.10, i.e., a sum of 617,760, which corresponds to 154.44% of his fixed compensation collected for 2016 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Presentation
Mr. Patrick Koller's annual fixed compensation as Deputy Chief Executive Officer was set at 620,000 by the Board of Directors at its meetings of December 9, 2014 and February 11, 2015. This compensation was set in reference to a comparison of compensation prepared by an outside consultant based on a set of twenty French manufacturers.
At its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors set the rules for determining Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation for 2016 as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The Board decided that Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation may range from 0% to 144% of his annual fixed compensation depending on the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets. The achievement of the following quantitative targets entitles him to variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of 80% of his annual fixed compensation: c 40% of his variable compensation is based on operating income set by
reference to the 2016 budget; c 60% is based on the free cash flow set by reference to the 2016 budget. On the recommendation of the Management Committee on February 1, 2017, the Board of Directors meeting of February 8, 2017, reviewed the extent to which these quantitative criteria had been met: c as regards the operating income, the Board of Directors formally noted
that 141% of this initial quantitative objective had been reached; c as regards free cash flow, the Board of Directors formally noted that
140% of this second quantitative objective had been reached. As a result of these two achievements, 140.4% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached: this entitles to quantitative variable compensation of 348,192 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed. At its meeting on February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors then reviewed the achievement of the qualitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016 which, if some or all of these targets are met, determines a multiplier effect of the qualitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. If the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account. Thus: c as regards the execution of the strategy decided upon by the Board of
Directors in October 2015 (25% weighting for this criterion) i.e. ensuring the development of Faurecia's technological capacities through a combination of organic and external growth; selecting and finalizing potential acquisitions ensuring increased technological capacity and creating value for shareholders; increasing investment in start-ups, the Board of Directors of February 8, 2017, highlighted the 2016 achievements especially the creation of a team dedicated to the Cockpit of the Future project and the launch of pre-development activities with four customers; the materialization of investments with the announcement of a strategic partnership with Parrot Automotive, the acquisition of a majority interest in Amminex and investments in various start-ups, including the Finnish company Tactotek.

Presentation
Mr. Patrick Koller's annual fixed compensation as Chief Executive Officer was set at 750,000 by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016. This compensation was established with reference to a compensation analysis conducted by an external consulting firm based on a group of 20 French industrial companies comparable to Faurecia.
The Board of Directors' meeting of July 25, 2016, decided to keep the structure of Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation as Chief Executive Officer the same as it had been when he was Deputy Chief Executive Officer, both with regard to quantitative and qualitative targets which are unchanged, and with regard to the multiplier effect associated with said targets. The only change decided by the Board of Directors concerns the quantitative targets which now entitle Mr. Patrick Koller to variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of 100% of his fixed annual compensation. Therefore, for the second half of 2016, Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation may range from 0 to 180% of the fixed annual compensation that he received as of July 1, 2016.

The Board of Directors of February 8, 2017, then reviewed the achievement of the qualitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2016: c as regards the execution of the strategy, the Board of Directors
considered that 100% of this criterion has been met; c as regards the execution of development plans for Asia, the Board of
Directors considered that 120% of this criterion has been met; c as regards the introduction of a simplified and more flexible method

At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors decided to allot up to 55,095 shares to Mr. Patrick Koller in the context of performance shares allotment plan number eight, based on the authorization granted by shareholders at their General Meeting of May 27, 2016 (thirteenth resolution adopted in extraordinary session). These 55,095 shares correspond to 0.04% of the capital as of December 31, 2016. The Board of Directors made the definitive acquisition of these shares contingent on the following: c 60% on an internal performance condition: Group net income after tax
as of December 31, 2018, before taking into account capital gains from the disposal of assets and changes in the scope of consolidation, as approved by the Board of Directors, assessed against net income for the same fiscal year as it had been forecast in the Group's mediumterm plan reviewed and set by the Board of Directors on the date the shares are allocated; and c 40% on an external condition: growth in Faurecia's net earnings per share between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2018, assessed against the weighted growth over the same period of a reference group comprised of twelve comparable international automotive equipment suppliers. If these performance conditions laid down in plan number eight have been met in full at the end of the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. Patrick Koller will be granted the maximum 55,095 shares of which he will take ownership on July 25, 2020.

This will enable your Company to carry out financial transactions as and when market conditions permit, and quickly raise the capital needed to implement the Group's growth and consolidation strategy.
The aim of the 24th resolution is to involve Group employees in its expansion, in particular through a capital increase reserved for employees.
The aim of the 25th resolution is to amend the Company's bylaws to include a procedure to appoint Board members representing employees, in accordance with Article L. 225-27-1 of the French

Under the provisions of Article R. 225-31 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce), it is the responsibility of the shareholders to determine whether the agreements and commitments are appropriate and should be approved.

1.2 Commitments authorized in favor of Patrick Koller, Deputy Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016 and Chief Executive Officer as of July 1, 2016
The Board of Directors has authorized the following commitments in favor of Patrick Koller, Deputy Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016 and Chief Executive Officer as of July 1, 2016.
1.2.1 Defined contribution pension plan (Article 83 of the French Tax Code (1) and defined benefit pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code) set up for all Group employees in France
Nature and purpose The defined contribution pension plan (Article 83 of the French Tax Code) and defined benefit pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code) set up for all Group employees in France, including Patrick Koller, were authorized by the Board of Directors at its meetings of April 13 and July 25, 2016.
Terms and conditions These plans include:
c a defined contribution plan relating to salary brackets A and B with total contributions representing 1% on bracket A and 6% on bracket B of the compensation without any contribution by the beneficiary. In 2016, Faurecia paid 7,337.04 in respect of these contributions;
c a defined benefit plan with the following terms and conditions:
c minimum seniority: five years at the time of retirement,
c progressive increase of potential entitlement in relation to seniority and compensation: potential entitlement increases each year by 1% of salary bracket C,
c reference period taken into account to calculate entitlement: seniority as of December 18, 2006,
c entitlement calculations relate to salary bracket C only (i.e., between four and eight times the French annual social security ceiling),
c the reference compensation taken into account at the time of retirement is the average of the annual bracket C compensation received over the past three years.
Both of these plans remain open to all Group executives with at least five years' seniority at the time of retirement for the defined benefit plan and at least one year's seniority for the defined contribution plan.
At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors confirmed that Patrick Koller, who no longer has an employment contract with the Company, will remain a beneficiary of these two plans after July 1, 2016 in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Code of commerce as amended by the French Act No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 (the Macron Act), the Board of Directors decided to make Patrick Koller's right to the defined benefit plan subject to the following performance condition, linked to his annual variable compensation:
c in the event that the variable compensation objectives are achieved at 80% or above, an additional 1% of the potential rights (limited to salary bracket C) will vest for the period in question;
c in the event the variable compensation objectives are achieved at less than 80%, the increase in the rights will be reduced in proportion to the level at which the objectives were achieved (for example, an objective achieved at 30% would lead to a 0.30% increase in the potential rights).
The potential rights applicable in favor of Patrick Koller at December 31, 2016 are as follows:

Reference compensation as of December 31, 2016 (bracket C)

Potential annual rights for 2016

Total potential annual rights as of December 31, 2016

1.2.2 Supplementary defined benefit pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code) set up specifically for members of Faurecia's Executive Committee
Nature and purpose The supplementary defined benefit pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code), of which Patrick Koller is a beneficiary, was authorized by the Board of Directors at its meeting of July 25, 2016.
Set up following a decision by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 11, 2015 and modified by a unilateral decision made by the Chief Executive Officer on July 4, 2016, this plan was intended for members of Faurecia's Executive Committee who have an employment contract with the Company, either in progress or suspended, or hold a corporate office in France, and have served on the Executive Committee for a minimum of three consecutive calendar years as from the implementation of this plan or the date they joined the Executive Committee.

Terms and conditions Faurecia guarantees beneficiaries of the plan an annual pension determined according to the Company's operating income and budget approved by the Board of Directors according to the following formula S Xi*R, where:
c R is the annual reference compensation;
c Xi is the entitlement for each year of seniority (i) equal to:
c 3% if the operating income for the year is strictly more than 105% of the budgeted operating income,
c 2% if the operating income for the year is between 95% and 105% of the budgeted operating income,
c 1% if the operating income for the year is strictly less than 95% of the budgeted operating income.
Operating income for the year Y is defined based on the income statement as of December 31, Y approved by the Board of Directors in year Y+1 and the initial budget for the year Y approved by the Board of Directors in the year Y-1.
Each year, the Board of Directors therefore decides how much should be granted, following the approval of the financial statements.
In respect of 2015, the Board of Directors decided at its meeting of April 13, 2016 that the pension for the financial year would be equal to 3% of the reference compensation of each beneficiary in France. The potential individual rights of Patrick Koller at December 31, 2016 are as follows:

Reference compensation as of December 31, 2016

Potential annual rights
for 2016

Total potential annual rights as of December 31, 2016

Maximum potential rights (all Faurecia plans)

1,469,290

6%

* Combined with eight times the annual social security limit.

25%*

Seniority conditions
Three calendar years on the Executive Committee as of January 1, 2015

No payment was made to Patrick Koller in respect of this plan during the financial year ended December 31, 2016.
Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company The Board of Directors has justified the agreement as follows: "These plans, which are subject to performance conditions, are part of a long-term strategy to retain senior directors and the Chief Executive Officer and encourage closer involvement in the Group's results."
1.2.3 Severance pay Nature and purpose At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a severance pay package for Patrick Koller.
Terms and conditions This indemnity is subject to the following conditions:
i. Severance pay would be due to Patrick Koller in the event that he is removed from office as Chief Executive Officer at the Company's initiative, except in the event of serious or gross misconduct;
ii. No indemnity would be due if Patrick Koller resigns or retires;
iii. The payment of this indemnity is subject to the following performance conditions:
a. achieving positive operating income over the three financial years prior to the end of Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer,
b. achieving positive net cash flow over the three financial years prior to the end of Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer;

336

Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports
iv. The severance pay package would be equal to 24 months of Patrick Koller's reference compensation (fixed compensation and short-term variable compensation) if the two conditions set out above are met over the three financial years in question, which in practical terms amounts to meeting six criteria;
v. Should one of the six criteria not be met, the severance pay package would be reduced by one sixth and therefore could be equal to zero if none of the six criteria are met;
vi. Should Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer be less than three years, the severance pay calculation would be the same, but the number of criteria would be adjusted to take into account the actual duration of his term of office.
Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company The Board of Directors has justified the agreement as follows: "This commitment, which is subject to performance conditions, is part of a long-term strategy to retain the Chief Executive Officer and encourage closer involvement in the Group's results."
AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS ALREADY APPROVED BY THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Agreements and commitments approved in previous years In accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Code of commerce, we were informed that the following agreements and commitments, approved by the Annual General Meeting in previous years, remained in force during the year ended December 31, 2016.
2.1 Defined contribution pension plan (Article 83 of the French Tax Code) and defined benefit pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code) for all Group employees in France

This is a free translation into English of a report issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with and is construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.
To the Shareholders, In our capacity at Statutory Auditors of your Company and in compliance with Article L. 225-209 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) on capital reductions by means of cancellation of own shares purchased, we have prepared this report with the aim of informing you of our assessment of the reasons for, and terms and conditions of, the proposed capital reduction.

To the Shareholders,
In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Faurecia S.A., and in accordance with Articles L. 228-92 and L. 225-135 et seq. of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce), we hereby report to you on the proposed delegations of authority to the Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares and/or securities, which are submitted to you for approval.
On the basis of the Board of Directors' report, the shareholders are requested to:

c the issue, with pre-emptive subscription rights (twentieth resolution) (i) of ordinary shares and/or (ii) ordinary shares carrying rights to the allocation of other ordinary shares or debt securities and/or (iii) securities carrying rights to the Company's ordinary shares to be issued.

It is specified that in accordance with Article L. 228-93 of the French Code of commerce, securities to be issued can carry rights to ordinary shares to be issued by any company in which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of the share capital.
The aggregate nominal amount of the share capital increases that may be carried out, either immediately or in the future may not exceed  250 million pursuant to the twentieth resolution and 95 million pursuant to the twenty-first and twenty-second resolutions.
The aggregate nominal amount of the debt securities that may be issued pursuant to the twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second resolutions may not exceed  1 billion.
These limits take into account the additional securities to be issued pursuant to the delegations of authority under the twentieth to twenty-second resolutions in accordance with Article L. 225-135-1 of the French Code of commerce, in the event the shareholders adopt the twenty-third resolution.
It is the Board of Directors' responsibility to prepare a report in accordance with Articles R. 225-113 et seq. of the French Code of commerce.

We do not express an opinion on the final terms and conditions of the issues because they have not been set, or consequently, on the proposed cancellation of the pre-emptive subscription rights proposed to the shareholders in the twenty-first and twenty-second resolutions.
In accordance with Article R. 225-116 of the French Code of commerce, we will prepare an additional report if and when the Board of Directors uses its delegations of authority to issue securities carrying rights to other shares or the allocation of debt securities, to issue securities carrying rights to shares to be issued and to issue shares without pre-emptive subscription rights.

Where applicable, the Board of Directors will be responsible for setting the final terms and conditions of any such issue.
It is the Board of Directors' responsibility to prepare a report in accordance with Articles R. 225-113 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. It is our responsibility to express an opinion on the fairness of the information taken from the financial statements, on the proposed cancellation of shareholders' pre-emptive subscription rights and on certain other information relating to these operations, which is presented in this report.
We performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with professional standards applicable in France to such engagements. These procedures consisted in verifying the information disclosed in the Board of Directors' report pertaining to the transaction and the methods used to set the issue price of the shares to be issued.
Subject to a subsequent examination of the terms and conditions of the proposed issue, we have no matters to report as regards the methods used to set the issue price of the shares to be issued given in the Board of Directors' report.
We do not express an opinion on the final terms and conditions of the issue because they have not been set, or consequently, on the proposed cancellation of shareholders' pre-emptive subscription rights.
In accordance with Article R. 225-116 of the French Code of commerce, we will prepare an additional report if and when the Board of Directors uses this delegation of authority to issue shares or securities that are shares granting access to the other shares or to issue securities granting access to shares to be issued.

12.5.2. INDEPENDENT VERIFIER'S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT

This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.
This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.

To the Shareholders,
In our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the COFRAC (1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the Statutory Auditors of the company Faurecia, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2016, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the "CSR Information," pursuant to the provisions of the Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce).

Responsibility of the Company
It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce), in accordance with the protocols used by the Company (hereafter referred to as the "Criteria"), and available on request at the Company's headquarters.

Independence and quality control
Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the Article L. 822-11 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations.

Responsibility of the independent verifier
It is our role, based on our work: c to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate
explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information); c to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria; Our verification work was undertaken by a team of 6 people between September 2016 and February 2017, for an estimated duration of 10 weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the Order of May 13, 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission.
1. ATTESTATION OF PRESENCE OF CSR INFORMATION
Nature and scope of the work Interviews with the management of relevant departments allowed us to obtain an understanding of the Company's strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the Company's activities and related to its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes. We have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce).

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports

In the absence of certain consolidated information, we have verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in Article R. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce).
We verified that the CSR Information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-3 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce).
Conclusion
Based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above we confirm the presence in the management report of the required CSR Information.
2. LIMITED ASSURANCE ON CSR INFORMATION
Nature and scope of the work
We undertook around 10 interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments in charge of the data collection process and ­ when relevant ­ responsible for internal monitoring process and risk management in order to:
c assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;
c verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information.
We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices.
For the CSR Information which we considered the most important (1):
c At the level of the parent company, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report;
c At the level of the representative selection of entities that we selected (2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 15% of the total workforce and between 15% and 36% of the quantitative environmental information.

(1) Social Information:
· Indicators (quantitative information): total headcount and breakdown by contract, absenteeism rate, total number of trainings, work accidents frequency rate (with and without days lost).
· Qualitative information: employment (gender and geography, hiring and terminations, women proportion in executives headcount), labor organization, absenteeism, labor relations (social dialogue organization, collective agreements), health and safety, work accidents (frequency and gravity), training policies, diversity and equality of treatment and opportunities (measures undertaken for gender equality, measures undertaken to improve gender equality, antidiscrimination policies and actions), promotion and respect of the ILO core conventions (freedom of association, anti-discrimination policies and actions, elimination of forced labor and child labor).
Environmental and societal information:
· Indicators (quantitative information): the percentage of production sites certified ISO 14001, the number of sites certified ISO 14001, raw material consumption and its ratio per turnover unit, energy consumption and its ratio per turnover unit, GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2 and their ratio per turnover unit), emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds, the quantity of waste produced and its ratio per turnover unit, waste distribution per disposal type, the percentage of suppliers that have been assessed following CSR criteria.
· Qualitative information: general environmental organization, training and information delivered to the employees regarding environmental protection, the resources dedicated to the prevention of environmental risks and pollution, measures undertaken to prevent, reduce or remediate air emissions (emissions of volatile organic compounds), circular economy (waste generation prevention, waste recycling and disposal, measures undertaken to improve energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy), climate change (the significant emission sources for GHG generated by the activities of the society, especially for the use of services and goods produced by the society, the adaptation to climate change), importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in the purchasing policies and the relations with suppliers and subcontractors; importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in the purchasing policies and the relations with suppliers and subcontractors, loyalty of practices (measures to prevent corruption).
(2) Faurecia Clean Mobility BG: North America Division, including the sites of Silao and Queretaro (Mexico), and the Fradley site (United Kingdom); Faurecia Interiors BG: South Europe Division, including the sites of Mouzon and Hénin-Beaumont (France); Faurecia Seating BG: Banbury site (United Kingdom).

12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports

For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the Company.
Eventually, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information.
We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated.
Conclusion Based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria.

NOTE ON METHODOLOGY RELATING TO REPORTING ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS

Social and environmental indicators are reported following the guidance in the relevant Faurecia Core Procedure (FCP). The procedures form part of the Faurecia Excellence System (FES), which defines the working methods for Group employees worldwide and underpins the Group's identity.
The aim of the FCP covering environmental reporting is to organize the annual collection, compilation and communication of data in this area via a Group software operated by Tennaxia. The scope of reporting covers Group sites identified by the HSE managers in each Business Group (sites with a low environmental impact are excluded).

The data, duly collected, checked and input into the software is approved at division, Business Group and Group level before being consolidated.
The FCPs covering employee-related matters notably define the reporting standards as regards headcount and other key employee data within the Group. All Faurecia group sites are covered. These procedures are based on monthly reporting via the Metis_HR software, which is then used to consolidate the data. Checks are carried out throughout the data reporting process, and at the end of this process the data are analyzed by the Group Human Resources department.

The Group software rolled out at the relevant sites describes, among other things, the list of indicators being reported, the checks, in particular consistency, carried out throughout the reporting process as well as the instructions for use.

The environmental and social data in this Registration Document are independently audited by Ernst & Young et Associés. The opinion given in Section 12.5.2 summarizes their conclusions from their work.
