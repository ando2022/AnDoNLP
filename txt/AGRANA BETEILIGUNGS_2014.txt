ANNUAL REPORT 2014|15
OF AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2015
In this report on the 2014|15 financial year, the sustainability aspects that are material to AGRANA's business activities are presented in accordance with the G4 reporting standard of the Global Reporting Initiative and are covered directly in the corporate governance and Group management report. To make the non-financial information easier to find, a content index of all GRI G4 indicators discussed in the report is provided from page 189. In addition, relevant passages throughout the report are marked with a green fingerprint symbol.

LET TER FROM THE CEO
16
The 2014|15 financial year, as expected, was defined by numerous challenges. A difficult price situation in the Sugar segment, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the trend in the prices of crude oil and ethanol were among the key drivers for AGRANA in the year under review. As a result of market prices, Group revenue declined significantly. Especially in the Sugar segment, operating profit (EBIT) also fell sharply. The coming months will continue to be very challenging for Sugar, and in the short term we see at best break-even results in this segment. Our Starch and Fruit segments have proved a strong stabilising influence, with Starch even slightly improving on the prior year and with Fruit's moderate decrease in EBIT explained by one-time effects. These nonrecurring factors in Fruit were start-up costs for the successful commissioning of the new US plant in Lysander, New York, and one-off expenses for restructuring in the fruit preparations business.
Market-focused: AGRANA is well prepared for new challenges in the Sugar segment The sugar market environment deteriorated drastically in the last financial year, with persistently falling world market prices. As well, strain for the industry came from the run-up to the end of the EU sugar market regime in September 2017, in anticipation of which sugar manufacturers are positioning themselves for battle. The record yields of the 2014|15 beet sugar campaign likewise did nothing to ease the pressure on the market. At the beginning of the new 2014|15 sugar marketing year alone, the EU sugar price plummeted from  508 per tonne in September 2014 to  455 in October 2014. Even a reduction of beet prices to the EU minimum level was not able to make up for the earnings impact of this erosion in sugar market prices. The hopes are now pinned on the world market: For the first time in years, sugar production and consumption should be equal, which would lead to rising world market prices. Moreover, sugar stocks in Europe are expected to normalise at the end of the 2014|15 marketing year. As well, beet cultivation area for the next crop will decrease; AGRANA expects that European sugar beet growers are reducing their planting area by about 10% overall. A slightly rising world market price and lower production in Europe should thus lead to higher prices again.
For the time after 30 September 2017, when the production quotas and minimum beet prices expire, little has changed strategically for AGRANA's sugar business. Our market is in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. This is where we continue to see our strengths, particularly in supplying the region's deficit markets. We have built a strong market position in the CEE countries in recent years and demonstrated the reliability of our product quality and service. We will continue to work on honing our competitiveness and fine-tuning distribution structures, including investing  25 million in a new logistics centre at our existing site in Kaposvár, Hungary. At this facility, storage and packaging are soon to be optimised and centralised, which is expected also to further improve customer service. At the same time we are focusing on maximising the efficiency of sugar production through rationalisation, reduction of energy costs and increases in yields.
Diversified: A competitive advantage we will continue to exploit We remain committed to our strategy of diversification across three pillars. Especially during a time of difficult conditions for sugar producers, our Starch and Fruit segments are a source of stability for the Group's results.
AGRANA has taken an important step in the Starch segment by reinforcing the value-added processing strategy through the construction of the wheat starch plant. We are investing in new spray dryers in order to produce more specialty starches, particularly for export, and are further increasing our corn (maize) processing capacity in Aschach, Austria. In the alcohol operations we are not planning an expansion, as AGRANA currently already produces enough bioethanol to

the same as for the prior year.

In the Fruit segment, we are growing outside of Europe. With the new US plant in the state of New York, we took advantage of the market growth in the region. Currently we are evaluating market opportunities in Southeast Asia. In China we have already created sufficient capacity for the next number of years to be able to grow there in step with the rising demand. The market in Europe is saturated; the focus here is on cost savings. AGRANA's general goal is to grow more rapidly than the market and thus gain market share.
Engaged: Sustainability is a quality criterion Proof of sustainability along a product's entire value chain has become a major quality factor and buying criterion for consumers, and thus also for our customers. We therefore aim to attend even more closely than before to ensuring sustainable production conditions, especially also in our upstream value chain. In the 2014|15 financial year we worked hard on the further integration of sustainability aspects into operational business processes. This is expressed in a number of new (or existing but newly formalised) internal guidelines and principles and in certifications to various international sustainability standards relevant to our businesses. With a view to continuous improvement, AGRANA has also set itself specific sustainability objectives for the coming financial years. These relate above all to the creation of additional transparency regarding environmental and social criteria in our supply chain; reduction of energy and water consumption at our production facilities; and awareness-building and trainings around a range of sustainability aspects.

Open to change: Cost optimisation in focus; outlook for 2015|16 is challenging The present difficult business environment demands extra efforts to improve the earnings situation in the medium term. Optimisation measures will be intensified along the whole value chain. Among other initiatives, this will include cost reductions through concentration of administration activities, maintenance cost adjustments and the implementation of an even more customer-needs-focused and market-oriented management. In our capital expenditures, we plan to continue to keep pace with depreciation in order to create potential for future profit growth.
AGRANA will have a difficult 2015|16 financial year; particularly in the Sugar segment a trend reversal is unlikely in the short term. In Starch, the sugar-market-dependent isoglucose business as well as ethanol prices will remain important driving factors for the segment's results. Non-food starches and the Fruit segment, with ambitious sales volume targets, should perform well. Although we do not expect to reach last year's earnings result in 2015|16, we look to the coming financial years with confidence and believe that margins in all segments will increase again in the medium term.
Speaking for the whole Management Board, I would like to thank all who contributed to AGRANA's achievements in the year. We are particularly grateful to our employees for their outstanding qualities and their loyalty, and to our commercial partners and shareholders for their confidence and trust.

Transparent: Capital market orientation remains highly important for AGRANA For decades now, AGRANA has had two stable principal shareholders in Austria's Zucker-Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. and Germany's Südzucker AG. In the 2014|15 financial year there was no change in shareholder structure; however, in the prior year, at the time of the exit of British financial services firm Prudential plc (M&G Investments), 4.9% of

SUPERVISORY BOARD'S REPORT
18 The Supervisory Board actively oversaw and supported AGRANA's performance in the 2014|15 financial year and exercised its responsibilities and powers under the law and the Articles of Association while observing the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In a total of five meetings, of which all its members attended at least half, the Supervisory Board, through the reports of the Management Board and detailed written material, informed itself about the company's business situation and financial position, about all relevant matters concerning the business performance and exceptional business transactions as well as the corporate strategy, and discussed these subjects with the Management Board. The thorough deliberations in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees centred on corporate strategy and the opportunities for the further development of the Group, as well as the current challenges of the general economic environment. The Supervisory Board was briefed in a timely and comprehensive manner about measures requiring its approval. In accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board commissioned an external evaluation of its activities, the findings of which it thoroughly discussed.
Top agenda items of discussions Regular key agenda items of the Supervisory Board's deliberations were the strategic orientation and further development of the Group, the business trend in all segments and the optimisation of corporate financing. Outside the regular meetings as well, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board had numerous conversations with the Management Board to discuss ongoing developments in the Group's environment, their impact on current business results, and the risk situation.
In its meeting on 9 May 2014 the Supervisory Board dealt with the audit of the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2014, the nomination of the independent auditor for election for the 2014|15 financial year, and the medium-term investment planning. The independent auditor attended this meeting and reported on the audit priorities and results, which also included the accounting-related elements of the internal control system. The Supervisory Board adopted the parent company financial statements and approved the consolidated financial statements. In its meeting on 4 July 2014 the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the medium-term planning, a strategic equity investment project and a financing project, and agreed to a restructuring measure in the Fruit segment. It also approved a capital expenditure project. The meeting on 12 November 2014 discussed the forecast financial results for 2014|15, the subject of corporate governance, strategic equity investment and capital expenditure projects and the reorganisation of the existing Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan). In its meeting on 26 February 2015, the Supervisory Board deliberated on the financial planning and the capital investment projects for the 2015|16 financial year. The agenda of this meeting also included the self-evaluation under the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and the subject of strategic equity investments.
Committees of the Supervisory Board The Audit Committee convened for two meetings in the 2014|15 financial year. With the independent auditor in attendance, the Audit Committee dealt exhaustively with the 2013|14 parent company and consolidated financial statements of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG and discussed the Management Board's proposal for the appropriation of profit. The Committee's deliberations also covered the audit of the corporate governance report and dealt with the report from Internal Audit and with the risk management system. The Audit Committee likewise worked on the planning and priorities for the audit of the 2014|15 financial statements and discussed the subjects of anticorruption and compliance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
22 COMMITMENT TO THE AUSTRIAN CODE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AGRANA is committed to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (the Code) and complies with almost all of its provisions. The Code can be viewed on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance at www.corporate-governance.at. Based on the principle of voluntary self-regulation, the Code provides the framework for the direction and oversight of the company with the aim of high transparency for all stakeholders.
The Code consists of binding so-called L rules (these are based on legal requirements); of C rules (comply-or-explain rules), which are expected to be adhered to, with deviations to be explained in order to achieve compliance with the Code; and of R rules (recommendations), non-compliance with which requires neither disclosure nor explanation.
In the 2014|15 financial year, AGRANA applied the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the version of July 2012. At its meetings on 12 November 2014 and 26 February 2015, the Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of compliance with the Code.
In the 2014|15 financial year, AGRANA adhered to all C rules of the Code, with the exceptions explained below:
 Rule 27 (Management Board compensation criteria) A retroactive change to existing contracts does not appear justified. The existing employment contracts of the Management Board members do not tie variable compensation to non-financial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts. Setting ceilings on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unforeseeable developments and to honour special achievements.
 Rule 27a (severance pay) In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act. The Management Board contracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay.
 Rule 49 (contracts requiring approval) Under section 95 (5)(12) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the approval of the Supervisory Board is required for contracts with members of the Supervisory Board by which members undertake, outside their role on the Supervisory Board, to provide a service to the Company or a subsidiary for a material consideration. This also applies to contracts with companies in which a Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest. For business policy and competition reasons, the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the annual report as stipulated in rule 49.
The business culture of the AGRANA Group has always been marked by open and constructive teamwork between the Management Board and Supervisory Board, which together ensure that the Code's requirements are fulfilled. The Management and Supervisory Boards of AGRANA, and especially their chairmen, are thus engaged in ongoing dialogue regarding the Group's performance and strategic direction, both at and between the meetings of the Supervisory Board.
To safeguard open and transparent communication with shareholders and the interested public, information given to investors during conference calls and road shows is simultaneously made available to all other shareholders via the Group website at www.agrana.com/en/ir.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION
26 Supervisory Board independence The Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG applies the guidelines for the definition of supervisory board independence in the form set out in Annex 1 to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance:
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past five years, have been a member of the Management Board or other management staff of the company or a subsidiary of the company.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not have a business relationship, of a size significant to him or her, with the company or a subsidiary of the company, and shall not have had such a business relationship in the past year. This also applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member holds a significant economic interest, but does not apply to board positions held within the Group.
 The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board under L rule 48 does not automatically imply a member's designation as non-independent.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past three years, have been an external auditor of the Company or a partner or employee of the external auditing firm.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a management board member of another company in which a member of the Company's Management Board is a supervisory board member.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not serve on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a strategic shareholding in the Company or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a close relative (direct descendant, spouse, common-law spouse, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, nephew or niece) of a Management Board member or of persons holding any of the positions referred to in the foregoing points.
Committees and their members Where the importance or specialist nature of a particular subject matter makes it appropriate, the Supervisory Board also exercises its advisory and supervisory functions through the following three committees:
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee deals with the legal relationships between the Company and the members of the Management Board. The Committee is responsible for succession planning in respect of the Management Board and approves the compensation schemes for the Management Board members. In the 2014|15 financial year the Nomination and Remuneration Committee met once.
The Strategy Committee prepares strategic decisions of the Supervisory Board by providing decision support, and makes decisions in urgent matters. The Strategy Committee held no meetings in the 2014|15 financial year.
The Audit Committee prepares for transaction by the Supervisory Board all matters related to the Company's separate financial statements and to the auditing of the accounting records and of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report, including the corporate governance report. It monitors the effectiveness of the internal control system, audit system and risk management system and verifies the independence and qualifications of the external auditors.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

27
In the 2014|15 financial year the Audit Committee met twice. Its meetings focused particularly on the audit of the 2013|14 financial statements, the preparation of the audit of the 2014|15 financial statements, and the supervision of the risk management system. The Audit Committee also dealt with the compliance report for the Group.
The Supervisory Board terms of reference include the procedures for the committees; an excerpt of the terms of reference is available on the AGRANA website at www.agrana.com/en/about-agrana/ management/supervisory-board.
Supervisory Board committees consist of the Supervisory Board Chairman or a Vice-Chairman, and of as many Supervisory Board members as the Supervisory Board determines. The only exception is the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which consists of the Supervisory Board Chairman and two members appointed from among the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting. If the Supervisory Board has two Vice-Chairmen, they shall be appointed as these two other members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

COMPENSATION REPORT
Compensation of the Management Board The Supervisory Board duly reviews and discusses the appropriateness of the Management Board's compensation, also taking into consideration the Group's internal compensation structure.
The total compensation of the Management Board members consists of a fixed and a variable, performance-based component. The performance-based component is contractually tied to the amount of the dividends paid over the respective last three years, in order to take into account sustainable, long-term performance criteria.

The fixed compensation of the Management Board members remained unchanged compared to the prior year. Stephan Büttner was appointed to the Management Board with effect from 1 November 2014, replacing Walter Grausam, who retired from the Management Board on 31 December 2014.
Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board under the Company's plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. For the Management Board members Johann Marihart, Fritz Gattermayer and Walter Grausam, the following applies: The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme under the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG5) are met. In the event of retirement before the age determined under the ASVG, the amount of the pension is reduced. The pension amount is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assessment base. For the pension of Stephan Büttner, there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached the age of 55 years if the employment contract is terminated by the employer. For the 2014|15 financial year, pension fund contributions of  2,955 thousand (prior year:  968 thousand) were paid.
The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund. In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act (see note on rule 27a) or the Occupational Pension Plan Act (BMSVG6). In the balance sheet at 28 February 2015, within the item "retirement and termination benefit obligations", an amount of  8,058 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year:  3,940 thousand) and an amount of  1,906 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year:  2,009 thousand).
No compensation agreements in the event of a public tender offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.

AGRANA maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage for management staff. This D&O insurance covers certain personal liability risks of the persons acting as legal representatives of the AGRANA Group. The cost is borne by AGRANA.
Transactions of members of the Management Board in financial instruments are notified to the Financial Market Authority (FMA) in accordance with section 48d (4) Stock Exchange Act and published on the website of the FMA. During the reporting period there were no such transactions.

Compensation of the Supervisory Board On 4 July 2014 the Annual General Meeting approved an annual aggregate remuneration for the Supervisory Board of  250,000 (prior year:  250,000) for the 2013|14 financial year and delegated to the Supervisory Board the responsibility for allocating this sum among its members.

In accordance with section 110 (3) of the Austrian Labour Act, the Supervisory Board members who are employee representatives do not receive Supervisory Board compensation.

COMPLIANCE
For AGRANA, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is integral to good corporate governance.
AGRANA has a dedicated compliance office led by the compliance officer, who looks after the compliance responsibilities centrally. The most important responsibilities of the compliance officer are the further expansion of the compliance management system in the AGRANA Group by producing and training internal guidelines; providing support in compliance matters; documenting cases of non-compliance and issuing recommendations. In addition, a Compliance Board was created, consisting of the heads of the Internal Audit department, Human Resources department, Legal department and Corporate Secretariat, and the compliance officer. The Compliance Board has its own terms of reference. It deliberates on an ongoing basis on fundamental questions regarding matters of compliance.

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2014|15

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION
30 The compliance management system of AGRANA has the following four core elements:
The AGRANA Code of Conduct forms the foundation of all business actions and decisions. The Code of Conduct is designed to give a clear and systematic understanding of the conduct which AGRANA expects from all its employees, managers and directors in all activities and locations of the Group. Together with the mission statement, it guides the entire AGRANA Group, setting unambiguous standards of integrity, correct business conduct and ethical principles.
Anticorruption laws apply worldwide and must be obeyed everywhere and at all times. In response to the specific Austrian anti-corruption legislation, AGRANA has issued a separate Austria AntiCorruption Policy, complementing the Code of Conduct. This policy sets out binding regulations and a reporting system. The policy aims to ensure legally compliant conduct and facilitate the proper handling of invitations and gifts. Additionally, to accommodate Austrian laws, a separate tax policy was created that governs the handling of tax processes.
The purpose of the globally applicable Antitrust Compliance Policy is to ensure that all employees and board members know and abide by the essential provisions of competition and antitrust law and have the awareness to recognise situations with antitrust relevance. The overarching aim of this policy is to preserve employees from violating antitrust legislation and to provide practical, real-world support in applying the relevant rules.
For AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as a publicly traded company, it is highly important to adhere to stock exchange and capital market laws and regulations, particularly the Stock Exchange Act and the Issuer Compliance Regulation of the Financial Market Authority. Based on these pieces of legislation, AGRANA has issued its Capital Market Compliance Policy. It sets out the principles governing the disclosure of information and prescribes organisational measures for safeguarding confidentiality and for preventing improper use or transmission of insider information.
The purpose of the AGRANA compliance management system is to fulfil the corporate leadership's organisational and supervisory obligations under the law and to minimise the liability risks for the AGRANA Group, its employees and board members.
To help achieve this, about 50 trainings were held for a defined group of employees in the 2014|15 financial year on the new Austria-specific anti-corruption and tax policy. The trainings in capital market policy compliance have begun and will be completed in the first half of 2015. As regards competition and antitrust law, about two-thirds of identified employees were already trained in the year under review; the others will receive the training in 2015. In the 2015|16 financial year, AGRANA plans to provide training on all relevant compliance policies at the international subsidiaries.
The Internal Audit department verifies compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies. In the 2014|15 financial year it audited 13 of the 50 AGRANA production sites (i. e., 26% of these sites) falling within the GRI report boundaries (see the section "Organisational structure" from page 45), including audits for corruption and fraud. The audit of a Hungarian subsidiary found breaches of AGRANA's conflict-of-interest rules; this led to the mutually agreed departure of the local management team.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

31
PROMOTING EQUITY FOR WOMEN
Equality of opportunity in the workplace and equal treatment of employees without regard to gender are principles enshrined in the AGRANA Code of Conduct. Any form of discrimination is resolutely confronted. The aim of AGRANA's diversity management is to create a work environment where employees feel integrated, respected and connected so that the breadth and depth of their abilities, experience and viewpoints can be harnessed synergistically for the Group.
In line with its core business activity of processing agricultural raw materials, AGRANA is regularly looking for prospective employees with technical training and education. However, the proportion of women with vocational training or technical academic degrees is relatively low, both in Austria and other countries. In June 2014 the Group therefore held an open-house for young female potential future trainees at the sugar factory in Tulln, Austria.
AGRANA is convinced that keeping work and family life in harmony is still commonly a challenge, especially for women. To help remedy this, AGRANA offers its staff in Vienna a company day-care centre, as well as a childcare service for days when schools close locally for a day and on longweekend days falling between a public holiday and the weekend.
As well, in the summer of 2014 AGRANA for the first time organised a week of care during the summer holidays for children of employees at the sugar plant in Tulln, Austria. That week, trained educators from Hilfswerk (a non-profit organisation which is one of the country's largest providers of childcare) put on age-specific, engaging programmes for children aged three to ten years. In response to the positive feedback from this 2014 pilot project, the initiative will again be available for employees in summer 2015 to give working parents peace of mind.

AGRANA'S STRATEGY

34 As an Austrian industrial group with an international focus, AGRANA's Sugar and Starch segments operate mainly in Europe and the operations of its Fruit segment are global. In these markets, AGRANA seeks or already commands a leading position in the industrial processing of agricultural raw materials. The Group pursues a growth strategy oriented to the respective local market opportunities. Long-lasting, stable customer and supplier relationships, respectful treatment of all stakeholders and continual growth in the company's value are major cornerstones of the corporate strategy, which is guided by the principles of sustainable management. AGRANA's aim is to provide both its globally operating and its regional customers worldwide with high product quality, optimum service and innovative product development ideas and expertise.
AGRANA controls and manages the product value chain from the purchase of agricultural raw materials to the production of the resulting intermediate goods for industrial customers (and of end products for consumers in the case of the Sugar segment). AGRANA utilises the Group's strategic know-how across segment boundaries. This is especially true for agricultural grower contract management and raw material procurement, the knowledge of customer requirements and markets, the opportunities for the development of inter-segment products, and synergies in logistics, purchasing, sales and finance. The cross-segment application of these competencies forms the basis for a robust market position in relation to competitors in all product groups, and underpins AGRANA's innovative strength and lean cost position.
In its business operations, AGRANA seeks to make the part of the product value chain that it has influence over as sustainable as possible. By sustainability in this context, AGRANA primarily means the following three aspects, which apply to all business segments:
 Utilisation of almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed, and use of low-emission technologies to protect the environment
 Respect for all stakeholders and communities where the Group operates  Engaging in long-term partnerships

The strategic goal: Customer- and market-
oriented growth in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe

The strategic goals: Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products

of acquisitions and cooperative new ventures.

The strategic goals: Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products. In the Starch segment, AGRANA focuses on highly refined specialty products. Innovative, customer-driven products supported by application advice and continuous product development, combined with cost optimisation, are the key to the segment's success. An example is the leading position in organic and in GMO-free1 starches for the food industry. As well, in the non-food sector, the Group is a major supplier of specialty starches for the paper, textile, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and building materials industries. And AGRANA's essential core competency ­ processing agricultural raw materials into industrial products ­ is also the basis for the bioethanol business. In Austria, AGRANA is the leading vendor of this climate-friendly fuel thanks to the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf. By the complementary production of wheat starch at this site, AGRANA wants to both optimise the product portfolio and continue to progress towards the ideal of complete raw material utilisation. AGRANA's goal is to enhance value-added through optimal use of the protein fractions of agricultural raw materials in the utilisation of by-products.

The strategic goal: Customer- and market-oriented global growth. In the Fruit segment, the Group's business activities are fruit preparations (AGRANA Fruit, about 75% of segment revenue) and fruit juice concentrates (AUSTRIA JUICE, about 25% of segment revenue):

SYNERGY STRATEGY
The strategic goal: Raise inter-segment synergies to ensure the Group's ideal positioning amid a volatile operating environment in the business segments. The synergy strategy encompasses the strategies of the three individual segments and also includes the sustainability dimension. For AGRANA, sustainability has an environmental, a social and an economic aspect. The Group strives for careful, prudent use of natural resources, achieves almost 100% utilisation of its raw materials and employs highly efficient technologies to protect the environment.
CAPITAL MARKET STRATEGY
The strategic goal: A long-term partnership with shareholders. The Group's sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility. For its overall financing needs, in addition to the ability to self-finance, AGRANA has access to committed credit lines and the proceeds of a Schuldscheindarlehen (a loan with bond-like characteristics, sometimes translated as "bonded loan" or "promissory note loan"). AGRANA sees its shareholders as long-term partners in realising the Group's goals and offers them an attractive long-run return on investment at a reasonable level of risk. With a policy of open and transparent communication, AGRANA aims to safeguard investors' confidence in the Group and make its business performance and management decisions predictable and easy to understand.

For the equity market, the 2014 calendar year was characterised by uneven macroeconomic growth rates, uncertainty about the policies of central banks and a series of political crises. The growth acceleration in Europe did not meet expectations, while the Ukraine-Russia crisis had a negative economic impact in some cases and, above all, weighed heavily on sentiment. The economic trend in the USA was relatively robust and thus the US stock exchanges were among the year's winners. The Vienna Stock Exchange had a good start to 2014, but the lasting crisis surrounding Ukraine, along with weak national economic data and company-specific issues, led to unfavourable newsflow in the Austrian marketplace and hence to declining share prices.
AGRANA (ISIN code: AT0000603709) started the 2014|15 financial year at a share price of  87.70. The Vienna stock market environment cited above and the challenging market setting for sugar manufacturers made for a volatile share price performance that was negative on balance. While the quotation briefly exceeded  90 in June, it fell to just below  70 in October. Towards the end of the financial year, the share price rallied to slightly above  80. The average trading volume on the Vienna Stock Exchange was approximately 2,000 shares per day (based on double counting, as published by the VSE). The closing price of AGRANA's shares on the balance sheet date of  80.51 represented a decrease of 8.20% for the financial year under review. The performance of the benchmark index for the Vienna exchange, the ATX, was a decline of 3.58% over the same period.
The market capitalisation at 28 February 2015, with an unchanged 14,202,040 shares outstanding, was  1,143.4 million (prior year:  1,245.5 million).
AGRANA is listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and is also quoted in the VÖNIX, the Austrian Sustainability Index. This equity index comprises those exchange-traded Austrian companies which are leading in social and environmental performance.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SOURCING MODELS
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA processes sugar beet from contract growers and also refines raw sugar purchased worldwide. The products are sold into downstream industries for use in, for example, sweets, non-alcoholic beverages and pharmaceutical applications. Under country-specific sugar consumer brands, AGRANA also markets a wide range of sugars and sugar specialty products to consumers through food retailers. In addition, in the interest of the most complete possible utilisation of its agricultural raw materials, AGRANA produces a large number of fertilisers and feedstuffs for animals. These not only help the economic bottom line but also ecologically close the material cycle by returning minerals and other nutrients to the land and the food chain.

Organisational boundaries of GRI reporting With the exceptions named below, the sustainability information integrated in this 2014|15 annual report and visually highlighted with a green fingerprint represents all AGRANA Group companies worldwide. These performance data material to AGRANA's business activities were generated in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) version G4, level "Core").
For organisational boundary reasons, the sustainability data do not include the equity-accounted joint ventures of the AGRANA Group ­ the AGRANA-STUDEN group (in the Sugar segment) and the HUNGRANA group (in the Starch segment). INSTANTINA (in the Sugar segment) is also excluded from the scope of the data.

Content boundaries of GRI reporting
(1) Supplier assessment for human rights, labour practices and environmental aspects In view of its core business of processing agricultural raw materials and of the associated high procurement volumes and costs, AGRANA limits its reporting scope to suppliers of agricultural raw materials and intermediate goods (such as frozen fruit pieces).
(2) Biodiversity AGRANA as a processor of agricultural raw materials is dependent on the availability of these inputs and thus on the functioning of local ecosystems. For this reason, biodiversity is an important element of sustainability for AGRANA, especially in its upstream value chain in the farm landscape. In this annual report, AGRANA publishes biodiversity aspects (to the extent possible) of raw material procurement from contract growers in the respective business segment's report.

ably reused in animal husbandry or crop cultivation.

AGRANA's reporting of energy use and emissions is confined to its own production operations and, respectively, to Scope 1 and Scope 2. The reasons are that very limited data is available for Scope 3, and also that Scope 3 sources are in some cases (such as business travel) negligible compared to the large contributions which the production operations make to the carbon footprint through their energy consumption and emissions.

(4) Water and effluent (wastewater) AGRANA reports water and wastewater figures solely for its core business, the processing of agricultural raw materials in its production plants. Data on water use in the upstream value chain (i. e., in the production of agricultural raw materials) are not sufficiently complete or reliable for all raw materials used worldwide and are therefore not reported.

Water ­ perhaps the planet's most important resource ­ is one of many inputs in the production processes of the AGRANA Group. The use and discharge of water at all sites follows sustainable practices. In its processes, AGRANA frequently utilises the water contained in the agricultural raw materials.

Thus, much of the water required by a sugar factory is obtained from the beet itself. Sugar beet has a water content of about 75%, which must be separated from the sugar during the manufacturing process. This water is used both to leach the sugar out of the cossettes (the sliced beet) and, earlier, to transport and clean the beet. The used water is continually cleaned and returned to the process cycle. Much the same is true in juice concentrate production from apples, which contain about 86% water.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

47
The consolidated financial statements for the 2014|15 financial year (the twelve months ended 28 February 2015) were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

INITIAL APPLICATION OF IFRS 11 (JOINT ARRANGEMENTS)
With the adoption of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements), the joint ventures of the AGRANA STUDEN group (Sugar segment) and HUNGRANA group (Starch segment) are since the beginning of the 2014|15 financial year accounted for using the equity method. As this standard requires retrospective application, the data for the prior year (2013|14) have been restated accordingly. Details of the impacts on the presentation and results are provided in the consolidated financial statements (from page 110) under the heading "Restatements in accordance with IAS 8".

CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION
In the 2014|15 financial year the Group saw four deconsolidations as a result of mergers, including the merger of AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH, Vienna, into AGRANA Stärke GmbH, Vienna, and three additions as companies were consolidated for the first time.
In total, 63 companies were fully consolidated (end of 2013|14 financial year: 64 companies) and 11 companies were accounted for using the equity method (end of 2013|14 financial year: 12 companies).

In the 2014|15 financial year, revenue of the AGRANA Group was  2,493.5 million, a decrease of 12.3% from the prior year as a result mainly of lower selling prices. Revenue in the Starch segment, at  700.1 million (down 0.9%) was nearly as high as one year earlier; revenue reductions in the Sugar segment to  731.1 million (off 24.1%) and in the Fruit segment to  1,062.3 million (down 9.4%) primarily reflected the decline in sales prices.

Operating profit (EBIT, or earnings before interest and tax), at  121.7 million, was 27.1% below the prior-year level of  166.9 million. While EBIT in the Starch segment showed a small improvement (to  54.1 million, up 0.4%), the Sugar segment ( 9.0 million; down 81.7%) as expected saw a very significant decrease in earnings as a result of the difficult sugar market conditions. The net exceptional items income of  1.0 million in the Sugar segment was attributable to refunds received in connection with the EU production levy. A net exceptional items expense of  6.7 million weighed on EBIT in the Fruit segment. More details on these one-time expenses associated with the streamlining of fruit preparations production sites in Austria and with restructurings in the Dirafrost business are presented in the Fruit segment report. On balance, operating profit in the Fruit segment decreased moderately, by 8.2% to  58.6 million.

Net financial items in the 2014|15 financial year amounted to a net expense of  5.2 million (prior year: net expense of  30.2 million); the substantial year-on-year improvement of  25.6 million resulted primarily from net currency translation gains (prior year: translation losses). Net interest income too increased by  3.2 million. The main reasons for this were lower borrowing needs as a result of reduced working capital, and a further drop in interest rates.
Profit before tax decreased from  136.7 million in the prior year to  116.5 million. After an income tax expense of  31.9 million based on a tax rate of 27.4% (prior year: 21.7%), the Group's profit for the period was  84.6 million (prior year:  107.0 million). Profit for the period attributable to shareholders of AGRANA was  80.9 million (prior year:  105.2 million); earnings per share eased to  5.70 (prior year:  7.40).

INVESTMENT

In 2014|15, AGRANA invested a total of  91.2 million, or  38.7 million less than in the year before. The analysis of this capital spending on purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets by segment is as follows:

Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was  168.6 million in the 2014|15 financial year, down 9.4% from the prior year as a result mainly of the lower EBIT. With a smaller decrease of  58.7 million in working capital (prior year: decrease of  98.8 million), net cash from operating activities was  227.3 million (prior year:  283.9 million). Net cash used in investing activities was  87.1 million, taking into account lower outflows for investment in property, plant and equipment and intangibles (prior year: net cash use of  126.5 million). Net cash used in financing activities of  78.3 million (prior year: net cash use of  139.1 million) reflected primarily the payment of the dividend for the 2013|14 financial year. Free cash flow declined by 11.0% yearon-year.

Total assets at 28 February 2015 were  2,406.9 million, an increase of  14.7 million from the year-earlier level. With investment exceeding depreciation and with the change in equityaccounted joint ventures, non-current assets grew by  32.2 million. While cash and cash equivalents increased markedly (by  58.0 million), inventories fell for volume and price reasons (by  60.1 million), leading to a slight net reduction in non-current assets.

Liabilities

AGRANA's equity ratio of 49.6% was almost unchanged from the year-earlier level (49.8%). On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, non-current liabilities rose slightly, as a result mainly of the increase in provisions for pension and termination benefit obligations (up  13.6 million). Current liabilities remained virtually constant despite somewhat higher current borrowings and provisions.
Net debt at 28 February 2015 was  330.3 million, a considerable reduction of  56.5 million from the 2013|14 year-end level. The gearing ratio of 27.7% at the balance sheet date was thus substantially lower than one year earlier, when it stood at 32.5%.

In the past months the AGRANA Group took advantage of favourable conditions in the capital market to further secure its long-term funding base. A syndicated loan in the amount of  300 million obtained at the end of 2012 (a working capital facility) was renewed early with the existing bank lenders in July 2014 for five years (thus maturing in 2019) as strategic and longterm financing for the Group. As well, in October 2014 the variable interest portion of the Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) placed in 2012 ( 74 million out of  110 million) was called and reissued. As the issue was highly oversubscribed, AGRANA increased the amount to  90 million (for a new total of  126 million).

In the 2014|15 financial year, revenue in the Sugar segment fell by a significant 24.1% year-onyear to  731.1 million. The reasons were a sharp reduction in sales prices and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in quantities sold into the sugar-using industry and in non-quota sugar. In the business with wholesalers and retailers, the market-leading position was further consolidated through high quota sugar sales and good service. Revenue from by-products rose moderately. The Sugar segment accounted for 29.3% of Group revenue (prior year: 33.9%).
Likewise, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), at  9.0 million, was sharply lower than in the prior year. The key negative driver was the drastic decline in sugar sales prices, which could not be made up for by the lower raw material prices paid especially for raw sugar. The earnings trend in co-products (dried beet pulp and molasses) was also a downward one; as a consequence of lower selling prices, the additional contribution margins from these products did not match the levels of the year before. Net exceptional items income of  1.0 million resulting from refunds in connection with the EU production levy had a small positive effect on EBIT.
Further details on the results in the Sugar business are given in the segment report from page 54.

Revenue in the Starch segment in 2014|15 was  700.1 million, just 0.9% less than in the previous year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower sales prices for bioethanol, native starches and starch saccharification products. The price effect was almost completely offset by higher volumes, including the output of the fully utilised wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria. Selling prices for by-products remained steady from the prior year, with an increased share of premiumpriced proteins. The Starch segment generated 28.1% of the Group's revenue (prior year: 24.9%).

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL RESULTS

EBIT, at  54.1 million, was up 0.4% from the prior year. Lower raw material and energy prices and higher sales quantities, thanks particularly to products from the wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, compensated for the revenue decrease caused by lower sales prices. The EBIT profit margin showed a small uptick to 7.7% (prior year: 7.6%). The contribution made to segment EBIT by HUNGRANA, the joint venture which is now accounted for using the equity method, was off moderately from the previous year.

Fruit segment revenue decreased by 9.4% in the 2014|15 financial year, to  1,062.3 million. The sales volumes of fruit preparations were slightly below the year-earlier level, but most of the approximately 3% decline in fruit preparations revenue represented currency translation effects. The revenue reduction of just under one-quarter in the fruit juice concentrate division resulted mainly from steeply lower selling prices of apple juice concentrate, but also from a decrease in sales quantities. The Fruit segment was responsible for 42.6% of Group revenue (prior year: 41.2%).
Fruit segment EBIT was  58.6 million, or 8.2% less than one year earlier. Operating profit in the fruit juice concentrate business was down in absolute terms as a consequence of selling prices, but the margin was held constant. In fruit preparations, operating profit was reduced by a net exceptional items expense of  6.7 million, mostly for the costs of closing the plant in Kröllendorf/ Allhartsberg, Austria, and moving its production to Gleisdorf, Austria. Nonetheless, overall Fruit segment operating profit before exceptional items and equity-accounted joint ventures was fully steady at the year-earlier level.
More information on the results in the Fruit segment is provided in the segment report from page 66.

Total sales quantities of sugar products declined significantly compared to the prior year, with differences between product groups. While the volume of retail quota sugar was steady, there was a clear decrease in quota sugar sold into the food and beverage industry, especially in Austria, where the reduction was 8%. This was explained both by weather-related lower demand from the beverage industry and by the difficult market situation in general. The quantity of non-quota sugar sold to the chemical industry fell by 44%, but sales of the same commodity outside the EU increased by 25%.
In all product groups, operating profit was affected by falling prices. The largest decline was experienced in prices with wholesalers and retailers. The price erosion was felt in every country of operation.
The result of the AGRANA-STUDEN group, which is included in the consolidated financial statements by the equity method of accounting, had a negative impact on EBIT of the Sugar segment, due largely to the low sales prices in the Western Balkans region caused by volume and price pressure from Serbia, and to underutilisation of the refinery in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT
World sugar market For the 2014|15 sugar marketing year (SMY, October 2014 to September 2015) the analytics firm F. O. Licht, in its second, revised estimate of the world sugar balance from 17 February 2015, is forecasting a further decrease in world sugar production and further growth in consumption. This estimate implies an equilibrium of supply and demand, which would be the first time since SMY 2009|10. However, given the high sugar stocks accumulated in the past several years, this is likely to have only a moderate impact on the world market price.

The producer countries with a major influence on the world market, Brazil and India, expect good harvests. While a dry spell in Brazil's main production regions depressed crop expectations in January, abundant rainfall in February improved the outlook again and another good crop is thus now projected. India expects this crop to exceed demand in its domestic market, with the surplus to be placed on the world market. For this purpose, an export subsidy was introduced that is to make exporting attractive for Indian producers even when world market prices are low.
The strong US dollar and relatively low oil price are also leaving their mark. The low price of petroleum as a product competing with ethanol hampers the production of ethanol and manufacturers are therefore opting for a higher proportion of sugar in their production mix. This is especially true in Brazil, where the switch between the two products can be accomplished quickly. The strength of the American dollar, particularly against the Brazilian real, cushions the impact of the low world market prices (quoted in US dollars) in the national currency and thus sugar exports make economic sense even when prices in the world market are down.

Customers in industry and resellers Regarding its reseller accounts (wholesalers and retailers), AGRANA continues to work to consolidate or expand existing market share. The aim going forward is to retain the preferred supplier status with customers, some of whom the Group has been serving for many years.
In the reseller business, the focus in all countries is on the intensification and continuation of the existing brand strategy and, especially in Eastern Europe, on strengthening the specialties portfolio.
Among large industrial customers, there is a sustained trend towards consolidation and internationalisation. AGRANA is able to act as a dependable partner to these companies both locally and internationally.

RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION
The area of sugar beet fields harvested by AGRANA's contract farmers in the 2014|15 sugar marketing year was about 98,000 hectares (prior SMY: 102,000 hectares); a little over 600 hectares of this was used for organic production in Austria. While the contract acreages were thus lower, above-average beet yields and harvests were achieved in all countries thanks to this year's very good weather and growing conditions. In total, AGRANA processed approximately 7.7 million tonnes of beet (prior year: 6.2 million tonnes). The sugar content of the 2014 crop, at 15.2%, was below average (prior year: 17.1%), as a result of the weather before and during the harvest period and the relatively lengthy storage of the beet.

EU sugar policy After the expiration on 30 September 2017 of the sugar and isoglucose quotas and of the arrangements on the minimum price for beet, the new regime for the intra-EU market ­ besides an unchanged reference price of  404 per tonne for white sugar ­ provides for the possibility of governmentfunded private storage, and contracts between beet growers and the sugar industry will remain mandatory. As a consequence, the volume and price volatility in the world market will make itself felt more strongly in the EU sugar market than before.

AGRANA's seven beet-using sugar factories processed a daily average of about 48,400 tonnes of beet (prior year: 50,500 tonnes). The average campaign length across all plants was 164 days (prior year: 125 days). During this time the beet was processed into approximately 999,000 tonnes of sugar (prior year: 953,000 tonnes). Sugar production thus significantly exceeded the Group's EU beet sugar quota of 618,000 tonnes and was up about 4.8% from the prior year. The volumes in excess of the quota are marketed as non-quota sugar to the chemical industry or exported on the world market. In 2014|15 AGRANA also refined approximately 277,500 tonnes of white sugar equivalent from raw sugar (prior year: 274,700 tonnes). As well, in the organic beet campaign, the Group produced around 4,200 tonnes of organic sugar (prior year: about 3,900 tonnes).

The changes in average specific water consumption and in average specific effluent (wastewater) discharge volume per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the year were attributable largely to the higher quantity of sugar beet processed.

Despite the increase in beet quantities processed, the specific amount of waste per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the Sugar segment fell from 202 kg in 2013|14 to 195 kg in the 2014|15 financial year. The approximately 19.8%

increase in reuse of waste represented mainly by-products such as pressed beet pulp which must be reported as waste under local legislation, in spite of the fact that AGRANA sells or gives them away as co-products. The reduction in waste sent to landfill is due mostly to a site in Romania that no longer disposed of waste in landfills in 2014|15. The absolute and specific increase in hazardous waste is the result of extensive rail track renewal at the facility in Leopoldsdorf, Austria, and the disposal of more waste oil.
Biodiversity at a former production site Biodiversity represents an important element of sustainability especially in AGRANA's upstream supply chain in the agricultural landscape. At its own production facilities as well, however, AGRANA goes to considerable lengths to protect local ecosystems and conserve biodiversity.

INVESTMENT
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA invested  34.5 million (prior year:  43.1 million) in new assets and asset replacement during the 2014|15 financial year:
 The molasses desugaring plant in Tulln, Austria, was expanded and the enlarged facility is to begin operation in May 2015

 Pulp press replacement in Hrusovany and Opava, Czech Republic, and Sere, Slovakia

Thus AGRANA has repurposed the settling ponds on the grounds of its former sugar plant (closed in 2006) in Hohenau an der March, Austria, working together with the AURING conservationist club. Located in an area of high diversity value identified under the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands1, the ponds now serve as a staging area for water birds, most notably waders. The site is a popular destination for bird watchers.

The Starch segment, through AGRANA Stärke GmbH, includes the three Austrian plants in Aschach (corn starch), Gmünd (potato starch) and Pischelsdorf (integrated wheat starch and bioethanol plants). The company also manages and coordinates the international starch and bioethanol holdings in Hungary and Romania. Since the beginning of the 2014|15 financial year, with the adoption of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements), the consolidated financial statements use the equity method to account for the joint ventures of the HUNGRANA group (which make starch and saccharification products, bioethanol, and by-products). In the year under review, AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH was merged into AGRANA Stärke GmbH.

Revenue of AGRANA Stärke GmbH in the 2014|15 financial year was held almost at the year-earlier level. The effect of lower selling prices for most core products was counteracted by higher volumes, particularly in native and derivative starches. The wheat starch plant commissioned in the prior year in Pischelsdorf, Austria, reached full utilisation in 2014|15 and the additional quantities of starch and by-products were marketed successfully. Thanks to the stable market demand and vigorous marketing, sales volume growth was achieved in the existing product portfolios of potato and corn starches and saccharification products. The bioethanol business operated in a difficult market environment. As a result of production- and import-driven oversupply and a decline in demand for bioethanol, the year under review saw a plunge in ethanol quotations, with a historic low of  417 per cubic metre in January 2015. The lower raw material and energy costs were not enough to offset the margin losses in the bioethanol activities. Overall, EBIT of AGRANA Stärke GmbH remained level with the prior year.
Sales revenue of the Romanian subsidiary was down year-on-year amid lower sales quantities and prices. Especially in saccharification products, sales volume declined significantly due to heated competition. Lower material expenses, however, outweighed the revenue reduction to still produce an improvement in EBIT.
In 2014|15, revenue of the HUNGRANA group in Hungary, which is now equity-accounted, decreased considerably. The lower sales prices of the core products, notably bioethanol and isoglucose, could not be recouped by the higher sales quantities of core and by-products. Despite lower raw material and energy prices, the joint venture's after-tax result was less than in the prior year.

RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION
World grain supply and demand for the 2014|15 grain marketing year1, according to the International Grains Council, shows a level of production much like the prior year's and a slight increase in demand. World corn production of 992 million tonnes is expected to exceed consumption, estimated at 974 million tonnes. Similarly, global wheat production of 719 million tonnes is forecast to exceed worldwide demand of 709 million tonnes. This suggests that global stocks of corn and wheat will increase from the previous year.

63
Corn and wheat The corn processing volume in the AGRANA starch plants in Austria and Romania, as in the prior year, was about 745,000 tonnes in the 2014|15 financial year. Within this total, the share of specialty corn processed (waxy corn, organic corn, and Guaranteed Non-GMO corn) increased to about 12% (prior year: 8%).
At the site in Pischelsdorf, Austria, in the 2014|15 financial year, approximately 440,000 tonnes (prior year: 287,000 tonnes) of wheat were used for processing into wheat starch and bioethanol.

Consistent with the better supply on international commodity markets, futures prices declined in the course of the year. At the end of February 2015, on the NYSE Euronext Liffe commodity derivatives exchange in Paris, corn quoted around  148 per tonne and the wheat quotation was about  185 per tonne (prior year, respectively:  173 and  209 per tonne).
Potato In the 2014|15 campaign the Austrian starch plant in Gmünd, over a campaign lasting 147 days (prior year: 101 days), processed about 240,500 tonnes of starch potatoes (prior year: 160,200 tonnes) with an average starch content of 17.3% (prior year: 18.7%). The organic share of this was about 3% (prior year: 4%). For the 2015 campaign year, AGRANA plans a starch potato contract volume of approximately 220,000 tonnes. About 24,900 tonnes of food potatoes (prior year: 23,200 tonnes) were processed into around 4,500 tonnes of long-life potato products (prior year: 4,300 tonnes), with an organic share of approximately 21% (prior year: 19%).

In Hungary at HUNGRANA, the corn processing volume grew slightly from 1,034,000 tonnes to 1,048,000 tonnes (note that since the switch to equity accounting in the year under review, the figures for this entity are stated at 100% of the total rather than 50% as in the past).
Engagement in the upstream value chain In the 2014|15 financial year the Starch segment (like the Sugar and Fruit activities) took the first steps to implement the AGRANA principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products, with a focus on contract-grown potatoes in Austria and the Czech Republic. In 2015|16 it is planned for the potato supplier farms to participate in the Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative. Besides the consulting provided by the AGRANA agricultural advisors, the participation by many European Union farmers in the EU cross compliance programme should also be positive for the results of the self-assessment (for details, see the "Sustainability" section on page 73).

The average specific water consumption in the Starch segment per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the 2014|15 financial year was about 8.3% less than one year earlier. This was mostly because, in 2013|14, more water was used for starting operation of the expansion of the starch derivatives plant in Aschach, Austria. The increase of about 2.2% in average specific effluent volume was the result of higher precipitation in Austria, which naturally entailed the discharge of more surface water.

Revenue in the fruit preparations division eased by about 3.4% in the year under review. This was the result primarily of unfavourable currency translation effects, but also of slightly lower sales volumes for fruit preparations (down 1.3%) which was only partially offset by higher quantities in other business (sales of raw materials, up 6.3%). While sales quantities were pushed up year-on-year in North America (including the new plant in Lysander, New York), Australia and Asia, the other regions did not reach the year-earlier volumes, with Eastern Europe falling particularly short.
Despite the challenging market environment, AGRANA was able to maintain its position in the EU ­ the most important region for this business in revenue terms ­ and also to significantly increase profits. This was made possible especially by effective product portfolio management and cost control improvement. AGRANA will continue to take measures to raise profitability in the EU.
In Russia and Ukraine, AGRANA's fruit preparations business saw a weakening of the market and declines in sales quantities as a result of the difficult economic and political situation, but was able to improve its operating margin. There were no bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials at any time.
In North America, AGRANA Fruit (the fruit preparations division) achieved volume growth. Earnings here decreased from the prior year in measure with the (budgeted) start-up costs for the new plant in Lysander, New York.

RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION
The prices in procurement markets were down for the second consecutive year.
The deflationary trend in raw material markets was particularly evident for berries and stone fruits in the European and North African sourcing regions. Likewise, costs fell for sugar and starch, important ingredients in fruit preparations.

The berry processing season was on the whole marked by good available volumes of the principal fruits. The prices for the most important raw materials (strawberry, sour cherry and black currant, though not raspberry) were down significantly from the prior year.

AGRANA'S UNDERSTANDING OF SUSTAINABILITY

In the 2014|15 financial year, AGRANA worked intensively on the further integration of sustainability aspects into operational business processes. This is apparent in a number of new or newly formalised internal policies and principles, in the certification to various international sustainability standards relevant for the business activities, in the membership and work in organisations and initiatives focused on sustainability, and in the goals set for the coming financial years.

In essence, all activities can be summed up under AGRANA's three sustainability principles, which serve management and all employees as a practical and intuitive guide to daily sustainable action:

At AGRANA we:  Utilise almost 100% of our raw materials and employ low-emission technologies to protect
the environment  Respect all our stakeholders and the communities where we operate  Engage in long-term partnerships with suppliers and customers

AGRANA'S SUSTAINABILITY ACTIVITIES IN 2014|15 AND GOALS GOING FORWARD
The six issues relevant to AGRANA's businesses were addressed in the year under review through the following activities and objectives.

(1) Environmental and social criteria in sourcing The growing sustainability consciousness of consumers in the food and beverage sector, and thus of the food industry, increasingly makes the assurance of sustainability criteria along the entire product value chain a condition of buying and sourcing decisions.
For AGRANA, which in the 2014|15 financial year processed a total of about 11.6 million tonnes (prior year: 9.6 million tonnes) of agricultural raw materials in the three business segments, the focus of sustainability work in the upstream value chain was therefore the development of a strategy for ensuring and documenting sustainability aspects in the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate goods.

AGRANA principles the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products The starting point for all activities was the formulation of principles, applicable to all AGRANA Group companies, for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products. These AGRANA principles set both minimum social standards (by reference to the AGRANA Code of Conduct) and environmental criteria that AGRANA regards as relevant for the sustainable production of the agricultural raw materials required by the Group. The principles also address different ways for suppliers to meet these sustainability criteria, according to the degree of vertical integration of the respective sourcing model. The integration of the principles into individual agreements with contract growers and other raw material suppliers has begun.

New AGRANA products with extra sustainability value To improve soil fertility and enhance biodiversity, especially in beet fields, AGRANA developed a flowering catch-crop mix in 2014|15 that was very well received by the farmers (also see the "Biodiversity" section in the Sugar segment report on page 57).
Rising interest by consumers and hence by the food industry in plant protein as a substitute for animal protein is leading to steady growth in vegan products. In the year under review, AGRANA catered to this trend by developing blends of fruits, vegetables and sweet lupines. These innovations were presented for the first time by AGRANA's Fruit segment at the Health Ingredients Europe trade show in Amsterdam.
As well, the AGRANA Research & Innovation Center (ARIC) developed starches which, when used in sauces and spreads, serve as a partial substitute for fats and thus help reduce fat content. These starch products were premiered at Biofach in Nuremberg, Germany, the world's leading trade fair for organic food.
(5) Compliance and business conduct The activities in 2014|15 around compliance and business conduct are presented in the "Compliance" section of the corporate governance report (see from page 29).

(6) Social engagement The catastrophic flooding in 2014 in Southeastern Europe deprived thousands of people in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia of their livelihoods. As AGRANA has been operating a facility in Brcko, Bosnia-Herzegovina for many years and its local employees too suffered flood damage, it was only natural for the company to help out swiftly and unbureaucratically.
Through donations collected under the motto "Employees helping employees" and the matching of the resulting sum by AGRANA's Management Board, a total of  41,000 was raised. The money supported local colleagues affected in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also went to the "Reconstruction in Southeastern Europe" aid initiative started by the Kurier, an Austrian daily newspaper.
In May 2014 AGRANA's Vienna office mounted a usedclothing donation campaign specifically to help homeless people of EU origin who use the Zweite Gruft emergency shelter operated by Caritas, a charity.
The now-traditional Christmas donation by AGRANA's office in Vienna, which takes the place of Christmas gifts to commercial partners, in December 2014 was given to the Red Cross for its winter aid programme in eastern Ukraine.
In 2014|15 as in the previous years, AGRANA donated sugar to the "Le+O markets" run by Caritas. These regularly held markets offer food at a nominal price, together with orientation, social counselling and support for people with low incomes. As in the past, AGRANA employees from the head office in Vienna volunteered their help with the weekly food distribution at a nearby Le+O market during working hours.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

78 Operating in a highly competitive market environment, it is vital for AGRANA to be a market trendsetter and differentiate itself from the competition through product innovations. In close partnership with customers, AGRANA's research and development (R&D) teams are always working on new recipes, specialty products and innovative applications for existing products, in a tribute also to the Group's strategic focus on lasting, sustainable success.
Until July 2014, AGRANA maintained two separate R&D facilities. The activities of Zuckerforschung Tulln Ges.m.b.H. in Tulln, Austria, ranged from agricultural R&D, to food, sugar, starch and bioethanol technology, all the way to microbiology and biotechnology projects. Meanwhile, the Centre of Innovation and Excellence in Gleisdorf, Austria, conducted the centralised R&D for the fruit preparations business. This facility was responsible for the development of products and production methods, in addition to longer-term R&D projects to provide AGRANA's international customers with innovative solutions in direct response to the needs of the market.
After a physical expansion of the research site in Tulln, AGRANA's research and innovation activities at the former two centres were combined into a single unit at this location in summer 2014. The resulting new AGRANA Research & Innovation Center (ARIC), with about 60 people and approximately 4,000 m2 of floor space, is now the Group's central research and development institute. The capital expenditure for the expansion of the Tulln research site was about  4 million. Beyond offering administrative synergies, the merging of the two units especially promotes the closer collaboration of the previously geographically separate groups of researchers. The complementarity between the two groups' experience is particularly valuable in cross-segment areas of research, such as nutrition physiology, thickeners and aromas, microbiology, product quality and safety, and organic products. In this way, the growing number of projects that involve more than one AGRANA business segment can be carried out much more simply and efficiently. This new AGRANA research cluster in Tulln also makes it easy to connect with relevant university institutions as well as their graduates. Moreover, the AGRANA research center also offers its specialist R&D know-how to third parties and acts as a state-accredited laboratory for bioethanol analytics and sugar beet quality control.

SUGAR SEGMENT
After preliminary work in the 2013|14 campaign, development efforts to optimise sugar extraction in terms of control of microbial activity were front and centre in the 2014|15 financial year. Microorganisms are to some extent consciously used in the process for the benefits they bring, but need to be carefully controlled to minimise certain disadvantages of their use. Allowing more microbial activity saves disinfectant and energy costs (energy is saved if the extraction residue is to be dehydrated, as the action of the microorganisms improves the mechanical pressability of the spent beet pulp). On the other hand, it causes some sugar losses and involves costs for

product.

Non-food applications In starches for non-food uses, the R&D efforts are increasingly moving away from petrochemicals in favour of renewable, eco-friendly products. In the paper, adhesive and textile sectors, creative solutions for starch modification permitted the replacement of synthetic, petroleum-based products. Besides their environmental advantage, these new starches also have high economic appeal for the market.
Saving unnecessary costs while keeping quality constant is an important concern in additives for dry mortars. Through new raw material combinations among other ways, smart new products were brought to market to meet this need.
A promising area of application for innovative starch products made from renewable resources is the bioplastics sector, which shows steady growth in demand. Here, special thermoplastic starches were developed for the large market segment of film applications. An especially attractive quality of these starches is their good workability with common, biodegradable polyesters. What is more, in the plastic composition, they significantly increase the proportion of the renewable component to petrochemical polyesters.

FRUIT SEGMENT
Work continued apace on the multi-year project established in 2013|14 for continual quality improvement in the individual parts of the value chain for fruit preparations, "from field to cup". In this endeavour, the ConsumerRelevant Innovation Strategy helps to frame market-centric sub-projects, all of which share the common goal of protecting the natural texture of the fruit pieces while at the same time preserving the fruit's own aromas and colours.
The financial year saw the industrial-scale implementation of several steps to optimise fruit raw materials: In Morocco, new strawberry varieties were cultivated, special harvesting methods were adopted and novel options for processing immediately after harvest were tested on a large scale.
The emphasis in fruit product development was on alternative clean label stabiliser systems. Under this umbrella, AGRANA established the use of fruit fibres in production operations. Additionally, the application of special peptins in a wide variety of yoghurt products was commercialised worldwide. In the ice cream industry, AGRANA agreed a three-year joint project with a long-standing partner, focusing on the improvement of fruit pieces in ice cream.

Bioethanol A recurring objective of AGRANA's research and development activities is to boost the value-added of process by-products. For example, work is being done on upgrading distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a co-product of bioethanol production that can also be used as organic fertiliser (BioAgenasol®). The combination of BioAgenasol®

The collaboration with filling and dosing machinery manufacturers was continued, both to support mutual customers in the dairy sector with problem solutions and to be able to drive new developments forward. For the beverage sector, an innovative filling process was developed (together with two partner firms) that improves filling precision and end product quality.

In the year, AUSTRIA JUICE expanded the beverage bases business for the long term by winning additional customers and developing new products. The company successfully started its own aroma production to support the growth segment of beverage bases and build up the aromas business. Further projects were initiated for the better utilisation and marketing of process by-products and the expansion of the product portfolio.
Special attention in this regard is placed on the development, and ultimately the marketing, of premium natural fruit flavourings known as FTNF ("from the named fruit") flavours. Other R&D objectives are the improvement of manufacturing processes for water phase flavours and the evaluation of the technical feasibility of reducing critical pesticides in the fruit juice supply chain by physical methods.

AGRANA'S PEOPLE

82 In the 2014|15 financial year the AGRANA Group as a whole employed an average of 8,708 people (prior year: 8,505). Of this total, 2,138 worked in Austria (prior year: 2,124) and 6,570 worked in other countries (prior year: 6,381).
The average number of employees in each business segment was as follows:  Sugar segment: 2,326 employees (prior year: 2,276).  Starch segment: 863 employees (prior year: 858).  Fruit segment: 5,519 employees (prior year: 5,371).
The average age of permanent employees1 on 28 February 2015 was 41 years, as in the prior year. Of the permanent employees, 28.8% (prior year: 29.2%) were women, and 59.6% of salaried staff had an academic degree (prior year: 58.9%).
The increase in staff numbers in the Sugar segment resulted largely from the record beet campaign in 2014|15. In the Starch segment, the average number of employees was steady. An increase of just under 150 positions in the Fruit segment was attributable mainly to a greater requirement for seasonal labour in Ukraine, Mexico and Serbia. The new production facility in the USA likewise entailed growth in staff numbers.
HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
As an international group of companies, AGRANA relies on its employees' working ability and motivation, as well as their integrity and social consciousness. Employees are supported in their development and encouraged to think and act like entrepreneurs. The style of work and leadership is marked by cooperation and mutual esteem.
Every AGRANA employee thus assumes responsibility for his or her own continuing professional development. The personnel departments provide all employees with training and development opportunities and support in harmony with the Group's strategic objectives. This long-term development is also essential to securing AGRANA's continuing competitive strength.
A Group-wide performance management system for managerial staff, including performancerelated pay, is used worldwide to achieve the company's strategic and operational goals and targets.

In the 2014|15 financial year there were no fatal accidents in the workplace at the AGRANA Group.1 In the 2014|15 financial year there were six accidents of AGRANA contractors. For organisational reasons, these are not included in the AGRANA workplace safety data such as the injury rate, lost day rate and absentee rate.
1 Non-permanent (i. e., fixed-term or temporary) and permanent employees within the GRI report boundaries (see from page 45). 2 Injury rate = (total number of accidents5 ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,0007 3 Lost day rate = (total number of lost days8 ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 4 Absentee rate = (total number of missed hours due to accident5 and sickness ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 5 In AGRANA's workplace safety data, injuries are counted as accidents if a scheduled work day is lost. Days are counted
as lost from the first scheduled work day missed after the accident (excluding accidents on the way to or from work). 6 Total paid hours worked are defined by AGRANA as contractual work hours plus paid overtime. 7 Explanation of the multiplier 200,000: This multiplier is intended to make a company's internal workplace safety data
comparable with other companies. It is based on the assumption of 40 work hours per week and 50 work weeks per year, for 100 employees (40 × 50 × 100). The purpose is to convert from a company's average number of accidents, lost days or absentee hours (hours missed as a result of accident or illness) per hour of work done in the company, to an annual number per 100 employees. 8 A work day is assumed to have eight hours.

Trained educators from non-profit Hilfswerk put on age-appropriate, stimulating programmes for employees' children aged three to ten years, including such varied activities as a first-aid course, excursions to a farm, and a playful introduction to sign language. Under the motto of "This is where our food comes from", children were given a glimpse into the world of farming.

RISK MANAGEMENT
AND SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
86 The Management Board of the AGRANA Group recognises the importance of active risk management. The basic aim of risk management at AGRANA is to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible and take appropriate measures to safeguard the profitability and continued existence of the Group.
The AGRANA Group uses integrated monitoring and reporting systems that permit regular, Groupwide assessment of the risk situation. For the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group, two mutually complementary control tools are in place:
 An enterprise-wide, operational planning and reporting system forms the basis for the monthly reporting to the appropriate decision-makers. Under this reporting process, a separate risk report is prepared for the Group and each business segment. Its focus is on the determination of sensitivities to changing market prices for the current and next financial year. The individual risk parameters are assessed on an ongoing basis in relation to the current budget (prepared at the start of the year) or the current forecast (as updated in the course of the year), so as to be able to calculate the impacts on the profit measure "operating profit before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures". Besides these ongoing reports, the business situation and the use of risk mitigation measures is regularly discussed by the risk managers from the business areas directly with the Management Board.
 The aim of strategic risk management is to identify material individual risks and evaluate their implications for the overall profile of risks and opportunities. Twice every year, the mediumto long-term risks in the individual business areas are analysed by a designated risk management team together with the Group's central risk management function. The process involves risk identification and risk assessment by probability of occurrence and potential magnitude of risk/opportunity, the definition of early warning indicators and the taking of countermeasures. Also, the aggregate risk position of the AGRANA Group is determined for the current financial year using a Monte Carlo simulation (which is an established standard calculation in risk management). This allows a judgement to be made as to whether a combination or accumulation of individual risks could pose a threat to the ability to continue in business as a going concern. The results are reported to the Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Risk management representatives have been designated for the business segments of the AGRANA Group who are responsible for initiating loss-minimising measures as required, subject to Management Board approval.
In the 2014|15 financial year, the independent auditor evaluated the design and implementation of risk management, in accordance with rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, and submitted the findings in a final report on the viability of the Group-wide risk management. The evaluation used the recommendations of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as the reference model against which to compare AGRANA's risk management.
RISK POLICY
AGRANA sees the responsible treatment of business opportunities and risks as an essential basis for purposeful, value-driven and sustainable business management. The Group's risk policy seeks to ensure risk-aware behaviour, sets out clearly defined responsibilities and stipulates independent risk control as well as integrated internal controls.

worked on and appropriate provisions were set aside in

Currency risks Currency risks arise mainly from the purchase and sale of goods in foreign currencies and from financing in foreign currencies or local financing in euros. For AGRANA, the principal relevant exchange rates are those between the euro and the US dollar, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Ukrainian hryvnia, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan.
For hedging currency risks, AGRANA primarily employs forward foreign exchange contracts (also known as currency forwards). Through these, the value of cash flows denominated in foreign currencies is protected against exchange rate movements. In countries with volatile currencies, these risks are further reduced through the shortening of credit periods, indexing of selling prices to the euro or US dollar, and similar methods of risk mitigation.
Currency risk is determined using the Value-at-Risk approach and presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In the 2013|14 and 2014|15 financial years, no material new information emerged in this fraud case, and the internal and external investigations conducted in 2012|13 proved to have been sufficiently comprehensive. Criminal complaints filed by AGRANA are pending against the former local management and against companies currently or previously owned by these former managers. Negotiations with the insurance company regarding cover of the reputational damage are in progress.
Arrangements for internal and external audits are in place to assure, to the extent possible, that similar occurrences are prevented or detected at an early stage.
AGGREGATE RISK
The Group's aggregate risk exposure was marked by continuing high volatility in selling prices and raw material purchasing prices, and, on balance, remained the same as in the prior year. At present there are no discernible risks to the AGRANA Group's ability to continue in business.

SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND OF RISK MANAGEMENT (DISCLOSURES UNDER SECTION 243A (2) AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE)
The Management Board of AGRANA exercises its responsibility for the establishment and design of an internal control system and risk management system in respect of both the accounting process and of compliance with the relevant legal requirements.
Standardised Group-wide accounting rules, the internal control system and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) assure both the uniformity of accounting and the reliability of the financial reporting and externally published financial statements.
Most Group companies use SAP as the primary ERP system. All AGRANA companies send the data from their separate financial statements to the central SAP consolidation module. This ensures that the reporting system operates on the basis of uniform data. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group Accounting department. The department is responsible for ensuring the correct and complete transfer of financial data from Group companies, for carrying out the financial statement consolidation, performing analytical processing of the data and preparing financial reports. On a monthly basis, the Controlling and Group Accounting departments validate and assure the congruence of the internal and external reporting.
The primary control tool for AGRANA's management is the enterprise-wide, uniform planning and reporting system. The system comprises a medium-term plan with a planning horizon of five years, budget planning for the next financial year, monthly reporting including a separate monthly risk report, and, three times per year, a projection for the current financial year that incorporates the significant financial developments. In the event of material changes in the planning assumptions, this system is supplemented with ad-hoc forecasts.

The monthly financial reporting produced by Controlling portrays the performance of all Group companies. The contents of this report are standardised across the Group and include detailed sales data, the balance sheet, income statement and the financials derived from them, as well as an analysis of significant variances. This monthly report also includes a dedicated risk report both for each business segment and the whole AGRANA Group, calculating the risk potential for the current and the next financial year based on the assumption that the key profitability factors (energy prices, raw material prices, selling prices, etc.) remain constant at their current level to the end of the respective financial year.
A Group-wide risk management system at both the operational and strategic level in which all sources and types of risk relevant to AGRANA ­ such as the regulatory and legal environment, raw material procurement, competitive and market risks, and financing ­ are analysed for risks and opportunities, enables the management to identify changes in the Group's environment at an early stage and to take timely corrective action as required.
Internal Audit monitors all operational and business processes in the Group for compliance with legal provisions and with internal policies and procedures, and for the effectiveness of risk management and the systems of internal control. The unit's audit activities are guided by a Management Board-approved annual audit plan that is based on a Group-wide risk assessment. When requested by the Management Board, Internal Audit also performs ad-hoc audits focusing on current and future risks. The audit findings are regularly reported to AGRANA's Management Board and the respective managers responsible. The implementation of the actions proposed by Internal Audit is assured by follow-up verifications.
As part of the audit of the financial statements, the external independent auditor, to the extent required for the audit opinion, annually evaluates the internal controls of the accounting process and of the information technology systems. The audit findings are reported to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

CAPITAL, SHARES, VOTING RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF CONTROL
(DISCLOSURES UNDER SEC TION 243A (1) AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE)
91
The share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG at the balance sheet date of 28 February 2015 was  103.2 million, divided into 14,202,040 voting ordinary no-par value bearer shares. There are no other classes of shares.
Z&S Zucker und Stärke Holding AG ("Z&S"), based in Vienna, is the majority shareholder, directly holding 86.2% of the share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Z&S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGRANA Zucker, Starke und Frucht Holding AG, Vienna. In this latter company, ZuckerBeteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. ("ZBG"), Vienna, in turn holds 50% less one share (that share being held by AGRANA Zucker GmbH, a subsidiary of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG), and Südzucker AG ("Südzucker"), Mannheim, Germany, holds the other 50%. The following five Vienna-based entities are shareholders of ZBG: ,,ALMARA" Holding GmbH (a subsidiary of Raiffeisen-Holding Niederösterreich-Wien registrierte Genossenschaft mit beschränkter Haftung); Marchfelder Zuckerfabriken Gesellschaft m.b.H.; Estezet Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H.; Rübenproduzenten Beteiligungs GesmbH; and Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest Beteiligungs AG. Under a syndicate agreement between Südzucker and ZBG, the voting rights of the syndicate partners are combined in Z&S, there are restrictions on the transfer of shares, and the partners in the syndicate have certain mutual rights to appoint members of each other's management board and supervisory board. Thus, Johann Marihart has been nominated by ZBG and appointed as a member of the management board of Südzucker AG, and Thomas Kölbl has been nominated by Südzucker and appointed as a member of the management board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG.
Until 27 February 2014, M&G Investments, a subsidiary of London, UK-based financial services firm Prudential plc, held 15.6% of AGRANA's share capital. Z&S, which as the majority shareholder of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG had until then held 75.5% of the share capital, acquired an additional, direct interest of 10.7% from M&G Investments; as a result, Z&S has held a total of 86.2% of the voting rights in AGRANA since this transaction. At the time, another 4.9% of AGRANA's shares were acquired directly by Südzucker, which thus increased its direct interest in AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG to about 6.5%. Of this total, the newly acquired stake of almost 5 percentage points is to be placed on the market again in order to increase the widely held (free float) portion of shares of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. The aim is to boost the liquidity of AGRANA shares and thus enhance their attractiveness for investors. On any shares within this stake of 4.9% that are not placed, Z&S holds a call option which can be exercised since 1 March 2015, with Südzucker as the counterparty.
There are no shareholders with special rights of control. Employees who are also shareholders of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG exercise their voting rights individually.
The Management Board does not have powers to issue or repurchase shares except to the extent provided by law.
The agreements for the Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) and credit lines (syndicated loans) contain change of control clauses that grant the lenders an extraordinary right to call the loans.
With this exception, there are no significant agreements that take effect, change materially, or end, in the case of a change of control resulting from a takeover offer. No compensation agreements in the event of a public tender offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.

In view of the sound balance sheet structure on 28 February 2015 and the diversified business model, AGRANA believes it continues to be well positioned for the new financial year, but expects a significant decline in earnings.

AGRANA currently expects Group revenue to remain steady in the 2015|16 financial year. For operating profit (EBIT), the Group is projecting a significant decrease. Total investment in the three business segments in 2015|16, at about  93 million, will be slightly above the rate of depreciation.

In the Sugar segment, although sales volume is likely to rise (especially in the Eastern European markets), AGRANA expects a further significant decline in revenue as a result of the persistent strong general downward pressure on prices. Reduced beet costs and a cost-saving programme already begun in the 2014|15 financial year in all countries will not be able to make up for the declining selling prices, and a negative EBIT should thus be expected in 2015|16.
The investment planned for the Sugar segment in 2015|16 is approximately  32 million. Most of this spending will be in the areas of energy efficiency (particularly in Austria) and packaging and logistics (Hungary).

In the Starch segment, AGRANA's expectations for the 2015|16 financial year are steady sales quantities and a moderate, price-driven revenue reduction. As a result of the continuing unsatisfactory price trend for bioethanol and the sustained competitive pressure in saccharification products which detracts especially from the earnings of HUNGRANA, the Starch segment's EBIT is predicted to come in significantly below the prior-year result.

1 Operating profit (EBIT) is after exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures. 2 Investment represents purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill.

AGRANA expects that in the 2015|16 financial year, the Fruit segment will achieve moderate revenue growth and a significant gain in EBIT. The fruit preparations division predicts a positive revenue trend ­ especially in the Europe and North America regions ­ driven by rising sales volumes. Raw material prices are expected to remain low, as demand was noticeably weak and there remained sufficient fruit inventory at the turn of the year; a factor working in the opposite direction is the weakening of the euro against the US dollar, which is felt, for instance, in the sourcing of tropical fruits for Europe. In the fruit juice concentrate business, a slight revenue reduction is expected amid lower prices.
The planned level of capital investment in the Fruit segment this year is approximately  33 million. In the fruit preparations business, capacity expansion is a high priority, notably in the USA and Australia, while the focus in the fruit juice concentrate operations is on asset replacement and maintenance investment and the continual improvement of product quality.

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2014|15

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

102

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG ("the Company") is the parent company of the AGRANA Group and has its registered office at Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen-Platz 1, A-1020 Vienna. The Company together with its subsidiaries constitutes an international group engaged mainly in the worldwide industrial processing of agricultural raw materials.
The consolidated financial statements of the AGRANA Group for 2014|15 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in effect at the balance sheet date and with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union.

1. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The segment reporting, which conforms with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8, distinguishes between three business segments ­ Sugar, Starch and Fruit ­ and thus follows the AGRANA Group's internal reporting structure.
The AGRANA Group has the three reportable segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit, which correspond to its strategic businesses. Each of the segments offers a different product portfolio and is managed separately in view of the different production technologies, raw material procurement and sales strategies. AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft ("AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG"), the Group's holding company, is considered part of the Sugar segment.
For each segment, there is internal monthly reporting to the Group's chief operating decision maker. Information on the results of the reportable segments is given below. Segment profitability is evaluated primarily on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items, which is a key performance indicator in every internal management report.

The revenue and asset data represent consolidated amounts. Inter-segment charges for products and services are based on comparable market prices.
Exceptional items consisted of income from reimbursement for excess amounts of production levy paid for the 2001|02 to 2005|06 sugar marketing years; expenses for the closure of a Fruit segment plant in Kröllendorf/Allhartsberg, Austria, and the closing of a production site in Belgium.
The items "segment assets" and "segment liabilities" match the allocation used in internal reporting.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros (000) unless otherwise indicated. As a result of automated calculation, rounding errors may occur in totals of rounded amounts and percentages.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the principles of clarity, understandability and materiality were observed. In the presentation of the income statement, the nature of expense method was used. The separate financial statements of the fully consolidated companies represented in the consolidated financial statements are based on uniform accounting policies.
In addition to the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement and balance sheet, a statement of changes in equity is presented. The notes also include information on the business segments.
All IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that were effective at the time of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and applied by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG have been adopted by the European Commission for application in the EU.
The following IFRS and IFRIC became effective (i. e., their application became mandatory for the first time) in the 2014|15 financial year. The amendments to IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) remove the disclosure requirement ­ previously introduced in IAS 36 by IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) ­ to disclose the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of units) to which a significant carrying amount of goodwill or of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been allocated. Under the amendment to IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation), the existing offsetting model under IAS 32 is retained in principle, but refined by additional application guidance. As a result of the amendments to IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement), companies must, under certain conditions, novate derivatives to central counterparties. The initial application of these amended standards had no material impact, or no impact, on the consolidated financial statements.
The first-time application of IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), the standard which supersedes the guidelines on control and consolidation previously contained in IAS 27 (Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements) and SIC 12 (Consolidation ­ Special Purpose Entities), has changed the definition of control, in that uniform criteria are now applied to all companies in determining a relationship of control. Under the new concept, control exists when the potential parent company (the investor) has decision-making power over the relevant activities of the potential subsidiary (the investee) through voting rights or other rights, has exposure to positive or negative variable returns from the investee, and can use its decision-making power to affect these variable returns. For AGRANA there were no impacts on the scope of consolidation and thus no impacts on the consolidated financial statements.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

106

The adoption of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) has eliminated proportionate consolidation. The new standard also defines two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. From the beginning of the financial year under review, the joint ventures which previously were proportionately consolidated are accounted for using the equity method under IAS 28. As this rule must be applied retrospectively, the prior-year data have been restated accordingly. Details regarding the impacts and reporting changes are provided at the end of this section under "Restatements in accordance with IAS 8" (the title of IAS 8 is Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors). The classification as joint ventures is noted on page 128 under "Critical assumptions and judgements".

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

Also applied for the first time, IFRS 12 (Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) sets out the required disclosures for entities that report in accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) and IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures). The quantitative and qualitative disclosures under IFRS 12 must enable the users of a reporting entity's financial statements to evaluate the nature of its interests in other entities, the risks associated with these interests, and their financial effects.
The following standards and interpretations either have been adopted by the European Union and will become effective for the 2015|16 financial year or later, or have been issued by the IASB but not yet adopted by the EU. In the latter case, the effective year given in the table represents the expected time of adoption. AGRANA has not early-adopted any of the new or changed standards cited below.

107

Content and expected impacts on AGRANA

The amendments clarify that information should not be obscured by aggregation and that materiality considerations apply to all parts of the financial statements, even when individual standards require specific disclosures. The relevance of the items in the balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income determines their disaggregation or aggregation. In other comprehensive income, all effects from companies accounted for using the equity method are presented as a separate line item regardless of whether or not they will subsequently be reclassified to the income statement. The amendments are part of the Disclosure Initiative, which is intended to improve disclosure requirements. Application of the amendments is expected to have impacts on the presentation of the financial statements and on disclosures in the notes.
The amendment clarifies that a depreciation method based on revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate. This is because revenue represents the generation rather than the consumption of economic benefits. No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
See amendment to IAS 41 (Agriculture).
The amendments relate to the recognition of contributions from employees or third parties where the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of employee service. It will be permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. No material impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
The amendment reinstates the equity method as an accounting option for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the separate financial statements. The amendment has no impact, as it relates to separate financial statements.
The amendment clarifies that in a transaction involving an associate or joint venture, the extent of gain or loss recognition depends on whether the assets sold or contributed constitute a business. No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
The amendment clarifies that a non-investment entity which in its consolidated financial statements uses the equity method to account for an investment entity investee as an associate or joint venture, may retain the fair value measurement applied by the associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries. The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.
The amendment introduces a rebuttable assumption that a revenue-based amortisation method is inappropriate for the same reasons as in IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) (see above). No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.

The amendment brings bearer plants, which are used solely to grow produce, into the scope of IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment). Bearer plants can thus be accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment. A bearer plant is defined as "a living plant that is used in the production or supply of agricultural produce, is expected to bear produce for more than one period, and has a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales." No material impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
The IASB has issued the final version of IFRS 9, bringing together the results of the classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting phases of the project to replace IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). This new version of the standard adds a new model of expected losses for measuring impairment, and limited changes to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets. The impairment model is based on the concept of providing for expected losses at the inception of a contract, with the exception of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, where expected credit losses are incorporated into the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition. The classification and measurement model for financial assets is expanded by adding a new category, "fair value through other comprehensive income" (FVTOCI), for certain debt instruments. As well, additional guidance is provided on how to apply the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics test. The standard supersedes all previous versions of IFRS 9. AGRANA is reviewing the likely impacts on accounting and measurement. An expansion of disclosures is expected.
See amendment of IAS 28 (2011) (Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures).
The amendment clarifies that the exemption from the requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements also applies to parent companies which are themselves subsidiaries of an investment entity, and specifies that an investment entity must measure at fair value its interests in all those subsidiaries which themselves meet the definition of an investment entity. The latter applies even when the subsidiaries provide investment-related services. The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.
As a result of the amendment, the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, is required to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in IFRS 3 and other IFRSs with the exception of those principles that conflict with the guidance in IFRS 11. The amendment may have impacts on the accounting for future acquisitions of equity interests.
The amendment clarifies that investment entities which measure their subsidiaries at fair value fall within the scope of IFRS 12 and must provide the disclosures relating to investment entities required by IFRS 12. The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.
IFRS 14 permits entities that are first-time adopters of IFRS to continue to account for regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with their previous GAAP both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements. The standard is not relevant to AGRANA.
IFRS 15 establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. Specifically, it also establishes criteria for determining whether different performance obligations under a contract are distinct. AGRANA does not expect the application of the standard to have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition, but expects it to require expanded disclosures.
The improvements relate mainly to IFRS 2 (definition of vesting conditions), IFRS 3 (accounting for contingent consideration in a business combination), IFRS 8 (aggregation of operating segments), IFRS 13 (short-term receivables and payables), IAS 16 and IAS 38 (revaluation method ­ proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation/amortisation) and IAS 24 (expanded definition of related parties). The impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are being assessed.

RESTATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH IAS 8
Restatements under IAS 8 related to provisions for pension and termination benefit obligations and to trade and other payables. A retrospective change was made to the measurement base for determining termination benefit and vacation pay obligations.
At 28 February 2014 the negative fair value of an interest rate swap, including deferred tax, was recognised in other comprehensive income in equity; the requirements for this under IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) were not given. The prior-year data was adjusted by recognising the fair value measurement in the income statement under finance expense and recognising the tax effects under income tax in the income statement.
As well, the initial application of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) at the beginning of the 2014|15 financial year had impacts on the balance sheet, income statement and other parts of the financial statements, as the joint ventures in the STUDEN group (Sugar segment) and in the HUNGRANA group (Starch segment), which previously were proportionately consolidated, are now accounted for using the equity method.
The retrospective application of the new standard also had analogous impacts on the comparative periods presented. An analysis of the assets and liabilities which were aggregated in the balance sheet item "equity-accounted joint ventures" for the first time as at 1 March 2013 is provided in the following overview.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

Content and expected impacts on AGRANA

111

The improvements relate mainly to IFRS 1 (meaning of effective IFRSs), IFRS 3 (scope exceptions for joint ventures), IFRS 13 (scope of IFRS 13) and IAS 40 (clarification of the interrelationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40 when classifying property as investment property or as owner-occupied). The impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are being assessed.
The improvements relate mainly to IFRS 5 (changes in method of disposal), IFRS 7 (servicing contracts), IAS 19 (discount rate is to be based on bonds denominated in the same currency as the benefits to be paid) and IAS 34 (disclosure of information "elsewhere in the interim financial report"). The impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are being assessed.
IFRIC 21 (Levies) provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government. Its scope does not cover income taxes (as defined in IAS 12), fines and other penalties. Its application to liabilities arising from emissions trading schemes is optional. The obligating event for the recognition of a liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. If the obligating event occurs over a period of time, the liability is recognised progressively. If the obligation is triggered by reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised when that threshold is reached. The changes will have no material impact on the presentation of AGRANA's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The decrease in assets and liabilities led to a reduction in capital employed and in net debt. Impacts in the income statement, besides a reduction in revenue, occurred in all line items that are constituents of operating profit (EBIT) and of net financial items, as well as in income tax expense. Profit for the period and earnings per share were not affected. The after-tax results of the companies involved entered into the Group accounts solely through the income statement item "share of results of equity-accounted joint ventures". In view of the fact that these companies constituted operating rather than financial investments, the share of results of equity-accounted joint ventures was reported as a component of operating profit.

3. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include by full consolidation all domestic and foreign companies controlled by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (i. e., all subsidiaries), except where the subsidiary's effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows is immaterial. Subsidiaries' accounts are consolidated from the time that control is acquired until control ceases.

Companies managed jointly with another entity (joint ventures) are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

At the balance sheet date, 63 (prior year: 64) companies besides the parent were fully consolidated in the Group financial statements and 11 (prior year: 12) companies were included using the equity method.

An overview of the fully consolidated entities, equity-accounted joint ventures and other business interests is given beginning on page 173.

The number of companies that were fully or proportionately consolidated changed as follows in the 2014|15 financial year:

Non-controlling interests Of the non-controlling interests of  65,161 thousand, most represented the co-owners of the JUICE group, at  47,895 thousand. AGRANA's total (direct and indirect) interests in the JUICE group amounted to 50.01%. Therefore, 49.99% of the equity of the JUICE group must be reported as a non-controlling interest in AGRANA's consolidated financial statements.

3.1. BALANCE SHEET DATE
The balance sheet date (reporting date) of the consolidated financial statements is the last day of February. Group companies with other reporting dates prepare interim financial statements at the Group reporting date.

119

4. CONSOLIDATION METHODS
 Acquisitions of companies that are fully consolidated are accounted for using the purchase method, by allocating their acquisition cost to the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) at the time of acquisition. Where the acquisition cost exceeds the net fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the difference is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. Conversely, where the acquisition cost is less than the net fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this difference arising on initial consolidation (sometimes referred to as "negative goodwill") is recognised in income in the period of acquisition.
 Pursuant to IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. Instead, using the impairment-only approach, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and written down only in the event of impairment.
 The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the time of acquisition, provided that the requirements for the application of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) are met. The investments in these companies are initially recognised at cost and adjusted in the subsequent periods for the post-acquisition change in AGRANA's share of the joint ventures' net assets. The carrying amounts are increased or decreased annually to recognise AGRANA's share of the investees' profit or loss, dividends and other equity movements. Any goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investments in joint ventures; regarding indications of impairment, the provisions of IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) apply. An impairment loss on equityaccounted joint ventures is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount.
 Intragroup revenues, expenses and income and all receivables and payables or provisions between the consolidated companies are eliminated. In assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included in non-current assets or in inventories, intragroup balances are eliminated.

5. CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 Financial statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euros in accordance with IAS 21. The functional currency of every Group company is its respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at middle rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Expenses and income are translated at annual average rates of exchange, with the exception of the currency translation gains and losses from the measurement of receivables and liabilities related to Group financing.

 Differences compared to prior-year amounts arising from the translation of balance sheet items at current balance sheet date exchange rates or arising from the use of average rates in translating expenses and income compared to the use of current balance sheet date rates are recognised outside profit or loss, directly in equity.

 Foreign currency monetary items are measured at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with currency translation gains and losses recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.

 In translating the financial statements of foreign Group companies, the following exchange rates were applied:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.1. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

 Purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill) are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of between 5 and 15 years. All intangible assets other than goodwill have a determinable useful life.

 Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Details on this impairment test are presented in the notes to the balance sheet.

 Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded separately from goodwill if they are separable by the definition in IAS 38 or if they result from a contractual or legal right and their fair value can be reliably measured.

 Product development costs are capitalised at cost if they can be accurately allocated to a product and if both the technical feasibility and the marketing of the new product are assured. In addition, the development work must be sufficiently likely to generate future cash inflows. Under IAS 38, research costs cannot be capitalised. They are charged directly to expense in the income statement.

 Items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of purchase and/or conversion, less straight-line depreciation and impairment losses. For the bioethanol plant in Austria, a unit-of-production method of depreciation was used in the financial year. Besides materials and labour costs, prorated overheads are capitalised in the conversion costs of internally generated assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of an asset that are incurred during the production period are capitalised in accordance with IAS 23. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period during which they are incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, unless they result in an expansion or material improvement of the asset concerned, in which case they are capitalised.

 Where rental agreements or leases transfer all material risks and rewards of ownership to the AGRANA Group (finance leases), the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset. The asset is initially measured at the lower of (i) its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and (ii) the present value of the future minimum rental or lease payments. This amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings.

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is generally based on the following useful lives:

Buildings Plant and machinery Office furniture and equipment

15 to 50 years 10 to 15 years
3 to 10 years

 Impairment losses are recognised, in accordance with IAS 36, if the recoverable amount of an asset has declined below its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.

6.2. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE
 Government grants to reimburse the Group for costs are recognised as other operating income in the period in which the related costs are incurred, unless the grant is contingent on conditions that are not yet sufficiently likely to be met.
 Grants to support capital expenditure are deducted from the cost of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment beginning at the time of the binding award of the grant.
6.3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 The AGRANA Group distinguishes the following classes of financial instruments:
Financial assets ­ Securities, and investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies ­ Trade receivables ­ Other financial assets ­ Cash and cash equivalents
Financial liabilities ­ Bank loans and overdrafts, and other loans from non-Group entities ­ Borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group ­ Trade payables ­ Financial other payables
Derivative financial instruments ­ Interest-rate derivatives ­ Currency derivatives ­ Commodity derivatives
 Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are as a rule measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. If fair value cannot be reliably determined, they are recorded at cost.
 Securities (these assets are referred to as "available-for-sale") are measured at market prices, with changes in fair value recognised outside profit or loss (after deferred taxes) in a separate reserve item in equity. Only after the cumulative changes in fair value are realised by selling the security are they recognised in profit or loss.
 Financial assets are recognised at the settlement date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Impairment tests are performed when there are substantial indications of impairment. When the fair value of a non-current financial asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit for the period.
 Cash and cash equivalents are measured at their face amount, which represents their market value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and bank deposits having a remaining term to maturity of up to three months at the time of investment.
Derivative financial instruments  Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At inception of the derivative contract, derivatives are recognised at cost. Subsequently they are measured at market value at every balance sheet date. Changes in value are as a rule recognised in profit or loss. Where the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting under IAS 39 are met, unrealised fair value changes are recognised directly in equity.
 The market value of derivative financial instruments is determined on the basis of quoted market prices, information from banks or discounting-based valuation methods. The market value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on the contract rate and the current forward rate.
Receivables  Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Non-interest-bearing receivables with a remaining maturity of more than one year are recognised at their present value using the effective interest method. For default risks or other risks contained in receivables, sufficient impairment provisions are individually allowed. The face amounts of the receivables net of necessary impairment provisions represent the fair values. Irrecoverable receivables are derecognised on an individual case-by-case basis. If the reasons for an impairment provision cease to apply, the impairment loss is reversed, to no more than the asset's historical cost.
 Foreign currency receivables are measured at middle rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
Payables  Borrowings are initially measured at their actual proceeds. Premiums, discounts or other differences between the proceeds and the repayment amount are realised over the term of the instrument by the effective interest method and recognised in net financial items (at amortised cost).
 Trade payables are initially measured (at inception of the liability) at the fair value of the goods or services received. Subsequently these payables are measured at amortised cost. Other payables not resulting from the receipt of goods or services are measured at their payable amount.
 Payables denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at middle rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.

6.4. INVENTORIES
 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost of purchase and/or conversion and net selling price. The weighted average cost formula is used. In accordance with IAS 2, the conversion costs of unfinished and finished products include ­ in addition to directly attributable unit costs ­ reasonable proportions of the necessary material costs and production overheads inclusive of depreciation of manufacturing plant (based on the assumption of normal capacity utilisation) as well as production-related administrative costs. Financing costs are not taken into account. To the extent that inventories are at risk as a result of prolonged storage or reduced saleability, a write-down is recognised.
6.5. EMISSION ALLOWANCES
 Emission rights are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance) and IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets). Emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes of IAS 38 that, except as noted below, are to be classified as current assets. They are assigned a cost of zero. From the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances (one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide), a provision for CO2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income statement. The provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or any excess of their market value at the measurement date over their cost. CO2 emission allowances that have already been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in non-current assets.
6.6. IMPAIRMENT
 Assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are tested at every balance sheet date for evidence of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed for impairment annually at 31 August regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment.
 The impairment test involves determining the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's value in use and its net selling price. If the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement.
 An asset's value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the asset's continuing use and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The discount rate used in determining present value is a pre-tax market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned. Where no largely independent cash inflows can be determined, value in use is determined for the next-larger unit (the cash generating unit) to which the asset belongs and for which largely independent cash inflows can be determined.
 Where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated, the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill and equity-like securities classified as availablefor-sale) is recognised as income in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
 The AGRANA Group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination benefits. Under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements, AGRANA has no further obligation after paying the agreed premium. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when they fall due, and are reported in staff costs. Contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same manner as those paid to defined contribution plans. As the Group has no payment obligations beyond making the contributions, no provision is maintained.
 The provisions for defined benefit pension, termination and long-service obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), based on actuarial valuations. This involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. In the case of a deficit, a provision is recorded; in the case of a surplus, an asset (other receivable) is recorded. The defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over the period during which the respective beneficiaries acquire the entitlement to these benefits.
 Service cost is recognised in staff costs. Besides the current service cost for the benefits newly earned by staff every year, it may also include past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes, which is recognised immediately in profit or loss for the period. The net interest cost for the financial year is calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the year to the net pension obligation determined at that time, taking into account the expected payment outflows. Net interest is recognised in finance expense.
 Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur, along with their effect on deferred taxes with the exception of obligations for long-service awards. Correspondingly, the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet. The changes in actuarial gains and losses recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.
 Actuarial gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity cannot be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The direct recognition in equity also includes the differences between (i) the interest income on plan assets based on the discount rate and included in net interest and (ii) the actual return on plan assets determined at the end of the period.
 The calculation is based on extrapolated future trends in salaries, retirement benefits and employee turnover, as well as a discount rate of predominantly 1.4% for the year under review (prior year: 3.5%).
 A portion of pension obligations was transferred to pension funds. The retirement benefit contributions to be paid are calculated so as to fully fund the retirement benefit obligation at the time of retirement. If a plan deficit occurs, there is an obligation to fund the shortfall. The Group also holds benefit insurance policies to secure its ability to meet obligations under pension and termination benefit plans. The individual assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. The individual assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. Likewise, the qualifying insurance policies are treated as plan assets in reducing the present value of the respective pension and termination benefit obligation.

6.8. OTHER PROVISIONS
 Other provisions are recognised where the following conditions are met: the AGRANA Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, the obligation is likely to lead to an outflow of resources, and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
 Provisions are measured at the amount representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the present value of the obligation determined on the basis of a market interest rate differs materially from its nominal amount, the present value of the obligation is used.
 The risks arising from contingent liabilities are covered by sufficient provisions.
6.9. DEFERRED TAXES
 Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base; on consolidation entries; and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised. Significant differences existed between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base for property, plant and equipment, inventories and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected to be utilised within five years.
 Deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method (under IAS 12), based on the pertinent national income tax rates. Consequently, with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation, deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the tax base, to the extent that deferred tax assets are likely to be realised.
 Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of legislation in force or enacted at the balance sheet date, in the amount expected to be payable. Future changes in tax rates are taken into account if the change in tax rate has already been enacted in law at the time of preparation of the financial statements.
 When income and expenses are recognised directly in equity, the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities are also taken directly to equity. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account company-specific forecasts of, for instance, the future earnings situation in the respective Group company.
 Deferred tax assets are classified as non-current assets; deferred tax liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities. Deferred tax assets are off set against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority.
 The income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income, and the movement in deferred taxes.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.10. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND COSTS
 Revenue from goods sold is recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have passed to the purchaser. Revenue from services provided is recognised to the extent that the services have been rendered by the balance sheet date.
 Operating expenses are recognised in the income statement upon use of the product or service or as incurred.
 Finance expenses comprise the interest expense, similar expenses and transaction costs on borrowings including finance leases; financing-related currency translation gains and losses; and financing-related hedging gains and losses.
 Income from financial investments represents interest, dividend and similar income realised from cash-equivalent investments and investments in other financial assets; gains and losses on the disposal of financial assets; and impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.
 Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised at the time of the decision to pay the dividend.

127

6.11. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS
 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company's management to make judgements and to act on assumptions about future developments. These judgements and assumptions can have a material effect on the recognition and measurement of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of other liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of income and expenses reported for the financial year.
 The following assumptions involve a not insignificant risk that they may lead to a material change in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year:
­ The impairment testing of goodwill (carrying amount at 28 February 2015:  226,176 thousand), other intangible assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2015:  15,299 thousand) and property, plant and equipment (carrying amount at 28 February 2015:  661,537 thousand) is based on forward-looking assumptions. The determination of the recoverable amounts for the purpose of the impairment review involves several assumptions, such as regarding future net cash flows and the discount rate. The net cash flows are the amounts in those five-year cash flow forecasts for the cash generating units that are most current at the time of preparation of the financial statements. The discount rate varies by industry, company risk level and specific market environment; in the financial year it ranged from 6.3% to 10.4% (prior year: 7.5% to 9.4%).
­ Had the WACC been 1 percentage point higher, no goodwill impairment would have required recognition in any of the CGUs.
­ Financial instruments for which no active market exists are reviewed for impairment by using alternative discounting-based valuation methods. The inputs used for the determination of fair value are based in part on assumptions concerning the future.

­ The measurement of existing retirement and termination benefit obligations (carrying amount 28 February 2015:  71,885 thousand) involves assumptions regarding discount rate, age at retirement, life expectancy, employee turnover and future increases in pay and benefits.
­ The sensitivity analysis below is based on varying one assumption at a time with the other assumptions remaining unchanged from the original calculation. Potential correlation effects between assumptions are thus not taken into account. The changes in assumptions would have the following effects on the present values of the obligations stated in note 25a:

­ The recognition of deferred tax assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2015:  22,184 thousand) is based on the assumption that sufficient tax income will be realised in the future to utilise tax loss carryforwards.
­ The off-balance sheet obligations from financial guarantees and from other contingent liabilities, and any reductions in these obligations, are regularly reviewed as to whether they require recognition in the balance sheet.
­ In determining the amount of other provisions (carrying amount at 28 February 2015: 56,636 thousand), management exercises judgement as to whether AGRANA is likely to incur an outflow of resources from the obligation concerned and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are measured at the amount of the likely outflow of resources.
 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The actual values may deviate from the assumptions and estimates made if the actual general conditions do not match the expectations held at the balance sheet date. Changes in estimates of assets, liabilities, income and expense are recognised in profit or loss as they become known, and the assumptions adjusted accordingly.
 The HUNGRANA group and the STUDEN group were classified as joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11 and the agreements existing at the time. The AGRANA Group holds 50% of the share capital of the joint ventures.
 The AGRANA Group holds 50.01% of the share capital of AUSTRIA Juice GmbH and is subsidiaries. As a result of the underlying contracts and arrangements, AGRANA exercises control over these companies and fully consolidates them in the Group accounts.

Net currency translation differences on financing activities amounted to a gain of  8,716 thousand (prior year: loss of  16,850 thousand). This was composed of a realised loss of  93 thousand (prior year: realised loss of  142 thousand) and an unrealised gain of  8,809 thousand (prior year: unrealised loss of  16,708 thousand). The net gain was attributable largely to movements in exchange rates for the currencies of Ukraine, Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

The nominal tax charge or credit is based on application of the standard Austrian corporation tax rate of 25%.
The Tax Reform Act of 2005 introduced a new concept for the taxation of company groups. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, the AGRANA Group established a group consisting of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as the group parent and the following group members: AGRANA Zucker GmbH, AGRANA Stärke GmbH, AGRANA Marketing- und Vertriebsservice Gesellschaft m.b.H., AGRANA J&F Holding GmbH, AGRANA Internationale Verwaltungs- und Asset-Management GmbH, AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, INSTANTINA Nahrungsmittel Entwicklungs- und Produktionsgesellschaft m.b.H., and AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH.
Deferred taxes are recognised on differences between carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of the individual companies in their home countries. Deferred taxes take into account carryforwards of unused tax losses.
In the interest of conservative planning, deferred taxes reflect carryforwards of tax losses only to the extent that sufficient taxable profit is likely to be earned over the next five years to utilise the deferred tax assets.  14,305 thousand (prior year:  6,532 thousand) of potential tax assets were not recognised. These related to cumulative unused tax loss carryforwards of  66,306 thousand (prior year:  22,767 thousand). Of the unused tax loss carryforwards,  18,606 (prior year:  22,608 thousand) can be carried forward indefinitely,  38,734 thousand (prior year:  159 thousand) expire in five to seven years and  8,966 thousand (prior year:  0) expire in 2016. Deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of  4,114 thousand (prior year:  0) were not recognised.
At the balance sheet date the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised directly in equity amounted to a net asset of  6,396 thousand (prior year:  4,206 thousand).
For temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities of  193,502 thousand (prior year:  193,869 thousand) were not recognised, as these gains are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period and these temporary differences are thus not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

8. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method and in accordance with IAS 7. The statement traces the movements in the AGRANA Group's cash and cash equivalents arising from operating, investing and financing activities.
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, represent cash on hand, cheques and bank deposits. They do not include current bank borrowings or securities classified as current assets.
Currency translation differences, with the exception of those relating to cash and cash equivalents, are already eliminated within the corresponding items in the balance sheet.
8.1. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was  168,568 thousand (prior year:  186,114 thousand), or 6.76% of revenue (prior year: 6.55%). The item "other non-cash expense and income" included, among other items, the unrealised foreign currency translation gains reflected in net financial items, representing a deduction of  8,809 thousand in this part of the cash flow statement (prior year: unrealised translation losses as an add-back item of  16,708 thousand); an effect of  8,096 thousand from deferred taxes as an add-back item (prior year:  3,305 thousand add-back); and the non-cash exceptional expense of  4,566 thousand for closing a Fruit segment plant in Kröllendorf/Allhartsberg, Austria, and a production facility in Belgium (prior year: exceptional income of  3,944 thousand from the reimbursement received for the overpaid production levy and the closure of a South African plant in the Fruit segment). After changes in working capital, net cash from operating activities was  227,293 thousand (prior year:  283,895 thousand).
As a result of currency legislation, there are restrictions on access to cash and cash equivalents of subsidiaries in the amount of  17,006 thousand (prior year:  19,391 thousand) in China, Ukraine and Argentina.

 The additions of  2,247 thousand of non-goodwill intangible assets related primarily to software.
 Intangible assets consist largely of goodwill, capitalised in accordance with IFRS 3, that resulted from the acquisition of companies. Intangibles also include acquired customer relationships, software, patents and similar rights, as well as non-current prepayments. and similar rights.
 Of the total carrying amount of goodwill, the Sugar segment accounted for  20,111 thousand (prior year:  20,111 thousand), the Starch segment for  1,606 thousand (prior year:  1,606 thousand) and the Fruit segment for  204,459 thousand (prior year:  204,460 thousand).

1 The prior-year data have been restated under IAS 8. Detailed information is provided from page 110.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

 To satisfy the provisions of IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36 and to allow the calculation of any impairment of goodwill, AGRANA has defined its cash-generating units to match its internal reporting structure. The cash-generating units in the AGRANA Group are the Sugar segment, Starch segment and Fruit segment, consistent with the internal management accounting and reporting processes. All goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units.
 To test for impairment, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by allocating to it the corresponding assets and liabilities, inclusive of attributable goodwill and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount inclusive of goodwill. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.
 In testing for impairment, AGRANA uses a discounted cash flow method to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units. The determination of expected cash flows from each cash-generating unit is based on business plans that are validated and approved by Supervisory Board committees and have a planning horizon of five years. Projections beyond a five-year horizon are based on the assumption of a constant, inflation-induced growth rate of 1.5% per year (assumption in the prior year: 1.5%). The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) derived from the AGRANA Group's capital costs is calculated at 10.4% (prior year: 9.4%) for the Fruit segment, at 6.3% (prior year: 7.5%) for the Starch segment and at 7.8% (prior year: 8.0%) for the Sugar segment.
 The quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis. The insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan. Projections of value in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends. Value in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for the regional markets.
 All goodwill reported in the consolidated financial statements was shown to be free of impairment. A comparison of the carrying amounts of the CGUs with the respective value in use shows the following excess of value in use over carrying amount:  96 million for the Fruit segment (prior year:  165 million);  737 million for the Starch segment (prior year:  497 million); and  128 million for the Sugar segment (prior year:  136 million).
 The goodwill is not tax-deductible.
 No other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives required recognition at the balance sheet date.

9.7. SECURITIES
Securities held as current assets had a carrying amount of  46 thousand (prior year:  146 thousand) and consisted mainly of floating rate debt securities held as a liquidity reserve.

9.8. EQUITY
 The Company had share capital of  103,210,250 at the balance sheet date, consisting of 14,202,040 ordinary voting bearer shares without par value. All shares were fully paid.
 The movements in the Group's equity are presented from page 100.
 The capital reserves ("share premium and other capital reserves") consist of share premium (i. e., additional paid-in capital) and of reserves resulting from the reorganisation of companies. The capital reserves remained unchanged in the 2014|15 financial year. Retained earnings consist of the available-for-sale reserve, the cash flow hedge reserve, the effects of consolidation-related foreign currency translation, and accumulated profits/losses.
 In January 2015, AGRANA Fruit Brasil Participacoes Ltda. increased its ownership interest in AGRANA Fruit Brasil Indústria, Comércio, Importacao e Exportacao Ltda. from 75% to 100%. The difference of  2,548 thousand between the purchase price paid and the carrying amount of the acquired net assets was offset against retained earnings.

Disclosures on capital management A key goal of equity management is the maintenance of sufficient equity resources to safeguard the Company's continuing existence as a going concern and ensure continuity of dividends. Equity bore the following relationship to total capital:

¤000
Total equity Total assets Equity ratio

28 Feb 2015 28 Feb 20141

1,194,420 2,406,887
49.6%

1,190,988 2,392,218
49.8%

Capital management at AGRANA means the management of equity and of net debt. By optimising these two measures, the Company seeks to achieve the best possible shareholder returns. In addition to the equity ratio, the most important control variable is the gearing ratio (net debt divided by total equity). The total cost of equity and debt capital employed and the risks associated with the different types of capital are continuously monitored.

The sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility and also demonstrates the Group's financial stability and independence. In addition to its self-financing ability, AGRANA also has access to high, committed credit lines for its overall financing needs.

The approach to capital management was unchanged from the prior year.

a) Provisions for retirement and termination benefit obligations

Provisions for retirement and termination benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19, using the projected unit credit method and taking into account future trends on an actuarial basis. For both the retirement and termination benefit obligations, the plans are defined benefit plans.

The present values of the obligations, and the associated plan assets where applicable, were determined based on the following actuarial parameters:

%
Expected rate of wage and salary increases Austria/Europe Mexico/USA/South Korea
Expected trend of pension increases Austria Mexico
Discount rate Austria/Europe/USA Mexico/South Korea

1.4 7.0 / 3.1

3.5 8.0 / 4.2

A discount rate of 1.4% (prior year: 3.5%) was used in almost all cases in the determination of the provisions for pensions and termination benefits. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds with a duration matching the average weighted duration of the obligations.
The measurement process also involves other company-specific actuarial assumptions, such as the staff turnover rate. The current mortality tables recognised in the respective country are used as the biometric basis for the calculations ­ in Austria, this is the version of the computation tables by Pagler & Pagler specific to salaried employees ("AVÖ 2008-P-Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung").

Defined benefit plans Pension plans in the AGRANA Group are based largely on direct defined benefit commitments. The amounts of the pension benefits are usually determined by length of service and pensionable pay. Termination benefit plans exist mainly as a result of legal requirements or of obligations under collective agreements and the benefits represent one-time, lump sum payments. The amount of the termination benefits typically depends on final pay and length of service.

In connection with defined benefit pension commitments, the AGRANA Group's major plans are the following:
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has direct defined benefit commitments in respect of Management Board members for retirement, disability and survivor pensions based on a fixed percentage of a pension assessment base. All pension benefit obligations are transferred to and administered by an external pension fund. The present value of the obligation was  20,698 thousand (prior year:  12,637 thousand) and the plan assets amounted to  12,640 thousand (prior year:  8,697 thousand). Further detail is provided in the section "Related party disclosures" in these notes.
In addition, there were direct defined benefit commitments, including survivor benefits, in respect of retired former employees of AGRANA Zucker GmbH in the amount of  22,243 thousand (prior year:  20,805 thousand), of AGRANA Stärke GmbH in the amount of  2,866 thousand (prior year:  2,638 thousand) and of AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH in the amount of  243 thousand (prior year:  186 thousand). The present value of the obligation of AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH is offset by plan assets in the form of pension risk transfer insurance of  167 thousand (prior year:  170 thousand).
At AGRANA Fruit Austria GmbH there are pension commitments in respect of active employees for retirement, disability and survivor benefits with a contractual (in some cases length-of-servicedependent) fixed benefit amount, and direct obligations in respect of retired former employees, including survivor benefits. The present value of these obligations was  1,032 thousand (prior year:  786 thousand) and there were plan assets in the form of pension insurance of  456 thousand (prior year:  406 thousand).
In Mexico there is a contractual obligation in respect of a defined set of recipients in the event of retirement or early retirement to pay a fixed percentage of a specified pensionable pay base in monthly instalments for a period of ten years. Alternatively, the recipient may choose a lump sum payment. The present value of this obligation was  594 thousand (prior year:  470 thousand), with plan assets in the form of pension insurance of  106 thousand (prior year:  96 thousand).

The AGRANA Group has the following main termination benefit plans:
 The termination benefit plans most significant in amount exist in Austria and France. The plans represent legislated commitments to pay a lump sum benefit on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) and in the event of retirement or death. The amount

1 The prior-year data have been restated under IAS 8. Detailed information is provided from page 110.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

of the benefit depends on final pay and length of service. Termination benefit obligations in Austria and France are funded solely by provisions, in the amount of  35,973 thousand (prior year:  28,771 thousand).

 In Russia and Ukraine there are termination benefit commitments (either statutory or based on company-wide agreements) that are minor in amount. These are payable as a lump sum on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) or on retirement. The benefit amount depends on final pay and length of service. These commitments in the amount of  71 thousand (prior year:  117 thousand) are covered solely by provisions.

 The termination benefit arrangements in the USA consist of contractual commitments in respect of a defined set of recipients, while the commitments in Mexico are legislated obligations to all permanent and full-time employees. In Mexico the termination benefit is paid if the employment relationship is terminated after 15 years or more of service, at retirement or in the event of disability or death. It takes the form of a lump sum in an amount that is based on final salary and length of service. In the USA, the benefit is paid on termination of employment and is based on final salary and length of service. In Mexico, plan assets of  13 thousand (prior year:  21 thousand) off set the present value of the obligation of  137 thousand (prior year:  104 thousand). In the USA, the commitments of  961 thousand (prior year:  672 thousand) are funded solely by provisions.

 The present value of the obligation of the termination benefit plan for South Korea was  1,267 thousand (prior year:  1,098 thousand), while the plan assets amounted to  818 thousand (prior year:  589 thousand).

The expense for the unwinding of discount on benefits accrued in prior years, less the return on plan assets, is included within net financial items. The current service cost is included in staff costs. The actual return on plan assets was  1,193 thousand (prior year:  404 thousand).
The year's actuarial result in pension and termination benefit provisions, which is recognised directly in equity, was a loss of  17,261 thousand (prior year: actuarial gain of  60 thousand). The actuarial loss resulted primarily from the lower discount rate and from experience adjustments concerning factors such as expected retirement age, wage and salary growth rates and assumed employee turnover rates. As of 28 February 2015, cumulative actuarial gains and losses of  38,261 thousand (prior year:  21,000 thousand) had been offset against retained earnings, not taking into account deferred taxes.
The experience adjustments reflect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. Such differences arise, especially, from actual rates of wage and salary increases, changes in pension benefits, employee turnover and biometric variables such as disability and mortality.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

Composition of plan assets The plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension benefit insurance policies. The fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide, at all times, full coverage of the payment obligations arising from the respective benefit plans. The plan assets include neither financial instruments issued by the Group nor owner-occupied property.

At the balance sheet date the plan assets were invested in the following asset categories:

%
Fixed income securities Equity securities Real estate Other

28 Feb 2015 28 Feb 20141

57.93 29.36
3.43 9.28

53.87 30.38
3.83 11.92

151

Risks Defined benefit plans are associated with various risks for the AGRANA Group. Besides general actuarial risks such as discount rate risk and longevity risk, these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial assumptions such as rates of wage and salary growth, pension benefit trends, retirement age and employee turnover (early departures). Risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks, credit risks and investment risks. Other risks lie in exchange rate fluctuation and changes in inflation rates.
The rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is less than the discount rate used, the respective net liability increases. The net liability is particularly strongly influenced by the discount rate, with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability. A further decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in defined benefit liabilities that can only be offset to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets.
Potential inflation risks that may lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations lie, indirectly, in inflation-driven salary growth during active service and in inflation-induced pension benefit increases.

Duration and future payments The average weighted duration of the present value of the pension obligations at 28 February 2015 was 12.96 years (prior year: 9.97 years) and that of the termination benefit obligations was 9.67 years (prior year: 9.39 years).
 954 thousand (prior year:  1,170 thousand) of contributions are expected to be paid into the plan assets in the subsequent reporting period.

10. NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
10.1. INVESTMENT AND CREDIT TRANSACTIONS (NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS)
To cover its overall funding needs, the AGRANA Group, in addition to its self-financing capability, has access to syndicated credit lines and bilateral credit lines from banks.
Financial instruments are generally procured centrally and distributed Group-wide. The principal aims of obtaining financing are to achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value, safeguard the Group's credit quality and ensure its liquidity.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, the AGRANA Group in the course of its day-to-day financial management uses conventional investments (demand deposits, time deposits and securities) and borrowings (in the form of overdrafts, short-term funds and fixed rate loans).

Bank loans and overdrafts, other loans from non-Group entities (excluding finance lease obligations) and amounts due to affiliated companies of the Südzucker group amounted to  628,965 thousand (prior year:  627,292 thousand) and carried interest at an average rate of 1.98% (prior year: 2.42%). They are measured at repayable amounts. In the case of bank debt denominated in foreign currencies, nominal values are translated into euros by applying the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Fair values may therefore increase or decrease from the prior-period values, depending on movements in exchange rates.
The fixed interest portion of bank loans and overdrafts and amounts due to affiliated companies was  251,067 thousand (prior year:  236,379 thousand). The fair values (i. e., market values) of the variable rate bank loans and overdrafts are equivalent to their carrying amounts. At the balance sheet date,  809 thousand (prior year:  679 thousand) of bank loans and overdrafts were secured by mortgage liens and  7,900 thousand (prior year:  7,900 thousand) were secured by other liens.
In the course of its day-to-day financial management, the Group invests in demand deposits and time deposits. Cash and cash equivalents increased by  57,962 thousand from the prior year, to a new total of  193,818 thousand. In addition, securities in the amount of  46 thousand (prior year:  146 thousand) were held as current assets; these were categorised as held-for-trading.

10.2. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
To hedge part of the risks arising from its operating activities (risks due to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and raw material prices), the AGRANA Group to a limited extent uses derivative financial instruments. AGRANA employs derivatives largely to hedge the following exposures:  Interest rate risks from money market rates, arising mainly from liquidity fluctuation typical
during campaigns or from existing or planned floating rate borrowings.  Currency risks, which may arise primarily from the purchase and sale of products in US dollars
and Eastern European currencies and from finance in foreign currencies.  Market price risks, arising especially from changes in commodity prices for sugar in the
world market, energy and grain prices, and selling prices for sugar and ethanol.

156

The Group employs only conventional derivatives for which there is a sufficiently liquid market (for example, interest rate swaps, interest rate options, caps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options or commodity futures). The use of these instruments is governed by Group policies under the Group's risk management system. These policies prohibit the speculative use of derivative financial instruments, set ceilings appropriate to the underlying transactions, define authorisation procedures, minimise credit risks, and specify internal reporting rules and the organisational separation of risk-taking and risk oversight. Adherence to these standards and the proper processing and valuation of transactions are regularly monitored by an internal department whose independence is ensured by organisational separation from risk origination.

The notional principal amounts and the fair values of the derivative financial instruments

The currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year; the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to ten years.
The notional principal amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges, translated into euros.
The fair value of a derivative is the amount which the AGRANA Group would have to pay or would receive at the balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position. As the hedging transactions involve only standardised, fungible financial instruments, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices.
Fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially recognised directly in equity. Only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of cash flow hedges at 28 February 2015 was a liability of  519 thousand (prior year: liability of  279 thousand).
The value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in profit or loss. The hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for the Juice activities, and to hedge sales contracts in the Sugar segment.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available at the balance sheet date and of the methods and assumptions outlined below.
The non-current assets item "investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies", and the securities held as non-current and as current assets, include available-forsale securities. These are measured at current securities exchange prices or market value.
Other investees for which fair value could not be determined for lack of market prices in the absence of active markets, were measured at cost. These are primarily unlisted companies for which the shares were not measured by the discounted cash flow method because cash flows could not be reliably determined.
As a result of the short maturities of the trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents, their fair values are assumed to be equivalent to their carrying amounts.
The positive and negative fair values of interest rate, currency and commodity derivatives relate partly to cash flow hedges. For the interest rate hedges, the fair values are determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on the basis of reference rates, taking into account forward premiums or discounts. The fair values of interest rate and commodity derivatives are obtained from the bank confirmations as at the balance sheet date. The market rates (fair values) of currency derivatives are based on the forward rates determined by AGRANA as at the balance sheet date and the hedged exchange rates. The interest rates and exchange rates used for the determination of the forward rates are based on the reference rates published by the ECB or the national central banks. In some cases, as a result of differences in interest rates, the fair values determined by the Group may differ to an insignificant extent from the fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations.
For trade payables and current other financial liabilities, it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the fair values equal the carrying amounts.
The table below shows how the fair values were determined, broken down by category of financial instrument. The fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based on quoted market data:

The three levels were defined as follows:
 Level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices quoted for the exact instrument on an active market (i. e., these prices are used without adjustment or change in composition).
 In Level 2, the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market for similar assets or liabilities, or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on observable market data.
 Level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

162

The fair value of Level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the underlying currencies' interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity. The mark-to-market price is determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction. The input factors for this are the reference rates of the ECB (daily fixing) or selected national central banks, and the daily EURIBOR and LIBOR/IBOR quotes.
For Level 2 interest rate derivatives, the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity. The fair value is obtained from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions.

10.4. RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE AGRANA GROUP
The AGRANA Group is exposed to market price risks through changes in exchange rates, interest rates and security prices. In the Group's operating activities, price risks arise largely from the costs of raw materials (mainly sugar beet, sugar purchased in the world market, grains, potatoes, and fruit) and energy, and from selling prices of sugar, starch, ethanol and fruit products. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risks, associated especially with trade receivables.
AGRANA uses an integrated system for the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group. The Group's proven approach to risk management is guided by the aim of balancing risks and returns. The Group's risk culture is characterised by risk-aware behaviour, clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and the implementation of internal control systems.
AGRANA regards the responsible management of business risks and opportunities as an important part of sustainable, value-driven corporate governance. Risk management thus forms an integral part of the entire planning, management and reporting process and is directed by the Management Board. The parent company and all subsidiaries employ risk management systems that are tailored to their respective operating activity. The systems' purpose is the methodical identification, assessment, control and documenting of risks.

164

In a three-pronged approach, risk management at the AGRANA Group is based on risk control at the operational level, on strategic control of Group companies by the Group, and on an internal monitoring system delivered by the Group's internal audit department. In addition, emerging trends that could develop into threats to the viability of the AGRANA Group as a going concern are identified and analysed at an early stage and continually re-evaluated as part of the risk management process.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of an economic loss as a result of a counterparty's failure to honour its payment obligations. Credit risk includes both the risk of a deterioration in customers' or other counterparties' credit quality, and the risk of their immediate default.
The trade receivables of the AGRANA Group are largely with the food, chemical and retail industries. Credit risk in respect of trade receivables is managed on the basis of internal standards and guidelines. Thus, a credit analysis is generally conducted for new customers. The Group also uses credit insurance and security such as bank guarantees.
For the residual risk from trade receivables, the Group establishes provisions for impairment. The maximum exposure from trade receivables is equivalent to the carrying amount of the trade receivables. The carrying amounts of past due and of impaired trade receivables are set out in note 20.
The maximum exposure of  492,767 thousand (prior year:  495,646 thousand) to credit risk consisted of the carrying amounts of all receivables and other current assets plus contingent liabilities, and was equivalent to the carrying amount of these instruments. AGRANA does not consider the actual credit risk to be material.
AGRANA maintains business relationships with many large international industrial customers having excellent credit ratings.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that a company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due or in sufficient measure.
The AGRANA Group generates liquidity with its business operations and from external financing. The funds are used to fund working capital, investment and business acquisitions.
In order to ensure the Group's solvency at all times and safeguard its financial flexibility, a liquidity reserve is maintained in the form of credit lines and, to the extent necessary, of cash. To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, both short-term and long-term finance is raised in the course of day-to-day financial management.
The following maturity profile shows the effects of the cash outflows from liabilities as at 28 February 2015 on the Group's liquidity situation. All cash outflows are undiscounted.

The undiscounted cash outflows as presented are based on the assumption that repayment of liabilities is applied to the earliest maturity date. Interest payments on floating rate financial instruments are determined by reference to the most recent prevailing rates.
At the end of the year under review there were no projected cash flows from derivatives used for cash flow hedging.

Currency risk

The Group's international business operations expose AGRANA to foreign exchange risks from

financing and financial investment as well as from trade receivables and trade payables. Since the

2011|12 financial year, to measure and control these risks, the AGRANA Group uses Value-at-Risk

based on the variance-covariance approach at a 95% confidence level. This involves the

measurement of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the

correlations between them. The result is stated as the diversified VaR from currencies and

is analysed by borrowings and operating business:

91,000 6,804

91,371 5,519

Most of the Group's foreign exchange risk arises in the operating business, when revenue is generated in a different currency than are the related costs.
In the Sugar segment, Group companies based in the European Union whose local currency is not the euro are exposed to sugar-regime-induced foreign exchange risk between the euro and their respective local currency, as the beet prices for a given campaign are set in euros EU-wide. The subsidiaries in Romania and Bosnia-Herzegovina are subject to additional currency risk from raw sugar purchases in US dollars.
In the Starch segment, foreign exchange risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.
In the Fruit segment, foreign exchange risks arise when revenue and materials costs are in foreign currency rather than local currency. In addition, risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Interest rate risk The AGRANA Group is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in the euro zone.
Beginning in the year under review, risks from potential changes in interest rates are reported on an "at risk" basis. AGRANA distinguishes between Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) for variable rate borrowings and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for changes in market interest rates on fixed rate borrowings.
CFaR: An increase in interest rates would cause an increase in funding costs from variable rate borrowings. The CFaR analysis is based on the volatilities of the individual funding currencies and the correlations between them.
VaR: The analysis examines the implied risk from a decrease in interest rates, as existing fixed rate borrowings would continue to incur interest costs at a constant rate instead of following the market trend. The different maturities of fixed interest borrowings are taken into account through weighted present values and a potential change in variable interest rates under the modified duration approach. The CFaR and VaR from borrowings were as follows:

¤000
Net position of variable interest borrowings Cash-Flow-at-Risk diversified
Net position of fixed interest borrowings Value-at-Risk upon change in interest rates

28 Feb 2015 28 Feb 20141

377,898 3,170

390,914 2,353

198,751 6,492

202,851 6,568

The floating rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. To hedge against this risk, interest rate swaps were entered into for a portion of the borrowings, thus achieving fixed interest rates on this portion.

167

Commodity price risk AGRANA's business activities expose it to market price risk from purchases of commodities and the sale of finished products (ethanol). This is particularly true in the production of bioethanol, where the most important cost factors by far are the prices of the main inputs, corn and wheat. To a lesser but still significant extent, the Sugar segment has exposure to the purchase prices of raw sugar.

At the balance sheet date the Group had open commodity derivative contracts to purchase 153,500 tonnes of wheat (prior year: 90,200 tonnes) for the Austrian bioethanol production operations, to buy 4,700 tonnes of corn (prior year: 35,400 tonnes) and to sell 9,050 tonnes of corn (prior year: 0 tonnes). These positions represented an aggregate contract amount of  27,462 thousand (prior year:  53,087 thousand) and, based on the underlying closing prices, had a positive fair value of  519 thousand (prior year: negative fair value of  571 thousand).

A change in the underlying raw material prices of plus or minus 10% would result in the following changes in the value of these commodity derivative positions:

Legal risks AGRANA continually monitors possible changes in the legal setting that could lead to a risk situation, and takes mitigative measures as necessary. This applies particularly to compliance matters and food and environmental legislation; the Group maintains dedicated staff positions for these areas.
There are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As noted in previous annual reports, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority in 2010 sought a fine under an antitrust case for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to Austria filed against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany. To date the Cartel Court has not ruled on the case. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.

REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of AGRANA BeteiligungsAktiengesellschaft, Vienna, for the year from 1 March 2014 to 28 February 2015. These consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 28 February 2015, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the fiscal year ending on 28 February 2015 and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and for the Accounting System The Company's management is responsible for the group accounting system and for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor's Responsibility and Description of Type and Scope of the Statutory Audit Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in Austria and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Those standards require that we comply with professional guidelines and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

GLOSSARY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TERMS

A
ActiProt®: AGRANA's own brand of high-protein animal feed. This form of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is a by-product of bioethanol production from cereals, obtained by drying the mash (the residue from distillation). The DDGS is pelleted and marketed as a non-perishable feedstuff. With its high protein content of at least 30% and its valuable energy content, DDGS is a sought-after feed for livestock, particularly dairy animals. In the AGRANA Group this co-product is generated in the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, which typically processes corn, wheat, triticale and molasses. Like all other products marketed by AGRANA, ActiProt® is GMO-free.
Apple pomace: Apple pomace is the spent apple pulp left after juice extraction. It is high in residual sugar and in pectin, and low in protein. In the course of the production of apple juice concentrate from fresh, ripe apples, AGRANA has developed a proprietary process which, compared with conventional apple pomace, creates a product with improved sensory characteristics and reduced bitter content.
ATX: The ATX (Austrian Traded Index) is a real-time price index developed by the Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener Börse) that covers the blue-chip segment of the Austrian stock market as represented by the approximately 20 most liquid shares traded on Wiener Börse. The index composition is determined on the basis of companies' market capitalisation (the price per share multiplied by the number of shares). The influence of a given ATX stock on the index thus depends on the number and price of the company's shares. The ATX also serves as the underlying for futures and options quoted in euros on the Exchange. The starting value of the ATX on 2 January 1991 was 1,000 points.
B
Biodiversity: Biodiversity, or biological diversity, by the definition of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is "the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part." This includes diversity within species, diversity between species and diversity of ecosystems. The

preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity are considered important foundations of human wellbeing. The destruction and fragmentation of habitats is viewed as the greatest threat to the diversity of life on earth.
Bioethanol: Bioethanol is a fuel manufactured by the fermentation of carbohydrate-containing biomass (renewable carbon sources). It has a minimum alcohol content of 99% by volume and contains effectively no water. In Europe, for climate reasons, bioethanol is produced mainly from starch-containing grain crops or from sugar beet. Unlike fossil fuels, bioethanol is CO2 neutral, and its physical properties differ from those of petrol. Its use as a petrol substitute in more or less undiluted form (in so-called high blends) therefore requires modifications to engines. For low blends (such as E10), engine modification is not needed.
Biogas: Biogas contains methane as a combustible component, which is manufactured through the zymosis of biomass in biogas facilities and is used for the generation of bioenergy. Biogas can be acquired from fermentable recycling material that contains biomass, such as sewage sludge, biowaste or food waste, liquid and solid farmyard manure, or also from energy crops that have been planted specifically for this purpose, i.e., renewable raw materials.
C
Campaign: The processing period for agricultural raw materials that have a limited storage life.
Cane sugar: Sugar produced from sugar cane. Chemically identical to beet sugar.
Corn starch: Starch produced from corn (maize), used especially as an ingredient in foods (such as puddings), but also in industrial applications, such as in paper products and cosmetics.
CO2 (carbon dioxide): Regarded today as the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is a gas consisting of carbon and oxygen. It is colourless and odourless and makes up less than 1% of the air we breathe. Carbon dioxide is produced in the combustion of substances containing carbon, and during respiration.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

184

CO2 equivalent: To make the greenhouse effect of different greenhouse gases comparable and calculable, their global warming potential is used. It indicates the contribution of a gas to the heating of the earth's atmosphere by assigning an equivalent volume of CO2. The greenhouse effect per kilogram of a given gas is expressed as a multiple ("equivalent factor") of the greenhouse effect of one kilogram of carbon dioxide.
Customs duties: Also known as import duties or customs tariffs, these help to protect domestic products against cheap imports from non-EU countries (thus providing tariff protection). The basic import duty for sugar is a fixed amount. In addition, a special safeguard provision provides for a higher tariff when sugar imports exceed a certain quantity.
D

EU Biofuels Directive: The so-called Biofuels Directive of the European Parliament and European Council dated 26 March 2009 regulates the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels (for example, wind and solar energy, geothermal and hydropower) in the transport sector. The Directive specifies the percentage of renewable fuels within total fuel consumption, but does not prescribe how these targets must be reached (blending of biogenic with fossil fuels, or use of alternative fuels). Under the Directive, fuels defined as biogenic include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biomethanol, biodimethyl ether, bio-ETBE, bio-MTBE, synthetic biofuels and pure plant oils.
EU sugar regime: See sugar regime.
Exports of sugar to non-EU countries: The licences necessary for these sugar exports are distributed by the EU to sugar producers through a tender process.

Deficit countries/markets/regions: Countries, markets or regions that consume more sugar than they produce and which therefore cover their needs through sugar imports. In Europe, in connection with the surrendering of quotas under the EU sugar regime, this concerns countries such as Ireland, Italy and Portugal, as well as Hungary and Romania.
E
Emission: Generally signifies the release of noxious substances such as pollutants or greenhouse gases into the environment. A typical example are car exhaust fumes.

F
Fermentation: In the context of biotechnology, fermentation (zymosis) means the conversion of biological material through the addition of enzymes (known as "ferment") or in the presence of bacterial, fungal or cell cultures.
F. O. Licht: A leading private-sector source of analysis on the global markets for sugar, ethanol, molasses, feed additives, biofuels, coffee and tea, F. O. Licht publishes a wide range of print reports and organises conferences for the sugar and ethanol industries.

Ethanol: Ethanol is a form of alcohol and is a clear, flammable liquid. It is also known as pure alcohol, grain alcohol or drinking alcohol, and is found in drinks such as wine and beer. In recent years, ethanol has acquired great importance outside the beverage industry as a biofuel referred to as bioethanol. See bioethanol.

Fruit juice concentrate: Forming the basis for fruit juice drinks, fruit juice concentrates are sold into the fruit juice and beverage industry. The same quantity of water carefully removed from the pressed fruit juice is later added to the concentrate again to create the end product for consumption. The result is high-quality juice with 100% fruit content.

Fruit preparations: Sometimes referred to as fruit ingredients. High-quality fruit is prepared in liquid or piece form and thermally preserved for further processing, especially for use by the dairy, ice-cream and bakery industries.

OTHER INFORMATION GLOSSARY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TERMS

G

M

Gluten: Gluten is a mix of substances, including proteins, that occurs in cereal seeds. When flour is mixed with water, it is gluten that makes the resulting dough rubbery and elastic. Gluten is crucial to the baking properties of flour.
GMO: Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering.

Marketing year for grains: This period runs from July to June of the following year.
Molasses: Sweet, dark-brown by-product of sugar manufacturing, with the consistency of syrup. It still contains about 50% sugar, which cannot be further crystallised. Molasses is used predominantly in the manufacture of yeast and alcohol, and as a cattle feed supplement.

I
IGC (International Grains Council): The International Grains Council is an intergovernmental organisation concerned with grains trade. Since 1995 the London-based IGC also administers the Grains Trade Convention, an international agreement. The IGC Secretariat provides both administrative support to the Council, and services to the Food Aid Committee established under the Food Aid Convention of 1999. The IGC's grain market studies are widely used in sector and market research.
ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation): The International Organisation for Standardisation (widely known as ISO) is the leading international association of national standard-setting bodies and develops international standards in all areas but electricity and electronics, which are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and telecommunication, which is the province of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Together, these three organisations form the World Standards Cooperation, or WSC.
Isoglucose: Isoglucose, a liquid, is a sweetener based on starch that has been converted to sugar. At a fructose content of 42%, it has the same sweetness as sugar and is therefore used as a sugar substitute. The fructose content can be raised to as much as 55% through further process stages. Isoglucose is manufactured from grains, especially corn.

Minimum price for sugar beet: The EU sugar regime sets a minimum price for quota beets specific to a certain delivery stage and quality standard. For other delivery terms or quality levels, price adjustments are made.
Modified starch: Modified starches are obtained by physical, enzymatic or chemical processes and are starch products that meet higher technological requirements. Important properties remain intact after modification. Modified starches are used in the food industry and in industrial applications where they are superior to natural starch in qualities such as stability against heat and acidity, shear strength, and freezing and thawing properties. Modified starches used as food additives must be declared as such if they are chemically changed. Otherwise ­ if modified physically (through heat or pressure) or enzymatically ­ they are considered food ingredients and have no E number.
N
Native starch: See starch.
Non-quota sugar: Under the EU sugar regime, non-quota sugar is sugar that exceeds the production quota. This can be marketed as industrial (non-food) sugar for use primarily in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry (e. g., to produce yeast, citric acid and vitamins), or can be exported into non-EU countries or carried over to the next sugar marketing year.

P
Prime Market: A subsegment of the "equity market.at" market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Prime Market comprises the shares of companies admitted to listing in the Official Market or Second Regulated Market and meeting the special additional requirements for admission to the Prime Market. These securities are traded via the Xetra trading system using the Continuous Trading procedure, in conjunction with auctions.
Production levy: The production levy for sugar quotas is  12 per tonne. From the 2007|08 sugar marketing year, up to one-half of the levy can be paid by the sugar beet farmers. For isoglucose, the amount of the levy is 50% of that for sugar. The production levy is an administrative tax paid to the EU.
Production quota: See sugar quota.
Q
Quota: See sugar quota.
Quota sugar: The amount of sugar produced and marketed in the course of a sugar marketing year within the allotted production quota.
Quota sugar beets: The amount of sugar beet necessary to fully utilise the production quota for sugar.
R
"Ramsar Convention" on wetlands: The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) ­ called the "Ramsar Convention" ­ is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments of its member countries to maintain the ecological character of their Wetlands of International Importance and to plan for the "wise", or sustainable use, of all of the wetlands in their territories.
Raw sugar: Raw sugar is a semi-finished form of cane sugar (or of beet sugar) in which the sugar crystals are not yet completely freed from the adhering non-sugar materials, which give it its brown colour.

Reference price: The reference price set in the EU sugar regime for EU quota sugar is used to find the minimum prices for sugar beets and does not have any direct effect on the market price, which is determined by supply and demand.
Refining: The term "refining" in its general sense refers to a technical process for the cleaning, processing, separation or concentration of raw materials. In the case of sugar, it means the de-coloration of brown raw sugar (from sugar cane or sugar beet) through repeated recrystallisation.
S
Starch: Starch is an organic compound and one of the most important energy storage materials in plant cells. In our latitudes, starch is mainly acquired from corn, wheat or potatoes. To extract starch, the starch-containing parts of the plants are milled to a small size and the starch is washed out. Through filtration and centrifugation steps, the starch is extracted. After the final stage of drying, native starch emerges from the process as a white powder.
Starch corn (starch maize): Starch corn, also known as soft corn, is one of the oldest corn varieties. It is well suited for eating directly, as it can be ground easily due to its floury nutritive tissue. Starch corn is an important industrial raw material.
Sugar: In Europe, sugar is produced from sugar beet. In sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world, sugar cane is the main raw material for sugar production. The term "sugar" in general usage typically refers to granulated sugar, i.e., sucrose. However, there are several other types of sugar, including glucose, fructose and lactose, among others. All are part of the carbohydrate food group.
Sugar beet: Sugar beet is an agricultural crop grown almost exclusively for sugar production. The sugar beet plant consists of the leaves and a large, fleshy root. The root stores sucrose, which is extracted in the sugar factory.
Sugar marketing year (SMY): The sugar marketing year of the European Union begins on 1 October and ends on 30 September of the following year. This definition applies for all regulations of the EU sugar market.

Sugar production: In sugar production from sugar beet, raw juice is extracted from the sugar beet slices. The juice is then cleaned in several stages and eventually thickened until sugar crystallises from it. Through repeated recrystallisation, the sugar is purified to produce clean, white crystals. These crystals have a sucrose content of very close to 100%. That makes sugar an extremely pure food product with an almost unlimited shelf life.
Sugar quota: Under the EU sugar regime, a production quota for sugar and isoglucose is set for every EU member state that produces sugar. Each national quota is apportioned among the respective country's sugar-producing companies as their individual production quota. This restricts production volumes and minimises surpluses.
Sugar regime: The European Union's regulatory framework existing since 1968 for sugar quotas and tariffs serves to regulate the EU common market for sugar and ensure intraEU sugar production.
T
Triticale: As a hybrid grain resulting from the crossing of wheat and rye, triticale combines the characteristics of both these grains in terms of flavour and composition. Thanks to its higher starch content, triticale is also used as an energy crop for the production of bioethanol.
W
West Balkan Agreement: Since autumn 2000 the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia may import limited quantities of duty-free sugar (among other products) into the EU. The EU has since then concluded corresponding free trade agreements with Croatia and Serbia.
White sugar: Also called granulated or table sugar, white sugar is produced by crystallisation and centrifugation.
WTO (World Trade Organisation): In the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation, its currently 157 member states negotiate the liberalisation of world trade.

Forward-looking statements This annual report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions and estimates made by the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Although these assumptions, plans and projections represent the Management Board's current intentions and best knowledge, a large number of internal and external factors may cause actual future developments and results to differ materially from these assumptions and estimates. Some examples of such factors are, without limitation: negotiations concerning world trade agreements; changes in the overall economic environment, especially in macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; EU sugar policy; consumer behaviour; and public policy related to food and energy. AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG does not guarantee in any way that the actual future developments and actual future results achieved will match the assumptions and estimates expressed or made in this annual report, and does not accept any liability in the event that assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect.
In the interest of readability, this document may occasionally use language that is not gender-neutral. Any gender-specific references should be understood to include masculine, feminine and neuter as the context permits.
As a result of the standard round-half-up convention used in rounding individual amounts and percentages, this report may contain minor, immaterial rounding errors.
No liability is assumed for misprints, typographical or similar errors.
The English translation of the AGRANA Annual Report is solely for readers' convenience and is not definitive. In the event of discrepancy or dispute, only the German-language version shall govern.
