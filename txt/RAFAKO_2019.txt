In 2012, one of RAFAKO S.A.'s largest projects was commissioned: a wet flue gas desulfurization unit for the Siekierki CHP Plant (owned by PGNiG Termika S.A.). The unit is one of the largest environmental projects in Poland.
In 2015 and 2016, wet FGD units were placed in service in Gdask, Gdynia, Kraków and Wroclaw, as part of the EDF Group's comprehensive plan to bring its generation assets in compliance with new environmental requirements.
The proprietary semi-dry flue gas desulfurisation system engineered by RAFAKO S.A. is more cost-efficient than the wet method:
· In 2007-2008, RAFAKO S.A. supplied high-efficiency semi-dry flue gas desulfurisation units to the Lód CHP Plant and Skawina Power Plant.
· The same technology was also used for the construction of a new CHP plant for Grupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowe Kdzierzyn S.A., commissioned in 2017;
· In September 2017, a semi-dry flue gas desulfurisation unit was commissioned for K7 and K8 steam generators at the Bialystok CHP Plant, and the final acceptance of the unit took place in March 2018.
In 2011, RAFAKO S.A. entered a new area of pro-environmental projects in the power sector, i.e. reduction of nitrogen oxides, as it commenced the manufacture of state-of-the-art SCR units on an EPC basis.
· Starting from June 2011, SCR systems were gradually deployed at units 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Kozienice Power Plant; the last system was commissioned in 2017;
· In 2012, a contract was signed with GDF SUEZ Energia Polska S.A. (currently ENEA Elektrownia Polaniec S.A.) for the delivery of SCR systems for power generating units at the Polaniec Power Plant; The SCR systems for units 2, 3, 6, 7 were commissioned in 2016, and an SCR system for unit 4 was commissioned in 2018;
· In 2014, RAFAKO S.A. and OMIS S.A. signed a contract with ENERGA Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A. for the construction of flue gas NOx reduction systems for units 1, 2 and 3 at Elektrownia Ostrolka S.A.; the common system for all units was completed in 2016, the separate system for units 2 and 3 was commissioned in 2017, and the last part of the project ­ the system for unit 1 ­ in September 2018.
In 2009, dust extraction equipment, including electrostatic precipitators and bag filters, was added to the Company's product offering. In 2010-2013, a number of electrostatic precipitators were put in operation, including at units 10, 4, 3 and 8 at the Kozienice Power Plant; at a BB-1150 steam generator of units 4, 5 and 6 at the Belchatów Power Plant; as well as at unit 6 at the Tuzla CHP Plant. In 2014, two electrostatic precipitators were installed by the Company at the Westfalen Power Plant in Germany, and further two at the Eemshaven Power Plant in the Netherlands. In December 2016, RAFAKO S.A. completed the upgrade of an electrostatic precipitator at the Morava CHP Plant in Serbia. In December 2018, the electrostatic precipitator at unit 1 at the Ostrolka Power Plant (the last part of the project to upgrade electrostatic precipitators at units 1, 2 and 3 at Energa Elektrownia Ostrolka S.A.) was placed in service.
2014 was a breakthrough year for RAFAKO S.A. A contract was signed for the construction of a 910 MW power generating unit at the Jaworzno III Power Plant, where RAFAKO S.A. will execute this turn-key contract on its own and, in terms of technologies, will supply the entire boiler island.
In 2014, the long-awaited contract for the extension of the Opole Power Plant came into effect. Under the contract, two new supercritical 900 MW power generating units were built in what is the largest project in the Polish power sector since 1989. The Company's entire scope of work and services under the contract was subcontracted to Alstom Power Sp. z o.o. (currently GE Power Sp. z o.o.). Generating unit 5 was commissioned at the Opole Power Plant on May 31st 2019 and generating unit 6 ­ on September 30th 2019.
In early 2017, RAFAKO delivered, on an EPC basis, a new CHP plant for Grupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowe Kdzierzyn S.A., comprising a coal-fired generating unit with a high-efficiency steam generator, state-of-the-art flue gas treatment technologies and a steam turbine.
Foreign sales account for a significant part of RAFAKO S.A.'s total revenue. The largest steam generators manufactured by the Company for foreign customers operate in the power plants of the former Yugoslavian

In 2019, UAB VILNIAUS KOGENERACINE JEGAINE of Vilnius was the Company's largest customer , accounting for 21.7% of total sales (18.7% in 2018). Sales to this customer involve the construction of a biofuel CHP plant unit made up of fluidised-bed boilers and a biofuel transport and feeding system (PLN 205,680 thousand in 2019).

PGE Górnictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. ­ for which RAFAKO S.A. performs contracts for air pollution control equipment, upgrades and assemblies, as well as parts of power equipment and related services ­ also had a significnat share in the sales (17.2% in 2019 vs. 6.6% in 2018). In 2019, total sales to PGE Górnictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. were PLN 162,508 thousand.

A large customer in 2019 was PT PLN (Persero), with an 11.7% share in total sales (1.2% in 2018), to which
RAFAKO S.A. is supplying two coal-fired steam units on the Indonesian island of Lombok. In 2019, sales to
this customer were PLN 111,171 thousand.

Another large customer was Operator Gazocigów Przesylowych GAZ-SYSTEM S.A., with an 11.3% share in total sales (0.8% in 2018). For this customer RAFAKO S.A. performs contracts in the oil and gas segment (PLN 107,411 thousand in 2019).

The Company delivers high value contracts, which may significantly increase the share of sales to a particular customer in total revenue.

The presented revenue data includes construction contract revenue accounted for using the percentage of completion method.

In 2019, the Company's supplier base was highly fragmented as none of the suppliers represented more than 10% of the total value of purchases.
RAFAKO S.A. relies on external suppliers for various services ­ delivery and assembly of machinery and equipment, construction and installation services and transport, as well as pipes, metal sheets, shaped materials, welding materials and specialist equipment. The range of purchases depends on the nature and requirements of individual projects. The availability of production materials, supplies or procurement services is not a significant limiting factor for the Company's business. Suppliers are chosen based on their ability to provide materials and equipment that meet the relevant technical and quality standards by specified deadlines and in the most costeffective manner. The procurement process is based on market analysis, with the pool of suppliers including only manufacturers recognised for the quality of their products and compliance with the safety, environmental and other relevant standards.
With some contracts, the list of potential manufacturers and service providers must be approved by RAFAKO S.A.'s customers.
3.4. Related-party transactions
In 2019, the Compana did not enter into any material transactions with related parties on non-arm's length terms.
For a detailed list of related-party transactions in 2019, see Note 43 to the Company's full-year financial statements for 2019.
3.5. Amount and structure of operating expenses and gross profit/(loss)
In the 12 months ended December 31st 2019, cost of sales was PLN 1,071,525 thousand which, with PLN 947,061 thousand in revenue, translated into gross loss of PLN 124,464 thousand. Compared with 2018, when the Company earned gross profit of PLN 61,897 thousand, the result was PLN 186,361 thousand lower.
The loss was mainly attributable to a revision of estimated costs of the following two significant contracts:
· Delivery and installation of an SCR system and upgrade of electrostatic precipitators for AP-1650 steam generators 9 and 10 at ENEA Wytwarzanie Sp. z o.o. The additional cost of the contract, as estimated by the Company, amounts to PLN 65m, and reduced RAFAKO's result for 2019.
The additional cost of the contract is due mainly to an extraordinary increase in market prices during the contract performance and to work which, in the Company's opinion, went beyond the contract's scope, including in particular an increase in costs under contracts settled based on unit rates, claims raised in 2019 by major subcontractors, resulting from some necessary additional work, costs related to longer than assumed execution of the contract, resulting from additional work performed, as well as additional services and deliveries related to an electrostatic precipitator. At the same time, the Company estimated its claims against the employer for the reasons indicated above at PLN 67.8m. A letter containing a settlement proposal was sent to the Employer on March 5th 2020. Its key elements were to recognise the works performed outside the scope specified in the contract; set the completion dates for each stage of the works; and determine the final payment amount. Further to the proposal made by RAFAKO S.A., the parties agreed on the text of an annex that is expected to be signed on June 30th 2020. The annex will address the contract's completion dates and payment terms.

· Construction of a biofuel-fired co-generation unit consisting of fluidised bed boilers, biofuel storage and feeder systems, and a flue gas treatment system in Vilnius, Lithuania.
The additional cost of the contract, as estimated by the Company, is PLN 87.0m, and the total result of the contract, including a PLN 2.4m increase in total revenue, deteriorated by PLN 84.7m. After having recognised additional costs, the Company recorded a loss on the contract. Therefore, the 2019 result included a PLN 27.4m loss recognised under the percentage of completion method, a PLN 22.7m provision for an expected loss, and a PLN 7.8m adjustment to the positive result of the contract recognised by the end of 2018. The overall effect of the contract on the 2019 result was PLN -57.9m. The additional cost of the contract, as estimated by the Company, amounts to PLN 87.0m, due mainly to extraordinary price increases during the Vilnius Project performance, work which, in the Company's opinion, went beyond the project's scope and longer than assumed execution of the project (through no fault of the Company), due in particular to delays in the employer's performance under the contract resulting in delayed orders for deliveries and services, whose prices increased dramatically owing to the expiry of relevant bids. The Company also estimated additional costs related to changes in the contract's scope introduced by the employer, resulting in the need to perform some additional work. The Company estimated its claims at EUR 17.5m.
For a detailed presentation of overall results on the contracts and the related claims, see Notes 11.1.3 and 11.1.4 to the full-year financial statements for 2019.
In 2019, administrative expenses were PLN 35,176 thousand, having decreased by PLN 3,783 thousand year on year, mainly on lower costs of advisory services purchased by the Company.
In 2019, selling expenses were PLN 22,452 thousand, having decreased by PLN 1,601 thousand year on year, mainly due to lower costs of advisory services and lower bid preparation costs.

3.6. Other income and expenses and net finance income/costs

3.6.1. Net other income/(expenses)

General information

Economic and financial condition

Growth prospects

In 2019, RAFAKO S.A.'s liquidity position deteriorated as the costs incurred on large projects were higher than planned. This may lead to increased tension in relations with trading partners and may cause the latter to offer RAFAKO S.A. less acceptable terms of business.
In 2019, liabilities to the Social Security Institution (ZUS), State Treasury and employees were settled in a timely manner, although there were significant delays in payments to suppliers.
In terms of financial liquidity, the need to engage substantial cash to secure contract bonds (performance bonds and advance payment guarantees), provided mainly by banks, is a significant burden on the Company.
The Company is also exposed to currency risk. Changes in PLN exchange rates, especially if frequent and significant, may materially affect both the profitability of contracts and the amount of currency translation differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and translated into PLN. In the reporting period, more than 31.4% of the Company's invoiced revenue was denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in EUR.
The currency risk management strategy adopted by the Company involves reducing the currency exposure to the Company's most important currency pair, that is EUR/PLN, by matching the currency structure of income and expenses. The Company mainly uses natural hedging. Currency is sold or bought on an ongoing basis.
As at December 31st 2019, the Company did not have any open FX hedging transactions. The Company does not apply hedge accounting.
For the Company to continue as a going concern, a key issue is to maintain financial liquidity. A significant increase in the cost of performance of key contracts, as estimated by the Company, poses a material threat to RAFAKO S.A.'s ability to continue as a going concern. The Management Board believes that negotiations with key customers to increase contract prices will allow it to mitigate the risk.
The Company's Management Board has also identified potential cost optimisation areas and non-core assets which can be potentially divested. The Management Board estimates that these efforts may bring in at least several dozen million zlotys. The money will be used to improve and maintain the Company's liquidity position, which is currently stable.
Access to external financing is a major factor in ensuring liquidity. In June 2019, the parent and PKO BP S.A. signed an annex to the multi-purpose credit facility agreement; under the annex, RAFAKO S.A. will have access to credit and guarantee facilities totalling PLN 200m until the end of June 2020.
As at the date of these financial statements, the Company received a recommendation from the credit committee and was at the final stage of negotiating the final terms of extending the credit facility from PKO BP Bank Polski S.A. The existing arrangements for renewal of the multi-purpose credit facility agreement with PKO BP S.A. of February 7th 2012, as amended (MPCF), provide for extending the availability period until November 10th 2020 and reducing the facility amount to PLN 142m. A relevant annex will be executed by the end of June 30th 2020, after all corporate approvals are obtained. The Management Board of RAFAKO S.A. is of the opinion that these terms and conditions will have no adverse effect on the Company's liquidity.
RAFAKO S.A. has also secured new bank guarantee and insurance guarantee facilities providing security for its contracts. However, the current amount of the credit and guarantee facilities available to RAFAKO S.A. is insufficient to deliver the plan to expand its order book. Therefore, RAFAKO S.A. takes all reasonable steps to increase its guarantee potential to the level enabling the parent's Management Board to implement its growth strategy and to structure credit facilites so that they better meet the parent's needs.
In 2019, the Company used a bank credit facility and long-term lease contracts with interest rates based on the 1M WIBOR reference rate plus margin. However, it did not use any commercial loans. Therefore, any potential changes in interest rates on such instruments, or changes involving higher margins on credit instruments offered by banks, affected the level of the Company's finance costs, but did not pose any threat to its business in that period.
The Company does not use any financial instruments to hedge the identified risks, as it believes that the effect of such hedges on net profit (loss) and liquidity would be immaterial.

Access to new bank/insurance guarantees will be of major importance for the Group to be able to maintain liquidity. Unavailability of sufficient guarantee limits may restrict the Company's ability to win new revenuegenerating contracts.
For the objectives and rules of financial risk management, see Note 46 to the financial statements for 2019.
3.10. Debt
In 2019, RAFAKO S.A.'s liabilities towards its creditors increased by PLN 304,750 thousand. As at December 31st 2019, total non-current and current liabilities were PLN 828,059 thousand, compared with PLN 523,309 thousand as at December 31st 2018.
The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in current trade payables by PLN 155,940 thousand, current liabilities under construction contracts by PLN 75,788 thousand, and in other short-term provisions by PLN 32,752 thousand. The value of non-current liabilities increased by PLN 19,144 thousand relative to 2018.
As at December 31st 2019, the carrying amount of the Company's assets not encumbered with on-balance-sheet (non-current and current) liabilities was PLN 104,529 thousand (December 31st 2018: PLN 394,426 thousand).
The ratio of debt (non-current and current liabilities) to assets increased to 88.8%, from 57% as at the end of 2018. In other words, equity covers means 11.2% of the Company's assets.
The ratio does not take into account the Company's contingent liabilities under bank and insurance guarantees (mainly performance bonds and advance payment guarantees provided on the Company's instructions; such guarantees are typically used in contracts on the market for power generation equipment), letters of credit and promissory notes issued as security. As at December 31st 2019, the Company's contingent liabilities under these instruments were PLN 1,794,426 thousand (PLN 1,676,531 thousand at December 31st 2018). The largest item was a PLN 1,175,587 thousand surety issued for the benefit of financial institutions which provided performance bonds for the Jaworzno project SPV's obligations under the Jaworzno Project; the surety was used in connection with financial guarantee agreements.
In the 12 months ended December 31st 2019, the Company's contingent liabilities grew by PLN 117,895 thousand, which resulted from an increase in guarantees granted and an increase in promissory notes issued. In the 12 months ended December 31st 2019, a number of guarantees were issued by banks and insurance companies to trading partners upon the Company's instructions, including performance bonds of PLN 159,338 thousand, advance payment guarantees of PLN 61,448 thousand and bid bonds of PLN 25,702 thousand. In this category of liabilities, the largest item was a performance bond of PLN 35,547 thousand, issued in June 2019. As at the end of December 2019, liabilities under promissory notes issued were PLN 107,900 thousand. The largest item of this category of liabilities is the guarantee promissory note issued for the benefit of the National Centre for Research and Development of Warsaw of PLN 86,552 thousand in connection with the implementation of Phase II of a project executed under a contract for the execution and financing of a project under the 200 + Units Programme. As at the end of December 2019, liabilities under sureties in issue were PLN 1,175,587 thousand. In this category of liabilities, the largest item was the sureties covering E003B7 Sp. z o.o.'s liabilities, issued by RAFAKO S.A. on April 16th 2014 and February 24th 2016 and valid until April 17th 2028, in connection with the project to develop new coal-fired generation capacities at TAURON Wytwarzanie S.A. ­ construction of supercritical 910 MW generating unit at the Jaworzno III Power Plant ­ Power Plant II. The largest item of guarantees expired in the 12 months ended December 31st 2019 was a EUR 2,310 thousand performance bond.
In the 12 months ended December 31st 2019, the Company's contingent receivables (mainly under performance bonds and advance payment guarantees) fell by PLN 6,761 thousand, including a PLN 2,647 thousand increase in receivables under bank and insurance guarantees, a PLN 5,643 thousand increase in letters of credit, and a PLN 1,529 thousand decrease in receivables under promissory notes. The largest item of guarantees obtained in 2019 was a USD 1,268 thousand advance payment guarantee. The largest guarantee which expired in 2019 was a EUR 1,004 thousand performance bond.
For details of changes in contingent receivables and liabilities, see Note 40 to the financial statements for 2019.
The 2019 and 2018 liquidity and debt ratios are presented in Appendix 1.

Execution of annex 6 to the master contract and the subcontractor agreement; under the annex, the contract price was increased by PLN 15,428,571.95, exclusive of VAT. In addition, certain contract milestones were sub-divided and their completion deadlines were changed based on the most recent knowledge. Annex 7 to the Master Contract and Subcontractor Agreement was signed, increasing the net contract price by PLN 52,308.4 thousand (VAT exclusive), extending the completion deadline for the Contract by 72 days, with the placement-in-service report to be signed by January 31st 2020, and introducing the Transitional Period, ending three months and 19 days after the signing of the placement-in-service report. On December 31st 2019, the unit was synchronised with the national power system, enabling power to be delivered to the grid.
2020 The deadline for handing over the unit to operations, set for January 31st 2020 in the contract, was not met, because a failure occurred in the steam generator part of the unit during a test run. The emergency committee determined that the failure was caused by a sequence of adverse events which could not, individually, lead to the failure.

May

An agreement was signed on cooperation in investigating the causes of and repairing the

failure in the steam generator part of the unit.

Annex 8 to the Jaworzno contract was signed to ensure that the unit is promptly and

June

successfuly handed over to operations. Annex 8 introduced a new schedule for performance

of the contract, confirming November 15th 2020 as the date the unit is to be handed over

for use. The parties also agreed to execute a separate annex/agreement to define their

other mutual obligations, including with respect to financial settlements.

Taking into account all circumstances associated with these events, the Management Board

is of the view that both the estimated costs to repair the failure and the costs of contract

extension that need to be incurred to complete the contract will be covered from

compensation payments and from payments of reasonable claims granted against the

Employer. Given these material uncertainties, as at the date of signing of these financial

statements the Management Board was unable to determine the outcome of the contract,

including whether a loss will be incurred.

In its separate financial statements, RAFAKO S.A. recognises only revenue and expenses related to its own scope

of work, i.e. 11.3% of the total scope of work to be performed on the Jaworzno 910 MW Project. In its separate

5. Research & development and quality improvement projects
In its R&D activity, RAFAKO S.A. partners with the academic community, including the Wroclaw University of Technology, Silesian University of Technology, Cracow University of Technology, AGH University of Science and Technology, Institute of Fluid-Flow Machinery of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute for Chemical Processing of Coal, and other scientific and research institutions. Key initiatives in this area rely on cooperation with a number of entities on projects commissioned by the National Centre for Research and Development and by InnoEnergy ­ Knowledge & Innovation Community.
The Company's research and development activity has two directions: improvement of the products in the current offering and search for completely new products for new markets.
The former seeks to ensure that the Company keeps pace with emission reduction requirements.
Design methodologies and a technology for revamping 200 and 360 MWe units were developed in 2019 with a view to creating innovative low-emission coal-fired plants as a source of standby capacity.
Work on the following projects was completed:
· CO2-SNG ­ CO2 methanation for storage of cheap, surplus energy through SNG production (with InnoEnergy's co-financing);
· Polygen ­ a municipal polygeneration system fired with biomass and refuse-derived fuel (financed by InnoEnergy);
· The new product development projects implemented in 2019 and continued in 2020:
· 200+ Units Programme ­ innovative technology to change operational regime of 200 MWe power generating units (phase II was completed, and the project design was developed);
· Shockwave ­ shockwave technology (low input, comprehensive technology for removing components covered by emission restrictions from flue gas produced by steam generators);
· Mercury concentration in flue gas treatment media ­ examination of the degree of mercury precipitation in flue gas treatment systems.
The technologies available to RAFAKO S.A. allow it to continuously increase production capacities and the range of services provided, improve the quality of its products, and reduce the costs of operations.
The new product development initiatives included the project to build an 8.5 metre-long electric bus that was launched back in 2017. The key developments in the E-BUS project in 2019 included:
· presentation of the vehicle at the Silesia fair in Sosnowiec, with the first prize of the fair and an honourable mention awarded to the project;

IV. Growth prospects
1. Energy policy
The energy market
The energy market, both in Poland and abroad, is the core market for RAFAKO S.A.
This market, and its commercial segment in particular, are heavily regulated in terms of their current organisation, future development and structure in the context of the increasingly stringent environmental protection standards. The regulated nature of the industry follows from the power market's strategic importance to the energy security of every country, with environmental protection and reduced CO2 emissions becoming a global priority in international relations. Such regulations include both the legislative framework and general objectives of the national and EU-level energy policies in terms of environmental protection.
Because of the introduction of more stringent environmental protection standards, businesses generating flue gases, such as CHP plants and power plants, are required to upgrade their existing units and install new equipment to reduce air emissions. As a result, the number of new projects in the power segment is growing, including construction of low-emission, high-efficiency power plants and upgrades to the existing energy sources to ensure their compliance with the strict environmental requirements imposed under EU laws, which stimulates demand for the products and services offered by RAFAKO S.A.
The EU's energy policy is formulated by Member States as well as EU institutions. The legal basis for the energy policy is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
According to the Energy Union (2015), the five main aims of the EU's energy policy are to:
· Ensure the functioning of the internal energy market and the interconnection of energy networks; · Ensure security of energy supply in the EU; · Promote energy efficiency and energy saving; · Decarbonise the economy and move towards a low-carbon economy in line with the Paris Agreement; · Promote the development of new and renewable forms of energy to better align and integrate climate
change goals into the new market design;
· Promote research, innovation and competitiveness. The key legal act regulating the operation of the Polish energy sector is the Energy Law. It lays down the rules governing the development of the energy policy, the rules and conditions for the supply and use of fuels and energy, including heat, and operation of energy companies.
Poland's Energy Policy until 2040, prepared by the Ministry of Economy, plays a major role in setting the development directions for the energy sector. The objectives set out in the draft document include:
· 56%­60% share of coal in electricity generation by 2030; · 21%­23% share of RES in final gross energy consumption by 2030; · implementation of nuclear power generation by 2033; · 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (relative to the 1990 level); · 23% increase in energy efficiency by 2030 (relative to the 2007 primary energy forecast). The need to diversify the structure of electricity generation will contribute to reducing the share of coal in Poland's energy mix.
New coal-fired generating units built after 2025 will use technology meeting the emission standard of 450 kg of CO2 per MWh of energy output. In order to ensure efficient use of fuels and mitigate the adverse environmental

impacts, new methods for the use and processing of coal (gasification, oxyfuel combustion, other clean coal technologies) will be sought and implemented.
Further advancement of photovoltaics (particularly after 2022) and offshore wind farms (the first offshore wind farm will be launched around 2025) will play a crucial role in the power generation industry given the increased cost-effectiveness of these energy sources and the expected increase in market flexibility necessary for RES development.
Utilisation of non-agricultural waste for energy generation should also increase, With sludge, industrial waste meeting the statutory definition of hazardous waste (including hospital waste) and municipal waste offering the biggest potential. The use of biomass in power generation will increase considering the growing volumes of biowaste and the tightening of bio-waste storage regulations.
Given their desired environmental impact, no cost burden of climate and environmental policies and stability of generation, nuclear power sources will be integrated into the power system. Poland's first nuclear power reactor (with a capacity of approximately 1­1.5 GW) will be launched around 2033. Another five reactors with a total capacity of 5­7.5 GW will be launched every two to three years.

In line with its strategy adopted in early 2018, the RAFAKO S.A. also intends to focus on the oil and gas sector, both in Poland and on an international scale. This is seen as a promising market in view of the expected multibillion investments in this sector, mainly relating to the implementation of Poland's energy policy objectives. The projects include but are not limited to the construction of gas stations, transmission pipelines, underground gas storage facilities, and gas compressor stations for the construction of natural gas and oil production facilities.
The demand for natural gas will be growing as it can be used as fuel in power plants and generates lower emissions relative to other fossil fuels.
The gas market in Poland is regulated by the Energy Regulatory Office. In line with its decision, Gaz-System S.A. has been and will be the Transmission System Operator in Poland from October 2010 until the end of 2030. Its main task is to develop the existing transmission system to ensure the long-term ability of the gas system to meet the legitimate needs for transmission of gas fuels in domestic and cross-border trade by expanding the system and, where applicable, by expanding interconnections with other gas systems.
Diversification of gas supply directions and sources is to be achieved through the following two key projects:
· construction of the Northern Gate,
· expansion of connections with the neighbouring countries.
This will create favourable conditions for developing a gas transmission and trade centre in Poland for CEE and Baltic countries. An expansion of the national network and storage infrastructure is also necessary.
Gas Storage Poland Sp. z o.o., wholly-owned by PGNiG S.A., acts as the natural gas storage system operator.
In the coming years, the natural gas infrastructure is going to be expanded both in Poland and in Europe.
The oil market involves mostly crude oil transmission, storage, distribution and trading.
Most fuel pipelines in Poland are owned by PERN S.A., a state-owned joint-stock company. In the near future, further development of the pipeline network and expansion of crude oil storage capacities are to be expected.
On February 22nd 2019, the Sejm (lower house of the Polish parliament) passed a special act on preparing and implementing strategic projects in the oil sector. The new act, which simplifies the procedures for obtaining the necessary administrative approvals, is designed to facilitate the preparation and, consequently, the implementation of the projects strategic to Poland's energy security, such as the construction and upgrade of oil and fuel pipelines.

Key developments

Growth prospects

According to the conclusions from forecast analyses performed for the purposes of Poland's Energy Policy until 2040, demand for electricity in Poland is expected to grow. Power was generated largely from conventional fuels (hard coal and lignite). In the next dozen or so years (especially after 2029) a significant part of the currently operated generating units will be decommissioned. This process is driven by the wear and tear of power generating units and tightening of the EU environmental standards. The increase in demand for electricity will be covered by sources other than conventional hard coal- and lignite-fired power plants. To meet the growing demand for electricity, in view of the significant decommissioning prospects, the capacity market has been implemented as an investment stimulus to ensure the stability of supplies.
Given the expected phase-out of existing capacities in the Polish power system, a capacity decline is expected for coal-fired power plants, while the capacities of renewable energy power plants (mainly wind, biogas and biomass-fired power plants) and nuclear power plants are expected to increase.
The PGE Group completed the construction of new units at the Opole Power Plant (two units with a capacity of 900 MW each). The project to build a 450 MW lignite-fired unit at the Turów Power Plant is nearing completion. On January 30th 2020, a contract was signed to build two CCGT units with a total capacity of 683 MWe each at the Dolna Odra Power Plant.
The PGE Group aims to preserve leadership in the RES segment and secure an approximately 25% share of domestic RES generation by 2030. To that end, the PGE Group intends to implement highly advanced onshore wind farm projects and an offshore wind farm project with a capacity of approximately 1,000 MW, and to expand its distributed generation business.
The Group's 2018­2023 capex budget amounts to approximately PLN 6.9bn, including ca. PLN 3.2bn to be spent on advancing new initiatives and approximately PLN 0.8bn to be spent on expanding district heating networks and generation assets in current locations. Environmental and maintenance expenditure will amount to approximately PLN 2.9bn.
The 2024­2030 capex plan of approximately PLN 10.6bn comprises growth capex of ca. PLN 8.1bn and environmental and maintenance capex of PLN 2.5bn.
New strategic directions for the Tauron Group are based on developing clean energy sources, as a foundation for creating the Tauron Group's value. By 2025, the Tauron Group plans to invest in the construction of onshore wind farms (a capacity addition of 900 MW), photovoltaic sources (a capacity addition of 300 MW) and offshore wind projects. Once completed, these projects will increase the share of low- and zero-emission sources in the volume of electricity generated by the Tauron Group to nearly 30% in 2025 and more than 65% in 2030.
The Enea Group plans to invest over PLN 64bn by 2035. Projects to build new generation capacities intended to support its low-carbon transition will require capital spending of PLN 22bn, with PLN 14.7bn earmarked directly towards renewable energy sources. The Enea Group's total installed capacity will gradually increase to 8,287 MW in 2030. Once the strategic goals are delivered, its installed capacity will reach 9,672 MW by 2035. The Enea Group has set itself a target of 60% of electricity output coming from gas-fired and renewable energy sources by 2035.
The Energa Group is expanding its onshore wind capacities and developing photovoltaic projects, while its longterm plans are to engage in offshore wind projects.
The programme for construction of municipal waste incineration plants, launched in 2007 and included on the Indicative List of the Ministry of Regional Development under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment, envisaged the construction of 12 municipal waste incineration plants: in Szczecin, Koszalin, Pozna, Gdask, Olsztyn, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Lód, Warsaw, Kraków and two facilities in Silesia. Currently, there are already 8 waste incineration plants in operation in Poland (in Warsaw, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Konin, Kraków, Pozna, Szczecin, and Rzeszów). Further local governments, including but not limited to those in Gdask, Olsztyn and Wroclaw, are contemplating the construction of such facilities.
Also the PGNiG Group has plans to invest (through Polska Spólka Gazownictwa). Some of the funds will be allocated for the connection of new users, construction of new and upgrades of existing gas distribution networks, connection of new areas to the gas network, investments in infrastructure accompanying the

development of gas distribution networks, such as communication, metering, ICT. PGNiG's plans also include expansion of gas storage capacities.
Gaz-System plans capital expenditure of PLN 11bn in 2019­2022. In the 2020­2029 Development Plan, GazSystem envisages more than 30 major projects, which will increase the length of the national transmission network from 11,000 km to approximately 14,800 km. The document sets two time horizons: until 2023 and until 2029. In the first one, the ongoing investment programmes defined in the previous plan for 2018­2027 are to be continued. The programmes include in particular those related to diversification of natural gas supplies to Poland, that is the Baltic Pipe programme, expansion of the LNG terminal in winoujcie, construction of a connection with Lithuania, and construction of the North-South Corridor, which includes opening a connection with Slovakia. In Poland, the Baltic Pipe programme provides for construction of a link between the Baltic Pipe and the Polish transmission system and a gas pipeline connecting Goleniów and Lwówek, expansion of the gas compressor stations in Goleniów and Odolanów, and construction of a new gas compressor station in Gustorzyn. The second time horizon (until 2029) will be the time for carrying out investment projects whose implementation will depend on the development of gas markets in Poland and the region.
The PERN Group's business consists in the operation of the pipeline network, storage and distribution of crude oil and petroleum products, including fuels. Its Long-Term Strategic Plan for 2018­2022 provides for the Group's capital expenditure of PLN 3.1bn. The strategy also provides for increasing the scale of PERN's operations and ensuring a stable increase in revenue and financial resources for the execution of key projects. The capex plan envisages the construction of new fuel and oil storage capacities and new pipelines. Some of the key projects planned for 2020 include expansion of the Gdask Oil Terminal, expansion of the fuel and oil storage capacities and construction of the Boronów- Trzebinia pipeline.
Major growth projects have also been announced by the ORLEN Group, including the expansion of the Plock and Wloclawek plants.
Some of the capital projects may be cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
3. Competitive environment
RAFAKO S.A. operates on a market dominated by large, mainly international players. On this market, contracts are typically awarded through tenders announced by clients, and projects usually take several years to complete.
Given the significance of factors such as experience, credentials, technological capabilities and financial resources in bidding for new contracts, RAFAKO S.A. faces a limited number of competitors, which are typically companies specialising in EPC projects. In line with market requirements, a majority of the Company's projects are also implemented under EPC contracts.
There is considerable competition in terms of the products and services which are part of EPC projects. Each company which the Company considers a significant competitor has proprietary energy generation technologies, extensive credentials and many years of experience in delivering EPC contracts. While some of them specialise in specific types of steam generators, others offer a comparable range of products and have access to technologies allowing them to bid for contracts within the same product scope as RAFAKO S.A. Complete power generating units are constructed by: GE Power, Alstom Power Systems, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Doosan Power Systems, COVEC, CNEEC, Amec Foster Wheeler, CNIM, All of which have proprietary energy generation technologies, as well as organisational capacities necessary to carry out EPC projects. These companies, as well as RAFAKO S.A., offer products necessary to construct complete generating units that can run on any kind of fuel.
With respect to specific products, such as steam generators, desulfurisation units, NOx reduction units, dust removal units, waste incineration facilities and oil and gas facilities, RAFAKO S.A.'s main competitors are Polimex Energetyka, Polimex Mostostal, Budimex, Erbud, SBB Energy, SES Tlmace, Bertsch, Aalborg, Sefako, Fakop, Energoinstal, Duro Djakovic, Stabo, Mostostal Warszawa, Control Process, GE Power, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Remak Energomonta, Yara, Instal-Filter, Balcke-Dürr Polska, ELWO Engineering, Eco Instal, Hitachi Zosen Inova, CNIM, Steinmueller Babcock, TM.E..

Furthermore, given the nature of large EPC contracts, it cannot be ruled out that RAFAKO S.A. will partner with the above-mentioned companies for certain projects, especially those consisting in the supply of steam generators, their pressurised components or flue gas desulfurization units.
4. Factors and developments relevant for the Company's prospects in 2020
In 2020, the following factors and developments will have the greatest bearing on the Company's development and prospects:
· completion of the 910 MW supercritical power generating unit at the Jaworzno Power Plant,
· implementation of the divestment and cost optimisation programmes,
· securing financial liquidity and obtaining access to new bank/insurance guarantees that will enable the Group to perform new contracts,
· making good progress on the construction of a biomass-fired co-generation unit in Vilnius (Lithuania),
· progress in the construction of two coal-fired steam units (2x50 MW) on the Lombok Island, Indonesia,
· performance of a large number of significant contracts in the Polish and European markets, including construction of modern steam generators, flue gas desulfurisation and NOx reduction units, and pressurised parts of steam generators,
· performance of new contracts in the natural gas and oil segment,
· acquisition of new material contracts.
It should also be noted that as part of cooperation with KPMG, initiated in December 2019, an independent assessment of the Company's and the RAFAKO Group's contracts was carried out, the correctness of the Company's financial model was reviewed, and an independent medium-term liquidity model for the Company was prepared. The outcome of the accounting firm's work, as well as the steps taken to change the contract reporting model, have enabled the Company to identify the risks involved in the projects it is carrying out and the measures it must promptly take to minimise losses. The outcome will also contribute to the stabilisation of the Company's and the Group's reported performance. The Company has also undertaken an analysis aimed at redefining and streamlining its own and the RAFAKO Group's product portfolio and individual business lines based on operational efficiency and market outlook criteria and indicators.
The World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic prompted many governments to introduce various restrictions aimed at limiting spread of the disease. Shortly after the state of epidemic was announced in Poland in mid-March 2020, the Company adapted to the situation to the largest extent possible. In order to ensure that the highest safety standards are met, a Crisis Management Team has been established, which monitors the situation on an ongoing basis, takes decisions and prepares operating guidelines related to the risk of coronavirus infection. Based on the guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Chief Sanitary Inspector, the sanitary rules have been tightened both at the Company's headquarters and at the contract performance sites, where additional sanitary procedures have been implemented by the employers.
Despite these efforts, the epidemic has affected the performance of contracts by the Company. This holds true particularly for subcontracted work and foreign supplies. The impact of the epidemic is being analysed and estimated in consultation with project owners on a case-by-case basis.
As at the date of these financial statements, the future development of the epidemic in Poland and globally and its impact on the Company's operations and financial results are unknown and cannot be predicted. Taking into account the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, the dedicated team is monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis and takes appropriate measures to mitigate its adverse impacts on the Company's operations, and its priority is to maintain business continuity and keep employees and stakeholders safe.
