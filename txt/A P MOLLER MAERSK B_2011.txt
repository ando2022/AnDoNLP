Revenue increased by 7% to USD 60.2bn (USD 56.1bn), positively affected by higher oil prices and container volumes but offset by lower container freight rates. Profit was USD 3.4bn (USD 5.0bn) and thus in accordance with the latest announced outlook of USD 3.1-3.5bn expressed on 9 November 2011. The result was negatively affected by low container freight rates on especially the Asia­ Europe trades and positively affected by the divestment gain from Netto Foodstores Limited, UK of USD 0.7bn. The Group's return on invested capital (ROIC) was 8.3% (12.2%).
Maersk Liner Business made a loss of USD 0.6bn (profit of USD 2.6bn) and a negative ROIC of 3.4% (positive by 15.3%). The negative result was primarily due to the low rates on the Asia­Europe trades. The freight rates started the year at a reasonable level, but decreased throughout

the year as large amounts of new tonnage was delivered. Overall freight rates were 8% lower than in 2010 and this, combined with 35% higher bunker prices, reduced margins considerably. The number of containers carried increased by 11% to 8.1m FFE, and the Group more than regained the market share lost during 2010.
Maersk Oil made a profit of USD 2.1bn (USD 1.7bn) and a ROIC of 36.3% (32.6%), positively affected by 39% higher oil prices at an average of USD 111 per barrel (80 per barrel). The Group's share of oil and gas production declined by 12% to 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (377,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day), primarily due to lower share of production in Qatar and lower production in Denmark and the UK. The high investment level continued throughout the year and the Group was successful in

securing a number of new licences in Norway, the UK and the US Gulf of Mexico. The high exploration activity resulted in new discoveries, and at year end the Group was involved in execution of four major development projects in the UK, US Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and Algeria.
APM Terminals made a profit of USD 649m (USD 793m). The profit excluding sales gains and impairment losses was 24% higher than in 2010. Container throughput increased by 8% on a like-for-like basis and ROIC was 13.1% (16.0%). The high investment level from previous years continued, and during 2011 APM Terminals secured further new investments and development projects primarily in emerging markets.
Maersk Drilling made a profit of USD 495m (USD 399m) and a ROIC of 12.7% (11.0%), positively affected by higher day rates and better contract coverage. Several new longterm contracts were entered into and the Group committed USD 3.9bn for investments in six new rigs.

Svitzer experienced mixed market conditions and slightly improved profits to USD 133m (USD 130m). ROIC was 7.0% (7.2%).
Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG made a profit of USD 8m (loss of USD 242m) and a ROIC of 0.3% (negative by 8.0%), negatively affected by net impairments of USD 159m. An agreement was entered into to divest Maersk LNG for USD 1.4bn. The transaction is expected to be completed in Q1 2012.
Retail activities made a profit of DKK 5.3bn (DKK 2.2bn) and a ROIC of 34.7% (15.4%), positively affected by gain of DKK 3.8bn corresponding to USD 0.7bn from the divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK. The divestment was completed in April 2011.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 7.3bn (USD 10.1bn), while cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 9.8bn (USD 4.6bn). The Group's free cash flow was negative USD 2.5bn (positive USD 5.5bn).

Maersk Supply Service made a profit of USD 210m (USD 201m) and a ROIC of 11.3% (10.5%), positively affected by a higher activity level and improved spot rates.
Maersk Tankers experienced difficult market conditions due to excess capacity in most tanker segments and made a loss of USD 151m (USD 118m) and a negative ROIC of 4.2% (3.4%). To better utilise the fleet Maersk Tankers entered into a new VLCC pool partnership as joint operator.
Damco continued growing and adjusting its business portfolio. With the acquisition of NTS International Transport Services in China, Damco has significantly increased its service offerings within the airfreight market. Profit was USD 65m (USD 44m) and ROIC was 25.8% (22.2%).

With an equity ratio of 51.4% (51.5%), net interest-bearing debt of USD 15.3bn (USD 12.4bn) and a liquidity buffer of USD 11.3bn (USD 14.5bn), the Group is well prepared and determined to execute on its long-term growth aspirations and seize market opportunities within its core businesses despite current turmoil in the financial markets.

Outlook for 2012

Group annual report 2011

Outlook for 2012

The A.P. Moller - Maersk Group expects a positive result lower than the 2011 result. Cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be around the same level as in 2011 while cash flow from operating activities is expected to develop in line with the result.

Maersk Drilling has almost full contract coverage at attractive rates in 2012 and expects a result in line with the 2011 result. Maersk Supply Service expects a result at the same level as in 2011, with one third of the available vessel days in 2012 not yet contracted.

Maersk Oil expects a result significantly below the result for 2011 based on expected 20% decline in the share of oil and gas production to a level of around 265,000 boepd at an average oil price of USD 105 per barrel. The production decline is predominantly caused by a reduced share of production in Qatar, and the natural maturation of the North Sea fields. The transfer of 20% ownership of DUC to the Danish North Sea Fund by mid-2012 will reduce the Group's production share in Denmark, but will have no impact on net earnings. Exploration costs are expected to be above USD 1bn.

The total result from all other activities is expected to be at the same level as in 2011 excluding divestment gains and impairments.
The outlook for 2012 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global economy. The Group's expected result depends on a number of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other things equal, the sensitivities for four key value drivers are listed in the table below:

Maersk Liner Business expects a negative result in 2012 as a consequence of excess capacity. Global demand for seaborne containers is expected to increase by 4-6% in 2012, lower on the Asia­Europe trades but supported by higher growth in the North-South trades.
APM Terminals expects a result above 2011 and to grow more than the market supported by volumes from new terminals.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group
Message from Executive Board

Group annual report 2011

The Group delivered an acceptable result for 2011 given the conditions in the container shipping market. While Maersk Line turned loss-making, most other business units delivered good returns and the Group made significant investments in long-term growth.

Earnings were lower than in 2010, and return on invested capital (ROIC) did not contribute to the Group's ambitions of 10% over the cycle due to excess capacity in the container shipping industry.
Executing on priorities The Group executed well on its 2011 priorities. Customer focus increased across the Group and initiatives were taken to further increase the service levels provided to the Group's customers.

Maersk Oil invested USD 4.8bn in exploration and expansion of its licence portfolio. Furthermore, Maersk Oil matured the portfolio through new discoveries, development plans and expansion of existing development plans. The Group's ambition is to grow the share of oil production to 400,000 boepd from the 333,000 boepd achieved in 2011. Maersk Oil's share of oil production will decline in 2012 and 2013 before new field developments will stabilise the share of production in 2014 and stepwise increase the share of production towards the goal.

A transformation of Maersk Oil was initiated with increased transparency and a more efficient organisation being the main objectives. The transformation initiatives continue in 2012.
The win again priority was pursued across the Group through cost cutting, other profit improvements and portfolio adjustments to counter the effects of a tougher economic environment. An agreement to divest Maersk LNG was entered into and is expected to be completed in Q1 2012.
Furthermore, the Group expanded its core businesses in emerging markets where economic growth continued at profitable levels.
Investing in long-term growth The Group assesses that global demand for shipping and oil and gas will continue to grow and the Group will continue to invest in these businesses.

Maersk Line improved and expanded its range of services not least through the introduction of the new Daily Maersk product on the Asia­Europe trades which sets new standards in the industry. The WAFMAX and SAMMAX vessels, with high reefer capacity targeted for West African and South American trades, were introduced, further strengthening Maersk Line's competitive advantage in the reefer market. Maersk Line gained market share on most trades, supported by 16% growth of its operated fleet. Maersk Line contracted 20 new vessels with each 18,000 TEU capacity to be delivered from mid2013 to mid-2015. Due to increased size and efficiency, these vessels will allow lower unit costs and the best environmental performance in the industry. Competition remains tough, not least due to excess capacity and fragmentation of the industry. There is continued need for consolidation, reduction of capacity and more stable and sustainable rates. Some operational consolidation was seen at the end of 2011, but Maersk Line maintains

Message from Executive Board

Group annual report 2011

its view that more is needed for the industry to deliver sustainable returns to shareholders.
Maersk Line is satisfied with, and will defend its current market share, which provides sufficient scale benefits allowing for an optimal product offering to its customers. By focusing on profitability over further market share growth, Maersk Line will take a number of initiatives to restore freight rates from the current loss-making levels. More specifically, Maersk Line will optimise its pricing practices and adjust its capacity to improve the market balance. Lay-up plans are also activated, super slow-steaming will be used more extensively and Maersk Line will invest in line with market growth.
APM Terminals continued its expansion and gained market share as both new and existing terminals were added to the portfolio, primarily in growth markets such as Georgia, Peru and Costa Rica. Profitability was also further improved. The long-term ambition for APM Terminals is to become the world's leading port operator and a more significant profit contributor to the Group through greenfield projects in growth markets, optimisation of existing terminals and by developing its value propositions to customers and authorities.

seek to benefit from its strengthened positions on reliability and customer satisfaction. Cost reductions will continue to be pursued.
The shipping markets were difficult in 2011 and will continue to be difficult for some time. Therefore, and because of the significant investments and commitments made in 2011, the Group will downscale its growth ambitions for the shipping segments in 2012.
Maersk Oil will continue to invest in and review exploration activities to secure that it delivers on developments and prospects. It has high priority for the Group to reverse the declining production profile and to ensure steady growth towards a sustainable production share of 400,000 barrels per day.
The drive for increased customer focus will continue in all businesses.
The Group will prioritise further investing in selected growth markets and strengthen relationships with officials, key partners and clients. Recruitment and other HR activities will also be accelerated in these countries, all to establish a solid foundation for long-term expansion.

Maersk Drilling invested further in the ultra-deepwater and ultra-harsh environment segments where demand for its high-end rigs remains strong. Maersk Drilling wants to significantly expand its current fleet of jack-up rigs and floaters, mainly through newbuildings. In 2011, Maersk Drilling placed orders for six new rigs totalling investments of USD 3.9bn. Contracts have been secured for two of the new ultra-harsh jack-up rigs.
Improving performance All businesses delivered top quartile returns or improved performance relative to their industry benchmarks. Performance improvements will continue to obtain top quartile returns for all businesses.
2012 priorities The Executive Board has decided on two Group priorities for 2012: "Creating winning businesses" and "Growth markets".

Financial flexibility The fundamental financial requirements for pursuing the Group's growth ambitions are in place and the financial position continues to be strong with no larger refinancing risks in the coming years. The Group will continue to broaden its funding base through the corporate bond market when terms are attractive. This gives the Group strength to continue to execute on its growth strategy as well as take advantage of opportunities created by the current market conditions.
A position of strength The Group is in much better shape today than before the crisis of 2008-2009. Financial strength, competitiveness, customer focus, products and services have been improved and a range of other initiatives have been taken. In 2012, the Group will embrace the challenges and opportunities from a position of strength.

The target for Maersk Line is to continue the momentum obtained during the financial crisis. Particular focus will be on pricing and competitiveness and Maersk Line will

Case: Expansion in growth markets

Group annual report 2011

Case
Expansion in growth markets

The Group sees strong business potential in the growth markets in South East Asia, Africa, Latin America and Central/Eastern Europe. These markets are expanding, and profitability rates are high.
In 2011, the revenue generated in growth markets made up 33% of the Group's total revenue ­ but this revenue resulted in 53% of the Group's total profits because of better margins.
Offering what they need Natural resources and low labour costs are the main reasons for the rapid growth in these markets. And now, higher education levels increasingly support the development of local business while growing wealth creates a larger middle-class with higher consumption of both energy and goods. China is, for example, expected to become the world's leading market for luxury goods in 2012.

Global trade figures are testament to the trend. Imports into Asia have grown significantly over the last few years, owing to greater demand for raw materials, imported fruit etc. This increased the demand for shipping with high reefer container capacity such as the Group's WAFMAX and SAMMAX vessels for West African and South American trades.
In some of the 'new markets', the Group expects growth rates of up to 10% over the coming years.
The Group will continue to invest significantly in oil and gas in order to profit from the increasing demand in growth markets and to fuel further growth. Likewise, the Group is investing in terminals and infrastructure

to ease the increasing pressure on transport gateways. APM Terminals' strategy is thus strongly focused on expansion in growth markets where it already has good positions.
Solving bottleneck issues A concrete example of how the Group is solving bottleneck issues and growing alongside local economies is the Apapa Terminal in Lagos, Nigeria.
Half of the country's exports pass through the Apapa keyhole and the IMF predicts that the Nigerian economy will grow at an annual rate of 6.4% in 2010-2015.

APM Terminals took over operations at Apapa in 2006. At that time, container vessels on average spent 20 days on a call. Now, they spend only one. This saves congestion fees, and local farmers benefit from access to efficient ways of exporting products in a spur for agriculture.
APM Terminals has invested in infrastructure at the terminal and offers local employees training and experience. Its developed administration systems also help minimise corruption.

Share of revenue and profit from growth markets
2007, APM Terminals has doubled its revenue to USD 4.7bn ­ but the company's appetite for new projects is far from sated. Around 70% (growing to 80% in 2015) of its investments and 84% of its profits are in and from growth markets.

Strong interest from governments Many growth markets, like Nigeria, currently lack the container terminal capacity to handle increased cargo volumes. APM Terminals expects these volumes to grow by another 10% annually in coming years.
Governments seek to solve this problem by, among other things, privatising ports and offering land for new terminals, something APM Terminals benefits from. Since
Growth prospects

The opportunities far outweigh the related risks.
Advantage in experience The Group will continue to take advantage of its global presence, long-term experience (first liner call to Brazil was made as early as 1913) and its strong local network to expand business in growth markets. Furthermore, the Group's diversified portfolio of businesses and services can provide what many growth markets need to further develop their economies.

The Group is aware of the fact that operating in growth markets also entails risks. It therefore deliberately diversifies its investments to reduce then. But its basic assessment is that the opportunities in these markets far outweigh the related risks.

The market for container shipping Overall, the container volumes developed positively in 2011. However, the different trades experienced diverse growth trends during the year.
In 2011, the market grew by 7% compared to 2010 (Drewry). The growth slowed down in second half of 2011 and in Q4 the market only grew by 5% compared to Q4 2010 (Drewry). In general, container imports to Europe and USA softened with no ordinary peak in demand during Q3. Growth for the Asia­Europe trades was 4%, while volumes on the Transpacific trades were unchanged.
Competition was intense during 2011 as many carriers took delivery of new tonnage especially during Q2 and Q3. A large number of +10,000 TEU vessels were delivered and employed on the Asia­Europe trades resulting in redeployment of smaller vessels to other trades. This had a negative impact on freight rates especially on the Asia­Europe trades where rates declined to unsustainable levels. In Q4, the spot rates on the Asia­Europe trades reached an unprecedented level below USD 500 per TEU, significantly below the operating costs of most carriers.
As a result of the difficult market conditions and as a response to Maersk Line's introduction of Daily Maersk, most competitors on the Asia­Europe trades announced in Q4 formations of new alliances in order to optimise their combined networks and reduce costs.
Despite rate pressure, only limited tonnage was laid-up. However, during Q4 several carriers announced lay-ups and suspension of strings. During 2011, 239 container vessels with a combined capacity of 1.77m TEU were ordered and at year-end the global order book was 4.3m TEU, equivalent to 28% of the current fleet (Alphaliner). During 2012, it is expected that 253 container vessels with a combined capacity of 1.47m TEU will be delivered, equivalent to 10% of the current fleet. At the same time, global demand for seaborne containers is expected to increase by 4-6%, with expected lower growth on the Asia­Europe trades and higher growth in the NorthSouth trades.

Maersk Liner business Maersk Liner Business covers the Group's container shipping activities which include Maersk Line, Safmarine, MCC and Seago Line and comprise 645 owned and chartered container vessels with a total capacity of 2.5m TEU at 31 December 2011. Furthermore, the fleet includes 15 owned and chartered multi purpose vessels.
Revenue for the container activities increased by 5% to USD 25.1bn, positively affected by higher volume but partly offset by decreasing rates. Volume transported by the Group increased by 11% to 8.1m FFE (7.3m FFE). In Q4, the increase was 18% compared to the same period in 2010. The Group's volume growth was above the general market and thus the Group gained market share in 2011. The average freight rate including BAF decreased by 8% compared to 2010 to USD 2,828 per FFE and was 12% lower in Q4 compared to Q4 2010.

On the main Asia­Europe trades, the head haul as well as back haul volumes increased by 15% and 17% respectively compared to 2010. Average head haul freight rate decreased by 21% whereas the back haul rates decreased by 13%.
Volumes on the Africa trades increased by 19% at slightly lower rates. On the Latin America trades volumes increased by 17%, while rates decreased by 7%. Volumes on the Oceania trades decreased by 2% while rates increased 6%. Volumes on Transpacific increased by 2% and rates decreased by 7%. Volumes on the Transatlantic were more or less unchanged and rates increased slightly. MCC increased its Intra-Asia volume by 5%.
The Group is continuously optimising its service network and in September 2011, Maersk Line announced the new product Daily Maersk introducing daily departures from four main ports in Asia to three main ports in Europe with guaranteed transportation time. The operation involves 70 vessels and has been very well received by customers. In Q4, the on time delivery was 98% ­ significantly above the industry average.
During 2011, Maersk Line and Safmarine started taking delivery of container vessels specially fitted for Africa and South America. Apart from the focus on reducing slot cost and emission of green house gasses, these vessels serve the customers better than standard vessels because of their substantial reefer capacity.
The focus on growth markets helps position the Group towards the future as volume growth rates are significantly higher than for more mature markets while rates have also proven to be more stable.

Maersk Line announced that the Safmarine headquarters and regional offices would be merged into the Maersk Line organisation while maintaining the Saf-marine brand and sales force.
Seago Line was established to further develop Intra-Europe container transport.
Customer satisfaction further increased during 2011 and is now at an all time high.
The average bunker price for Maersk Liner Business was 35% higher in 2011 than in 2010. Bunker consumption per TEU/day decreased by 2%. As a consequence of the pressure on freight rates, it has become more difficult to pass on the increasing bunker cost to customers as more contracts are entered with validity of less than one month. These short term contracts are often based on all-in freight rates with no BAF element.
With the aim of reducing emissions and costs, Maersk Line is continuously seeking new ways of optimising bunker consumption. One initiative introduced during 2011 was super slow steaming which is primarily being used on the backhaul trades.
Total unit cost increased by 9% compared to 2010 whereas unit cost excluding bunker cost increased by 2% mainly due to increasing terminal and port expenses in growth markets. Total unit cost for Q4 was 2% higher than in Q4 2010, and 6% lower excluding bunker cost.
Maersk Line continued the focus on Reliability, Ease of doing business, Environmental impact and Competitiveness with the aim to achieve a 5% point higher EBIT margin than its peers. A number of initiatives to facilitate business with Maersk Line have already been implemented and more initiatives will be introduced during 2012. Maersk Line continues to be the most reliable container carrier and during Q4 the highest overall on-time-delivery of 87.5% was measured by Drewry. Customer satisfaction further increased during 2011 and is now at an all time high.
Maersk Line signed contracts for delivery of 20 18,000 TEU vessels which will be delivered in 2013-2015.

During 2011, the Group took delivery of 18 new and two second hand vessels totalling 98,000 TEU as well as two new multi purpose vessels (36,000 DWT). 10 vessels totalling 36,000 TEU were sold while one vessel of 5,000 TEU was scrapped in an environmentally responsible manner.
At the end of 2011, the fleet consisted of 254 own container vessels and 391 chartered container vessels with a total capacity of 2.5m TEU. In addition to this, the Group owned three and had chartered 12 multi purpose vessels. 42 vessels totalling 491,000 TEU are on order for delivery during 2012-2015 and two multi purpose vessels in Q1 2012.
At year-end, the total chartered capacity was 1.2m TEU (0.9m TEU).

The lost time incidents frequency (LTIF) for 2011 was 0.57 per million working hours (0.83 per million working hours).
Profit before financial items (EBIT) per FFE were negative by USD 75 (positive by USD 384) excluding gain on sale of ships and containers. The Q4 result was negatively impacted by one-off costs of USD 105m related to restructuring in Safmarine.
Maersk Line regained market share during 2011 and focus is moved towards profitability ahead of further market share gain. Maersk Line is taking initiatives to restore freight rates from loss-making levels by adjusting capacity through lay-ups and super slow-steaming to improve the market balance.

Maersk Oil

The profit increased by 24% compared to 2010, positively affected by higher oil prices but partly offset by higher exploration costs as well as a lower production share in Qatar and lower production in Denmark and the UK. The effective tax rate increased to 73% (71%), primarily due to increase of the tax rate in the UK and increasing exploration activities where the future tax deductibility depends on making commercial oil discoveries.
Safety has high priority for Maersk Oil and LTIF was 0.91 per million working hour (1.19 per million working hours). Efforts continue to completely eliminate incidents.
Production and development With an average daily share of oil and gas production in 2011 of 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent, the Group's share for the year was 12% lower than in 2010 (377,000 barrels per day). The decline was due to a lower share of production in Qatar and a lower production in Denmark and the UK, partly offset by a smaller new production from Brazil.
In Qatar, all 15 new platforms under the Al Shaheen field development were in operation and 12 new wells were put into production in 2011, increasing the total number of completed wells to 168 out of the 169 planned wells. The Group's average share of the oil production was 157,000 barrels per day, 6% lower than in 2010 (167,000 barrels per day). The decline was primarily due to higher oil prices and a lower share to recover investments and costs. The current field production level in the range of 300,000 barrels of oil per day is expected to continue, however, with a considerable lower share to the Group due to the nature of the Production Sharing Agreement.
In the Danish part of the North Sea, production started from the new Halfdan platform and drilling activities are ongoing or planned at the Dan, Tyra and Valdemar fields to partly offset the declining production. In July 2012, the Danish state owned "Danish North Sea Fund" enters as partner with a 20% interest in DUC. This will lower the Group's production share, however there will be no impact on net earnings as the Danish state participation replaces a 20% profit share. With an average share of 75,000 barrels of oil per day, the Group's share was 9% lower than in 2010 (82,000 barrels per day).

The total share of the gas production was 2.2 billion m or on average 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (49,000 barrels per day). The lower oil and gas production was caused by decreasing production from mature fields and lower gas demand.
In the UK, construction of a platform and other infrastructure for development of the Golden Eagle area in the North Sea was approved by the authorities and production start is planned for 2014, initially with a production share of 20,000 barrels of oil per day. Repair of Maersk Oil's FPSO, which was damaged during a storm in February 2011, is ongoing at Gryphon and production is expected to restart in the second half of 2012. The loss of production and property damage are partly recoverable under the existing insurance policies, and for 2011 a compensation of USD 266m has been included from the loss of production

insurance. The Group's share of production was on average 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was 47% less than in the same period of 2010 (51,000 barrels per day) mainly due to the Gryphon shut down.

In Brazil, acquisition of shares in three offshore licences was completed in July 2011 and the Group's average share of production from the Polvo field was 8,000 barrels of oil per day.

Maersk Oil completed 14 exploration or appraisal wells in 2011.

In the US, the Jack deep-water development project in the Gulf of Mexico is progressing towards start of production in 2014, initially with a production share around 8,000 barrels of oil per day.

In Algeria, development of the El Merk fields is ongoing with an expected additional production share of 10,000 barrels of oil per day from Q4 2012. At 25,000 barrels of oil per day, the Group's share of production was 4% below 2010 (26,000 barrels per day).
In Kazakhstan, the significant development of the Dunga field continues, including some 200 wells, with start of production of the first wells planned for 2012. The share of production is expected to reach a level of 15,000 barrels of oil per day in 2014. The Group's share of the oil production continued at a level of 3,000 barrels of oil per day during 2011 (3,000 barrels per day), positively affected by production from newer wells at the Dunga field but offset by sale of the Saigak field.

Exploration and business development Maersk Oil is pursuing the strategic target of reaching a sustainable production share of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2011, investments in new activities increased substantially, in particular with the USD 2.4bn acquisition in Brazil. Further, Maersk Oil completed 14 (14) exploration or appraisal wells in 2011 and was involved in drilling of another 30 wells, either in progress or committed to start in 2012 in Angola, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Norway, Qatar, the UK and the US.
Exploration costs were USD 990m (USD 605m) reflecting a high exploration activity level, including drilling activities in Angola, Brazil, Norway and the UK as well as pre-development activities in Angola and the UK.

The lower exploration costs in 2010 were impacted by reversal of a provision for an onerous rig.
In Angola, Maersk Oil increased its share in the offshore Chissonga oil discovery in Block 16 from 50% to 65%, subject to authority approval. The discovery was declared commercially viable to the local authorities and the assessment of the development options is ongoing. In parallel, exploration drilling is taking place to determine the remaining potential in the block. In Block 23, oil was discovered in the Azul deep-water exploration well and further drilling is planned to assess the potential. In Block 8, exploration drilling is planned for 2012.

In the UK, a development plan for the Maersk Oil operated Flyndre/Cawdor discovery areas in the North Sea was submitted to the authorities. Appraisal activities at the Culzean discovery confirmed a significant gas accumulation and drilling is ongoing to determine the extent and possible development options. In addition, appraisal activities are ongoing to determine the extent of the Jackdaw and Courageous discoveries and drilling of further five wells is either in progress or planned to commence in 2012. In 2011, Maersk Oil was awarded two licences, increasing the total number of awarded licences in the latest exploration bid round to eight, including five licenses with operatorship and two firm well commitments.

In Brazil, drilling is ongoing to appraise the Itaipu discovery and plans have been made to start appraisal drilling in the Wahoo discovery in 2012. The acquisition of a share in offshore licence BM-C-34 was approved by the authorities and a 2-well drilling plan is ongoing.
In Iraq, Maersk Oil acquired a 20% shareholding in HKN Energy Ltd., which comprises a 75% interest in the Sarsang Production Sharing Contract including operatorship in the Kurdistan Region. HKN Energy Ltd. drilled an oil discovery well in 2011 which is expected to be brought into a minor production in 2012.

In the US Gulf of Mexico, drilling of the Buckskin appraisal well was completed late 2011 and results are being evaluated with a commercial assessment expected for mid 2012. Drilling of the Oceanographer exploration well was postponed until 2013 due to low rig availability. In December 2011, Maersk Oil was awarded 12 leases in the Western Gulf of Mexico, subject to final authority approval.

In Norway, appraisal drilling is ongoing at the Avaldsnes discovery, where Maersk Oil owns a 20% share. Further, drilling of the T-Rex exploration well was ongoing by the end of 2011 and appraisal drilling of the Zidane gas discovery started in January 2012. Maersk Oil was in January 2012 awarded interests in seven exploration licences, including two as operator.

APM Terminals

APM Terminals operates a global network of 55 container terminals and 154 inland facilities in 64 countries.
In 2011, the global container terminal market measured in TEU increased by 7% compared to 2010 and by 5% in Q4 2011 (Drewry). The economic challenges facing consumer markets in both Europe and the US have to a limited extent affected volumes in ports along the main east-west trades, which was more than offset by high growth in the north-south trades and the Intra-Asia market.
The number of containers handled by APM Terminals (crane lifts weighted with APM Terminals' ownership interest) increased 7% compared to 2010 and 8% on a like-for-like basis. With a growth of 8% on a like-for-like basis in Q4 APM Terminals' volumes continued to exceed market levels.

During the year, operations in the container terminals in North Africa and the Middle East were negatively influenced by unrest related to the Arab Spring, resulting in reduced service levels towards the shipping lines and lower throughput particularly during Q1. Through implementation of operational recovery plans in close coordination with customers, most of the affected terminals were again operating normally towards year end. Volumes in the second half of the year were positively affected by newly added terminals in Poti and Callao and strong volumes on terminals along the Asia­Europe trades on the back of market share gains for Maersk Line.
76% af APM Terminals' EBITDA came from growth markets.
APM Terminals continues to diversify its client portfolio and volumes from customers other than Maersk Liner Business increased by 11%, contributing 46% of total volumes.
The profit excluding sales gains and impairment losses was 24% higher than in 2010. The improvements in margins and competitiveness were largely due to consistent implementation of improved operational methods and working in partnership with customers to improve efficiency as well as portfolio optimisation.
The inland services that were integrated in 2010 went through a successful strategic reorientation and financial turnaround process, and the activities contributed

positively to the improvement of the financial performance in 2011.
APM Terminals is actively pursuing an investment strategy with focus on growth markets. 36 out of 55 container terminals operate in growth markets and 76% of EBITDA was generated in these markets.
During 2011, APM Terminals secured a number of new investments and development opportunities in growth markets. APM Terminals took over operations in port of Callao, Peru, acquired a controlling interest of the Black Sea port of Poti, Georgia, signed a concession agreement to build and operate the new Moin container terminal on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and was awarded the concession to build and operate a new container terminal at the port of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico. APM Terminals was also awarded the concession to operate the Skandia Container Terminal in Gothenburg, Sweden, taking control of operations in January 2012.

APM Terminals will continue to invest strategically to handle the growing container volumes and also to accommodate the tendency among container carriers to deploy larger vessels, creating a need for increased port specifications and more sophisticated operations.
LTIF was 3.46 per million working hours for 2011 (4.36 per million working hours). In order to achieve substantial improvement APM Terminals will in 2012 focus especially on eliminating high severity accidents and advancing the safety management culture and systems in the complex port and inland operations.

Maersk Drilling

The high oil price supported continued increases in oil companies' exploration and development spend. In 2011, the demand for offshore rigs continued to grow, especially for modern jack-up rigs and floaters due to the operators' growing preference for rigs which provide increased capabilities, efficiency and safety.
The Norwegian jack-up market remained solid with full utilisation, and recent large discoveries confirmed the positive outlook for this segment. The number of jack-up rigs with near-term availability in the market is limited, and the market is expected to remain tight and supportive of high day rates. Maersk Drilling owns and operates six jack-up rigs in Norway, of which most are on longterm contracts.

Similarly, the ultra deepwater rig market was characterised by close to full utilisation, and day rates increased over the year establishing a new rate level around USD 500,000 per day. The increasing demand was primarily seen from the main growth regions West Africa and Brazil. Despite a significant order book, the ultra deep-water rig market is expected to remain strong both short- and medium-term, as development and exploration activity in the growth regions will drive solid future demand.
Maersk Drilling's contract coverage for 2012 was 93% at the end of 2011.

The premium jack-up market strengthened in 2011 with close to full utilisation and enjoyed significantly higher utilisation and day rates compared to older jackup rigs, due to the safety and efficiency gains offered to the operators. Maersk Drilling owns and operates six premium jack-up rigs.

Maersk Supply Service

Maersk Supply Service provides global services to the offshore and associated industries, including anchor handling, towage of drilling rigs and platforms as well as transport of supplies.
The market developed better than expected, especially during the second half of the year with a stronger than expected North Sea spot market at attractive day rates. There was increased activity in Brazil and West Africa with a number of long-term requirements, however, addition of new build tonnage balanced the market overall.
The anchor handling vessels performed better than expected mainly driven by increased demand in deep water markets, especially Brazil. The platform supply vessels performed somewhat above expectations and activity in the subsea market was positive as expected. For all vessel types, activity in the renewable sector particularly in the North Sea had a positive effect.
Newbuilding activity slowed down for the anchor handling vessels and improved the supply and demand

balance in the market, whereas a significant order book exists for platform supply vessels.
Maersk Supply Service ordered two anchor handling vessels, optimized for reduced emissions and fuel consumption.
Maersk Supply Service had a reasonable contract coverage going into 2011 but also a suitable exposure to the spot market to cover project work and to be able to take advantage of seasonal rate fluctuations. Continued focus on strategic key markets, such as Brazil, Australia, West and East Africa, resulted in increased contract volumes in these areas.
Two anchor handling vessels were ordered including an option for up to four additional vessels. The vessels are to be built in Chile for the Canadian market and are optimized for reduced emissions and fuel consumption. One older vessel was sold.

Maersk Tankers

Maersk Tankers is a global tanker shipping company operating in the market for transportation of crude oil, refined oil products and LPG through the ownership of 119 vessels with an additional 71 vessels on time charter.
As in 2010, earnings in most tanker segments remained poor throughout 2011 as a result of excess capacity.
Demand for transportation of crude oil is closely linked to global oil consumption which grew by about 1.2% in 2011, mainly driven by growing Chinese demand. The crude market experienced some turmoil in connection with the political unrest in Libya but this was compensated by increased volumes from Saudi Arabia. Despite the increased demand, a 10% fleet growth (ACM) caused rates to decrease further particularly during the second half year. Overall, rates were low resulting in negative earnings.
As a result of the difficult market conditions and in order to better utilise the fleet, Maersk Tankers entered into a pool agreement with four other owners, operating a

combined fleet of 50 VLCCs. The pool agreement commenced in February 2012 with Maersk Tankers as joint operator.
Transportation demand for refined oil products remained flat in 2011.The global economic slowdown led to declining refinery output primarily in Europe and Asia, whereas the US saw increasing exports in transportation fuels to South America. Fleet growth varied from +6% in LR2 to -2% in Handytankers (Inge Steensland), but without significant improvements in the tonnage balance. Earnings remained low though marginally better for the smaller product vessels.
The gas market improved in 2011, as new production of LPG in the Middle East and strong Asian demand led to an increase in demand by about 6% (Waterborne). Supply growth was limited, allowing the gas tanker market to return to stronger earnings, particularly in the VLGC segment.
Maersk Tankers took delivery of two VLCCs, eleven product tankers and five gas vessels in 2011, and one product tanker was sold.

Global commercial initiatives implemented during the year resulted in Damco winning more large size customers within strategically selected industry segments. Customer satisfaction ratings improved to the highest level so far thereby continuing the positive development from 2010.
Total revenue increased to USD 2.8bn (USD 2.7bn). The traditional annual peak season in Q3 was rather muted due to the fact that usual season peaks in European and North American consumer demand did not materialise. Supply chain management volumes were 3% lower than in 2010, while ocean volume increased 15% which was well ahead of the market. Airfreight tonnage was up 47% mainly driven by the acquisition of NTS.

Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG

Maersk FPSOs builds, owns and operates offshore floating production storage and offloading units (FPSO) servicing major oil companies in the North Sea, Brazil, Australia and Congo. All units are on long-term contracts running for up to 15 years.
An agreement was entered into to divest Maersk LNG for USD 1.4bn. The transaction is expected to be completed during Q1 2012.
Maersk FPSOs achieved significant safety, operational and financial improvements. Maersk Peregrino was successfully delivered during Q1 and steady performance was demonstrated in Q4 2011 when the unit reached 95% availability. Average availability for the rest of the fleet increased to 90% (87%).

In December 2011, Maersk Ngujima-Yin, operating in Australia, was divested to the customer with a final handover date in Q3 2012. The vessel has experienced operational challenges since a fire broke out in 2009 and an impairment loss of USD 250m was recognised during Q2 2011.
In October 2011, an agreement was entered into to divest Maersk LNG for USD 1.4bn. The transaction is expected to be completed during Q1 2012.
The profit for Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG was positively affected by better operational performance in Maersk FPSOs, attractive new contracts in Maersk LNG, a reversed impairment of USD 91m related to the LNG assets and negatively affected by impairments of USD 250m on Maersk Ngujima-Yin.
The LTIF for Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG was 0.53 per million working hours (1.18 per million working hours).

Dansk Supermarked Group

The Dansk Supermarked Group comprises the retail concepts Bilka (hypermarkets), Føtex (supermarkets), Netto (discount stores), and Salling (department stores).
The Retail Market The retail market for fast-moving consumer goods experienced a slight increase for all markets compared to 2010.
The retail market for non-food consumer goods decreased in Denmark and discount stores benefited from costconscious consumers and gained market share from supermarkets and hypermarkets.
The Dansk Supermarked Group Revenue for the Dansk Supermarked Group was 7% lower than in 2010 mainly due to the divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK. Adjusting for this the revenue increased by 1% and measured in local currency an increase of 1%.

The market share in foreign markets increased slightly but remained unchanged in the Danish market.
The decrease in consumer spending as well as the change in consumer spending from regular supermarkets to discount stores had a negative effect on profits.
The profit was positively affected by the divestment gain from Netto Foodstores Limited, UK of DKK 3.8bn. The sale was completed in April 2011.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased due to investments in new stores and relocation and refurbishment of existing stores. The positive cash effect from the divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK was DKK 6.3bn.
During 2011, 84 new stores were opened of which 67 were outside Denmark and two stores were closed. The divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK reduced the total number of stores by 195 bringing the total number to 1,303.

The LTIF for Dansk Supermarked Group was 13.95 per million working hours (13.53 per million working hours).

Odense Steel Shipyard Group

The Odense Steel Shipyard Group delivered two frigates to the Royal Danish Navy as well as three Ro/Ro vessels.
Revenue amounted to DKK 1.9bn (DKK 2.8bn) and profit was DKK 0.2bn (loss of DKK 0.3bn). Result from the delivery of the last ships was slightly negative, while positive contributions came from refund of energy taxes, reversal of provisions and other net impacts from closing the shipyard, including sale of assets.

The shipyard successfully completed its shipbuilding activities with the delivery of the last Ro/Ro vessel and the last frigate, both of which were delivered in January 2012. The phase out of the shipbuilding activities is then completed in accordance with the plan made in August 2009.

Maersk Container Industry

Maersk Container Industry (MCI) benefited from a continued high demand for reefer containers, mainly driven by the underlying strong growth in reefer transported commodities and cargo conversion from conventional reefer bulk vessels to reefer containers.
MCI's patented integrated reefer concept has gained large acceptance in the market, and MCI's sales volumes of reefer containers and reefer machines were higher than in 2010.

MCI announced establishment of a new reefer production facility in Chile, the only one in the world located outside China.
In 2011, the LTIF was 1.33 per million working hours (1.88 per million working hours).
Revenue was USD 1.2bn (USD 0.7bn) and the profit was USD 69m (USD 41m). ROIC was 33.1% (20.6%).

Danske Bank A/S
The Group owns 20% of the shares in Danske Bank A/S, the largest Danish bank, which has operations in a number of countries, including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Ireland and Northern Ireland. The bank's profit was DKK 1.7bn (DKK 3.7bn), of which 20%, corresponding to DKK 343m (DKK 734m), is included in the A.P. Moller - Maersk Group's profit.

In April 2011, A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S participated in Danske Bank A/S' rights issue of DKK 20 billion with an investment of DKK 4bn, maintaining the 20% ownership share.

Ro/Ro and related activities

Ro/Ro and related activities comprise the Group's ownership interests in DFDS A/S and Höegh Autoliners, etc.
The profit was USD 34m (loss of USD 129m) and ROIC was 5.3% (negative by 17.5%).

The Group's share of profit in DFDS of USD 49m (USD 25m) is based on analyst consensus from February 2012 as the annual report for 2011 has not yet been published.

Income statement The A.P. Moller - Maersk Group's profit for the year declined by DKK 10.1bn to DKK 18.1bn (DKK 28.2bn).
Revenue increased by 2% to DKK 322.5bn (DKK 315.4bn), primarily as a consequence of higher oil prices and container volumes which was partly offset by lower container freight rates and lower share of oil production. Measured in USD, revenue was 60.2bn (USD 56.1bn).
Operating costs increased by DKK 19.3bn to DKK 245.6bn (DKK 226.3bn), primarily due to increasing container volumes and increasing bunker prices.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses decreased by DKK 4.9bn to DKK 28.9bn (DKK 33.8bn). The Group recognised impairment losses of net DKK 1.7bn (DKK 4.1bn), mainly related to Maersk FPSOs.
Gain on sale of non-current assets, net, increased to DKK 4.7bn (DKK 3.8bn), primarily due to divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK.
Share of the result in associated companies increased by DKK 0.2bn to DKK 0.7bn (DKK 0.5bn) due to full year effect of the ownership in DFDS (assumed ownership 12 July 2010) partly offset by a lower profit in Danske Bank.
Net financial expenses were reduced to DKK 4.6bn (DKK 5.3bn) primarily due to lower interest rate level and average net interest bearing debt.
Tax Companies in the A.P. Moller - Maersk Group are taxed under different tax regimes, depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to some of the Group's activities.

As a general rule, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage-based or similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the fleet's tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid, mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.
In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the normal corporate tax rate. Furthermore, the Danish government receives 20% of the profit before tax from the Danish sector of the North Sea, calculated according to tax rules. This profit share is treated as tax in the financial statements. In other countries, the government receives a share of the oil production in addition to the tax payment. Such government shares are excluded from revenue and hence not included as tax.
In 2011, the total tax charge for the A.P. Moller ­ Maersk Group was DKK 32.4bn (DKK 26.2bn). The increase was primarily caused by higher earnings from oil and gas activities, including an increase of the UK tax rate on oil of 12%-point. Of the total tax charge, taxes payable to Denmark constituted DKK 11.0bn (DKK 9.2bn), of which DKK 7.7bn (DKK 6.3bn) related to the special hydrocarbon tax and profit share to the Danish State.
Comprehensive income Comprehensive income for the year was DKK 19.9bn (DKK 36.2bn) and includes the profit for the year of DKK 18.1bn (DKK 28.2bn) and other comprehensive net income of DKK 1.8bn (DKK 8.0bn). Other comprehensive income mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow hedges and actuarial gains and losses.

Balance sheet At 31 December 2011, total assets amounted to DKK 404.7bn (DKK 374.7bn).
Intangible assets increased to DKK 28.8bn (DKK 14.6bn) mainly due to acquired oil and terminal concession rights.
Property, plant and equipment of DKK 254.8bn (DKK 243.7bn) increased by DKK 11.1bn, with investments in the year of DKK 43.2bn (DKK 26.8bn). Depreciation for the year was DKK 25.7bn (DKK 26.5bn), and net impairment losses of DKK 1.4bn (DKK 3.1bn) were recognised. Sale of tangible assets accounted for DKK 2.5bn (DKK 5.4bn), primarily related to sale of vessels. DKK 7.5bn (DKK 4.3bn) was transferred to assets held for sale comprising mainly the LNG activities. Currency adjustments were an increase of DKK 5.0bn (DKK 18.6bn) due to the development in USD versus DKK.
Shares in associated companies amounted to DKK 32.5bn (DKK 26.7bn), hereof Danske Bank DKK 25.2bn (DKK 21.0bn).
Derivatives were as of 31 December 2011 a net liability of DKK 3.3bn (DKK 1.9bn). The increase is primarily related to the depreciation of the USD.
Total cash and cash equivalents, consisting of securities held for trading as well as cash and bank balances totalled DKK 15.2bn (DKK 25.9bn) at 31 December 2011.
Assets held for sale of net DKK 8.7bn (DKK 3.4bn) comprised assets expected to be sold during 2012 including the Group's LNG activities and seven container vessels.
Equity totalled DKK 207.9bn (DKK 193.0bn). The increase includes comprehensive income for the year of DKK 19.9bn (DKK 36.2bn), and dividend was deducted by DKK 4.9bn (DKK 2.1bn).
Deferred tax liabilities totalled DKK 6.0bn (DKK 4.4bn) at 31 December 2011, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled DKK 4.9bn (DKK 5.1bn). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of DKK 4.0bn (DKK 3.6bn) have not been recognised, cf. note 13.

Funding During 2011, the Group continued to raise funding for new investments supporting the Group's solid liquidity position. The Group has limited refinancing needs in the next 24 months.
Considering the continued uncertainty in the commercial banking market, the Group is open to further diversifying its funding sources. Furthermore, this diversification may contribute to simplifying the Group's debt portfolio. At 31 December 2011, issued bonds were 13.2% (13.0%) of total interest-bearing debt.
Total interest-bearing debt amounted to DKK 109.8bn (DKK 101.1bn) or USD 19.1bn (USD 18.0bn) at 31 December 2011. The Group's net interest-bearing debt totalled DKK 88.0bn (DKK 69.7bn) or USD 15.3bn (USD 12.4bn). The Group has increased its net interest-bearing debt by USD 2.9bn during 2011 as a consequence of higher investment level. The average maturity of loan facilities in the Group was around five years at 31 December 2011. The Group has no immediate refinancing need. The intention is to maintain a strong liquidity position to be able to resist fluctuations and have the financial strength to exploit new investment opportunities.
Operating lease obligations The present value of the operating lease obligations totalled USD 11.6bn (USD 12.2bn) at 31 December 2011 using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into the following main items:
· O bligations regarding Container activities and Tankers, offshore and other shipping activities of USD 7.1bn (USD 7.5bn)
· O bligations regarding Terminal activities of USD 3.7bn (USD 3.8bn)
· Other obligations of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.9bn)
About one-third of the time charter payments in Container activities as well as Tankers, offshore and other shipping activities are estimated to relate to operational costs for the assets. The use of chartered vessels increases the flexibility to adjust the fleet size to match fluctuations in demand, primarily in container and tanker activity. The average term to maturity of the charters was 2.7 (2.4) years for container vessels and 4.2 (4.4) years for tankers.

Investment programme Total outstanding commitments concerning purchase of property, plant and equipment totalled USD 14.8bn (USD 9.1bn) at 31 December 2011. The major outstanding commitments are related to Container activities USD 5.2bn (USD 2.9bn), Oil and gas activities USD 2.9bn (USD 3.6bn), Terminal activities USD 2.8bn (USD 1.5bn) and Tankers, offshore and other shipping activities USD 3.7bn (USD 0.8bn).
Funding position At 31 December 2011, liquidity buffers, defined as cash and bank balances, securities and committed undrawn facilities, were USD 11.3bn (USD 14.5bn), of which total committed undrawn facilities constituted USD 8.6bn. Added to this are a number of overdraft facilities related to the Group's daily cash management operations. To this can be added financing commitments related to the Group's new building programme.
The Group's long-term objective is to maintain a conservative funding profile, matching that of a strong investment grade company over the business cycle. As a consequence of fluctuations in the payment schedule of investments and fluctuations in the Group's cash flow, fluctuations in the financial profile are expected. Based on the size of the committed loan facilities, including loans for specific asset financing, the maturity of the loan facilities and the existing investment profile, the Group's funding position is satisfactory.

None of the disputes mentioned above are expected to have any material impact on earnings in future periods.
Pensions, etc. The actuarial net liability in relation to defined benefit plans recognised in the financial statements totalled DKK 2.5bn (DKK 2.1bn) at 31 December 2011. Developments in the actuarial assumptions as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements resulted in actuarial losses of DKK 0.8bn (loss of DKK 0.2bn), which are included in other comprehensive income. In 2011, the Group paid DKK 0.6bn (DKK 0.5bn) to benefit plans.
Cash flow Cash flow from operating activities DKK 38.9bn (DKK 57.0bn) was negatively affected by lower earnings before depreciation and amortisation as well as higher tax payments. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was DKK 52.3bn (DKK 26.1bn). The increase was mainly due to investments in vessels, oil rights as well as the capital increase in Danske Bank partly offset by proceeds from the sale of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK.

Legal disputes, etc. The Group is involved in a number of legal disputes. Moreover, the Group is party to a number of tax disputes, some of which involve substantial amounts.

Risk management
A.P. Moller - Maersk Group
Risk management

Group annual report 2011

48

The A.P. Moller - Maersk Group is exposed to a range of different risks due to its global presence and variety of businesses. This requires a portfolio approach to risks where the downside risks are carefully evaluated and balanced against the upside potential and where risks are assessed from a portfolio perspective.
Management of the Group's risks is anchored in an Enterprise Risk Management framework, where the most significant risks and mitigation plans are consolidated bi-annually in a Group key risk overview. The Group key risk overview is discussed with the Group's Executive Board and Board of Directors.
Strategic Risks Freight rates The Group is exposed to fluctuations in freight rates, particularly in the container shipping market. This cyclical risk is mitigated by lowering the exposure towards the spot market by stabilising revenue through use of annual and semi-annual customer contracts. This is further supported by delivering differentiated service offerings with focus on reliability, ease of business and environmental performance, driving customer focus towards the entire value chain of transportation, and away from a sole focus on freight rates. In periods of excess tonnage, capacity can be reduced by redelivery of time chartered vessels, scrapping, lay-up and postponement of new building deliveries.
Oil and Gas Production The Group aims at replacing current oil and gas production by finding or acquiring new reserves. Over recent years investments in exploration, development and acquisition activities have increased while maintaining focus on maximising oil and gas recovery from mature fields. Furthermore, the Group has initiated an oil and

gas reserves evaluation process to support the investment decision process.
Political Risks The Group's global presence exposes both assets and earnings to geopolitical events. Political actions such as trade barriers, new taxes, currency restrictions, expropriation etc. could impact the Group's result and cash flows. Key mitigations to manage these risks include engagement with political bodies and authorities, local partnerships, monitoring of regulatory initiatives, corporate social responsibility and spread of geographical risks.
Financial Risks Liquidity The Group must have sufficient funds available to fund its operations and investment programme and service its debt. The Group has a strong financial policy and closely monitors cash flow forecasts, financial ratios and the liquidity buffer. Further, the Group aims to secure funding before committing investments and seeks to diversify financing sources through corporate bonds and private placements.
Credit Risk The Group has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.

Risk management

Group annual report 2011

49

Foreign Exchange Rate The Group's income from shipping and oil related activities is mainly USD denominated while the related expenses are in both USD and a wide range of other currencies. The Group's exposure to currency fluctuations is mitigated by various hedge programs.
Oil Price Crude Oil Price The Group has substantial income from its oil and gas activities and is therefore exposed to changes in oil prices. The Group had an entitlement production of 121 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2011.
Bunker Price The Group is exposed to changes in bunker costs and consumed in 2011 11,384 metric tonnes bunker fuel, of which 96% was in Maersk Line. The Group maintains focus on passing on bunker price fluctuations to customers through the Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) and on reducing bunker consumption.
Operational Risks Major Safety Incidents Controlling the risk of major safety incidents is inherent in the Group's businesses, particularly in the oil and offshore businesses. To mitigate these risks, safety training, safety risk management systems, certification and classification of equipment and procedures, quality assurance and processes for knowledge sharing across the Group are in place. When activities are performed in partnerships or in joint ventures where the Group is not in full control of the activities, the Group seeks to protect sustainable interests and values through cooperation and shareholder agreements, etc.
Major Environmental Incidents Controlling the risk of major environmental incidents is inherent in the Group's businesses, particularly in the oil, offshore and tanker business. The risk is mitigated through training, environmental management systems, oil spill procedures, membership of cross industry response organisations, double hull policy and by taking limited equity shares in operations in high risk areas. Where activities are performed in cooperation or joint ventures and the Group is not in full control of the activities, the Group constantly seeks to protect sustainable interests and values through cooperation and shareholder agreements, etc.

War, terrorism or piracy attack Due to its global operational presence the Group faces a threat of war, terrorism and piracy attacks in various areas. Main mitigations are disaster and contingency planning, security measures at offices, vessels and installations, armed guards on vessels, voyage planning and monitoring and intelligence.
Information risk The Group's global presence, size and complexity dictate a need for having the right information available at the right time, maintaining the integrity of protected information and preventing disclosure of confidential information. This is secured through an information security policy, IT governance, technical controls, information security user training and awareness campaigns and business continuity plans.
Procedures and controls Continued strengthening of the business areas' competitiveness, including customer focus and cost control, has a material impact on the Group's results and development. Part of the activities in APM Terminals and Maersk Oil are performed in cooperation and joint ventures where the Group is not in full control of the activities. Through cooperation and shareholder agreements etc., with stateowned partners among others, the Group constantly seeks to protect sustainable interests and values as well as to ensure implementation of initiatives to improve the Group's competitiveness and results.
Compliance Risks Human Rights It is a priority for the Group to be compliant with the global human rights standards associated with the new expectations and standards set by OECD for multinational enterprises endorsed in June 2011. An action plan has been developed with the intention of closing the gaps. The Group has a Responsible Procurement Programme, health and safety management programmes and global labour principles in place to mitigate the risk of non-compliance.
Tax The Group is exposed to a large number of different tax regimes in 130 countries and there is a risk of an unexpected tax expense due to uncertainty in the interpretation of local tax regulations or failure in compliance. To mitigate this risk, specific tax compliance policies are in place, a tax risk database is maintained and the Group's

Risk management

Group annual report 2011

50

tax function receives regular reporting from Business Unit and Country tax departments. In significant locations, specialised tax managers monitor changes in tax regulations and rules to ensure full compliance. In other locations the Group relies upon external tax advisors for guidance.
Anti-corruption, competition and export control Failure to comply with applicable legislation relating to anti-corruption, competition and export control may have a substantial negative impact on the Group's financial performance and reputation. To mitigate this

risk, mandatory compliance training, specific compliance policies and procedures, a whistleblower system, a "hospitality book" to report gifts and compliance audits and drills are in place.
Insurance The Group insures assets and liabilities according to industry practice in the various businesses. As of 1 January 2012, the Group will retain more risk through its newly established captive insurance company, Maersk Insurance A/S.

In 2011, the Group joined the United Nations Global Compact LEAD programme which consists of 55 participants and provides a platform to support the members in their efforts to achieve higher levels of corporate sustainability performance.
The safety imperative The safety and security of the Group's people and assets continues to be a top priority. In 2011, a safety strategy was launched, which among other focus areas establishes a platform to systematically share better practices across the Group in order to improve safety standards and performance.
A long-term view on climate change The Group agreed on a climate change position, strategy and target during 2011, which recognises the need to limit global warming to 2°C. Furthermore, the strategy outlines the Group's approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Group operations. The new target for 2020 is to reduce the CO intensity of the Group's operations by 10% using 2010 as a baseline.
Focus on Human Rights Human rights cover a wide range of issues, which are addressed through our programmes on responsible procurement, global labour principles and health and safety. During 2011, the UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights was launched and introduced a new international standard on the expectations for business conduct. An action plan for 2012-13 has been developed with the intention of

closing the gaps in the Group's adherence to the requirements of the Guiding Principles.
The safety and security of the Group's people and assets continues to be a top priority.
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative In 2011, Maersk Oil became a supporter of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is a global framework that promotes revenue transparency through public reporting of company payments and government revenues.
Further information The Directors' report does not include a complete statement of the Group's environmental and social responsibility. The Group's separate Sustainability Report for 2011 provides a comprehensive view of the Group's sustainability performance and also acts as the Group's Communication on Progress against the requirements of the UN Global Compact and complies with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act on corporate social responsibility reporting.

Human resources

Human Resources work closely with the business to proactively ensure highly skilled employees in the right positions, clear expectations of our leaders and a clear link between performance and rewards.
Growth markets and diversity To maintain the position as an attractive employer to our existing global workforce as well as to future employees, the Group continued in 2011 the focus on diversity within the organisation by furthering our inclusive work environment, developing and leveraging female talent and strengthening our leadership pipeline in growth markets.
To fully leverage the positive effects of our diverse and global workforce, the Group incorporated diversity into our leadership development programs.
The Group continued its efforts to develop and enable female talent in the organisation providing networking opportunities, targeted self-leadership courses and senior management exposure. Globally, the Group's representation of women in senior management was 9% (8%), in middle management 21% (21%) and at vice president level 4% (4%).1
In 2011, the Group's workforce in growth markets was 40%, making it a priority to ensure to capitalize on the talent potential in our growth market organisations.
Performance Management, Rewards and Engagement Focus on developing a performance culture within the organisation continues. To drive high performing busi-

nesses, all the employees should know exactly what is expected of them and how they will be rewarded when they meet, or exceed, these expectations. As part of this, the Group continues to introduce simple, transparent incentive schemes to an increasing number of employees. The Group clearly sees the benefit of this process through the annual engagement survey as our employees increasingly recognise that their pay and performance is linked.
In 2011, the annual engagement survey2 had a 90% response rate, the highest to date. A high response rate indicates the level of importance employees place on the survey. The survey results showed improvements in the employees' perception of the Group and its leadership. Furthermore, the customer related questions showed considerable improvements, indicating that employees are seeing a move towards being more externally and customer focused. These improvements are due to the continuous improvement initiatives taken by employees and their leaders.
Leadership development A precondition for the Group's success in achieving top quartile performance is the superior capabilities of the leadership staff. The speed of change in the markets and business environment increases and to stay ahead, the Group is ensuring a constant learning effort. To strengthen the capabilities of leaders, the Group launched several leadership programmes with a focus on activities that enable cross organisational learning and team learning.
The retention rate for the Group's high performing leaders within top 1,000 was 95% in 2011.

Technology and innovation

Technological pioneering and innovation is a cornerstone in the Group's shipping, oil and gas, offshore and terminal businesses. Using and developing new and improved technologies is the basis for the Group's efficient, safe and sustainable performance. Technology innovation is carried out by the Group's technology divisions in cooperation with the Group's businesses, manufacturers, shipyards, universities, etc.

on its characteristics, sailing conditions and unique performance. To make this evaluation easier, the Group has developed the EE-Analyser (Energy Efficiency), which allows predicting the effect of installing one or more new technologies based on each vessel's unique performance data. This data is received from a vessel performance management system implemented throughout the container shipping fleet.

Technology and innovation within shipping Maersk Maritime Technology (MMT) is the Group's knowledge and competence center within shipping innovation and technology. In addition to coordinating and supervising newbuilding projects, MMT provides specialised technical services and performance monitoring of the fleet.
In the Group's shipping segments, significant development and innovation has been undertaken over the years, providing the basis for today's safety and environmental efficiency. One example of major technological development and innovation is the 18,000 TEU Triple-E container vessels, which were ordered by Maersk Line in 2011. These vessels will have significantly higher capacity and energy efficiency and 50% lower CO emissions per container compared to the average vessel currently operating on the Asia­Europe trades. This has been achieved through detailed optimisation of the hull performance, the propulsion system and the machinery system. Furthermore, the vessels will be delivered with advanced waste heat recovery systems, utilising the heat energy of the exhaust.
New and improved vessels are being built continuously, but also older vessels are being optimised and improved with new technology focusing on fuel and CO reduction. The biggest challenge lies in determining which technologies are most useful for each individual vessel, depending

A wide range of technologies and initiatives have been evaluated in terms of reduction potentials and investment levels. Examples are frequency control of seawater cooling pumps and engine room ventilation as well as derating of the main engine and installation of economisers on auxiliary engines. More spectacular potentials for some vessels may be modification and optimisation of bulbous bows for a wider range of speeds and draughts.
Using and developing new and improved technologies is the basis for the Group's efficient, safe and sustainable performance.
At the end of 2011 38 vessels had waste heat recovery systems implemented, making Maersk Line the world's largest operator hereof. Another example of reduction of CO emissions and fuel consumption per container is the Group's initiative to increase the container stacking height on older vessels to allow more containers on the same vessel. This requires the wheel house to be elevated to secure sufficient visibility and at the same time the lashing bridges needs to be higher. In 2011 Maersk Line started such modifications on 16 S-class vessels, adding 1,200 TEU extra capacity on each vessel.

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Independent Auditors' Report

To the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
Independent auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2011, which comprise income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the parent company. The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for such internal control that management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial state-

ments. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
The audit has not resulted in any qualification.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the parent company's financial position at 31 December 2011 and of the results of the Group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2011 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Statement on the Director's report Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Director's report. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the Directors' report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.

1 Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements for 2011 for the A.P. Moller ­ Maersk Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. In addition, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for 2010. An overview of the new and updated standards and interpretations is given in note 30.
The Board of Directors and the Management Board have on 27 February 2012 considered and adopted the annual report for 2011, which will be presented for adoption by the shareholders at the company's Annual General Meeting on 12 April 2012.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, subsidiaries and proportionate shares in jointly controlled entities.
Subsidiaries are entities in which A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S controls the financial and operational policies for the purpose of achieving a return or other benefits from the activities. Control is achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling more than 50% of the voting rights, by means of agreements on management control or some other way of controlling the entity concerned. Entities in which the Group exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered to be associated companies (associates). A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Jointly controlled entities are entities in which the Group according to contractual agreements makes strategic decisions about the financing and operation of the entity jointly with one or more other parties.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company, subsidiaries and the proportionate share of jointly controlled entities which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, after the elimination of intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, intra-group balances and dividends, and gains on intra-group transactions. Financial statement items related to part-owned vessels are included proportionately.
Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and jointly controlled entities are eliminated in proportion with the Group's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way if not impaired.
Non-controlling interests' share of profit for the year and of equity in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned is included as part of the Group's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.
On acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. Any subsequent changes to contingent acquisition costs are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity. In stepwise acquisitions, value adjustments of previously recognised investments are recognised in the income statement. When surrendering control, the value of any retained investment is adjusted at fair value and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Group uses DKK as its presentation currency. In the translation to the presentation currency for entities with a functional currency different from DKK, the statement of comprehensive income is translated into DKK at average exchange rates and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from such translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For the Group's principal shipping activities and oil and gas activities, the functional currency is USD. This means that, among other things, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency in the country in which such activities are performed.

1 ­ continued
Transactions in other currencies than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge future transactions is recognised directly in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised or are no longer probable. At that time, the cumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities which can be attributed to the hedging relationship.
The ineffective portion of hedge transactions, including time value for oil price hedges, and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for financial instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.
Segment information The allocation of business activities into segments reflects the Group's character as a conglomerate. Some activities are related, but are managed as independent units. For practical reasons management has grouped operational segments into six business areas after which segment information is disclosed.
Revenue between segments is limited except for Terminal activities, which delivers a large part of its services to the Group's container shipping activities. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities comprise items directly related to or which can be allocated to segments. Financial assets and liabilities and also related financial income and expenses are not attributed to business segments. Financial income and expenses directly related to a segment such as exchange rate adjustment of trade receivables and trade payables are included in the segment results.
Reportable segments do not comprise costs in group functions. Furthermore, oil hedging activities in Maersk Oil Trading and the results of Maersk Oil Trading's trading activity in the form of purchasing bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of entities in the Group are not allocated to business segments.
Income statement Generally, revenue is based on invoiced sales. Uncompleted voyages in shipping activities are recognised at the share related to the financial year. The earnings of vessels that are part of pool arrangements are recognised in revenue based on time charter equivalents. Revenue regarding the oil and gas activities is calculated as the Group's share of the value of the oil and gas production in the partnerships in which the Group participates.
Exploration costs in the oil and gas activities are recognised as they are incurred, under operating costs.
Share in profits of associated companies is included after tax and corrected for share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for investments in associated companies, including goodwill, and their reversal.
Tax comprises the amount estimated to be paid for the year, as well as adjustments to previous years and deferred tax. The tax amount includes the special taxes relating to extraction and production of hydrocarbons, including the profit share to the Danish State and tax on income subject to Danish and foreign tonnage taxation, etc.
Government grants are deducted from the cost of the assets or costs to which the grant relates.

Statement of comprehensive income Other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not included in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation of consolidated and associated companies' financial statements into presentation currency, adjustment of other equity investments and hedging instruments to fair value and actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit plans etc. The Group's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies is also included.

In the event of disposal or discontinuation of an entity, the Group's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of securities are transferred to the income statement in the event of sale or when an impairment loss is deemed to be unrecoverable.

Actual and deferred tax relating to other comprehensive income are included.

Balance sheet Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Intangible assets in connection with acquired oil resources (concession rights etc.) are amortised from the commencement of production until the fields' expected production periods ends ­ a period of up to 15 years. Acquired exploration rights are amortised from the date of acquisition for a period of up to five years.

IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.

For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. Cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but impairment tests are prepared at least annually, starting in the year of acquisition. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units.

Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:

Ships, rigs, etc. Containers, etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure  Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc. Oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields

20-25 years 12 years
10-50 years over lease or concession period
5-20 years 3-7 years
up to 15 years

For oil production facilities, including facilities under construction, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil.
The cost of an asset is divided into separate components which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs to sell.

The cost of assets produced by the Group includes direct and indirect expenses. Borrowing costs from specific as well as general borrowings directly related to assets with a long production period are attributed to cost during the production period.
Cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment, removal and restoration.
Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships, rigs, etc. when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.
Assets held under finance leases are treated as property, plant and equipment.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is fully impaired before other assets in a cash-generating unit.
Investments in associated companies are recognised as the Group's share of the equity value measured according to the Group's accounting policies inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is regained.
Securities, including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for other securities. Securities that form part of the liquidity resources (Held for trading) are classified as current assets and value adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items. Other equity investments are classified as non-current assets (the category Available-for-sale) where unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. Write-down is made to net realisable value if lower. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Receivables are generally recognised at nominal value, which in all material respects corresponds to amortised cost. Non-current receivables are recognised at discounted value, including finance lease receivables. Write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments. Work in progress for third parties is recognised at the sales value of the work completed less payments on account.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit or loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Any dividend for distribution is included as a separate component of equity. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity, including proceeds on the disposal of own shares in connection with the exercise of share options.
The translation reserve comprises the Group's share of accumulated differences arising on the foreign currency translation of Group entities' and associated companies' financial statements into presentation currency. The securities reserve comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of other equity investments (Available-for-sale). The reserve for hedges includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of hedging transactions qualifying for hedge accounting.
Share options allocated to the key executives of the Group as part of the Group's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs at the estimated market value over the vesting period. The counter item is equity. The market value is calculated on the basis of the Black & Scholes formula for valuation of options.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation and include provisions for abandonment of oil fields, restructuring costs, legal disputes, onerous contracts, etc. Provisions are recognised on the basis of best estimates and considering discounting when the time element is significant.
Pension obligations, etc. which are defined benefit plans are recognised based on actuarial calculations of the obligations and the fair value of the assets in the plans. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of current service costs less employee payments, computed interest cost, expected return on plan assets and settlement, gains or losses, etc. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Costs regarding defined contribution pension and insurance plans are recognised as incurred.
Pension plans where the Group as part of collective bargaining agreements participates together with other enterprises ­ so called multiemployer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans where sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.

Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not provided on goodwill which is not deductible or depreciable for tax purposes, or temporary differences which have no effect on the accounting results or taxable income at the time of the transaction. In addition, deferred tax is not calculated for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent that taxable dividends are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised against future taxable income.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Transaction costs and any premium or discount are amortised over the term of the liabilities using the amortised cost method. Fixed interest loans which under hedge accounting are swapped to variable interest are measured at amortised cost adding or deducting the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet.
Cash flow statement Cash flow for the year is divided into cash flow from operating activities, cash flow used for investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances. Changes in marketable securities are included in cash flow used for investing activities.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and comparative figures are restated. Similarly, assets and related liabilities from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement.
Individual assets or groups of assets that are to be disposed of collectively, are classified as assets held for sale, when the activities to carry out such a sale have been initiated and the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities that are directly related to assets held for sale are presented correspondingly.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets etc. are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.
Key figures Return on equity is calculated as the profit or loss for the year divided by the average equity.
Return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is the profit or loss for the year before interest but after calculated tax, divided by the average invested capital (equity plus net interest-bearing debt).
Equity ratio is calculated as the equity divided by total assets.
The segments' return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is profit or loss divided by the average invested capital, net (assets less liabilities).
Earnings per share and cash flow from operating activities per share comprise A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S's share of the profit or loss for the year respectively the cash flow from operating activities divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding the Group's holding of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of issued share options.
Dividend per share is the proposed dividend for the year per share of DKK 1,000.
Total market capitalisation is the total number of shares ­ excluding the Group's holding of own shares ­ multiplied by the end-of-year price quoted by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen.

2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements
When preparing the consolidated financial statements for the Group, the management undertakes a number of accounting estimates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify the Group's assets and liabilities.
The most significant areas subject to estimates and judgements are mentioned below.
Valuation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment, if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are always carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less costs to sell and estimated value in use.
Fair value is sought to be obtained for active markets for corresponding assets or determined on the basis of other observable input. As far as possible, the estimated fair value of ships, rigs and properties is obtained using acknowledged brokers. However, it is not possible to determine reliable fair value for certain types of ships in the current market with continued low trading activity.
The estimated value in use is computed on the basis of the expected free cash flow from the relevant cash-generating unit based on updated business plans for the next five years or the remaining useful lives for assets operating under contracts. The calculated value in use is based on a number of assumptions and subject to uncertainty in respect of the global economy's impact on the Group's business areas in the short term as well as in the long term. For tanker activities in particular, the values in use are based on expectations of enhanced market conditions as compared to the level at the end of 2011. Assumptions are described in notes 9 and 10.
The determination and delimitation of cash-generating units differ for the various business areas. For integrated network businesses such as Maersk Line and Safmarine, the container shipping activities are considered to be a single cash-generating unit. For the Oil and gas activities, connected oil and gas fields are considered to be cash-generating units, and for offshore and other shipping activities, the cash-generating unit is often the individual asset. Maersk Tankers and Maersk Supply Service group vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing the management's ongoing follow-up.
Depreciation periods The total depreciation and amortisation is a considerable cost to the Group. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are depreciated and amortised over the expected useful lives for ships and rigs, etc., typically over a useful life of 20-25 years to a residual value of 10% of the original cost for ships and up to 30% for drilling rigs. For producing oil fields and production platforms, the useful lives are based on the expected production profile of the field.
Estimates of useful lives and residual values are reassessed regularly based on available information. In this connection, the long term view is prioritised, in order to disregard to the extent possible temporary market fluctuations, which may be significant. Changes to estimates of useful lives and residual values may affect the annual depreciation and amortisation and thereby the results for the year significantly.
Business combinations The allocation of the acquisition cost to the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and thus to goodwill, including the allocation to cash-generating units, may have a significant impact on future profits. Fair values are based on estimates using information available at the time control was achieved.
When part of the acquisition cost for entities acquired is dependent on the development in future profits, estimates are made of the most probable value of the contingent acquisition cost based on current forecasts.
Leasing Lease contracts are classified as operating or finance leases at the inception of the lease. Once determined, the classification is not subsequently changed unless there are changes to the contract documents.
Contracts which transfer all significant risks and benefits associated with the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. This usually applies to long-term lease contracts or where ownership is transferred to the lessee at the expiry of the lease term. All conditions in a contract are assessed and the classification depends to a certain extent on judgment based on the actual circumstances of the agreement.

The value of assets held under finance leases recognised in the balance sheet is based on the discounted value of the contractual lease payments. No contingent lease payments are included and the value can therefore be determined reliably. Uncertainty relating to the useful lives and residual values of assets and the impairment test principles is the same for assets held under finance leases as for own assets.
Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised and measured to the extent they are expected to be realisable within the foreseeable future. Tax assets which can only be utilised in the longer term are deemed to be uncertain and are not recognised.
Receivables Provisions for bad debt and write-downs of receivables are carried out on the basis of an assessment of their recoverability at the balance sheet date. Trade receivables are grouped on the basis of maturity analyses for the purpose of providing for bad debt. In special circumstances trade receivables are impaired individually. Other receivables, including loans, are written-down on the basis of an assessment of the individual debtor's credit rating. An analysis of overdue trade receivables and movement in the provisions for bad debt can be found in note 23. The writedowns of non-current receivables performed in the period can be found in note 6.
Pension liabilities The gross liability for defined benefit plans, etc. is based on a number of actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, future inflation, the future rate of salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. External actuaries are used for measuring the gross liabilities. Even modest changes to the actuarial assumptions may result in significant changes in the pension liability.
Plan assets that are used only to meet the obligations are set off against the gross liability. Assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators and comprise cash, securities, properties, etc. Where there is not an active market for the assets, the fair value is estimated. The less liquid the assets, the greater the uncertainty related to the measurement. The composition of the assets can be found in note 19.
Provisions for abandoment When establishing oil and gas production facilities, provisions are made for the cost of the disposal of the facilities and re-establishment of the sea bed according to the rules which apply to the individual concession areas. The assumptions for the provisions are reassessed annually. A significant part of the liability is not realised until after 20-30 years and consequently the calculation of the liability, including the assumptions applied, is associated with significant uncertainty.
The most significant assumptions are:
· The useful economic life of the field and thereby the time of abandonment (which partly depends on the future oil price) · Cost level at the time of abandonment · Discount rate
Provisions for legal disputes etc. The management's estimate of the provisions in connection with legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. Due to the nature of legal disputes, the outcome of these is subject to considerable uncertainty.
Other provisions The amount comprises inter alia estimated provisions for onerous contracts, guarantee obligations and provisions for incurred, but not yet reported incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the USA.
Judgement of accounting control To a certain extent, the classification of entities partly owned by other enterprises, and thereby how the entities are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements, is based on a judgement of the formal and actual conditions and clauses in shareholders' agreements etc.

19 Pensions and similar obligations

Group annual report 2011 103

As employer, the Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which the Group operates. As a main rule, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprises' share of the obligation is not available.

Expected return on assets is determined based on the risk-free interest rate of government bonds plus a premium corresponding to the longterm risk profile for each asset category. The risk premium has been fixed at 4.0% (3.5%) above the risk-free interest rate for shares, 1.5% (1.3%) for corporate bonds and 2.5% (2.0%) for real estate. Return on cash and bank balances is fixed based on the three-month spot rate.

Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, some entities in the Group participate together with other enterprises in defined benefit pension and health insurance schemes for current and retired employees (multi-employer plans). In 2011, the Group's contribution is estimated at DKK 572m (DKK 596m). The contributions to be paid in 2012 are expected to be DKK 690m.
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. The Group's share might be significant. Deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Based on the most recent available financial data from the plans' trustees, the plan assets totalled DKK 41.5bn (DKK 36.1bn) and the actuarial value of obligations approximately DKK 53.7bn (DKK 52.8bn). Net obligations in the plans with deficits totalled DKK 13.8bn (DKK 17.7bn). In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

23 Financial risks

Group annual report 2011 110

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's Business Units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2011.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2011. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rate.
Currency risk The Group's currency risk arises due to income from shipping and oil-related activities are denominated mainly in USD, while the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including land-based container activities, Terminal activities and Retail activities, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
· Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; · Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed, is estimated to have a positive impact on the Group's profit before tax by DKK 0.1bn (DKK 0.7bn) and the Group's equity, excluding tax, negatively by DKK 0.9bn (DKK 0.2bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 15 and 22, and are thus not an expression of the Group's total currency risk.

Interest rate risk The Group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as DKK, EUR and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.0 years (2.6 years). A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by DKK 407m (DKK 73m). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be negative by DKK 160m (DKK 64m).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

1 Liquidity buffers are defined as cash and bank balances, securities and undrawn committed revolving facilities.
Based on the liquidity reserve, the size of the committed loan facilities, including loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory. The Group's long term objective is to maintain a conservative funding profile, matching that of a strong investment grade company over the business cycle, with a strong liquidity position in order to withstand fluctuations in the economy, and have the strength to exploit new and attractive investment opportunities.
The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about five years).

It is of great importance for the Group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Group's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Group's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

If the acquisitions during the year had occurred 1 January 2011, the Group's revenue and profit would not have been materially different.
The accounting for the business combinations is considered provisional at 31 December 2011 as some analyses are still ongoing.
Poti Sea Port Corp. On 14 May 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Poti Sea Port Corp., which owns and operates the Black Sea port of Poti, Georgia. The acquisition is in line with the Group's strategy, which aims for APM Terminals to be the leading global port operator. Eastern Europe is a fast growing container activity region with a high forecasted growth.
The total acquisition cost was DKK 1,073m including a contingent consideration of DKK 151m. The contingent consideration is dependent on the future financial and operational performance of the company and is estimated to range between DKK 27m and DKK 310m (undiscounted).
From the acquisition date to 31 December 2011, Poti Sea Port Corp. contributed with revenue of DKK 149m and a profit of DKK 21m.
SK do Brasil Ltda. On 21 July 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in SK do Brasil Ltda., which owns shares in three offshore oil licenses in Brazil. The acquisition is in line with the Group's strategy, which aims for Maersk Oil to stabilise production by 2014 and thereafter gradually grow to reach a stable production level at 400,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day.
From the acquisition date to 31 December 2011, SK do Brasil Ltda. contributed with revenue of DKK 550m and a profit of DKK 41m.

NTS International Transport Services Co. Ltd. On 18 August 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in the China based airfreight forwarder NTS International Transport Services Co. Ltd. The acquisition strengthened Damco's market position providing the required platform to accelerate growth in global airfreight services.
The total acquisition cost was DKK 726m including a contingent consideration of DKK 157m. The contingent consideration is dependent on the future financial and operational performance of the company and is estimated to range between DKK 90m and DKK 280m (undiscounted).
Current assets include trade receivables with a fair value of DKK 292m. The gross amount due under the contracts is not materially different from the fair value.
The goodwill of DKK 399m is attributable to synergies between Damco's customer base and NTS International Transport Services Co. Ltd.'s airfreight services and is not deductible for tax purposes.
From the acquisition date to 31 December 2011, NTS International Transport Services Co. Ltd. contributed with revenue of DKK 636m and a profit of DKK 4m.
Acquisition completed after 31 December 2011 On 4 January 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Skandia Container Terminal AB, which operates the port of Gothenburg, Sweden. The acquisition will strengthen APM Terminals' position in Scandinavia. The total acquisition cost was DKK 1.3bn and is primarily related to terminal rights. The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete due to the recent closing date and limited availability of detailed financial information at this point in time.

Except for customary agreements within the Group's activities, no material agreements have been entered into that will take effect, change or expire upon changes of the control over the Company.
The necessary facility of DKK 2,183m (DKK 2,066m) corresponding to USD 380m (USD 368m) has been established in order to meet the requirements for trading in the USA under the American Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Certificate of Financial Responsibility).

30 New financial reporting requirements
Changes in accounting policies The International Accounting Standards Board has issued a number of changes to financial reporting standards and interpretations which come into effect for the 2011 financial year. None of these are of significance to the accounting policies applied by the Group.
Changes in coming years The Group expects to implement the following new standards when they become mandatory in 2015 (IFRS 9) and 2013 (others):
· F inancial instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will be issued in phases to gradually replace IAS 39. So far, the changes cover the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The principles for impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting are currently being drawn up.
The Group's current practice of classifying and recognising gains and losses in the income statement and other comprehensive income can be retained under IFRS 9.
· C onsolidation IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is based on the principle in IAS 27 that control is a precondition for the consolidation of an entity. The concept of control is expanded upon and there are guidelines on how to determine control in cases where an assessment is required. Among other things, the standard states, that an entity can have de-facto control over another entity even if it does not control the majority of the shares or votes.
The Group expects IFRS 10 to have limited impact.
· J ointly controlled entities IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 and removes the choice of method for preparing the financial statements of jointly controlled entities. Going forward it must be assessed whether the contracting parties have rights to assets and liabilities in the jointly controlled entity (joint operations) or if they have rights to the net assets in the arrangement (joint ventures) based on both the formal and substantive conditions.
Under the new standard, joint operations will continue to be recognised proportionately, whereas the Group's share of net assets in joint ventures will be recognised according to the equity method, equivalent to the accounting treatment of associates.
The Group's jointly controlled entities are mainly found in Oil and gas activities as well as Terminal activities. It is expected that the majority of arrangements in Oil and gas activities will be classed as joint operations, while arrangements in other segments will mainly be classified as joint ventures. The assessment of the contract conditions is complex and will have an impact on the Group's revenue and costs, as well as the total of assets and liabilities, but will not affect profit or equity. Please see note 29 for information on jointly controlled entities as they are included in the Group's financial statements for 2011.
· O ther changes IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities contains new requirements for information about interests in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement contains a definition of fair value and comprehensive guidelines on its application; these replace the guidelines found in the individual financial reporting standards. The standard means new disclosure requirements but does not change the Group's accounting policies.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits has been revised in terms of the accounting of and disclosure on defined benefit pension plans. The revised rules change the calculation of the period's interest cost for the net obligation with no material impact on the Group's profit.
IAS 1 means a change in the presentation of items in other comprehensive income.
Some of the above changes have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The standards endorsed by the EU with a later effective date than the corresponding effective date from the IASB are pre-implemented and thus comply with the IASB's effective date.
