Stronger together.
Sugar, Starch and Fruit: It is thanks to the very diversity of our products' applications in industry that the combination of these three pillars has proved a solid and stable base for our company. Together, the three business segments not only generate synergies in production and marketing, but also create long-term growth potential independent
of segmental market fluctuations.

Sugar

672.6 

million

Revenue of the Sugar segment declined by 8.0% from the year before, to  672.6 million. Sugar sales prices, especially for product sold to the sugar-using industry and to food retailers, were significantly lower than in the prior year, but growth was achieved in sales volumes of quota sugar, particularly to the food industry. While exports to countries outside the EU decreased, sales of non-quota sugar to the chemical industry were held almost at the year-earlier level.

Fruit

1,083.4 

million

The Fruit segment successfully defied the tough market conditions prevailing in its fruit juice concentrates business in the 2015|16 financial year. Sales revenue of the segment grew by 2.0% to  1,083.4 million. Sales quantities of fruit preparations were up slightly from the previous year and, coupled with an increase in sales prices, led to revenue growth of about 8% in this division of the Fruit segment. The fruit juice concentrates division, on the other hand, saw a revenue reduction of 18% as a result of a sharp decline in selling prices for apple juice concentrate from the 2014 crop.

Starch

721.6 

million

The Starch segment delivered a robust topline performance. At  721.6 million, revenue even slightly exceeded that of the prior financial year. The areas of revenue growth included the bioethanol business, which benefited from higher selling prices, and the sector of wet starch derivatives, where sales volumes rose. By-products generated slightly less revenue than in the prior year as a result of lower raw material prices, and sales reductions in saccharification products reflected the lasting low prices in a difficult European sugar market.

Supplying what makes industries run.
Our versatile Starch segment impresses with its outstanding product diversity, its high degree of value added and its wide range of applications. We supply a large number of very different industries, and the product portfolio of the Starch segment could not be more varied: Food ingredients, infant formula, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, feedstuffs and fertilisers, technical applications in the paper, textile and construction materials industries, and climatefriendly bioethanol for blending into petrol. Added to this is our leading position in organic and GMO-free starches.

Diversity and unity.
We are proud of the vast number of uses our products find in everyday life: The range
extends from sugar for foods, to starch for textiles and other non-food applications,
to fruit preparations for yoghurts and fruit juice concentrates. Taken together, AGRANA's products are indispensable both in commercial and in private daily life.

Bringing variety to life.
Our sugar forms the basis of a wealth of products for industrial customers and also for consumers, who daily use items containing AGRANA sugar: from baked goods and confectionery, to non-alcoholic beverages and processed-fruit products, all the way to pharmaceuticals. The countryspecific "Wiener Zucker" brand alone offers more than 30 different sugar products, with the organic range also steadily growing. Additionally, thanks to the complete utilisation of raw materials, AGRANA fields an extensive product offering of feedstuffs and fertilisers.

Producing excellent quality worldwide.
In the Fruit segment we serve customers in 70 countries, and our fruit preparations division, to name just one, has production operations at 24 sites around the globe. Our high-quality fruit raw materials are internationally purchased and processed for the global food industry. AGRANA fruit products enhance yoghurts, ice-creams, toppings and cereals, natural and regular juices (apple and berry juices), nectars, syrups, tea beverages and energy and near-water drinks.

Succeeding together.
With the growing competition in the marketplace, collaboration along the whole value chain is an important success factor. Cooperation to us means not only cultivating the team spirit among our approximately 8,600 employees1 on six continents but also fostering close and constructive relationships with our partners. Together with our crop growers and our customers, it is through an intensive exchange on matters of substance that we master the
challenges of our time.

Harvesting together.
Together with our approximately 10,000 contract growers of agricultural raw materials, we are able to achieve remarkable things. Even in difficult growing conditions, our farmers produce and deliver high-quality crops that we buy on a guaranteed basis and then process and market optimally, thus generating value for all members of the entire supply chain.

1 Average number of employees (by headcount) in the 2015|16 financial year.

In the field together.
Our established global network of agricultural advisors ensures that we remain in personal touch with our contract growers. Discussion forums with top management as well stimulate an active exchange of ideas with suppliers, especially beet and potato growers. This dialogue encourages trust and understanding, ultimately letting us develop solutions together to meet the challenges that may exist.

United in thinking of tomorrow.
Economic success is what drives us, but our responsibility to society as a whole is a constant guiding principle in our work. Through respect for people
and the environment at all our sites worldwide, we thus create a shared culture of care that also honours the needs of future generations.
Taking sustainable action.
At AGRANA we strive not only to completely utilise all our agricultural raw materials and to ensure all our production processes are as eco-friendly and energy-saving as we can make them, but also to advance sustainable production conditions in the upstream supply chain. For instance, in the farm sustainability self-assessment using the criteria of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI), one-half of our contract-based European beet growers and Austrian potato growers achieved gold status and the other half attained silver standing.
Leading energy efficiency.
In autumn 2015 at our sugar factory in Kaposvár, Hungary, a plant was installed which upgrades biogas (produced from spent beet pulp and other residues) into biomethane and feeds it into the local natural gas network. As a result, the Hungarian facility will in the next few years become the first sugar factory in Europe to achieve energy self-sufficiency (on a net basis, taken over the whole financial year).

Letter from the CEO

AGRANA at a glance 12

"Acting together" ­ the motto of our annual report reflects the winning combination of our three business segments that again proved itself in the completed 2015|16 financial year, enabling AGRANA, despite the challenges in the Sugar segment, to achieve a moderately improved operating profit (EBIT).
Sugar segment performed its absolute best in current demanding circumstances 2015|16 was another year of difficult conditions in the sugar market. Sales prices that were low all year (but did not fall further after the 2015 campaign) weighed on revenue and especially earnings in our Sugar segment. The fact that we are not having to report a loss in this segment is an accomplishment in itself. Our rationalisation measures, such as cost reductions in overheads, gained traction as quickly as our investment in yield enhancement (through chromatography), in by-product extraction (of betaine) and in energy efficiency.
The swings in the world market price for sugar and the fierce battle for EU market positions in the run-up to the sugar regime's expiration at the end of September 2017 will remain dominant drivers for our Sugar business. But: we have prepared well for the market liberalisation, already command a strong presence in the deficit markets, and have deep expertise in sugar and glucose production based on decades of experience. Our continuing goal is to expand our market share in Central and Eastern Europe. The negative impacts of the sugar market reform, such as the testing of the economic lower price limits, are already a reality, while the advantages ­ such as the elimination of production caps and export restrictions ­ will only make themselves felt from the end of 2017.
Acting together: stronger profits in Starch and Fruit We are currently benefiting more than ever from our diversification into three pillars, which led to a respectable consolidated earnings result for the Group. Starch and Fruit profits made up for the Sugar segment in 2015|16. In fact, the Starch segment delivered an all-time record operating profit, buoyed not just by its product diversity in food and non-food starches but also by ethanol prices. The Fruit segment held its operating profit steady at the prior year's level, with the fruit preparations division also attaining its best result yet, while the fruit juice concentrates business came in well below expectations due in part to the low apple juice concentrate prices from the 2014 crop.
Specialties strategy and higher refining intensity A lasting low oil price, the slowdown of the global economy with weaker growth in transition countries like China and Brazil, significant falls in commodity prices: Even, and especially, in this environment, AGRANA is strategically well positioned ­ with competition driven purely by raw material purchasing prices and product sale prices, our specialties strategy stands us in good stead. We will continue to focus on this approach in the future. In the Starch segment in particular, we have enormous manufacturing flexibility and can offer a very broad product portfolio thanks to a mix of available grades (organic, GMO-free, clean label), different input species and varieties (yellow corn, waxy corn, wheat, potatoes), a range of technologies (extrusion, drum drying, spray drying, slurry processes) and chemical and physical modifications. Our products' GMO-free nature and our organics capabilities are a competitive advantage that we increasingly leverage worldwide, including in the USA, where GMO-free starch specialties are in growing demand. We are also using a specialties strategy to counter the commoditisation trend in the fruit juice concentrate business. In the Sugar segment too, we will expand our unique selling propositions in our region in terms of the brands and breadth of the sugar product range and of managing regional brandname products.

Supervisory Board's report

AGRANA at a glance 14

In the 2015|16 financial year as in the prior years, the Supervisory Board actively oversaw and supported AGRANA's performance and exercised its responsibilities and powers under the law and the Articles of Association while observing the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In a total of four meetings, of which all its members attended at least half, the Supervisory Board, through the reports of the Management Board and detailed written material, informed itself about the company's business situation and financial position and about all relevant matters concerning the business performance and exceptional business transactions. The Management Board briefed the Supervisory Board in a timely and comprehensive manner on measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board.
Top agenda items of discussions Regular key agenda items of the Supervisory Board's deliberations were the strategic orientation and further development of the Group, the business trend in all segments and the optimisation of corporate financing. Outside the regular meetings as well, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board had numerous conversations with the Management Board, especially with the Chief Executive Officer, to discuss ongoing developments in the Group's environment, their impact on current business results, and the risk situation.
In its meeting on 12 May 2015 the Supervisory Board dealt with the audit of the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2015, the nomination of the independent auditor for election for the 2015|16 financial year, and the medium-term investment planning. The independent auditor attended this meeting and reported on the audit priorities and results, which also included the accounting-related elements of the internal control system. The Supervisory Board adopted the parent company financial statements and approved the consolidated financial statements. In its meeting on 3 July 2015, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the medium-term planning. The meeting on 30 November 2015 discussed the forecast financial results for 2015|16 and the subjects of corporate governance, strategic equity investment and capital expenditure projects. In its meeting on 25 February 2016, the Supervisory Board deliberated on the financial planning and the capital investment projects for the 2016|17 financial year. The Supervisory Board also attended to the self-evaluation under the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee convened for two meetings in the 2015|16 financial year. With the independent auditor in attendance, the Audit Committee dealt exhaustively with the 2014|15 parent company and consolidated financial statements of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG and discussed the Management Board's proposal for the appropriation of profit. The Committee's deliberations also covered the audit of the corporate governance report and dealt with the report from Internal Audit and with the risk management system. The Audit Committee likewise worked on the planning and priorities for the audit of the 2015|16 financial statements and discussed the subjects of anti-corruption and compliance.
The Committee chairman reported to the Supervisory Board in detail on the work of the Committee.

Parent company and consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements, group management report, parent company financial statements and parent company management report of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG ("AGRANA") for the 2015|16 financial year presented by the Management Board, as well as the accounting records, were audited by and received an unqualified audit opinion from KPMG Austria GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Vienna, the independent auditor appointed by the Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board endorses the result of this audit.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the parent company annual financial statements and reported to the Supervisory Board in the presence of the independent auditor. The Supervisory Board has reviewed the consolidated financial statements, group management report, parent company financial statements and parent company management report (including the corporate governance report) of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG for the 2015|16 financial year as well as the Management Board's proposal for the appropriation of profit. The final results of all of these reviews did not give rise to any reservations.
The Supervisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements for the 2015|16 financial year prepared by the Management Board, which are thus adopted for the purposes of section 96 (4) Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board endorses the group management report and parent company management report for the 2015|16 financial year and is in agreement with the proposal for the appropriation of profit.
The Supervisory Board extends its sincere appreciation and thanks to the Management Board and all employees for their commitment and accomplishments in the year.

Corporate governance report

AGRANA at a glance 18

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is a public limited company (a stock corporation) under Austrian law and is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Corporate governance at AGRANA is based on Austrian stock corporation law and capital market law, the regulations on employee co-determination, the Articles of Association and the terms of reference (the charters) of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. In addition, the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (the Code), which can be found on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance at www.corporate-governance.at, provides the framework for the direction and oversight of the company with the aim of high transparency for all stakeholders.
The Code consists of binding so-called L rules (these are based on legal requirements); of C rules (comply-or-explain rules), which are expected to be adhered to, with deviations to be explained in order to achieve compliance with the Code; and of R rules (recommendations), non-compliance with which requires neither disclosure nor explanation.
Commitment to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance
AGRANA is committed to the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In the 2015|16 financial year, AGRANA applied the Code in the version of January 2015. At its meetings on 30 November 2015 and 25 February 2016, the Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of compliance with the Code.
In the 2015|16 financial year, AGRANA adhered to all C rules of the Code except as explained below:
 Rule 27 (Management Board compensation criteria) The existing employment contracts of the Management Board members do not tie variable compensation to non-financial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts. Setting ceilings on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unfore seeable developments and to honour special achievements. A retroactive change to existing contracts does not appear justified.
 Rule 27a (severance pay) In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act. The Management Board contracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay.
The approach in respect of rules 27 and 27a was adopted by the Supervisory Board and implemented by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in the contracts of the Management Board members.
 Rule 49 (contracts requiring approval) Under section 95 (5) (12) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the approval of the Supervisory Board is required for contracts with members of the Supervisory Board by which members undertake, outside their role on the Supervisory Board, to provide a service to the Company or a subsidiary for a material consideration. This also applies to contracts with companies in which a Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest. For business policy and competition reasons, the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the Annual Report as stipulated in rule 49. This divergence was adopted by the Supervisory Board at the time of the initial commitment to the Code of Corporate Governance in 2005.

Supervisory Board independence The Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG applies the guidelines for the definition of supervisory board independence as set out in Annex 1 to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance:
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past five years, have been a member of the Management Board or other management staff of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not have a business relationship, of a size significant to him or her, with the company or a subsidiary of the company, and shall not have had such a business relationship in the past year. This also applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member holds a significant economic interest, but does not apply to board positions held within the Group.
 The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board under L rule 48 does not automatically imply a member's designation as non-independent.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past three years, have been an external auditor of the Company or a partner or employee of the external auditing firm.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a management board member of another company in which a member of the Company's Management Board is a supervisory board member.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not serve on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a strategic shareholding in the Company or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a close relative (direct descendant, spouse, common-law spouse, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, nephew or niece) of a Management Board member or of persons holding any of the positions referred to in the foregoing points.

Committees and their members Where the importance or specialist nature of a particular subject matter makes it appropriate, the Supervisory Board also exercises its advisory and supervisory functions through the following three committees:
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee deals with the legal relationships between the Company and the members of the Management Board. The Committee is responsible for succession planning in respect of the Management Board and approves the compensation schemes for the Management Board members. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee held no meetings in the 2015|16 financial year.
The Strategy Committee prepares strategic decisions of the Supervisory Board by providing decision support, and makes decisions in urgent matters. The Strategy Committee held no meetings in the 2015|16 financial year.

Corporate governance report 23

The Audit Committee prepares for transaction by the Supervisory Board all matters related to

·

the Company's separate financial statements and to the auditing of the accounting records and of

·

the consolidated financial statements and Group management report, including the corporate

·

governance report. It monitors the effectiveness of the internal control system, audit system and

·

risk management system and verifies the independence and qualifications of the external auditors.

·

In the 2015|16 financial year the Audit Committee met twice. Its meetings focused particularly

2·3

on the audit of the 2014|15 financial statements, the preparation of the audit of the 2015|16 finan-

·

cial statements, and the supervision of the risk management system. The Audit Committee also

·

dealt with the compliance report and with the report of the Group's Internal Audit function.

·

The Supervisory Board terms of reference include the procedures for the committees; an excerpt

of the terms of reference is available on the AGRANA website at www.agrana.com/en.

·

·

Supervisory Board committees consist of the Supervisory Board Chairman or a Vice-Chairman,

·

and of as many other members as the Supervisory Board shall determine. The only exception is

·

the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which consists of the Supervisory Board Chairman

·

and two members appointed from among the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual

·

General Meeting. If the Supervisory Board has two Vice-Chairmen, they shall be appointed as

·

these two other members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

The fixed compensation of the Management Board members remained unchanged compared to the prior year.
Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board under the Company's plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. For the Management Board members Johann Marihart, Fritz Gattermayer and former member Walter Grausam, the following applies: The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme (ASVG5) are met. In the event of retirement before the age determined under the ASVG, the amount of the pension is reduced. The pension amount is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assessment base. For the pension of Stephan Büttner, there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached 55 years of age provided that the employment relationship has ended. For the 2015|16 financial year, pension fund contributions of  720 thousand were paid (prior year:  2,955 thousand).
The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund. In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act (see note on rule 27a) or the Occupational Pension Plan Act (BMSVG6). In the balance sheet at 29 February 2016, within the item "retirement and termination benefit obligations", an amount of  6,646 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year:  8,058 thousand) and an amount of  1,986 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year:  1,906 thousand).
No compensation agreements in the event of a public tender offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.
AGRANA maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage for management staff. This D&O insurance covers certain personal liability risks of the individuals acting as legal representatives of the AGRANA Group. The cost is borne by AGRANA.

Compliance

·

For AGRANA, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is integral to good corporate

·

governance.

·

AGRANA has a dedicated compliance office led by the chief compliance officer, who since 1 January

2015 reports directly to the Management Board member responsible (the Group Chief Financial Officer Stephan Büttner) and centrally looks after the compliance activities. In July 2015 the CFOs

·

of the segments and subsidiaries were designated as compliance officers. This rolled out the

·

compliance organisation Group-wide to make it even more effective. The most important respon-

·

sibilities of the chief compliance officer are the further expansion of the compliance management system in the AGRANA Group by producing and training internal guidelines, providing support

· ·

in compliance matters, documenting cases of non-compliance and issuing recommendations. In addition, a Compliance Board was created, consisting of the heads of the Internal Audit, Human

· ·

Resources and Legal departments and Corporate Secretariat and the chief compliance officer. The

·

Compliance Board has its own terms of reference. It deliberates on an ongoing basis on funda-

mental questions in matters of compliance.

AGRANA at a glance 26
AGRANA's compliance management system comprises the following core elements and policies:
The AGRANA Code of Conduct forms the foundation of all business actions and decisions. The Code of Conduct is designed to give a clear and systematic understanding of the conduct which AGRANA expects from all employees, managers and directors in all activities and locations of the Group. Together with the mission statement, it guides the entire AGRANA Group, setting unambiguous standards of integrity, correct business conduct and ethical principles. The Code of Conduct has been translated into all languages relevant to the Group.
Anticorruption laws apply worldwide and must be obeyed everywhere and at all times. In view of Austria's specific anti-corruption legislation, AGRANA has issued a separate Austria Anti-Corruption Policy, complementing the Code of Conduct. This policy sets out binding regulations and a reporting system. The policy aims to ensure legally compliant conduct and to facilitate the proper handling of invitations and gifts. Additionally, to accommodate Austrian laws, a separate Tax Policy was created that governs the handling of tax processes.
The purpose of the globally applicable Antitrust Compliance Policy is to ensure that all employees and board members know and abide by the essential provisions of competition and antitrust law and have the awareness to recognise situations with antitrust relevance. The overarching aim of this policy is to preserve employees from violating antitrust legislation and to provide practical, real-world support in applying the relevant rules. The policy has been translated into all languages relevant for the Group.
For AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as a publicly traded company, it is highly important to adhere to stock exchange and capital market laws and regulations, particularly the Stock Exchange Act and the Issuer Compliance Regulation of the Financial Market Authority. Based on these pieces of legislation, AGRANA has issued its Capital Market Compliance Policy. It sets out the principles governing the disclosure of information and prescribes organisational measures for safeguarding confidentiality and preventing improper use or transmission of insider information.
The purpose of the AGRANA compliance management system is to ensure the fulfilment of the corporate leadership's organisational and supervisory obligations under the law and to minimise the liability risks for the AGRANA Group, its employees and board members.
In 2015|16, frequent trainings in Austria continued to be delivered for a defined group of employees on Austria-specific anticorruption and tax policy, on competition and antitrust law and capital market compliance. All identified employees in Austria were or have been trained. New staff members are continually being trained soon after hiring. In the international subsidiaries, the training of all relevant compliance policies for the defined group of employees was begun in 2015 and is to be completed in the course of 2016.
In addition to the physical classroom trainings, AGRANA now also plans to provide electronic distance training on the Code of Conduct, anticorruption, and competition and antitrust law. The trainings are being produced and delivered together with an external provider and are to be rolled out during the 2016|17 financial year in Austria and then worldwide.

Corporate governance report 27

The Internal Audit department verifies compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies. In

·

the 2015|16 financial year it audited 14 of the 50 AGRANA production sites (i.e., 28% of sites) falling

·

within the GRI reporting boundaries (see the section "Organisational structure" from page 41),

·

including audits for corruption and fraud in selected subject areas; one of the 14 audits covered

·

all production sites in this regard. No significant breaches of legal norms or of AGRANA's internal

·

regulations regarding anticorruption were found.

2·7

·

·

Promoting equity for women

·

Equality of opportunity in the workplace and equal treatment of employees without regard to

gender are principles enshrined in the AGRANA Code of Conduct.

·

·

AGRANA is convinced that, especially for women, achieving harmony between work and family

·

life is still commonly a significant challenge. To help remedy this, AGRANA offers its staff in Vienna

·

a company day-care centre, as well as a childcare service for days when schools close locally for

·

a day and on long-weekend days falling between a public holiday and the weekend. In July 2015,

·

in the second year of an initiative organised and financially supported by AGRANA, employees

·

at the sugar plant in Tulln, Austria, were able to take advantage of a week of care for their children

·

aged three to ten during the summer holidays. Trained educators from Hilfswerk (a non-profit

·

that is one of the country's largest providers of childcare) taught and looked after the children in

·

an age-differentiated programme of excursions and workshops.

·

·

In spring 2016 AGRANA joined the Austrian "Business for Family" network. This network was

launched by the Federal Ministry for Family and Youth to bring together companies and commu-

nities interested or already engaged in family-conscious personnel and municipal policies. The

·

network's platform and associated events are a place for dialogue, inspiration and sharing

·

of information. In connection with becoming a network partner, AGRANA has decided to adopt

·

additional measures improving the compatibility of work and family.

AGRANA's strategy

AGRANA at a glance 30

As an Austrian industrial group with an international focus, AGRANA's Sugar and Starch segments operate mainly in Europe and the operations of its Fruit segment are global. In these markets, AGRANA seeks or already commands a leading position in the industrial processing of agricultural raw materials. The Group pursues a growth strategy oriented to the respective local market opportunities. Long-lasting, stable customer and supplier relationships, respectful treatment of all stakeholders and continual growth in the company's value are major cornerstones of the corporate strategy, which is guided by the principles of sustainable management. AGRANA's aim is to provide both its globally operating and its regional customers worldwide with high product quality, optimum service and innovative product development ideas and expertise.
AGRANA controls and manages the product value chain from the purchase of agricultural raw materials to the production of the resulting intermediate goods for industrial customers (and end products for consumers in the case of the Sugar segment). AGRANA utilises the Group's strategic know-how across segment boundaries. This is especially true for agricultural grower contract management and raw material procurement, the knowledge of customer requirements and markets, the opportunities for the development of inter-segment products, and synergies in logistics, purchasing, sales and finance. The cross-segment application of these competencies forms the basis for a robust market position in relation to competitors in all product groups, and underpins AGRANA's innovative strength and lean cost position.
In its business operations, AGRANA seeks to make the part of the value chain that it has influence over as sustainable as possible. By sustainability, in this context, AGRANA primarily means the following three aspects, which apply to all business segments:
 Utilisation of almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed, and use of low-emission technologies to minimise impacts on the environment
 Respect for all stakeholders and communities where the Group operates  Working together in long-term partnerships

In the equity market, the 2015 calendar year was defined by exceptionally large price swings, reflecting the environment of political and economic uncertainty. Nonetheless, despite the multiplicity of market-moving events and the price volatility intra-year, the overall net change in global share prices from the end of 2014 to the end of 2015 was minimal. The Vienna Stock Exchange had a good start to 2015. A number of positive factors ­ such as companies' favourable earnings reports, the improved economic situation in Europe overall, the pick-up in export opportunities (thanks to the weaker euro), the expansionary monetary policy of the ECB and the temporary easing of the Ukraine-Russia conflict ­ allowed Vienna's benchmark index, the ATX, to rise about 25% to 2,681.44 points by the middle of May. By the end of the third quarter, global drivers (economic fears, the Greece crisis, and Chinese market turmoil) had caused the index to give back most of its earlier gains. However, thanks to a solid performance in the fourth quarter, the ATX advanced by a significant 11.0% overall in the 2015 calendar year.
AGRANA (ISIN code: AT0000603709) started the 2015|16 financial year at a share price of  80.51. The Vienna stock market environment described above and the challenging market setting for sugar manufacturers led to a volatile share price performance. From quotations around  80 in July, the share price fell to its low for the year of  73.00 towards the end of August. However, by the end of December the price rallied steadily, reaching the year's high of  90.50 before finding a level around  80 near the end of the financial year. The average trading volume on the Vienna Stock Exchange was approximately 1,400 shares per day (based on double counting, as published by the VSE). The closing price of AGRANA's shares at the balance sheet date of  80.50 was essentially unchanged from the opening price at the start of the financial year. The performance of the ATX index was a decline of 13.66% over the same period.
The market capitalisation at 29 February 2016, with an unchanged 14,202,040 shares outstanding, was  1,143.3 million (prior year:  1,143.4 million).
AGRANA is listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and is also quoted in the VÖNIX, the Austrian Sustainability Index. This equity index comprises those exchangetraded Austrian companies which are leading in social and environmental performance.

Group management report 36

AGRANA is a globally operating processor of agricultural raw materials, with its Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments manufacturing high-quality foods and many intermediate products for the downstream food industry as well as for non-food applications. With about 8,500 employees (in FTE1) at 53 production sites on six continents, the Group generated revenue of about  2.5 billion in the 2015|16 financial year.
AGRANA was established in 1988 and has been quoted on the Vienna Stock Exchange since 1991.

Business segments and sourcing models
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA processes sugar beet from contract growers and also refines raw sugar purchased worldwide. The products are sold into downstream industries for use in, for example, sweets, non-alcoholic beverages and pharmaceutical applications. Under country-specific sugar consumer brands, AGRANA also markets a wide range of sugars and sugar specialty products to consumers through food retailers. In addition, in the interest of the most complete possible utilisation of its agricultural raw materials, AGRANA produces a large number of fertilisers and animal feedstuffs. These not only help the economic bottom line but also ecologically close the material cycle by returning minerals and other nutrients to the land and the food chain.

Group management report 42

Supplier assessment for human rights, labour practices and environmental aspects In view of its core business of processing agricultural raw materials and of the associated high procurement volumes and costs, AGRANA limits its reporting scope for these aspects to suppliers of agricultural raw materials and intermediate goods (such as frozen fruit pieces).
Biodiversity AGRANA as a processor of agricultural raw materials is dependent on the availability of these inputs and thus on the functioning of local ecosystems. For this reason, biodiversity is an important element of sustainability for AGRANA, especially in its upstream value chain in the farming landscape. In this annual report, AGRANA to the extent possible publishes biodiversity aspects of raw material procurement from contract growers in the respective business segment's report.
Energy consumption and emissions AGRANA processes organic inputs such as sugar beet, grain, potatoes and fruit whose crop volume, sugar or starch content and quality are subject to annual fluctuation as a result of changing influences during the growing season and harvest. Product quantities at each site, along with the associated energy consumption, thus vary from one reporting season to the next. Presenting absolute totals for energy consumption and emissions would therefore not be meaningful.
AGRANA consequently only reports energy intensity and emission intensity per tonne of product manufactured (core and by-products), by business segment. Reductions achieved as a result of energy efficiency improvement and of emission-cutting measures are reported on an absolute basis and on a percentage basis per tonne of product.
AGRANA's reporting of energy use and emissions is confined to its own production operations and, respectively, to Scope 1 and Scope 2. The reasons are the very limited availability of data for Scope 3, and also that Scope 3 sources are in some cases (such as business travel) negligible compared to the large contributions which the production operations make to the carbon footprint through their energy consumption and emissions.

Water and effluent (wastewater) AGRANA reports water and wastewater figures solely for its core business, the processing of agricultural raw materials in its production plants. Data on water use in the upstream value chain (i.e., in the production of agricultural raw materials) are not sufficiently complete or reliable for all raw materials used worldwide and are therefore not reported.
Water ­ perhaps the planet's most important resource ­ is one of many inputs in the production processes of the AGRANA Group. The use and discharge of water at all sites follows sustainable practices. In its processes, AGRANA frequently utilises the water contained in the agricultural raw materials.
Thus, much of the water required by a sugar factory is obtained from the beet itself. Sugar beet has a water content of about 75%, which must be separated from the sugar during the manufacturing process. This water is used both to leach the sugar out of the cossettes (the sliced beet) and to transport and clean the beet. The used water is continually cleaned and returned to the process cycle. Much the same is true in fruit juice concentrate production from apples, which contain about 86% water.
Waste Agricultural raw materials are far too valuable for AGRANA not to utilise them to the fullest. The Groupwide principle of complete utilisation is practiced by producing both a wide range of high-quality foods and intermediate products for downstream industries and ­ particularly in the Sugar and Starch segments ­ manufacturing a very broad portfolio of by-products, especially feedstuffs and fertilisers. These not only contribute significantly to the economic bottom line but also close nature's material cycle by returning minerals and other nutrients to the land and the food chain.
In some countries, the by-product feeds and fertilisers marketed (or in some cases given away free) by AGRANA must be reported as waste for regulatory reporting purposes, solely for reason of the local regulatory regimes. Beginning with the 2015|16 reporting period, AGRANA no longer reports these as waste in the annual report, as they are directly used as valuable feedstuffs or fertilisers in animal husbandry or crop cultivation.

Group revenue in the 2015|16 financial year was  2,477.6 million, or very slightly below the level

of the prior year. A decrease in Sugar segment revenue to  672.6 million or by 8.0% was the

result of the lower sales prices. Revenue in both the Starch segment ( 721.6 million, up 3.1%) and

Operating profit (EBIT), at  129.0 million, grew moderately (by 6.0%) from the prior-year level. While EBIT in the Starch segment, at  65.9 million, rose substantially by 21.8%, the lower revenue in the sugar business led to markedly weaker (but positive) EBIT in the Sugar segment of  4.3 million, a decrease of 52.2%. In the Fruit segment, EBIT was steady (at  58.8 million, up 0.3%) despite a significant reduction in fruit juice concentrate earnings. Details on the share of results of equity-accounted joint ventures and on exceptional items can be found in the segment reports and the consolidated financial statements.

Net financial items in the 2015|16 financial year amounted to a net expense of  24.5 million (prior year: net expense of  5.2 million); the significant negative year-on-year change was attributable to net currency translation losses that represented a negative change of  21.3 million from the prior year's translation gains. The translation losses were caused primarily by depreciation in the currencies of Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico and Russia. Net interest expense, meanwhile, improved by  1.8 million thanks to a further decline in interest rates and the optimised use of existing liquid assets.

Operating cash flow before changes in working capital rose moderately from the prior year, to  225.9 million in 2015|16. After a significant increase of  73.7 million in working capital (prior year: decrease of  52.0 million) and a higher income tax expense, net cash from operating activities amounted to  101.9 million (prior year:  227.1 million). Net cash used in investing activities was  19.9 million (prior year: net cash use of  84.2 million) as higher payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles were offset by proceeds from non-current financial assets. Net cash used in financing activities of  163.6 million (prior year: net cash use of  81.1 million) reflected both the payment of the dividend for the 2014|15 financial year and the repayment of borrowings to Südzucker AG. Free cash flow declined by about 43% year-on-year.

In the 2015|16 financial year, revenue in the Sugar segment decreased by 8.0% year-on-year to  672.6 million. While sugar sales prices especially with the sugar-using industry and with resellers (food wholesalers and retailers) were down significantly from the prior year, growth was achieved in the sales quantities of quota sugar, particularly with the food industry. Sales volumes of non-quota sugar with the chemical industry were nearly at the year-earlier level, while exports to non-EU countries were down significantly. Revenue from by-products receded slightly for price reasons. The Sugar segment accounted for 27.2% of Group revenue (prior year: 29.3%).
As expected, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), at  4.3 million, also fell year-on-year (from  9.0 million). The key negative driver was the significant decline in sugar selling prices compared with the prior year. In the first six months of the prior year, higher prices were still being received from the 2013|14 campaign. The EBIT improvement in the last six months of the 2015|16 financial year was attributable primarily to the year-on-year drop in the cost of raw sugar and to the additional contribution margin from the higher sales volume.
Further details on the results in the Sugar business are given in the segment report from page 50.

Revenue in the Starch segment in 2015|16 was  721.6 million, up slightly by 3.1% from the previous year. Among other areas, the revenue growth was achieved in the bioethanol business, which benefited from higher selling prices, and in wet starch derivatives, thanks to higher sales volumes. Decreased revenue from saccharification products reflected the persistent low prices in the European sugar market. By-products brought in slightly less revenue than in the prior year, as a result of lower raw material prices. The Starch segment generated 29.1% of the Group's revenue (prior year: 28.1%).

Financial results 49

EBIT of  65.9 million significantly surpassed the year-earlier result, by 21.8%. Besides price-driven

·

margin growth (notably in ethanol) and higher sales volumes, this increase was explained by

·

lower raw material and energy prices. Profitability in terms of EBIT margin rose from 7.7% to 9.1%.

·

The earnings decrease at HUNGRANA, the equity-accounted subsidiary, was a result of the lower

·

sales prices for saccharification products.

Fruit segment revenue rose by 2.0% in the 2015|16 financial year to  1,083.4 million. In the fruit

·

preparations division, revenue expanded by about 8%, reflecting both sales volume that rose

·

slightly from one year earlier, and higher sales prices that were amplified by favourable currency

·

effects (mostly from the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Korean won and Egyptian pound). In the fruit

·

juice concentrates division, on the other hand, revenue declined by about 18% as a result mainly

·

of sharply lower selling prices for apple juice concentrate from the 2014 crop. The Fruit segment

·

was responsible for 43.7% of Group revenue (prior year: 42.6%).

·

EBIT in the Fruit segment was  58.8 million and thus steady at the year-earlier level. While

·

the fruit preparations division showed a significant improvement in EBIT, the lower apple prices

·

of the 2014 campaign and the associated considerable decline in concentrate prices negatively

affected margins in the fruit juice concentrate activities. In fruit preparations, a significantly

positive business trend was felt particularly in Europe, North and Latin America, Asia/Australia

and Middle East/North Africa, while currencies that strengthened against the euro (most notably

·

the US dollar, Korean won and Chinese yuan) also contributed to the gain in EBIT. The net

·

exceptional items expense of  3.1 million was related primarily to the restructuring project

·

of Dirafrost FFI N.V., Herk-de-Stad, Belgium; however, most of the project's one-time costs had

·

already been recognised in the 2014|15 consolidated financial statements.

Total sales quantities of sugar products rose compared to the prior year, with differences between markets. While the volume of retail quota sugar eased slightly, there was a clear increase in quota sugar sold into the food and beverage industry, especially in Hungary and Romania. The quantity of non-quota sugar sold to the chemical industry was held at the prior-year level, while sales of the same commodity outside the EU fell by about 38%.
Operating profit was negatively affected mainly by significantly lower prices. Particularly the quota sugar prices for sales to the downstream food industry declined considerably, and selling prices achieved with food resellers were also down. The price erosion was noticeable in all countries and outweighed the beneficial effect of easing raw material costs especially for raw sugar.
The result of the AGRANA-STUDEN group, which is included in the consolidated financial statements by the equity method of accounting, improved amid the low world market prices for raw and white sugar and the good utilisation of the refinery in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and thus was a positive influence in the Sugar segment's EBIT.

Group management report 52

In the completed SMY 2014|15, amid record yields throughout Europe, the EU sugar quota was fully utilised and the production of non-quota sugar was very high. Given the limits on the sale of non-quota sugar, large quan tities were carried over to SMY 2015|16. Due to dramatically reduced sugar prices in the EU, preferential imports in the last sugar marketing year remained well below the previous year. The quota sugar stocks at the end of SMY 2014|15 were therefore down significantly.
In October 2015 the European Commission (EC) released the first tranche, or 650,000 tonnes, of the export allowance of European non-quota sugar. At the end of January 2016 the EC also released the second tranche of export licences, for 700,000 tonnes. The total represents the export limit of 1.35 million tonnes set by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Customers in industry and resellers Sugar sales volume with industrial customers and resellers showed a positive overall trend in AGRANA's geographic territory. Through a widening of the customer base and intensified collaboration with key accounts, the quantities sold to industry were boosted by about 10%. In the reseller market segment, with the rising purchasing power in the Eastern European countries, there is not only growth in consumption in general but also rising demand for specialities. To continue to maintain and where possible expand its strong market position going forward, AGRANA's goal here is to intensify its existing brand strategy and the specialties marketing and strengthen the local brands. Especially in Eastern Europe, demand for sugar specialties is likely to rise in the long term. Demand for organic products in the Sugar segment was steady.

EU sugar policy After the coming expiration on 30 September 2017 of the sugar and isoglucose quotas and the minimum beet price, the new regime for the intra-EU market ­ besides an unchanged reference price of  404 per tonne for white sugar ­ provides for the possibility of governmentfunded private storage, and contracts between beet growers and the sugar industry will remain mandatory. As a consequence of the market liberalisation, the volume and price volatility in the world market will feed through to the EU sugar market more strongly than before.
The tariff protection of the EU sugar market for imports from non-EU countries is not affected by the change in the sugar regime. AGRANA also believes that, after the quotas are abolished, sugar exports will no longer be subject to volume limits in the future, as the absence of quotas and of a minimum beet price will remove any (regulatory) basis for the WTO export limit.
Sugar exports In 2013, negotiations began between the EU and the USA towards a free trade agreement (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP) aimed at extensive market liberalisation.
Only about 10% of trade goods are currently classified as "sensitive products" that are either to be covered by special derogations or to be completely excluded. Sugar and sugar-containing products are to be discussed in the final rounds of the TTIP talks.
In the TTIP, the question of rules of origin has particular importance for the sugar sector, as the USA is subject to duty-free, quota-free sugar imports from Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

balance in the five AGRANA beet-growing countries, from May to December 2015, about 630 questionnaires voluntarily completed by sugar beet suppliers were analysed. The response rates ranged from 7% to 34% depending on the country.
While the legal requirements for growing and contractgrowing of sugar beet in Austria, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary correspond to SAI bronze status, the voluntary disclosure provided by the individual farms showed an even better sustainability landscape: Both in Austria and Hungary, 50% or more of respondent farms attained gold standing and the other farms achieved silver status. The performance was even higher in the Czech Republic, where about two-thirds of growers reached gold status and one-third were rated as silver; the opposite ratio applied in Romania and Slovakia. Gold and silver ratings mean that the participants are using additional sustainable management practices above and beyond adherence to EU and national legislation.
Beginning with the Austrian farmers, an internal veri fication process was developed based on stratified random sampling of these self-assessments (stratified by several farm attributes), and the actual auditing began in early 2016. This is to ensure that the questions were correctly understood, and gives the growers an opportunity to provide feedback on the content and process of the self-assessment. The resulting insights are then used both for refining the SAI system and in the continual improvement of the individual farms. For the 2016 crop year AGRANA seeks to expand the voluntary participation by contract growers.
Building awareness of good agricultural practice In the 2015|16 financial year AGRANA continued to invest heavily in awareness-building for good farming practices, through initiatives like the on-going "Mont Blanc" project, through the Group's annual BETAEXPO event for contract growers, and through agricultural advisors.
"Mont Blanc" is an efficiency programme in place since 2012|13 that aims to boost sugar yield per hectare by up to 20% by 2017; it supports sustainability efforts through the resource-saving use of farm inputs for the benefit of farmers, environment and society. The keynote theme of the programme in 2015, the International Year of the Soil, was soil fertility. At 62 demonstration farms across the entire growing region, visiting growers were able to

glean new ideas on subjects such as soil cultivation systems. Growers' ability to identify and exploit room for improvement in their practices is aided by a judicious selection of demonstration fields, field tours during the growing period and numerous field trials whose results were systematically summarised and made available to all participants.
Under the motto "Sustainable Supply in Future", the 15th BETAEXPO was held in June 2015, dedicated to communicating good agricultural practices particularly to AGRANA contract growers. On the approximately 700 demonstration plots of the twelve-hectare BETA EXPO grounds next to the sugar factory in Tulln, Austria, about 3,500 visitors were able to view actual plantings of the AGRANA contract crops and innovations like the AGRANA catch-crop mix that won recognition under the 2014 Raiffeisen Climate Protection Challenge.
In connection with BETAEXPO, the first annual "AGRANA Sustainability Award" was presented to selected contract farmers with especially sustainable farming practices, including growers of sugar beet and organic sugar beet, in order to reinforce all suppliers' awareness of the importance of sustainable management along the entire value chain (also see the "Sustainability" section on page 72).
Biodiversity in the upstream value chain AGRANA's network of agricultural advisors is instrumental in the Group's long-standing close partnership with its contract growers. In 2015|16 the advisory programme again included seminars for interested farmers on environmentally sound and biodiversity-enhancing farm management. These events are also credited for the purpose of the Austrian Agri-Environmental Programme and were fully booked.
In the 2015|16 financial year, no fewer than 3,000 hectares were already "greened" with the catch-crop mix from Österreichische Rübensamenzucht GmbH, a not-for-profit subsidiary of AGRANA Zucker GmbH that makes GMO-free seed available to the contract farmers. It loosens the soil structure, mobilises nutrients, activates soil fauna and improves field biodiversity. What is more, the flowering fields provide ideal forage for wild animals, offer honey plants for bees, and add to the aesthetic dimension of the landscape.

Water use and discharge in processing The water required by a sugar factory is partly obtained from the beet itself. Sugar beet has a water content of roughly 75%, which must be separated from the sugar during the manufacturing process. This water is used both to leach the sugar out of the cossettes (the sliced beet) and to transport and clean the beet. The water is continually cleaned and returned to the process cycle.

The reduction of about 5.6% in average specific water consumption per tonne of product (core and byproducts) was attributable largely to more conscious water utilisation at the facilities in Kaposvár, Hungary, and Leopoldsdorf, Austria. The average specific amount of water discharge, by contrast, remained unchanged from the prior year. In-plant or municipal wastewater treatment plants at all sites ensure the environmentally responsible treatment of the effluent in compliance with local government requirements. When the cleaned wastewater is discharged into the receiving water, it thus meets the applicable environmental standards.

Waste from processing The absolute amount of waste in the Sugar segment eased by about 1.8% from the prior year, while the average specific amount of waste per tonne of product (core and by-products) increased from 64 kg to 75 kg as a result of the lower product output in the year under review.

The Starch segment, through AGRANA Stärke GmbH, includes the three Austrian plants in Aschach (corn starch), Gmünd (potato starch) and Pischelsdorf (integrated wheat starch and bioethanol plants). The company also manages and coordinates the international starch and bioethanol holdings in Hungary and Romania. Since the beginning of the 2014|15 financial year, the consolidated financial statements use the equity method to account for the joint ventures of the HUNGRANA group (which make starch and saccharification products, bioethanol, and by-products).

In the Starch segment, revenue rose by 3.1% in the 2015|16 financial year. The principal reason was the significant increase in ethanol prices from the prior year, with the resulting higher ethanol revenue. Another upside factor was that more of the manufacturing capacity for starch products per se was used to make higher-margin modified products. In the year, the pursuit of the specialties strategy also brought significant revenue growth in infant formula and organic products, thanks both to volume gains and stronger sales prices. The lasting low sugar prices in Europe weighed also on selling prices of saccharification products, and revenue in this product category thus did not reach the prior-year level despite higher volumes. By-product revenue was down slightly from one year earlier as a result of low grain and soy prices.
The trajectory of raw material prices was once again volatile in 2015|16, affected particularly by weather conditions. While prolonged drought in the summer led to significant crop failures locally for autumn crops such as corn and potatoes, and thus to temporarily higher prices, savings in raw material costs were realised overall relative to the prior year. Energy costs too declined in the year under review, mostly for price reasons. Ultimately, next to the improved cost situation, it was mainly the already mentioned higher sales prices (of bioethanol) and greater sales volumes that drove an increase in profitability for the Starch segment.

Raw materials and production
World grain production in the 2015|16 grain marketing year (1 July to 30 June) is estimated by the International Grains Council1 at about 2 billion tonnes, which is slightly below the prior year but still above the expected consumption. Global wheat production is forecast at 732 million tonnes (prior year: 728 million tonnes), compared to expected use of 719 million tonnes. The world's corn production is projected at 969 million tonnes (prior year: 1,016 million tonnes), versus expected consumption of 971 million tonnes. In view of the good wheat harvest, global total grain stocks are forecast to increase by about 16 million tonnes from the prior year to 465 million tonnes.
Tracking the more favourable supply trend especially for wheat, the grain quotations eased in the course of the year (for wheat) or remained steady (corn). On 29 February 2016 on the NYSE Euronext Liffe commodity derivatives exchange in Paris, both corn and wheat quoted at about  147 per tonne (prior year:  148 per tonne for corn and  185 for wheat).
Potatoes In the 2015 campaign the Austrian starch plant in Gmünd, over a period of 104 days (prior year: 122 days), for weather reasons processed significantly less starch potatoes than in the previous year, despite unchanged contract volume. The average yield per hectare was approximately 26 tonnes (prior year: 40 tonnes) and the average starch content was 17.3% as in the prior year. The organic portion of this amounted to approximately 4% (prior year: about 3%), measured by input volume. For the 2016 campaign year (crop year), AGRANA plans

a starch potato contract volume at the prior-year level, which at average yields should translate into a higher processing volume. In potatoes for the food industry, the amount processed into long-life potato products was comparable to that of the prior year, with an organic share of about 26% (prior year: about 21%).
Corn and wheat The total corn processing volume of the AGRANA starch plants in Austria and Romania in 2015|16 was down slightly year-on-year as a result of a weather-induced reduction in wet-corn processing. Within this total, the share of specialty corn processed (waxy corn, organic corn, and certified non-GMO corn) increased by about 31% from the year before.
At the wheat starch factory in Pischelsdorf, Austria, in 2015|16 the amount of raw materials used grew by 14% from the prior year, and for the first time, some of the wheat starch was made from certified organic wheat.
At the Pischelsdorf bioethanol plant, the processing of corn, wheat and triticale was somewhat below the prior-year level. Of the 2015 crop, about 50,700 tonnes of ethanol wheat and triticale were secured in advance through delivery contracts with growers. For the 2016 crop as well, cultivation contracts for ethanol grains were again offered.
In Hungary, at the equity-accounted joint venture HUNGRANA, total corn processing in 2015|16 increased moderately at an absolute level above 1 million tonnes (stated at 100% of the total). The wet-corn processing was completed at the end of November 2015 with a volume significantly less than in the previous year.

Energy use and emissions in processing The average specific direct energy consumption per tonne of product (both core and by-products) in the Starch segment eased by about 2.2% in the 2015|16 reporting period compared to one year earlier. An important reason for this was the reduction in natural gas use in Pischelsdorf, Austria, as a greater proportion of district heating was used in the energy mix.
However, the average specific indirect energy consumption per tonne of product in the Starch segment rose by about 8.3% from the prior year, driven primarily by the change in energy mix in Pischelsdorf and by an increased average refining intensity at the site in Aschach, Austria.
On balance, the average specific emissions per tonne of product from direct and indirect energy consumption were thus reduced by about 5.6% year-on-year (see chart on page 63).
At the three Austrian starch manufacturing sites of Aschach, Gmünd and Pischelsdorf, an energy management system was introduced in autumn 2014 and certified under ISO 50001. Aiming for continual improvement, the Starch segment is targeting site-specific efficiency gains amounting to a cumulative reduction of 50 GWh of energy use by 2020|21 through efficiencyboosting projects in individual sections of the plants. In the 2015|16 financial year about 5 GWh of this reduction target was achieved through several projects, such as an improvement in the distillation plant in Pischelsdorf.

Water use and discharge in processing At the AGRANA starch plants, true to the Group's environmental policy, water use and effluent are managed sustainably. Process water in the starch operations as well is repeatedly cleaned and reused in cycles. An example is the integrated bioethanol and wheat starch production complex in Pischelsdorf, Austria. Since the wheat starch plant began operation, the bioethanol plant generally does not require any external fresh water to be fed in, as its water needs for mashing are met with steam condensate and with slurry from the starch factory.

The average specific water consumption in the Starch segment per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the 2015|16 financial year was approximately 11.7% less than one year earlier, attributable mainly to the installation of a system for water recovery from starch slurry in Pischelsdorf, Austria. The reduction of about 11.6% in average specific water discharge resulted from factors including the lower amounts of precipitation and the short campaign duration in Gmünd, Austria.

Revenue in the fruit preparations division grew by about 8% as a result of higher sales prices that were amplified by favourable currency effects (largely from the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Korean won and Egyptian pound) and of a sales volume increase of approximately 4%. Geographically, the revenue growth was driven mainly by North America and Asia/Australia, while sales quantities were up in all AGRANA regions except North America.
In a noteworthy accomplishment, in the EU ­ the most important region in revenue terms ­ AGRANA succeeded in selling higher volumes despite the market contraction. A good product portfolio mix helped to grow revenue especially in France. Sales quantities in North America were in line with the prior year, but volumes in the ice-cream segment were expanded. The popularity of Greek yoghurt continues to offer good growth opportunities. In the Eastern Europe region the picture was heterogeneous: While sales volumes in Russia increased, those in Ukraine were down from a year ago. In Latin America more fruit preparations were sold than last year; the biggest driver here was Mexico, while the economic situation in Brazil detracted from the sales trend.
Analysed by customer segment, the dairy industry was one of several sectors responsible for revenue and volume growth. The diversification into more fruit preparations for the food service, bakery and ice-cream industries also continued to be a focus and volumes and revenue in these segments rose.

The exchange rate movement between the euro and the US dollar raised the cost of tropical fruits and of non-fruit ingredients sourced worldwide, such as pectin.
Currency risks in purchasing that could be neutralised only by local raw material management also existed in countries with high inflation, including in Russia, Ukraine and Latin America.
In the fruit juice concentrates division, available supplies of apples in the foremost European processing regions (Poland and Hungary) were lower than in the year before. The dry spring and summer months led to considerable increases in raw material prices at the beginning of the apple processing season and lasting until into November. Towards the end of the financial year, however, raw material prices resumed a downward trend. The capacity utilisation of the European fruit juice concentrate plants in the 2015 campaign was average. In China the production season by and large unfolded as planned, in line with the prior year.
The berry processing season was on the whole marked by good available volumes of the principal fruits. The prices for the most important raw materials (strawberry, sour cherry and black currant, though not raspberry) were higher than in the previous year.
Engagement in the upstream value chain In the 2015|16 financial year the Fruit segment as well worked on the implementation of the AGRANA principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products.
A goal of the fruit preparations business and its Vienna-based purchasing organisation, AGRANA Fruit Services GmbH (AFS), for the 2015|16 financial year was to document the certification status of its suppliers of fruits and intermediate products to defined sustainability standards. In the year under review, 12.4% of the raw materials procured by AFS had a sustainability certification; most of these were certified organic or under the Rainforest Alliance (RFA) and another customer standard of industry-wide relevance. However, these standards have not yet been benchmarked to those of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative's Farm Sustainability Assessment; the raw material sourcing in the fruit preparations division can thus not yet be mapped to a Group-wide reference framework. Additionally, on customer request, AFS has the capability to procure approximately a further 13.6% of raw materials in certified sustainable form. As all procurement in the fruit preparations division is done to customer specifications, the future trend in the amount of certified raw material volumes will depend on these customer requirements.
In the sourcing from contract growers in Mexico and Fiji, the fruit preparations business continued the successful work to raise social and environmental standards in the supply chain.
A project running since August 2013 (with support from an Austrian government programme for development assistance) for the certification of strawberry and blackberry suppliers in Jacona, Michoacán, Mexico, to the Rainforest Alliance standard was continued in the 2015|16 financial year. The certified strawberry cultivation area was expanded by about 72% and new areas were certified for soursop (a tropical fruit also known as graviola or guanabana) and raspberry. At the annual RFA awards in Mexico, AGRANA together with its fruit suppliers won recognition for its training and advisory measures as the company with the best performance in the first certification audit. "Aneberries", the Mexican berry exporters association, presented the AGRANA project at its annual conference as an example of best practice.

Energy use and emissions in processing The reported average specific direct energy consumption per tonne of product (both core and by-products) in the Fruit segment declined by about 3.8% in 2015|16 compared to the prior year (see chart on page 67). This resulted above all from the reduction in the natural gas share of the energy mix in the fruit juice concentrate operations in favour of greater use of steam and electricity. The average specific indirect energy consumption in the Fruit segment remained almost constant at the year-earlier level. Average specific emissions fromdirect and indirect energy use per tonne of product in the Fruit segment therefore decreased by about 3.1% from the prior year, in step with the lower energy consumption.
Water use and discharge in processing The decrease of about 2.9% year-on-year in average specific water consumption, and of about 5.5% in water discharge, per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the Fruit segment was driven primarily by the installation of treatment systems for the reuse of the water in the process cycle in the fruit juice concentrate activities.

AGRANA's understanding of sustainability
AGRANA as an industrial processor of agricultural raw materials defines sustainability in its business activities as a harmonious balance of economic, environmental and social responsibility. This understanding of sustainability is summed up by three sustainability principles, which serve management and all employees as a practical and intuitive guide to daily sustainable action:
At AGRANA we:  Utilise almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed and use low-emission
technologies to minimise impacts on the environment  Respect all our stakeholders and the communities where we operate  Engage in long-term partnerships with suppliers and customers
AGRANA's sustainability activities in 2015|16
The activities concerning sustainability are grouped into the following issues along the value chain:  Environmental and social criteria in the procurement of agricultural raw materials and
intermediate products  Environmental and energy aspects of AGRANA's production  Working conditions and human rights in respect of AGRANA employees  Product responsibility and sustainable products  Compliance and business conduct  Social engagement
In the 2015|16 financial year as in the previous years, AGRANA did intensive work on the further integration of sustainability aspects into operational business processes. Important steps in this regard included, for instance, the implementation of AGRANA's principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products, and the continuing execution of the Group's energy strategy. AGRANA also maintained the ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders and was again active in various sustainability-related industry initiatives.
Economic footprint of the AGRANA Group
In the sustainability realm, for AGRANA as an energy-intensive industrial company, the ecological aspect of its business operations has been a focus for many years. Besides this, the Group also considered working conditions (both internally and in the supply chain) and compliance aspects. Additionally, in the 2015|16 financial year the Group's contributions to the economy in terms of value added and employment were studied more closely for the first time.

Methodology Based on the business data for 2014|15, when AGRANA's Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments gener ated revenue of about  2.5 billion in 25 countries with approximately 8,700 employees worldwide, the Economica Institute of Economic Research calculated the gross value-added impacts and employment effects emanating from AGRANA's activities.
The study methodology is based on an input-output analysis. Using a worldwide input-output table in which AGRANA was individually modelled in the form of a satellite account, the input-output model describes the delivery and procurement relationships which link AGRANA to all production sectors of an economy, portrays the company's contribution of value added to the economy and shows the flows of individual goods (inputs) into and through AGRANA's production into its outputs and their uses. This makes it possible to quantify not only the direct impact of the Group's business activities on the macroeconomy but also their multiplier effect.

Group management report 72

In spring 2015, to facilitate farmers' use of the SAI's Farm Sustainability Assessment (a self-evaluation by the farmers), the FSA questionnaire was made available on AGRANA's web-based raw material information system to sugar beet contract growers in Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Throughout Austria this was also done for potato growers, while the self-assessment data for Romania and Hungary were at this first stage collected using a paper form.
Preliminary results of the voluntary supplier self-assessment In total in the five countries where beets and potatoes are grown for AGRANA, 838 completed FSA questionnaires were analysed in the period from May to December; in 2015 AGRANA thus conducted the largest SAI survey yet by any company. The response rates ranged from 7% to 34% depending on the country.
The results were highly gratifying: Nationally in Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic, 50% or more of the growers achieved gold status and the others reached silver standing. Both in Slovakia and Romania, the share of farms at a gold level of performance was about onethird, while the other growers attained silver status. Gold and silver ratings mean that the participants are using additional sustainable management practices above and beyond adherence to EU and national legislation.
For the Austrian farmers, an internal verification process for these self-assessments has already been developed and the auditing of the disclosures in the FSA questionnaires began in early 2016. This is to ensure that the questions were correctly understood and answered, and gives farmers an opportunity to provide feedback on the content and process of the self-assessment. The resulting insights are then used both for refining the SAI system and in the continual improvement of the individual farms.
BETAEXPO ­ Austria's largest demonstration field for AGRANA raw material crops The BETAEXPO in June 2015, under the motto of "Sustainable Supply in Future" and in its 15th year, again served to disseminate good agricultural practices, notably to current and prospective AGRANA contract farmers. On the approximately 700 demonstration plots of the twelve-hectare BETAEXPO grounds located next to the sugar factory in Tulln, Austria, about 3,500 visitors were

able to view actual plantings of the AGRANA contract crops ­ sugar beet, potato and grains ­ and innovations like the AGRANA catch-crop mix that won recognition under the 2014 Raiffeisen Climate Protection Challenge.
Given the growing importance which sustainable agricultural practice in AGRANA's supply chain has for customers' purchasing decisions, AGRANA invited its customers in downstream industries to visit this anniversary edition of BETAEXPO. Customers thus for the first time had the opportunity to gain a first-hand impression of the sustainability measures implemented by AGRANA and its contract growers. In a panel discussion, high-profile customers in the beverage and food industry presented their own sustainability strategies and expectations for their suppliers.
On the day before BETAEXPO, the first annual "AGRANA Sustainability Award" was presented to selected contract farmers with especially sustainable farming practices in the categories of sugar beet, organic sugar beet, potato and corn, in an effort to reinforce all suppliers' awareness of the importance of sustainable management along the entire value chain. For the 2016|17 financial year the target group for the award is to be expanded to include corporate suppliers, such as dealers and service providers.
Objectives for environmentally and socially responsible procurement In its Sugar and Starch segments, AGRANA's goal for the 2016|17 financial year is to continue the rollout of the SAI farm self-assessment (FSA) for environmental and social sustainability criteria together with its contract suppliers of sugar beet and potatoes in all countries of cultivation covered by the Group's tracking system, and thus to increase the number of farms participating in the FSA. The fruit juice concentrate division of the Fruit segment will also bring the SAI's FSA into play in its direct purchasing of crops from growers. At the same time, work on verification systems continues both internally and as a member of the SAI.
As one of its activities to support biodiversity in the supply chain in 2016|17, and consistent with the Group's natural affinity for honey-bee conservation, AGRANA plans to place ten beehives at each of its Austrian production sites and at the Group's headquarters in Vienna. These will be regularly tended by a beekeeper and are expected to yield about 200 kilograms of honey per site.

exceptionally long and therefore positive. In the case of open questions (such as "What else would you like to tell us?"), the opportunity was used to offer praise and, in some cases, also critical remarks.
The findings of the survey were presented to the individual sales organisations in workshops and specific action plans were developed together to optimise customer relationships. While most customer responses were very positive, there were also subject areas with room for improvement. These varied by region and were related partly to individual activities for the specific customers and partly to points such as improving the accessibility of staff in inside and outside sales, enhancing the provision of documents to customers, and the broad issue-set of sustainability.
Thus, internal training events on sustainable operations were held for sales staff to familiarise them with all aspects of AGRANA's sustainability activities. Digital and analogue documents are to support sales representatives in conveying to their customers not only the quality, service and price aspects of AGRANA's offering but also its sustainability engagement. The global survey is to be repeated in 2016|17 in order to measure and evaluate progress.

Trade show exhibits To present the company, deepen relationships with existing customers and win new ones, the AGRANA business segments jointly and individually exhibited at numerous trade shows in 2015|16, including food fairs, such as Biofach (in Nuremberg, Germany), ANUGA (Cologne, Germany), Gulfood Manufacturing (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), and FI Europe (Paris, France). The wide range of animal feedstuffs was presented at the agricultural trade shows, among them the Rieder Messe fair (Ried im Innkreis, Austria) and Inter-Agrar (Wieselburg, Austria). The Starch segment exhibited at the international "in-cosmetics" series of trade fairs (Barcelona, Spain, São Paulo, Brazil, and Bangkok, Thailand), at SCS Formulate (Coventry, United Kingdom) and at technology exhibitions like the European Coatings Show (Nuremberg, Germany). Individual AGRANA sites also had a presence at regional shows.
For the 2016|17 financial year, AGRANA will also participate for the first time in trade fairs in the promising new markets of Algeria (Djaz AGRO in Algiers) and Iran (Iran Food + Hospitality in Tehran) and, in another first, will exhibit in the USA (NYSCC Suppliers Day in New Jersey).

Group management report 76

Operating in a highly competitive market environment, it is vital for AGRANA to set market trends and differentiate itself from the competition through product innovations. In close partnership with customers, AGRANA's research and development (R&D) teams are always working on new recipes, specialty products and innovative applications for existing products, true to the Group's strategic focus on lasting, sustainable success.

The AGRANA Research & Innovation Center (ARIC) in Tulln, Austria, is the Group's central research and development institute for the starch, bioethanol, sugar and fruit businesses. ARIC, as a separate company in the AGRANA Group, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. The aim of the institute is to develop new applications for innovative products made from potato, corn, waxy corn, wheat and sugar beet. The company is active nationally and internationally as an in-house R&D service provider for sugar technology, food technology, starch and bioethanol technology, microbiology, biotechnology, as well as fruit preparations product development. Moreover, the AGRANA research center also offers its specialist R&D know-how to third parties and acts as a state-accredited laboratory for bioethanol analytics and sugar beet quality control.

This "clustering" and collaboration of R&D specialists from different segments (Sugar, Starch and Fruit) under one roof not only drives administrative synergies but also promotes creative exchange between different groups of researchers. The complementarity between the groups' experience is particularly valuable in cross-segment areas of research, such as nutrition physiology, thickeners and aromas, microbiology, product quality and safety, and organic products. In this way, the growing number of projects involving more than one AGRANA business segment can be carried out much more simply and efficiently.

Sugar segment
A project aimed at the potential reduction of primary energy costs was launched in connection with the expanded molasses desugaring plant at the sugar factory in Tulln, Austria. The plant operates by chromatographically (without the use of chemicals) separating molasses into a sugar-rich fraction, a betaine-rich one and a fraction high in ash and colour compounds. While there are excellent utilisation opportunities for the first two fractions, the existing uses of the latter residue, which still contains a significant proportion of sugar, can be diversified beyond the current options of feedstuff or fertiliser use.
A cooperative project with the Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology (ACIB GmbH), supported by the COMET programme of Austria's Research Promotion Agency (Österreichische Forschungs förderungsgesellschaft mbH), is studying the fermentative utilisation of the remaining sugar in this molasses residue. The researchers are using a two-stage process in which the residual sugar is digested by microorganisms to produce hydrogen and methane. The goal is to build a two-stage pilot plant in the molasses desugaring facility in Tulln for studying the process over a longer time period. If the concept proves viable and an industrial-scale version is installed, approximately 30% of the primary energy requirement of the molasses desugaring plant could be met from the methane produced on-site.

Fruit segment
A priority in 2015|16 was the consolidation of the individual projects concerned with continual quality improvement in the entire value chain for the production and marketing of fruit preparations. The innovation strategy employed involves the implementation of market-oriented projects which have the common goal of protecting the natural texture of the fruit pieces and preserving the fruit's particular aromas and colours.
In R&D for raw material procurement, substantial progress was made in microbiological characterisation. Efforts were also begun to further improve the micro biological standards through new methods for treating the fruit raw materials.
To raise productivity and profitability in fruit preparations manufacturing, special drying technologies are being developed and introduced. Different ways of using these technologies are being tested with the aim of enhancing fruit preparations quality.
Through the optimisation of process parameters and plant design in collaboration with universities, AGRANA is seeking significant improvements in the organoleptic (sensory) properties of fruit preparations.
In the ice-cream area, the focus is on the development of market-centred product innovations.

In the year, AUSTRIA JUICE further expanded the beverage bases business by winning additional customers and developing new products. The company successfully continued the development of its own production of composite aromas to support the growth segment of beverage bases and build up the aromas business. Particular attention was directed to opening up new market areas such as shandies (beer-based mixed drinks) and fruit-wine-based beverages. Other projects were initiated to improve the utilisation and marketing of process by-products and expand the product range, as well as to enhance and optimise process and product safety of juice concentrates in microbial terms.
Technological innovations in aroma analytics ("electronic noses") were added to the range of sophisticated aids used in quality assurance and product development.

Variable compensation A major element of AGRANA's personnel strategy is the incentivising and recognition of performance as a contribution to the Group's success. For managerial staff, a Group-wide performance management system, including performance-related pay, is in place to help achieve the company's strategic and operational objectives. In addition to targets related to the corporate financial position and profit, the variable compensation plan also involves personal targets to encourage and honour outstanding individual performance. In the 2015|16 financial year, 7.9% of all employees (prior year: 7.3%) were covered by this incentive-enhanced compensation system.
The personal targets, which for most of the management staff are part of the variable compensation scheme, also include non-financial (i.e., environmental and social) targets where reasonable and practicable.
AGRANA plans to continue to employ a Group-wide performance management system in the future that will place a growing focus especially on individual results and the contribution to corporate performance.
AGRANA HR team recognised with silver BEST RECRUITERS award The human resources team of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is proud to have placed second in the BEST RECRUITERS 2015/16 sector ranking in Austria, ahead of other well-known companies in the food industry, and thus numbering among the top 100 recruiters in the overall ranking.
BEST RECRUITERS is the largest recruiting study in the German-speaking countries. It annually reviews the quality of recruiting practices of the respective top 500

employers in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The study considers 86 criteria in examining the treatment of applicants, the recruiting presence and job advertisements.
The awarding of the silver BEST RECRUITERS mark confirms that AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG attaches great importance to the respectful treatment of potential new employees. In its permanent search for new talent, AGRANA takes this distinction as an incentive to continue to further raise its quality standards in the use of various recruiting methods and in interactions with people, as well as to remain current with the latest recruiting trends.
HR Cockpit In 2015|16, AGRANA designed and implemented an HR information and management tool based on key performance indicators (KPIs). On a monthly basis, this system provides the Management Board and the segment and HR management with the personnel KPIs in graphic and table format for every segment, business area, and region, including commentary highlighting the main movements and trends.
Staff development and training
AGRANA aims for the steady improvement of its employees' knowledge and skills. Besides numerous job skills trainings as well as personal development offerings, intensive programmes for all business segments are also available. These training courses not only heighten the Group's performance but also raise employee motivation.

Health programmes Satisfied, energetic and motivated employees are the backbone of the company. That AGRANA has the health and wellbeing of the Group's people at heart is therefore good for everyone. Under the "AGRANA Fit" programme, a rich range of health services and sports is available at many Group sites. Besides diverse presentations and workshops, the company cafeterias catered to the desire for conscious and healthful nutrition. At the annual Wien Energie Business Run, a total of 177 employees (59 teams) again tested their athletic ability in 2015|16.

Balancing work and family
In July 2015, like in the previous year, AGRANA offered employees at the sugar plant in Tulln, Austria, a week of combined child care and teaching during the summer holidays for their children aged three to ten years. Trained educators from Hilfswerk, a non-profit, looked after the children during an age-specific excursionand-workshop programme which featured trips to a Middle Age castle and a school farm as well as a circus workshop. To help balance the needs of work and family, AGRANA also offers its staff in Vienna a company day-care centre, plus a childcare service for days when schools close locally for a day as well for optional days off taken by employees to bridge between a public holiday and the weekend.
In spring 2016 AGRANA joined the Austrian "Business for Family" network, which was launched by the Federal Ministry for Family and Youth to bring together com panies and communities interested or already engaged in family-conscious personnel and municipal policies. The network's platform and associated events are a place for dialog, inspiration and sharing of information. In connection with becoming a network partner, AGRANA has decided to take a number of additional measures in the 2016|17 financial year that will improve the compatibility of work and family.

In the 2015|16 financial year there were no fatal accidents in the workplace at the AGRANA Group4.
In the 2015|16 financial year there were 13 accidents of AGRANA contractors. For organisational reasons, these are not included in the AGRANA workplace safety data such as the injury rate, lost day rate and absentee rate.

1 Injury rate = (total number of accidents5 ÷ total paid hours worked6 × 200,0007 2 Lost day rate = (total number of lost days8 ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 3 Absentee rate = (total number of missed hours due to accident5 and sickness ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 4 Non-permanent (i.e., fixed-term or temporary) and permanent employees within the GRI reporting boundaries
(see from page 41). 5 In AGRANA's workplace safety data, injuries are counted as accidents. Days are counted as lost from the first scheduled
work day missed after the accident (excluding accidents on the way to or from work). 6 Total paid hours worked are defined by AGRANA as contractual work hours plus paid overtime. 7 Explanation of the multiplier 200,000: The multiplier is intended to make the Group's internal workplace safety data
comparable with other companies. It is based on the assumption of 40 work hours per week and 50 work weeks per year, for 100 employees (40×50×100). The effect of the multiplier is thus to convert from a company's average number of accidents, lost days or absentee hours (hours missed as a result of accident or illness) per hour of work done in the company, to an annual number per 100 employees. 8 A work day is assumed to have eight hours.

Risk management
and system of internal control

Risk management 83

The Management Board of the AGRANA Group recognises the importance of active risk manage-

·

ment. The basic aim of risk management at AGRANA is to identify risks and opportunities

·

as early as possible and take appropriate measures to safeguard the profitability and continued

·

existence of the Group.

·

·

The AGRANA Group uses integrated monitoring and reporting systems that permit regular,

·

Group-wide assessment of the risk situation. For the early identification and monitoring of risks

·

relevant to the Group, two mutually complementary control tools are in place:

·

·

 An enterprise-wide, operational planning and reporting system forms the basis for the

monthly reporting to the appropriate decision-makers. Under this reporting process, a sepa-

rate risk report is prepared for the Group and each business segment. Its focus is on the

·

determination of sensitivities to changing market prices for the current and next financial year.

·

The individual risk parameters are assessed on an ongoing basis in relation to the current

·

budget (prepared at the start of the year) or the current forecast (as updated in the course of

·

the year), so as to be able to calculate the impacts on the profit measure "operating profit

·

before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures". Besides these ongoing

·

reports, the business situation and the use of risk mitigation measures is regularly discussed

·

by the risk managers from the business areas directly with the Management Board.

·

·

 The aim of strategic risk management is to identify material individual risks and evaluate

8·3

their implications for the overall profile of risks and opportunities. Twice every year, the

·

medium- to long-term risks in the individual business areas are analysed by a designated risk

·

management team together with the Group's central risk management function. The process

involves risk identification and risk assessment by probability of occurrence and potential

magnitude of risk/opportunity, the definition of early warning indicators and the taking

·

of countermeasures. Also, the aggregate risk position of the AGRANA Group is determined for

·

the current financial year using a Monte Carlo simulation (which is an established standard

·

calculation in risk management). This allows a judgement to be made as to whether a

·

combination or accumulation of individual risks could pose a threat to the ability to continue

·

in business as a going concern. The results are reported to the Management Board and the

·

Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

·

·

Risk management representatives have been designated for the business segments of the

·

AGRANA Group who are responsible for initiating loss-minimising measures as required, subject

to Management Board approval.

·

·

In the 2015|16 financial year, as in the prior year, the independent auditor evaluated the design

and implementation of risk management, in accordance with rule 83 of the Austrian Code

of Corporate Governance, and submitted the findings in a final report on the viability of the

Group-wide risk management. The evaluation used the recommendations of the Committee of

·

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as the reference model against

·

which to compare AGRANA's risk management.

Group management report 84

Risk policy
AGRANA sees the responsible treatment of business opportunities and risks as an essential basis for purposeful, value-driven and sustainable business management. The Group's risk policy seeks to ensure risk-aware behaviour, sets out clearly defined responsibilities and stipulates independent risk control as well as integrated internal controls.
Throughout the Group, risks may be assumed only if they arise from the core business of the AGRANA Group and if it does not make economic sense to avoid, insure or hedge them. The policy is to minimise risks to the extent reasonably possible while achieving an appropriate balance of risks and returns. The assumption of risks outside the operating business is prohibited without exception.
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is responsible for the Groupwide coordination and implementation of risk management arrangements determined by the Management Board. The use of hedging instruments is permitted only to hedge operating business transactions and financing activities, not for speculative purposes. The positions in hedge contracts and their current value are regularly reported to the Management Board.
Significant risks and uncertainties
The AGRANA Group is exposed to risks both from its business operations and from its national and international operating environment. As a globally operating processor of agricultural raw materials, climatic changes and their impacts on the availability of raw materials pose risks for AGRANA. Compliance with sustainable environmental and social criteria in the supply chain is also increasingly gaining significance from a risk perspective. AGRANA seeks to assure this compliance by adhering to defined criteria for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products. With its energy-intensive production activities, particularly in the Sugar and Starch segments, AGRANA is also subject to risks from energy-related and environmental legislation in the various countries. In this context AGRANA has formulated an environmental policy; compliance with the policy is to avoid or minimise risks.

Operational risks
Procurement risks AGRANA is dependent on the availability of sufficient amounts of agricultural raw materials of the necessary quality. Beyond a possible supply shortfall of appropriate raw materials, fluctuation in the prices of these inputs (to the extent that the difference cannot be passed through to customers) also represents a risk. Major drivers of availability, quality and price are weather conditions in the growing regions, the competitive situation, regulatory and legal requirements, and movements in the exchange rates of relevant currencies.
In the Sugar segment, sugar beet and raw sugar are used as raw materials. Besides weather factors, an important determinant of sugar beet availability is how profitable it is for farmers to grow beet rather than other field crops. For the refining facilities in BosniaHerzegovina, Hungary and Romania, the basic driver of AGRANA's profitability is how much value can be added by processing the purchased raw sugar, taking into account the market prices achievable for white sugar. Next to the risk of high raw sugar purchasing prices, another procurement risk lies in the regulations on the import of white and raw sugar into the European Union. The prices for the required raw sugar are hedged with commodity derivatives where financially appro priate. Additionally, exports of non-quota sugar (white sugar) are hedged using commodity derivatives. Hedging is performed in accordance with internal policies and must be reported to the Management Board.
In the Starch segment, sufficient supply contracts are concluded to secure the required quantities of raw materials. When economical, the hedging can also take the form of futures contracts and over-the-counter derivatives, both of which require management approval. The volume and results of these hedges are included in the monthly reporting and are reported to AGRANA's Management Board.
In bioethanol production, when prices change for the grains used as input materials, the selling price of the co-product ActiProt® generally changes in the same direction. This acts as a natural hedge by partly offsetting the grain price movements. However, there remains a residual risk that rising raw material costs cannot be fully passed on to bioethanol customers.

Free trade agreement: The free trade agreements currently being negotiated by the European Union could have economic impacts on AGRANA. The company is following the ongoing trade talks and analysing and evaluating the results.
EU renewable energy directive (2009/28/EC) In September 2015 the EU's adoption of Directive 2015/1513 amended the EU renewable energy directive. In view of the EU target of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), the rules for the contribution from biofuels were modified. By 2020, the share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transport is to represent at least 10% of the final consumption of energy in transport in a given member state. The share from conventional ("first-generation") biofuels was capped at 7%. At the same time, the national governments were requested to transpose this directive into national law by September 2017, including determining the renewable energy mix with which they plan to achieve the reduction targets. AGRANA is following the ongoing developments and analysing and evaluating the results.
Legal risks
AGRANA continually monitors changes in the legal setting relevant to its businesses that may lead to a risk situation, and takes risk management actions as necessary. This applies particularly to compliance matters and antitrust, food and environmental legislation; the Group maintains dedicated staff positions for these areas.
There are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As noted in previous annual reports, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority in 2010 sought a fine under an antitrust case for alleged competitionrestricting arrangements with respect to Austria filed against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany. To date the Cartel Court has not ruled on the case. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.
Financial risks
AGRANA is subject to risks from movements in exchange rates, interest rates and product prices. The financing of the Group is largely provided centrally through the Treasury department, which regularly reports to the Management Board on the movement in and structure of the Group's net debt, on financial risks and the amount and results of the hedging positions taken.
Interest rate risks Interest rate risks arise from fluctuation in the value of fixed interest financial instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates; this is referred to as interest rate price risk. By contrast, floating rate investments or borrowings are subject to minimal price risk, as their interest rate is adjusted to market rates very frequently. However, the fluctuation in market interest rates entails risk as to the amounts of future interest payments; this is referred to as interest rate cash flow risk. AGRANA strives to employ interest rate hedging instruments that match the amount and maturity of debt financing. In accordance with IFRS 7, the existing interest rate risks are determined by calculating Cash-Flow-at-Risk and the modified duration and are presented in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Currency risks Currency risks arise mainly from the purchase and sale of goods in foreign currencies and from financing in non-local currencies. For AGRANA, the principal relevant exchange rates are those between the euro and the US dollar, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Ukrainian hryvnia, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan.

System of internal control and of risk management1
The Management Board of AGRANA is responsible for the establishment and design of an internal control system and risk management system in respect of both the accounting process and of compliance with the relevant legal requirements.
The internal control system, standardised Group-wide accounting rules and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) assure both the uniformity of accounting and the reliability of the financial reporting and externally published financial statements.
Most Group companies use SAP as the primary ERP2 system. All AGRANA companies send the data from their separate financial statements to the central SAP consolidation module. This ensures that the reporting system operates on the basis of uniform data. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group Accounting department. The department is responsible for ensuring the correct and complete transfer of financial data from Group companies, for carrying out the financial statement consolidation, performing analytical processing of the data and preparing financial reports. On a monthly basis the Controlling and Group Accounting departments validate and assure the congruence between the internal and external reporting.
The primary control tool for AGRANA's management is the enterprise-wide, uniform planning and reporting system. The system comprises a medium-term plan with a planning horizon of five years, budget planning for the next financial year, monthly reporting including a separate monthly risk report, and, three times per year, a projection for the current financial year that incorporates the significant financial developments. In the event of material changes in the planning assumptions, this system is supplemented with ad-hoc forecasts.
The monthly financial reporting produced by Controlling portrays the performance of all Group companies. The contents of this report are standardised across the

Group and include detailed sales data, the balance sheet, income statement and the financials derived from them, as well as an analysis of significant variances. This monthly report also includes a dedicated risk report both for each business segment and the whole AGRANA Group, calculating the risk potential for the current and next financial year for the key profitability factors, based on the assumption of current market prices for not yet contractually secured volumes versus budgeted prices.
A Group-wide risk management system (see "Risk management" section from page 83) at both the operational and strategic level in which all sources and types of risk relevant to AGRANA ­ such as the regulatory and legal environment, raw material procurement, competitive and market risks, and financing ­ are analysed for risks and opportunities, enables the management to identify changes in the Group's environment at an early stage and to take timely corrective action as required.
Internal Audit monitors all operational and business processes in the Group for compliance with legal provisions and internal policies and procedures, and for the effectiveness of risk management and the systems of internal control. The unit's audit activities are guided by a Management-Board-approved annual audit plan that is based on a Group-wide risk assessment. When requested by the Management Board, Internal Audit also performs ad-hoc audits focusing on current and future risks. The audit findings are regularly reported to AGRANA's Management Board and the respective managers responsible as well as the Supervisory Board (represented by the Audit Committee). The implementation of the actions proposed by Internal Audit is assured by follow-up verifications.
As part of the audit of the financial statements, the external independent auditor, to the extent required for the audit opinion, annually evaluates the internal control system of the accounting process and of the information technology systems. The audit findings are reported to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

In the Starch segment, AGRANA's projection for the 2016|17 financial year calls for slightly rising sales volumes and steady revenue. The probable downward price pressure in saccharification products and bioethanol leads to a moderately to significantly reduced EBIT forecast compared to 2015|16, despite lower commodity derivative prices for raw materials.

The investment of approximately  58 million planned in the Starch segment represents about 50% of the Group total. The capital expenditure will primarily target capacity expansions in Austria (in Aschach) and product segments that have a high refining intensity, in order to seize growth opportunities in high-margin areas.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 100

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG ("the Company") is the parent company of the AGRANA Group and has its registered office at Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen-Platz 1, 1020 Vienna, Austria. The Company together with its subsidiaries constitutes an international group engaged mainly in the worldwide industrial processing of agricultural raw materials.
The consolidated financial statements of the AGRANA Group for 2015|16 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in effect at the balance sheet date and with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union.

1.Segment information
The segment reporting, which conforms with IFRS 8, distinguishes between three business segments ­ Sugar, Starch and Fruit ­ and thus follows the AGRANA Group's internal reporting structure.
The AGRANA Group has the three reportable segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit, which correspond to its strategic businesses. Each of the segments offers a different product portfolio and is managed separately in view of the different production technologies, raw material procurement and sales strategies. AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesell schaft ("AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG"), the Group's holding company, is considered part of the Sugar segment.
For each segment, internal monthly reporting is provided to the Group's chief operating decision maker (CODM). The members of the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG constitute the CODM. Information on the results of the reportable segments is given below. Segment profitability is evaluated primarily on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items, which is a key performance indicator in every internal management report.

·

·

Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros (000) unless otherwise

·

indicated. As a result of automated calculation, rounding errors may occur in totals of rounded amounts and

·

percentages.

·

·

In the presentation of the income statement, the nature of expense method was used. The separate financial

·

statements of the fully consolidated companies represented in the consolidated financial statements are based on

·

uniform accounting policies.

·

All IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that were effective at the time of prepara-

tion of these consolidated financial statements and applied by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG have been adopted by the

·

European Commission for application in the EU.

·

·

The following standards and interpretations either have been adopted by the European Union and will become

·

effective for the 2015|16 financial year or later, or have been issued by the IASB but not yet adopted by the EU.

·

In the latter case, the effective year given in the table represents the expected time of adoption. AGRANA has not

·

early-adopted any of the new or changed standards cited below. The information provided on the content of the

·

standards depends on whether and to what extent they are relevant to AGRANA. Where accounting rules becoming

Content and expected impacts on AGRANA

·

· ·

The amendments clarify that information should not be obscured by aggregation and that materiality considerations apply to all

 parts of the financial statements, even when individual standards require specific disclosures. The relevance of the items in the balance

sheet and statement of comprehensive income determines their disaggregation or aggregation. In other comprehensive income, all

·

effects from companies accounted for using the equity method are presented in a separate category regardless of whether or not they

·

will subsequently be reclassified to the income statement. The amendments are part of the Disclosure Initiative, which is intended

·

to improve disclosure requirements. Application of the amendments is expected to have impacts on the presentation of the financial

·

statements and on disclosures in the notes.

·

·

The intent of the amendment is to expand disclosures of the components of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities,

·

as through a reconciliation.

·

The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.

No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.

The amendment has no impact, as it relates to separate financial statements.

The IASB has issued the final version of IFRS 9, bringing together the results of the classification and measurement, impairment and

·

hedge accounting phases of the project to replace IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). This new version of the

·

standard adds a new model of expected losses for measuring impairment, and limited changes to the classification and measurement

·

requirements for financial assets. The impairment model is based on the concept of providing for expected losses at the inception of

·

a contract, with the exception of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, where expected credit losses are incorporated

·

into the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition. The classification and measurement model for financial assets and

·

for certain debt instruments is expanded by adding a new category, "fair value through other comprehensive income" (FVTOCI). As well,

·

additional guidance is provided on how to apply the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics test. The standard super-

·

sedes all previous versions of IFRS 9. For the securities holdings the new classification will also result in changes in measurement method.

·

For derivatives there is expected to be an expansion in hedge accounting. Expanded disclosures are also expected.

·

·

No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.

·

The amendment may have impacts on the accounting for future acquisitions of equity interests.

The standard is not relevant to AGRANA. In view of the extremely limited group of users, the European Commission has not endorsed

10·5

this interim standard for adoption into EU law.

·

·

IFRS 15 establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue

and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. Specifically, it also establishes criteria for determining whether different

·

performance obligations under a contract are distinct. AGRANA does not expect the application of the standard to have an impact on

·

the timing of revenue recognition, but expects it to require expanded disclosures.

IFRS 16 establishes new rules for the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases. The standard provides only a single

accounting model for the lessee, requiring the right of use to be recognised as the asset, and the obligation to be recognised as a liability,

·

in the balance sheet. Capitalisation is optional only for underlying assets with a low value and for short-term leases with a term of less

·

than twelve months. AGRANA is evaluating the extent to which IFRS 16 applies to existing rental agreements and how the right-of-use

·

asset and the corresponding liability are to be measured for individual contracts and categories of contracts. Once this process is completed,

·

the impacts on the financial position can be estimated. AGRANA only acts as a lessor to a very limited extent. As the dual accounting

·

model of operating leases and finance leases remains in place for lessors, no accounting changes are expected for AGRANA as a lessor.

·

·

No material impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.

·

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 106
Restatements in accordance with IAS 8 From the beginning of the 2015|16 financial year, the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income was expanded by adding the line item "effects from equity-accounted joint ventures" within other comprehensive income. The new item represents the effects ­ recognised directly in equity ­ from equity-accounted joint ventures in the form of IAS 39 fair value movements, currency translation differences, and changes in actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities. Previously, these effects were included in the separate line items for IAS 39 fair value movements and currency translation differences and for changes in actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities. The consolidated statement of changes in equity was adjusted by the addition of a separate column containing the corresponding amounts, to be recognised directly in equity, of the IAS 39 fair value movements, translation differences and changes in actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities of equity-accounted joint ventures.
Changes in comparative information In the 2015|16 financial year, currency translation gains or losses were for the first time presented on a gross basis in operating profit (EBIT) and in net financial items. For the 2014|15 comparative period this adjustment led to an increase in other operating income and other operating expenses of  5,055 thousand and an increase in finance income and expense of  41,204 thousand, compared to the published amounts.
As a result of an expansion of the treasury management system and an associated adaptation of recording processes, gains and losses on derivatives are since 2015|16 presented on a gross basis. For the 2014|15 comparative period, relative to the published amounts, this led to an increase of  11,935 thousand in gains on derivatives and an increase of  32,583 thousand in losses on derivatives, as well as a reduction of  5,130 thousand in currency translation gains within net financial items and a reduction of  25,778 thousand in translation losses in net financial items.
The presentation of employee numbers was changed from a headcount basis (average for the year) to full-time equivalents (average for the year).
In the cash flow statement, the interest, taxes and dividends representing cash flows are now presented separately and the foreign currency effects are allocated to the items to which they relate; the prior-year data have therefore been adjusted.
3.Scope of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include, by full consolidation, all domestic and foreign companies controlled by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (i.e., all subsidiaries), except where the subsidiary's effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows is immaterial. Control exists when AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has the power to participate in positive and negative variable returns of a company (an investee) and has the ability to affect these returns and direct the investee's relevant activities through its power over the investee. This is usually given when AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG owns more than one-half of the voting rights of the investee.
Companies managed jointly with another entity, where control is exercised jointly and the investors have joint rights to the net assets of the investee, are joint ventures and are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
At the balance sheet date, 58 companies (prior year: 63) besides the parent were fully consolidated in the Group financial statements and 12 companies (prior year: 11) were included using the equity method.
An overview of the fully consolidated entities, equity-accounted joint ventures and other business interests is given beginning from page 159.

Non-controlling interests

Of the non-controlling interests of  55,843 thousand (prior year:  65,161 thousand), most represented the co-owners of the AUSTRIA JUICE group, at  39,952 thousand (prior year:  47,895 thousand). AGRANA's total interests in the AUSTRIA JUICE group amounted to 50.01%. Therefore, 49.99% of the equity of the AUSTRIA JUICE group

3.1.Balance sheet date The balance sheet date (reporting date) of the consolidated financial statements is the last day of February. Group companies with other reporting dates prepare interim financial statements at the Group reporting date.

4.Consolidation methods
 Acquisitions of companies that are fully consolidated are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. Where a business combination entails the possible recognition of intangible assets not previously recognised in the separate financial statements of the acquired company, such as customer relationships, these are recognised only when the requirements under IAS 38 for capitalisation are met. For acquisitions of a majority interest rather than a 100% stake in a company, IFRS 3 provides an accounting policy choice as to how to measure the resulting non-controlling interests. The non-controlling interests may be measured either at their proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree (partial goodwill method) or at their proportionate share of goodwill (full goodwill method). This choice is available individually for each business combination. The full goodwill method has not been applied in the AGRANA Group to date.
 The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the time of acquisition, provided that the requirements for the application of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) are met. Profits or losses resulting from transactions of the AGRANA Group with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture.
 Intragroup revenues, expenses and income and all receivables and payables or provisions between the consolidated companies are eliminated. In assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included in non-current assets or in inventories, intragroup balances are eliminated.

5.Currency translation
 Financial statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euros in accordance with IAS 21. The functional currency of every Group company is its respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the ECB reference rates of exchange or other published reference rates at the balance sheet date (i.e., at period-end rates). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Expenses and income are translated at annual average rates of exchange (the mean of the daily rates of the ECB or national banks), with the exception of the currency translation gains and losses from the measurement of receivables and liabilities related to Group financing.
 Differences compared to prior-year amounts arising from the translation of balance sheet items at current balance sheet date exchange rates or arising from the use of average rates in translating expenses and income compared to the use of current balance sheet date rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Specifically, they are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income as currency translation differences related to consolidation.

6.Accounting policies

6.1.Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment

·

 Purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill) are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis

·

over their expected useful lives of between 5 and 15 years. Almost all intangible assets other than goodwill have

·

a determinable useful life. Those intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not material for the Group.

·

·

 Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Details on this impairment test are

·

presented in the notes to the balance sheet.

·

·

 Product development costs are capitalised at cost if they can be accurately allocated to a product and if both the technical feasibility and the marketing of the new product are assured. In addition, the development work must be sufficiently likely to generate future cash inflows. Items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of purchase and/or conversion, less straight-line or campaign-based depreciation and impairment losses. Besides materials and labour costs, prorated overheads are capitalised in the conversion costs of internally generated assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of an asset that are incurred during the production period are capitalised in accordance with IAS 23. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period during which they are incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, unless they result in an expansion or significant improvement of the asset concerned, in which case they are capitalised.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 112

 Where rental agreements or leases transfer all material risks and rewards of ownership to the AGRANA Group (finance leases), the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset. The asset is initially measured at the lower of (i) its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and (ii) the present value of the future minimum rental or lease payments. This amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings.

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is generally based on the following useful lives:

Buildings Plant and machinery Office furniture and equipment

15 to 50 years 10 to 15 years
3 to 10 years

6.2.Government assistance  Government assistance to reimburse the Group for costs is recognised as other operating income in the period in which the related costs are incurred, unless the assistance is contingent on conditions that are not yet sufficiently likely to be met.
 Government assistance to support capital expenditure is recognised as deferred income from the time of the binding award and deducted from the cost of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on a straightline basis over the useful life of the allocated asset through profit and loss. Details are provided from page 128.

6.3.Financial instruments  The AGRANA Group distinguishes the following classes of financial instruments:
Financial assets ­ Securities, and investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies ­ Trade receivables ­ Other financial assets ­ Cash and cash equivalents
Financial liabilities ­ Bank loans and overdrafts, and other loans from non-Group entities ­ Borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group ­ Finance lease obligations ­ Trade payables ­ Financial other payables
Derivative financial instruments ­ Interest-rate derivatives ­ Currency derivatives ­ Commodity derivatives
 Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, as well as securities, are classified to the available-for-sale category and are initially measured at fair value in the case of securities, and at cost in the case of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, including any transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is at fair value. Changes in value are recognised outside profit or loss (after income tax) in a separate reserve item in equity. Only after the cumulative changes in fair value are realised by selling the asset are they recognised in the income statement. Available-for-sale non-material investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are measured at cost.
 Financial assets are recognised at the settlement date.
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and bank deposits having a remaining term to maturity of up to three months at the time of investment. Cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

Accounting policies 113

Derivative financial instruments

·

 Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and

·

commodity prices. Derivatives are carried as an asset or liability and, irrespective of their purpose, are measured at

·

fair value. Changes in their fair value are recognised through profit or loss in other operating income/expenses

·

(for commodity derivatives and currency derivatives related to purchase and sales transactions) or in net financial

·

items (for interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives related to financings), unless the derivatives are used to

·

hedge an underlying transaction (cash flow hedges). Where the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting under

·

IAS 39 are met, the unrealised effective changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity. They are reclassified

·

from equity to profit or loss in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Ineffective

·

portions of the valuation gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement immediately.

Derivatives are classified as held for trading, except for derivatives in a hedging relationship with a hedged item

that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. More information on derivative financial instruments is provided on

·

page 141.

·

·

·

Receivables

·

 Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Non-interest-

·

bearing receivables with a remaining maturity of more than one year are recognised at their present value using the

·

effective interest method. For default risks or other risks contained in receivables, sufficient impairment provisions

·

are individually allowed. Receivables that are individually immaterial, and receivables with similar default risk,

·

are grouped together and impairment is recognised on the basis of historical experience. The face amounts of the

·

receivables net of necessary impairment provisions represent the fair values. Irrecoverable receivables are derecog-

·

nised on an individual case-by-case basis. If the reasons for an impairment provision cease to apply, the impair-

·

ment loss is reversed, to no more than the asset's historical cost.

 Foreign currency receivables are measured at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

·

·

·

Payables

·

 Borrowings are initially measured at their actual proceeds. Premiums, discounts or other differences between

·

the proceeds and the repayment amount are realised over the term of the instrument by the effective interest method

·

and recognised in net financial items (at amortised cost).

11·3

·

 Trade payables are initially measured (at inception of the liability) at the fair value of the goods or services

·

received. Subsequently these payables are measured at amortised cost. Other payables not resulting from the receipt

of goods or services are measured at their payable amount.

·

·

 Payables denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

6.4.Inventories

·

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost of purchase and/or conversion and net selling price. The weighted

·

average cost formula is used. In accordance with IAS 2, the conversion costs of unfinished and finished products

·

include ­ in addition to directly attributable unit costs ­ reasonable proportions of the necessary material costs and

·

production overheads inclusive of depreciation of manufacturing plant (based on the assumption of normal capacity

·

utilisation) as well as production-related administrative costs. Financing costs are not taken into account. To the

·

extent that inventories are at risk as a result of prolonged storage or reduced saleability, a write-down is recognised.

·

·

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 114
6.5.Emission allowances  Emission rights are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance) and IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets). Emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes of IAS 38 that, except as noted below, are to be classified as current assets. They are assigned a cost of zero. From the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances (one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide), a provision for CO2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income statement. The provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or any excess of their market value at the measurement date over their cost. CO2 emission allowances that have already been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in non-current assets.
6.6.Impairment  Assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are tested at every balance sheet date for evidence of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed for impairment annually at 31 August regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment.
 The impairment test involves determining the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's value in use and its net selling price. If the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement.
 An asset's value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the asset's continuing use and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The discount rate used in determining present value is a pre-tax market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned. Where no largely independent cash inflows can be determined, value in use is determined for the next-larger unit (the cash generating unit) to which the asset belongs and for which largely independent cash inflows can be determined.
 Where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated, the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill and equity-like securities classified as "available-for-sale") is recognised as income in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
6.7.Employee benefit obligations  The AGRANA Group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination benefits. Under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements, AGRANA has no further obligation after paying the agreed premium. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when they fall due, and are reported in staff costs. Contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same manner as those paid to defined contribution plans. As the Group has no payment obligations beyond making the contributions, no provision is maintained.
 The provisions for defined benefit pension, termination and long-service obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), based on actuarial valuations. This involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. In the case of a deficit, a provision is recorded; in the case of a surplus, an asset (other receivable) is recorded. The defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over the period during which the respective beneficiaries acquire the entitlement to these benefits.

Accounting policies 115

 Service cost is recognised in staff costs. Besides the current service cost for the benefits newly earned by staff

·

every year, it may also include past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes, which is recognised

·

immediately in profit or loss for the period. The net interest cost for the financial year is calculated by applying the

·

discount rate determined at the beginning of the year to the net pension obligation determined at that time, taking

·

into account the expected payment outflows. Net interest is recognised in finance expense.

·

·

 Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous

·

actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur,

·

along with their effect on deferred taxes (with the exception of obligations for long-service awards). Correspondingly,

·

the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet. The changes in actuarial gains and losses

recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.

Actuarial gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity cannot be reclassified to profit or loss in subse-

·

quent periods. The recognition in other comprehensive income also includes the differences between (i) the interest

·

income on plan assets based on the discount rate and included in net interest and (ii) the actual return on plan

·

assets determined at the end of the period.

·

·

 The calculation is based on extrapolated future trends in salaries, retirement benefits and employee turnover,

·

as well as a discount rate of predominantly 1.8% for the year under review (prior year: 1.4%).

·

·

 A portion of pension obligations was transferred to pension funds. The retirement benefit contributions to

·

be paid are calculated so as to fully fund the retirement benefit obligation at the time of retirement. If a plan deficit

·

occurs, there is an obligation to fund the shortfall. The Group also holds benefit insurance policies to secure its

·

ability to meet obligations under pension and termination benefit plans. The individual assets allocated to the pension

·

plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. The individual

assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the

net obligation. Likewise, the qualifying insurance policies are treated as plan assets in reducing the present value

·

of the respective pension and termination benefit obligation.

·

·

·

6.8.Other provisions

·

 Other provisions are recognised where the following conditions are met: the AGRANA Group has a legal or

·

constructive obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, the obligation is likely to lead to an outflow of

11·5

resources, and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.

·

·

 Provisions are measured at the amount representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the

obligation. If the present value of the obligation determined on the basis of a market interest rate differs materially

·

from its nominal amount, the present value of the obligation is used.

·

 The risks arising from contingent liabilities are covered by sufficient provisions.

 Provisions for reclamation comprise obligations for reclamation of properties, emptying and rehabilitation of

·

landfills, remediation or restoration of building structures, legacy soil reclamation and removal of waste residues.

·

·

 "Provisions for staff costs including long-service awards" also include provisions for phased retirement, provisions

·

for redundancy benefit plans under restructuring projects, provisions for bonuses and awards, and other personnel-

·

related provisions. Under IAS 19, long-service awards are classified as long-term employee benefits. These are

·

determined by the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the current period in staff

·

costs. Long-service awards are one-time payments dependent on level of salary or wage and length of service and

·

are stipulated under local company agreements or of collective agreements. Obligations for the payment of such

service anniversary bonuses exist especially in Austria and Germany. In Austria, provisions for phased retirement must

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 116
be created as a result of labour laws regarding obligations to employees. The legislation concerning phased retirement makes it easier for companies to employ older staff members working reduced hours with substantial financial security until full retirement. Provisions for redundancy benefit plans under restructurings are created only if a formal, detailed restructuring plan has been prepared and communicated.
 Provisions for uncertain liabilities include, among other items, provisions for litigation risks, onerous contracts, costs of beet receiving, loading and storage, and other uncertain liabilities. A provision for onerous (loss-making) contracts is recognised if the expected economic benefit from a contract is less than the unavoidable cost of fulfilling the contract.
6.9.Deferred taxes  Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base; on consolidation entries; and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised. Significant differences exist between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base for property, plant and equipment, inventories and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected to be utilised within five years.
 Deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method (under IAS 12), based on the pertinent national income tax rates. Consequently, with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation, deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the tax base, to the extent that deferred tax assets are likely to be realised.
 When income and expenses are recognised directly in equity, the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities are also taken directly to equity. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account company-specific forecasts of, for instance, the future earnings situation in the respective Group company. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if the associated tax benefits are expected to be realisable over a five-year planning horizon. This is the case if sufficient profits can be earned or if there is sufficient taxable income from the reversal of temporary differences previously recognised as liabilities.
 Deferred tax assets are classified as non-current assets; deferred tax liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities. Deferred tax assets are off set against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority.
 The income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income, and the movement in deferred taxes.
6.10.Recognition of revenue and costs  Revenue from goods sold is recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have passed to the purchaser. Revenue from services provided is recognised to the extent that the services have been rendered by the balance sheet date.
 Operating expenses are recognised in the income statement upon use of the product or service or as incurred.
 Finance expenses comprise the interest expense, similar expenses and transaction costs on borrowings including finance leases; financing-related currency translation gains and losses; and financing-related hedging gains and losses.
 Income from financial investments represents interest, dividend and similar income realised from cash-equivalent investments and investments in other financial assets; gains and losses on the disposal of financial assets; and impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.
 Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised at the time of the decision to pay the dividend.

Accounting policies 117

6.11.Critical assumptions and judgements

·

 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company's manage-

·

ment to make judgements and to act on assumptions about future developments. These judgements and assumptions

·

can have a material effect on the recognition and measurement of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of other

·

liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of income and expenses reported for the financial year.

·

·

 The following assumptions involve a not insignificant risk that they may lead to a material change in the carrying

·

amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year:

·

·

­ The impairment testing of goodwill (carrying amount at 29 February 2016:  226,202 thousand), other intangible

assets (carrying amount at 29 February 2016:  15,759 thousand) and property, plant and equipment (carrying

amount at 29 February 2016:  679,592 thousand) is based on forward-looking assumptions. The determination

·

of the recoverable amounts for the purpose of the impairment review involves several assumptions, such as

·

regarding future net cash flows and the discount rate. The net cash flows are the amounts in the most current

·

cash flow forecast for the cash generating units (CGUs) for the next five years (most current at the time of the

·

regular impairment test date of 31 August). Shortly before the balance sheet date, a new cash flow forecast

·

was presented to the Supervisory Board, which did not contain potential triggering events that would indicate an

·

impairment.

·

·

­ It was determined through a simulation that a hypothetical reduction of 5% in sustainable cash flows would not

·

lead to an impairment of goodwill.

·

·

­ The discount rate before tax varies by industry, company risk level and specific market environment;

·

in the financial year it ranged from 6.11% to 10.48% (prior year: 6.30% to 10.36%).

­ An increase of 0.5 percentage points in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) would not lead to impair-

·

ment. Financial instruments for which no active market exists are reviewed for impairment by using alternative

·

discounting-based valuation methods. The inputs used for the determination of fair value are based in part on

·

assumptions concerning the future.

·

·

­ The measurement of existing retirement and termination benefit obligations (carrying amount at 29 February

·

2016:  67,146 thousand) involves assumptions regarding discount rate, age at retirement, life expectancy, employee

11·7

turnover and future increases in pay and benefits.

·

·

­ The sensitivity analysis below is based on varying one assumption at a time with the other assumptions remaining

unchanged from the original calculation. Potential correlation effects between assumptions are thus not taken

·

into account. The changes in assumptions would have the following effects on the present values of the obligations

·

stated in note 25a:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 118

­ The recognition of deferred tax assets (carrying amount at 29 February 2016:  14,873 thousand) is based on the assumption that sufficient taxable profit will be earned over the five-year planning horizon to realise them.
­ The off-balance sheet obligations from financial guarantees and from other contingent liabilities, and any reductions in these obligations, are regularly reviewed as to whether they require recognition in the balance sheet.
­ In determining the amount of other provisions (carrying amount at 29 February 2016:  48,425 thousand), management exercises judgement as to whether AGRANA is likely to incur an outflow of resources from the obligation concerned and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
 The HUNGRANA group and the STUDEN group were classified as joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11 and the agreements existing at the time. The AGRANA Group holds 50% of the share capital of the joint ventures.
 The AGRANA Group holds 50.01% of the share capital of AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH and is subsidiaries. As a result of the underlying contracts and arrangements, AGRANA exercises control over these companies and fully consolidates them in the Group accounts.

Within other operating expenses, "other items" included, for instance, provisions and other purchased services.

The costs incurred in the financial year for external auditor KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft were  468 thousand (prior year:  666 thousand). Of this total,  447 thousand (prior year:  454 thousand) related to the audit of the consolidated financial statements (including the audit of the separate financial statements of individual subsidiaries),  8 thousand (prior year:  18 thousand) was for other assurance services, and  13 thousand (prior year:  194 thousand) represented other non-audit services.

The nominal tax charge or credit is based on application of the standard Austrian corporation tax rate of 25%.
The Tax Reform Act of 2005 introduced a new concept for the taxation of company groups. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, the AGRANA Group established a group consisting of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as the group parent and the following group members: AGRANA Zucker GmbH, AGRANA Stärke GmbH, AGRANA Marketingund Vertriebsservice Gesellschaft m.b.H., AGRANA Internationale Verwaltungs- und Asset-Management GmbH, AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, INSTANTINA Nahrungsmittel Entwicklungs- und Produktionsgesellschaft m.b.H. and AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH.
Deferred taxes are recognised on differences between carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of the individual companies in their home countries. Deferred taxes take into account carryforwards of unused tax losses.
In the interest of conservative planning, deferred taxes reflect carryforwards of tax losses only to the extent that sufficient taxable profit is likely to be earned over the next five years to utilise the deferred tax assets.  16,075 thousand (prior year:  14,305 thousand) of potential tax assets were not recognised. These related to cumulative unused tax loss carryforwards of  72,412 thousand (prior year:  66,306 thousand). Of the unused tax loss carryforwards,  25,568 thousand (prior year:  18,606 thousand) can be carried forward indefinitely,  20,851 thousand (prior year:  0) expire in two to four years,  17,020 thousand (prior year:  38,734 thousand) expire in five to seven years and  8,973 thousand (prior year:  8,966 thousand) expire in the 2017 calendar year.
At the balance sheet date the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised directly in equity amounted to a net asset of  7,198 thousand (prior year:  6,396 thousand).
For temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities of  191,574 thousand (prior year:  193,502 thousand) were not recognised, as these gains are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period and these temporary differences are thus not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

8.Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement

·

·

The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method and in accordance with IAS 7. The statement traces

·

the movements in the AGRANA Group's cash and cash equivalents arising from operating, investing and financing

·

activities.

·

·

Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, represent cash on hand, cheques and

·

bank deposits.

·

As a result of currency legislation, there are restrictions on access to cash and cash equivalents of subsidiaries in

the amount of  18,237 thousand (prior year:  17,006 thousand) in China and Ukraine.

·

·

Cash and cash equivalents do not include current bank borrowings or securities classified as current assets.

·

·

The currency translation effects, except those on cash and cash equivalents, are already eliminated in the respective

·

balance sheet items.

·

·

Note (14) 8.1.Cash flows from operating activities

·

Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was  225,914 thousand (prior year:  208,066 thousand),

or 9.12% of revenue (prior year: 8.34%). The non-cash expenses/income consisted mainly of the unrealised foreign

·

currency losses of  11,033 thousand (prior year: unrealised translation gains of  ­8,809 thousand) reflected in

·

net financial items, non-cash income taxes of  23,508 thousand (prior year:  31,901 thousand), non-cash interest of

 8,376 thousand (prior year:  10,182 thousand), a non-cash change of  1,146 thousand (prior year:  1,368 thousand)

in impairment on receivables, and non-cash inventory write-downs of  5,471 thousand (prior year:  13,851 thou-

sand). After changes in working capital and after cash flows from interest and taxes, net cash from operating activities

·

was  101,913 thousand (prior year:  227,143 thousand).

·

·

·

Note (15) 8.2.Cash flows from investing activities

·

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by  64,227 thousand from  84,151 thousand to  19,924 thousand.

·

This reflected the fact that an increase in outflows from purchases in property, plant and equipment and intangible

·

assets to  107,720 thousand (prior year:  86,982 thousand) was more than offset by the disposal of the participa-

·

tion capital of RAIFFEISEN-HOLDING NIEDERÖSTERREICH-WIEN regGenmbH in the amount of  85,000 thousand

which AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG had subscribed.

Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to  3,103 thousand (prior year:  1,621 thousand).

Note (16)

8.3.Cash flows from financing activities Borrowings (net of unrealised currency translation losses) fell by  21,098 thousand in the 2015|16 financial year (prior year: reduction of  8,373 thousand).

1 Proposal to the Annual General Meeting.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 126

As a result of the redemption of the participation capital by RAIFFEISEN-HOLDING NIEDERÖSTERREICH-WIEN regGenmbH, AGRANA was able to repay current borrowings of  85,000 thousand to affiliated companies in the Südzucker group.
Purchases on non-controlling interests consisted of the acquisition by AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, of the remaining 2.34% of Moravskoslezské Cukrovary A.S., Hrusovany, Czech Republic, for the sum of  2,558 thousand, which was paid in the year under review.
Dividends paid consisted mainly of the cash dividend distributed to the shareholders of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG.

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 127

 The additions of  6,682 thousand (prior year:  2,274 thousand) of non-goodwill intangible assets related

·

primarily to software and a quota for deliveries to a customer. The quota is subject to amortisation based on delivery

·

volume.

·

·

 Intangible assets consist largely of goodwill, capitalised in accordance with IFRS 3, that resulted from the acquisi-

·

tion of companies. Intangibles also include acquired customer relationships, software, patents and similar rights,

·

as well as non-current prepayments and similar rights.

·

·

 Of the total carrying amount of goodwill, the Sugar segment accounted for  20,111 thousand (prior year:

·

 20,111 thousand), the Starch segment for  1,606 thousand (prior year:  1,606 thousand) and the Fruit segment for

 204,485 thousand (prior year:  204,459 thousand).

·

 To satisfy the provisions of IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36 and to allow the calculation of any impairment of

·

goodwill, AGRANA has defined its cash-generating units to match its internal reporting structure. The cash-generating

·

units in the AGRANA Group are the Sugar segment, Starch segment and Fruit segment, consistent with the internal

·

management accounting and reporting processes. All goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units.

·

·

 To test for impairment, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by allocating to it the corre-

·

sponding assets and liabilities, inclusive of attributable goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment is recognised

·

in profit or loss when the recoverable amount (value in use) of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount

·

inclusive of goodwill.

·

·

 In testing for impairment, AGRANA uses a discounted cash flow method to determine the value in use of the

·

cash-generating units. The determination of expected cash flows from each cash-generating unit is based on business

plans that are validated and approved by Supervisory Board committees and have a planning horizon of five years.

Projections beyond a five-year horizon are based on the assumption of a constant, inflation-induced growth rate

·

of 1.5% per year (assumption in the prior year: 1.5%). The cost of capital (WACC) is calculated as the weighted average

·

cost of equity and debt capital for each CGU.

·

·

 The cost of equity is based on a risk-free rate, a return premium for the business risk, and a premium for country

·

risk and inflation differential. The spot rate of a 30-year zero coupon bond, based on Deutsche Bundesbank data,

·

was used as the risk-free rate of return. Business risk is represented by the product of a general market risk premium

12· 7

of 6.5% (prior year: 5.75%) and a beta factor derived from a peer group of nine companies. The country risk and the

·

inflation differential are assigned a volatility factor of 1.5 (prior year: 1.0).

·

 The cost of debt capital is calculated as the risk-free rate plus the country risk premium, the inflation differential,

·

and the credit spread determined by reference to the capital market.

·

The following table presents the carrying amounts of the goodwill, the respective discount rate (WACC) and the

excess of recoverable over carrying amount, by CGU:

 The quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis. The insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan. Projections of value in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends. Value in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for the regional markets.
 The amounts by which the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying amounts were subjected to a sensitivity analysis. The results are presented on page 117. The goodwill is not tax-deductible.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 128

 At the balance sheet date, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that were not significant for the AGRANA Group were included.

 The AGRANA Group, in addition to operating leases, also employs a small number of finance leases. The major

·

finance lease relates to the renting of a building erected on AGRANA land at the site in Kröllendorf/Allhartsberg,

·

Austria. This finance lease requires recognition in the balance sheet beginning in the 2015|16 financial year. An option

·

to purchase the third-party building can be exercised in the 2018|19 financial year. The finance leases for other plant,

·

fixtures and fittings are of minor significance and are primarily vehicle leases. The movement in property, plant and

capital) and of reserves resulting from the reorganisation of companies. The capital reserves remained unchanged

in the 2015|16 financial year. Retained earnings consist of the available-for-sale reserve and the reserves for cash flow

hedges, actuarial gains and losses, investments in equity-accounted joint ventures, effects of consolidation-related

foreign currency translation, and accumulated profits/losses for the period.

 In February 2016, AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, increased its ownership interest in Moravskoslezské Cukrovary A.S., Hrusovany, Czech Republic, from 97.66% to 100%. The difference of  724 thousand between the purchase price paid and the carrying amount of the acquired net assets was offset against retained earnings.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 132

Disclosures on capital management A key goal of equity management is the maintenance of sufficient equity resources to safeguard the Company's continuing existence as a going concern and ensure continuity of dividends. Equity bore the following relationship to total capital:

49.6%

Net debt Gearing ratio

405,806 33.8%

330,283 27.7%

Capital management at AGRANA means the management of equity and of net debt. By optimising these two measures, the Company seeks to achieve the best possible shareholder returns. In addition to the equity ratio, the most important control variable is the gearing ratio (net debt divided by total equity). The total cost of equity and debt capital employed and the risks associated with the different types of capital are continuously monitored.
The sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility and also demonstrates the Group's financial stability and independence. In addition to its self-financing ability, AGRANA also has access to high, committed credit lines for its overall financing needs.
The approach to capital management was unchanged from the prior year.

a) Provisions for retirement and termination benefits Provisions for retirement and termination benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19, using the projected unit credit method and taking into account future trends on an actuarial basis. For both the retirement and termination benefit obligations, the plans are defined benefit plans.

The present values of the obligations, and the associated plan assets where applicable, were determined based on the following actuarial parameters:

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 133

A discount rate of 1.8% (prior year: 1.4%) was used in almost all cases in the determination of the provisions for

·

pensions and termination benefits. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds with a

·

duration matching the average weighted duration of the obligations.

·

·

The measurement process also involves other company-specific actuarial assumptions, such as the staff turnover

·

rate. The current mortality tables recognised in the respective country are used as the biometric basis for the calcula-

·

tions ­ in Austria, this is the version of the computation tables by Pagler & Pagler specific to salaried employees

·

("AVÖ 2008-P-Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung").

·

·

Defined benefit plans

Pension plans in the AGRANA Group are based largely on direct defined benefit commitments. The amounts of

·

the pension benefits are usually determined by length of service and pensionable pay. Termination benefit plans exist

·

mainly as a result of legal requirements or of obligations under collective agreements and the benefits represent

·

one-time, lump sum payments. The amount of the termination benefits typically depends on final pay and length

·

of service.

·

·

The provision in the balance sheet (the net liability) for pensions and termination benefits in the AGRANA Group

·

represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets:

In connection with defined benefit pension commitments, the AGRANA Group's major plans are the following:

·

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has direct defined benefit commitments in respect of Management Board members for

·

retirement, disability and survivor pensions based on a fixed percentage of a pension assessment base. All pension

·

benefit obligations are transferred to and administered by an external pension fund. The present value of the

obligation was  19,020 thousand (prior year:  20,698 thousand) and the plan assets amounted to  12,374 thousand

(prior year:  12,640 thousand). Further detail is provided in the section "Related party disclosures" in these notes.

·

In addition, there were direct defined benefit commitments, including survivor benefits, in respect of retired former

·

employees of AGRANA Zucker GmbH in the amount of  19,721 thousand (prior year:  22,243 thousand), of AGRANA

·

Stärke GmbH in the amount of  2,666 thousand (prior year:  2,866 thousand) and of AGRANA Juice Holding

·

GmbH in the amount of  229 thousand (prior year:  243 thousand). The present value of the obligation of AGRANA

·

Juice Holding GmbH is offset by plan assets in the form of pension risk transfer insurance of  163 thousand (prior

·

year:  167 thousand).

·

·

At AGRANA Fruit Austria GmbH there are pension commitments in respect of active employees for retirement,

disability and survivor benefits with a contractual (in some cases length-of-service-dependent) fixed benefit amount,

and direct obligations in respect of retired former employees, including survivor benefits. The present value of these

obligations was  1,013 thousand (prior year:  1,032 thousand) and there were plan assets in the form of pension

insurance of  505 thousand (prior year:  456 thousand).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 134

In Mexico there is a contractual obligation in respect of a defined set of recipients in the event of retirement or early retirement to pay a fixed percentage of a specified pensionable pay base in monthly instalments for a period of ten years. Alternatively, the recipient may choose a lump sum payment. The present value of this obligation was  594 thousand (prior year:  594 thousand), with plan assets in the form of pension insurance of  99 thousand (prior year:  106 thousand).

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 135

The AGRANA Group has the following main termination benefit plans:

·

·

The termination benefit plans most significant in amount exist in Austria and France. The plans represent legislated

·

commitments to pay a lump sum benefit on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) and

·

in the event of retirement or death. The amount of the benefit depends on final pay and length of service. Termina-

·

tion benefit obligations in Austria and France are funded solely by provisions, in the amount of  35,224 thousand

·

(prior year:  35,973 thousand).

·

·

In Russia and Ukraine there are termination benefit commitments (either legislated or based on company-wide

·

agreements) that are minor in amount. These are payable as a lump sum on termination of employment (unless

terminated by the employee) or on retirement. The benefit amount depends on final pay and length of service. These

commitments in the amount of  101 thousand (prior year:  71 thousand) are covered solely by provisions.

·

·

The termination benefit arrangements in the USA consist of contractual commitments in respect of a defined set

·

of recipients, while the commitments in Mexico are legislated obligations to all permanent and full-time employees.

·

In Mexico the termination benefit is paid if the employment relationship is terminated after 15 years or more of

·

service, at retirement or in the event of disability or death. It takes the form of a lump sum in an amount that is based

·

on final salary and length of service. In the USA, the benefit is paid on termination of employment and is based on

·

final salary and length of service. In Mexico, plan assets of  3 thousand (prior year:  13 thousand) offset the present

·

value of the obligation of  132 thousand (prior year:  137 thousand). In the USA, the commitments of  1,073 thou-

·

sand (prior year:  961 thousand) are funded solely by provisions.

·

·

The present value of the obligation of the termination benefit plan for South Korea was  1,344 thousand (prior year:

·

 1,267 thousand), while the plan assets amounted to  827 thousand (prior year:  818 thousand).

The expense for the unwinding of discount on benefits accrued in prior years, less the return on plan assets, is included within net financial items. The current service cost is included in staff costs. The change in actuarial gains of the pension and termination benefit provisions, which is recognised directly in equity, was an increase of  3,225 thousand (prior year: losses with a decrease of  17,261 thousand). The change resulted primarily from the higher discount rate and from experience adjustments concerning factors such as expected retirement age, wage and salary growth rates and assumed employee turnover rates. As of 29 February 2016, net cumulative actuarial losses of  35,037 thousand (prior year: net losses of  38,261 thousand) had been offset against retained earnings, not taking into account deferred taxes.
The experience adjustments reflect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. Such differences arise, especially, from actual rates of wage and salary increases, changes in pension benefits, employee turnover and biometric variables such as disability and mortality.

Composition of plan assets The plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension benefit insurance policies. The fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide, at all times, full coverage of the payment obligations arising from the respective benefit plans. The plan assets include neither financial instruments issued by the Group nor owner-occupied property.

At the balance sheet date the plan assets were invested in the following asset categories:

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 137

Risks

·

Defined benefit plans are associated with various risks for the AGRANA Group. Besides general actuarial risks such

·

as discount rate risk and longevity risk, these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial

·

assumptions such as rates of wage and salary growth, pension benefit trends, retirement age and employee turnover

·

(early departures). Risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks, credit risks and investment risks.

·

Other risks lie in exchange rate fluctuation and changes in inflation rates.

·

·

The rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is

·

less than the discount rate used, the respective net liability increases. The net liability is particularly strongly influenced

·

by the discount rate, with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability. A further

decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in defined benefit liabilities that can only be off set

to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets.

·

·

Potential inflation risks that may lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations lie, indirectly, in inflation-driven

·

salary growth during active service and in inflation-induced pension benefit increases.

·

·

·

Duration and future payments

·

The average weighted duration of the present value of the pension obligations at 29 February 2016 was 12.51 years

·

(prior year: 12.96 years) and that of the termination benefit obligations was 8.92 years (prior year: 9.67 years).

·

·

 627 thousand (prior year:  954 thousand) of contributions are expected to be paid into the plan assets in the

·

subsequent reporting period.

·

The amounts of pension and termination benefit payments in the next ten years are expected to be as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 138

The provisions for uncertain liabilities included, among other items, provisions for litigation risks of  11,744 thousand (prior year:  8,481 thousand), for costs of beet receiving, loading and storage of  2,165 thousand (prior year:  2,771 thousand) and for onerous contracts of  4,189 thousand (prior year:  11,687 thousand).
Most of the non-current other provisions of  19,999 thousand (prior year:  14,879 thousand) represented provisions of  10,150 thousand for long-service awards (prior year:  10,048 thousand). These are payable under local company agreements or collective agreements and are based on length of service. Phased-retirement provisions of  736 thousand (prior year:  965 thousand) are expected to be used in outflows of funds in the next one to three years. For the majority of the non-current provisions of  7,173 thousand (prior year:  2,754 thousand) for recultivation, an outflow of funds is likely to occur in more than five years.

10.1.Investment and credit transactions (non-derivative financial instruments)

To cover its overall funding needs, the AGRANA Group, in addition to its self-financing capability, has access to

·

syndicated credit lines and bilateral credit lines from banks.

·

·

Financial instruments are generally procured centrally and distributed Group-wide. The principal aims of obtaining

·

financing are to achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value, safeguard the Group's credit quality and ensure

·

its liquidity.

·

13·9

To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, the AGRANA Group in the course of its day-to-day financial manage-

·

ment uses conventional investments (demand deposits, time deposits and securities) and borrowings (in the form

·

of overdrafts, short-term funds and fixed rate loans).

Bank loans and overdrafts (excluding finance leases) and amounts due to affiliated companies of the Südzucker group amounted to  531,024 thousand (prior year:  628,965 thousand). The reduction compared with the prior year resulted primarily from the repayment of a loan tranche of  85,000 thousand to Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany.
The weighted average interest rate paid on these credits was 1.95% (prior year: 1.98%), with a remaining maturity of 1.6 years (prior year: 1.9 years).
These borrowings are covered by credit line limits of  952,627 thousand (prior year:  1,007,724 thousand). The weighted average remaining maturity of the credit lines at the balance sheet date was 2.6 years (prior year: 3.0 years).
The credit funding of the AGRANA Group consists primarily of two syndicated credit lines totalling  450,000 thousand at the balance sheet date (prior year:  450,000 thousand), a Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) of  126,000 thousand (prior year:  126,000 thousand) and a financing from Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany, in the amount of  165,000 thousand (prior year:  250,000 thousand). The other credit lines are bilateral ones.
The fixed interest portion of bank loans and overdrafts and amounts due to affiliated companies was  200,149 thousand (prior year:  251,067 thousand). The fair values (i.e., market values) of the variable rate bank loans and overdrafts are equivalent to their carrying amounts. At the balance sheet date,  0 (prior year:  809 thousand) of bank loans and overdrafts were secured by mortgage liens and  7,800 thousand (prior year:  7,900 thousand) were secured by other liens.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased by  84,443 thousand from the prior year to a new total of  109,375 thousand. In addition, securities in the amount of  45 thousand (prior year:  46 thousand) were held as current assets; these were categorised as held-for-trading.

10.2.Derivative financial instruments

·

To hedge part of the risks arising from its operating activities (risks due to movements in interest rates, foreign

·

exchange rates and raw material prices), the AGRANA Group to a limited extent uses derivative financial instruments.

·

AGRANA employs derivatives largely to hedge the following exposures:

·

·

 Interest rate risks, which can arise from floating rate borrowings.

·

 Currency risks, which may arise primarily from the purchase and sale of products in US dollars and Eastern

·

European currencies and from finance in foreign currencies.

·

·

 Market price risks, arising especially from changes in commodity prices for sugar in the world market,

grain prices, and selling prices for sugar and ethanol.

·

The Group employs only conventional derivatives for which there is a sufficiently liquid market (for example, interest

·

rate swaps, interest rate options, caps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options or commodity futures).

·

The use of these instruments is governed by Group policies under the Group's risk management system. These

·

policies prohibit the speculative use of derivative financial instruments, set ceilings appropriate to the underlying

·

transactions, define authorisation procedures, minimise credit risks, and specify internal reporting rules and the

·

organisational separation of risk-taking and risk oversight. Adherence to these standards and the proper processing

·

and valuation of transactions are regularly monitored by an internal department whose independence is ensured

·

by organisational separation from risk origination.

·

·

The notional amounts and market values (fair values) of the derivative financial instruments held by the AGRANA

·

Group were as follows:

The currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year; the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to four years.
The notional amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges, translated into euros as the Group currency.
The fair value of a derivative is the amount which the AGRANA Group would have to pay or would receive at the balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position. As the hedging transactions involve only standardised, fungible financial instruments, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices.
Fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially recognised directly in equity. Only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss. At 29 February 2016 there were cash flow hedges with positive fair values of  1,748 thousand (prior year:  588 thousand) and cash flow hedges with negative fair values of 5,688 thousand (prior year:  69 thousand).
In the financial year,  588 thousand (prior year:  185 thousand) was reclassified to the income statement and the ineffective portion (amounting to  284 thousand) of cash flow hedges was recognised in profit for the period (prior year:  0).
The value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in profit or loss. The hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for the juice activities, and to hedge sales contracts in the Sugar segment.

The effect of the changes in fair value on equity, including the tax effect, would have been, for the increase in rates and prices, an equity increase of  5,253 thousand (prior year: increase of  2,147 thousand) and for the decrease in rates and prices, an equity decrease of  2,898 thousand (prior year: decrease of  2,059 thousand). The effect of the fair value changes on profit before tax would have been, for the increase in rates and prices, a profit decrease of  8,603 thousand (prior year: decrease of  3,693 thousand), and for the decrease in rates and prices, a profit increase of  8,097 thousand (prior year: increase of  2,228 thousand).

10.3.Additional disclosures on financial instruments
Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments Set out in the table below are the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities, both by individual item type and by measurement category. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.
The table below also shows how the fair values were determined, broken down by category of financial instrument. The fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based on quoted market data:
The three levels were defined as follows:
 Level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices quoted for the exact instrument on an active market (i.e., these prices are used without adjustment or change in composition).
 In Level 2, the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market for similar assets or liabilities, or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on observable market data.
 Level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of Level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the underlying currencies' interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity. The mark-to-market price is determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction. The input factors for this are the reference rates of the ECB (daily fixing) or selected national central banks, and the daily EURIBOR and LIBOR/IBOR rates.
For Level 2 interest rate derivatives, the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity. The fair value is obtained from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions.

Notes on financial instruments 147

The fair values of financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available at the

·

balance sheet date and using the methods and assumptions outlined below.

·

·

Securities held as non-current and current assets include available-for-sale securities. These are measured at current

·

securities exchange prices or market value.

·

·

Available-for-sale investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are measured at cost. These

·

are non-fully-consolidated investments in subsidiaries and interests in non-listed companies for which it was

·

chosen not to determine fair values using discounted future cash flows because this item is of minor significance for

·

the Group.

As a result of the short maturities of the trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents,

·

their fair values are assumed to be equivalent to their carrying amounts.

·

·

The positive and negative fair values of commodity derivatives relate partly to cash flow hedges. For the interest rate

·

hedges, the fair values are determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. Forward foreign exchange

·

contracts are measured on the basis of reference rates, taking into account forward premiums or discounts. The fair

·

values of interest rate derivatives are obtained from the bank confirmations as at the balance sheet date, and the fair

·

values of commodity derivatives are based on official quotations on futures exchanges. The market rates (fair values)

·

of currency derivatives are based on the forward rates determined by AGRANA as at the balance sheet date and

·

on the hedged exchange rates. The interest rates and exchange rates used for the determination of the forward rates

·

are based on the reference rates published by the ECB or the national central banks. In some cases, as a result

·

of differences in interest rates, the fair values determined by the Group may differ to an insignificant extent from the

·

fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations.

For trade payables and current financial other payables, it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the

·

fair values equal the carrying amounts. The fair value of fixed interest liabilities is calculated as the present value

·

of expected future cash flows. For variable rate liabilities, the fair value equals the carrying amount.

·

·

The net gains and losses on financial instruments are presented by measurement category in the following table:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 148

10.4.Risk management in the AGRANA Group The AGRANA Group is exposed to market price risks through changes in exchange rates, interest rates and security prices. In the Group's operating activities, price risks arise largely from the costs of raw materials (mainly sugar beet, sugar purchased in the world market, grains, potatoes, and fruit) and energy, and from selling prices of sugar, starch, ethanol and fruit products. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risks, associated especially with trade receivables.
AGRANA uses an integrated system for the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group. The Group's proven approach to risk management is guided by the aim of balancing risks and returns. The Group's risk culture is characterised by risk-aware behaviour, clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and the implementation of internal control systems.
AGRANA regards the responsible management of business risks and opportunities as an important part of sustainable, value-driven corporate governance. Risk management thus forms an integral part of the entire planning, management and reporting process and is directed by the Management Board. The parent company and all subsidiaries employ risk management systems that are tailored to their respective operating activity. The systems' purpose is the methodical identification, assessment, control and documenting of risks.
In a three-pronged approach, risk management at the AGRANA Group is based on risk control at the operational level, on strategic control of Group companies by the Group, and on an internal monitoring system delivered by the Group's internal audit department. In addition, emerging trends that could develop into threats to the viability of the AGRANA Group as a going concern are identified and analysed at an early stage and continually re-evaluated as part of the risk management process.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of an economic loss as a result of a counterparty's failure to honour its payment obligations. Credit risk includes both the risk of a deterioration in customers' or other counterparties' credit quality, and the risk of their immediate default.

The trade receivables of the AGRANA Group are largely with the food, chemical and retail industries. Credit risk in respect of trade receivables is managed on the basis of internal standards and guidelines. Thus, a credit analysis is generally conducted for new customers. The Group also uses credit insurance and security such as bank guarantees.

For the residual risk from trade receivables, the Group establishes provisions for impairment.

The net carrying amount of trade receivables after provisions for impairment is determined as follows:

Trade receivables Less credit insurance and other security Net credit risk

cash flows.

·

·

The maximum exposure from trade receivables is equivalent to the carrying amount of the trade receivables.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 150

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that a company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due or in sufficient measure.
The AGRANA Group generates liquidity with its business operations and from external financing. The funds are used to fund working capital, investment and business acquisitions.
In order to ensure the Group's solvency at all times and safeguard its financial flexibility, a liquidity reserve is maintained in the form of credit lines and, to the extent necessary, of cash.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, both short-term and long-term finance is raised in the course of day-to-day financial management.
The following maturity profile shows the effects of the cash outflows from liabilities as at 29 February 2016 on the Group's liquidity situation. All cash outflows are undiscounted.

Currency risk

The Group's international business operations expose AGRANA to foreign exchange risks from financing and financial

investment as well as from trade receivables and trade payables. To measure and control these risks, the AGRANA

Group uses Value-at-Risk based on the variance-covariance approach at a 95% confidence level. This involves the

measurement of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the correlations between

·

them. The result is stated as the diversified VaR from currencies and is analysed by borrowings and operating business:

Most of the Group's foreign exchange risk arises in the operating business, when revenues or costs are denominated in a currency other than that of the related costs or revenues, respectively. The foreign currency positions of  63,445 thousand (prior year:  91,000 thousand) in the operating activities were mainly in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Hungary, as well as a US dollar position in the euro area, and represented a Value-at-Risk of  5,459 thousand (prior year:  6,804 thousand).
The AGRANA Group's currency risk from financing arises from borrowings and financial investments not denominated in the local currency of the respective company. The foreign currency positions from financing amounted to  143,715 thousand (prior year:  217,750 thousand), with a Value-at-Risk of  9,959 thousand (prior year:  13,418 thousand) and pertained largely to Brazil, China, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Hungary for financings in euros and US dollars.
In the Sugar segment, Group companies based in the European Union whose local currency is not the euro are exposed to sugar-regime-induced foreign exchange risk between the euro and their respective local currency, as the beet prices for a given campaign are set in euros EU-wide. The subsidiaries in Romania and Hungary are subject to additional currency risk from raw sugar purchases in US dollars, and some companies are exposed to currency risk from sales of non-quota sugar in US dollars.

Notes on financial instruments 153

In the Starch segment, foreign exchange risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

·

·

In the Fruit segment, foreign exchange risks arise when revenue and materials costs are in foreign currency rather

·

than local currency. In addition, risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

·

·

·

Interest rate risk

·

The AGRANA Group is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in the euro zone.

·

·

Beginning in the year under review, risks from potential changes in interest rates are reported on an "at risk" basis.

AGRANA distinguishes between Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) for variable rate borrowings and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for

changes in market interest rates on fixed rate borrowings

·

·

CFaR: An increase in interest rates would cause an increase in funding costs from variable rate borrowings. The

·

CFaR analysis is based on the volatilities of the individual funding currencies and the correlations between them.

·

·

VaR: The analysis examines the implied risk from a decrease in interest rates, as existing fixed rate borrowings would

·

continue to incur interest costs at a constant rate instead of following the market trend. The different maturities of

·

fixed interest borrowings are taken into account through weighted present values and a potential change in variable

·

interest rates under the modified duration approach.

·

·

The CFaR and VaR from borrowings were as follows:

·

·

·

The floating rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. To hedge against this risk, interest rate swaps were

15·3

entered into for a portion of the borrowings, thus achieving fixed interest rates on this portion.

·

·

Commodity price risk

·

AGRANA's business activities expose it to market price risk from purchases of commodities and the sale of finished

·

products (ethanol). This is particularly true in the production of bioethanol, where the most important cost factors by

far are the prices of the main inputs, corn and wheat. To a lesser but still significant extent, the Sugar segment has

exposure to the purchase prices of raw sugar.

·

At the balance sheet date the Group had open commodity derivative contracts for the purchase of 84,281 tonnes

·

of raw sugar (prior year: 0 tonnes), the purchase of 184,500 tonnes of wheat for the Austrian bioethanol production

·

operations (prior year: 153,500 tonnes) and the purchase of 15,300 tonnes of corn (prior year: 4,700 tonnes), and

·

for the sale of 4,600 tonnes of corn (prior year: 9,050 tonnes) and the sale of 8,250 tonnes of white sugar (prior year:

·

0 tonnes). These positions represented an aggregate contract amount of  62,101 thousand (prior year:  27,462 thou-

·

sand) and, based on the underlying closing prices, had a combined net negative fair value of  3,789 thousand (prior

·

year: positive fair value of  519 thousand).

·

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 154

Legal risks AGRANA continually monitors changes in the legal setting relevant to its businesses that may lead to a risk situation, and takes risk management actions as necessary. This applies particularly to compliance matters and food and environmental legislation; the Group maintains dedicated staff positions for these areas.
There are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As noted in previous annual reports, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority in 2010 sought a fine under an antitrust case for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to Austria filed against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany. To date the Cartel Court has not ruled on the case. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.

A further contingent liability of  6,425 thousand (prior year:  6,600 thousand) related to a claim for recovery of an EU subsidy in Hungary. The management of the company involved believes the likelihood of repayment is low.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 156
Unlike the prior-year annual report, transactions with the other owners of the joint ventures are not reported.
In addition, at the balance sheet date, borrowings from related parties amounted to  220,470 thousand (prior year:  353,403 thousand); these borrowings were on normal commercial terms. Of this total,  130,000 thousand represented non-current borrowings (prior year:  130,000 thousand).
For fully consolidated subsidiaries, the Group issued guarantees in favour of companies with significant influence of  5,000 thousand (prior year:  17,958 thousand), of which an amount of  1,022 thousand (prior year:  9,345 thousand) was utilised.
The remuneration of the members of the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG totalled  3,183 thousand (prior year:  3,365 thousand), consisting of total fixed base salaries of  1,445 thousand (prior year:  1,693 thousand) and a total performance-based, variable component of  1,738 thousand (prior year:  1,672 thousand). The performance-based elements of the compensation are linked to the amount of the dividend payable for the last three financial years. The Management Board member of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG appointed on the basis of the syndicate agreement between Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany, and Zucker-Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H, Vienna, does not receive compensation for serving on the Management Board.
On 3 July 2015 the Annual General Meeting approved an annual aggregate remuneration for the Supervisory Board of  250 thousand (prior year:  250 thousand) and delegated to the Supervisory Board Chairman the responsibility for allocating this sum. The amount paid to the individual Supervisory Board members is tied to their function on the Board. No meeting fees were paid in the year under review.
Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board members Johann Marihart and Fritz Gattermayer and the former Management Board member Walter Grausam under the Company's plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme (ASVG) are met. The amount of the pension is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assessment base. In the event of early retirement within ASVG rules, the amount of the pension is reduced. For the pension of Stephan Büttner, there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached 55 years of age if the employment contract is terminated by the employer. For the 2015|16 financial year, pension fund contributions of  720 thousand were paid (prior year:  2,955 thousand).
The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund. In the balance sheet at 29 February 2016, within the item "retirement and termination benefit obligations", an amount of  6,646 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year:  8,058 thousand) and an amount of  1,986 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year:  1,906 thousand).
In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act or the Occupational Pension Plan Act.
Information on the Management Board and Supervisory Board is provided on page 158.

Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing ­ ISA. In accordance with International Standards on Auditing, we are required to comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Group's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

D
Deficit countries/markets/regions: Countries, markets or regions that consume more sugar than they produce and which therefore cover their needs through sugar imports. In Europe, in connection with the surrendering of quotas under the EU sugar regime, this concerns countries such as Ireland, Italy and Portugal, as well as Hungary and Romania.
E
Emission: Generally signifies the release of noxious substances such as pollutants or greenhouse gases into the environment. A typical example are car exhaust fumes.
Ethanol: Ethanol is a form of alcohol and is a clear, flammable liquid. It is also known as pure alcohol, grain alcohol or drinking alcohol, and is found in drinks such as wine and beer. In recent years, ethanol has acquired great importance outside the beverage industry as a biofuel referred to as bioethanol. See bioethanol.
EU Biofuels Directive: The so-called Biofuels Directive of the European Parliament and European Council dated 26 March 2009 regulates the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels (for example, wind and solar energy, geothermal and hydropower) in the transport sector. The Directive specifies the percentage of renewable fuels within total fuel consumption, but does not prescribe how these targets must be reached (blending of biogenic with fossil fuels, or use of alternative fuels). Under the Directive, fuels defined as biogenic include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biomethanol, biodimethyl ether, bio-ETBE, bio-MTBE, synthetic biofuels and pure plant oils.
EU sugar regime: See sugar regime.
Exports of sugar to non-EU countries: The licences necessary for these sugar exports are distributed by the EU to sugar producers through a tender process.

F
Fermentation: In the context of biotechnology, fermentation (zymosis) means the conversion of biological material through the addition of enzymes (known as "ferment") or in the presence of bacterial, fungal or cell cultures.
F.O.Licht: A leading private-sector source of analysis on the global markets for sugar, ethanol, molasses, feed additives, biofuels, coffee and tea, F.O.Licht publishes a wide range of print reports and organises conferences for the sugar and ethanol industries.
Fruit juice concentrate: Forming the basis for fruit juice drinks, fruit juice concentrates are sold into the fruit juice and beverage industry. The same quantity of water carefully removed from the pressed fruit juice is later added to the concentrate again to create the end product for consumption. The result is high-quality juice with 100% fruit content.
Fruit preparations: Sometimes referred to as fruit ingredients. High-quality fruit is prepared in liquid or piece form and thermally preserved for further processing, especially for use by the dairy, ice-cream and bakery industries.
G
GMO: Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering.
Gross value added: Gross value added, a measure used in national accounts, is the total value of the goods and services generated in the production process (known as gross output), less the value of goods and services consumed, processed or converted in the production process (referred to as intermediate consumption). Expressed differently, gross value added represents the amount available to spend on the production factors of labour (wages and salaries) and capital (profit, interest on borrowed capital, and depreciation).
Direct effects: Direct effects represent the amount of gross value-added or of employment generated within a given company or economic entity.

Production levy: The production levy for sugar quotas is  12 per tonne. From the 2007|08 sugar marketing year, up to one-half of the levy can be paid by the sugar beet farmers. For isoglucose, the amount of the levy is 50% of that for sugar. The production levy is an administrative tax paid to the EU.
Production quota: See sugar quota.
Q
Quota: See sugar quota.
Quota sugar: The amount of sugar produced and marketed in the course of a sugar marketing year within the allotted production quota.
Quota sugar beets: The amount of sugar beet necessary to fully utilise the production quota for sugar.
R
"Ramsar Convention" on wetlands: The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) ­ called the "Ramsar Convention" ­ is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments of its member countries to maintain the ecological character of their Wetlands of International Importance and to plan for the "wise", or sustainable use, of all of the wetlands in their territories.
Raw sugar: Raw sugar is a semi-finished form of cane sugar (or of beet sugar) in which the sugar crystals are not yet completely freed from the adhering non-sugar materials, which give it its brown colour.

Reference price: The reference price set in the EU sugar regime for EU quota sugar is used to find the minimum prices for sugar beets and does not have any direct effect on the market price, which is determined by supply and demand.
Refining: The term "refining" in its general sense refers to a technical process for the cleaning, processing, separation or concentration of raw materials. In the case of sugar, it means the de-coloration of brown raw sugar (from sugar cane or sugar beet) through repeated recrystallisation.
S
Starch: Starch is an organic compound and one of the most important energy storage materials in plant cells. In our latitudes, starch is mainly acquired from corn, wheat or potatoes. To extract starch, the starch-containing parts of the plants are milled to a small size and the starch is washed out. Through filtration and centrifugation steps, the starch is extracted. After the final stage of drying, native starch emerges from the process as a white powder.
Sugar: In Europe, sugar is produced from sugar beet. In sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world, sugar cane is the main raw material for sugar production. The term "sugar" in general usage typically refers to granulated sugar, i.e., sucrose. However, there are several other types of sugar, including glucose, fructose and lactose, among others. All are part of the carbohydrate food group.
Sugar beet: Sugar beet is an agricultural crop grown almost exclusively for sugar production. The sugar beet plant consists of the leaves and a large, fleshy root. The root stores sucrose, which is extracted in the sugar factory.
Sugar marketing year (SMY): The sugar marketing year of the European Union begins on 1 October and ends on 30 September of the following year. This definition applies for all regulations of the EU sugar market.

Sugar production: In sugar production from sugar beet, raw juice is extracted from the sugar beet slices. The juice is then cleaned in several stages and eventually thickened until sugar crystallises from it. Through repeated recrystallisation, the sugar is purified to produce clean, white crystals. These crystals have a sucrose content of very close to 100%. That makes sugar an extremely pure food product with an almost unlimited shelf life.
Sugar quota: Under the EU sugar regime, a production quota for sugar and isoglucose is set for every EU member state that produces sugar. Each national quota is apportioned among the respective country's sugar-producing companies as their individual production quota. This restricts production volumes and minimises surpluses.
Sugar regime: The European Union's regulatory framework existing since 1968 for sugar quotas and tariffs serves to regulate the EU common market for sugar and ensure intra-EU sugar production.
T
Triticale: As a hybrid grain resulting from the crossing of wheat and rye, triticale combines the characteristics of both these grains in terms of flavour and composition. Thanks to its higher starch content, triticale is also used as an energy crop for the production of bioethanol.
W
West Balkan Agreement: Since autumn 2000 the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia may import limited quantities of duty-free sugar (among other products) into the EU. The EU has since then concluded corresponding free trade agreements with Croatia and Serbia.
White sugar: Also called granulated or table sugar, white sugar is produced by crystallisation and centrifugation.
WTO (World Trade Organisation): In the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation, its currently 157 member states negotiate the liberalisation of world trade.

Forward-looking statements This annual report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions and estimates made by the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Although these assumptions, plans and projections represent the Management Board's current intentions and best knowledge, a large number of internal and external factors may cause actual future developments and results to differ materially from these assumptions and estimates. Some examples of such factors are, without limitation: negotiations concerning world trade agreements; changes in the overall economic environment, especially in macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; EU sugar policy; consumer behaviour; and public policy related to food and energy. AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG does not guarantee in any way that the actual future developments and actual future results achieved will match the assumptions and estimates expressed or made in this annual report, and does not accept any liability in the event that assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect.
In the interest of readability, this document may occasionally use language that is not gender-neutral. Any gender-specific references should be understood to include masculine, feminine and neuter as the context permits.
As a result of the standard round-half-up convention used in rounding individual amounts and percentages, this report may contain minor, immaterial rounding errors.
No liability is assumed for misprints, typographical or similar errors.
The English translation of the AGRANA annual report is solely for readers' convenience and is not definitive. In the event of discrepancy or dispute, only the German-language version shall govern.
