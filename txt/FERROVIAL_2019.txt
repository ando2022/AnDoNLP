The Services business is treated as Discontinued Activity in this Report. In accordance with the applicable accounting regulations, in the Consolidated Financial Statements balance sheet, all assets and liabilities have been reclassified in a line of assets held for sale, and the after-tax result generated by the Services activity is reported in a single line of the P&L account called "discontinued activities" for 2019 and 2018. In addition, the accounting standard requires valuing the assets at the lowest value between their carrying amount and their fair value (estimated sale price) minus sales costs. In the Consolidated Management Report and according to the requirements of Law 11/2018, the non-financial information for 2019 includes the Services division in the perimeter in order to inform about all aspects and impacts of the business.

Fellow shareholder,

T he traffic, profit and customer satisfaction figures of our main assets continued their positive trend of previous years. In addition to good performances at Highway 407 (Toronto) and Heathrow Airport, the NTE ­ one of our Managed Lanes project in Texas -- distributed its first dividend. Overall, Ferrovial was able to collect more than 729 million in dividends from the assets in its portfolio.

2019 has also been the year in which we have been working on a strategic reset for the business through a five-year plan ­ Horizon 24. This strategic reset will help reposition Ferrovial as a more agile and sustainable company, while continuing to focus on enhancing profits, efficiency and innovation across the board. We also welcomed our new CEO in October 2019, Ignacio Madridejos, who brings with him a wealth of experience. I am confident in his ability to lead Ferrovial through its new chapter.
Last year, we also began the process of divesting the Services division with the sale of the business in Australia and New Zealand. Until this sale process is completed, we will continue to report that division's results under discontinued operations and its assets at fair value.
In addition, the sale of a stake in Ausol under the asset rotation policy provided a sizeable cash influx and enabled us to deconsolidate the related debt.
Key developments in 2019 included winning the Silvertown Tunnel project in London and securing another extension of the NTE, which will allow us to strengthen our role as key infrastructure operators in Texas. In addition, we opened the Toowoomba highway in Australia, as well as the I-77, another Managed Lanes project in North Carolina. Construction has focused on risk reduction, maintaining competitiveness and seeking growth in high-value concessions.
Within our Airports division, Heathrow set another record with 81 million passengers, an 18% increase since 2010, while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. The plan to expand the airport is currently advancing through the local planning stages.
Net profit amounted to 270 million, an increase of 160% year-onyear. Revenues from continuing operations amounted to 6.054 billion, an increase of 5.5%. The combined Construction and Services backlog amounted to 29.080 billion.
The cash position, excluding infrastructure projects but including services, amounted to 1.631 billion.
Shareholder remuneration remained in the range announced at last year's Shareholders' Meeting -- 520 million -- in terms of dividends and share buybacks. Investors have responded positively to Ferrovial's strategy, with the share price appreciating by 52.4%,

RAFAEL DEL PINO Chairman
making Ferrovial one of the best performers on the IBEX, which gained 11.8% overall.
There is significant change in terms of technology, demographics, sustainability, and mobility habits around the world, offering many opportunities for Ferrovial and our assets. Our toll roads and airports, such as the 407 ETR, the Managed Lanes, and Heathrow not only represent innovative, sustainable and efficient solutions but are also models we want to emulate as we continue to grow.
In terms of sustainability, Ferrovial was recognized as the leader in its sector by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and was awarded the Gold Class. Our sustained commitment to the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations was further recognized by our inclusion in the most prestigious indexes including FTSE4Good, MSCI, CDP and Vigeo.
Our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and our support to the Global Compact underscore our goal to improve our legacy for future generations by constructing and maintaining efficient infrastructure that ensures mobility on a more sustainable level. In a year during which we were confronted by immense environmental challenges, Ferrovial made notable progress by cutting its CO2 emissions, marking a reduction of 59% in relative terms since 2009, while renewing its commitment to be a carbonneutral company by 2050. I cannot conclude without emphasizing the importance of the care and protection of our workers, an area in which we will continue to take active measures.
We are unsatisfied with this year's accident rate; consecuently, we have taken the necessary mesures to face this situation.
Finally, I would like to recognize the commitment and the contribution of the group's employees, who are instrumental to the success of Ferrovial. And I would also like to thank our shareholders and clients for their continued support for Ferrovial giving us the confidence to continue working on projects that generate value for all our stakeholders and for society as a whole.

Strategy
Sustainable infrastructures

Ferrovial has updated its strategy to reaffirm its focus on the development and operation of infrastructures.

A sector with 3.7 trillion-dollar investments required per year. A significant part of these investments will be channeled into transport infrastructure, including roads (0.9 trillion-dollar per year) and airports.
The infrastructure sector is experiencing a transformation driven by changes in demographics, social habits, technology, mobility and environmental concerns. This dynamic context presents opportunities for Ferrovial, as it impacts the way infrastructure will be designed, constructed and operated in the future.
n The concentration of population in cities and the consequent congestion in the existing access routes will demand innovative alternatives, upgrades and new infrastructure. These solutions should take into consideration future needs, such as those related to the increasing interconnectivity among infrastructure, vehicles and users.
n E-commerce and on-demand delivery will contribute to changes in transport and logistics developments. Consumers demand a wide offering of products, short delivery times and easy returns, leading to more vehicles on the roads and to new traffic patterns. In addition, further development of autonomous vehicles will introduce new technology requirements in infrastructure.
n Climate change concerns and decarbonization commitments will also require new solutions in infrastructure development and operation, such as recharging networks for electric vehicles or traffic management systems to reduce congestion or to give circulation preference to low carbon vehicles.
In addition to the above-mentioned trends, the company also faces challenges such as: the evolution of regulatory frameworks and commercial, political and social tensions (in the countries where it operates), the increasing competition (both from infrastructure companies and from financial investors), and the transport decarbonization.

PURPOSE Sustainable infrastructure for a world on the
move.
VISION Develop and operate sustainable, innovative and efficient infrastructure while creating value for our stakeholders.
VALUES Respect, Collaboration, Excellence, Innovation,
Integrity.

STRATEGY
Strategic priorities
n People: ensure the highest standards for health and safety in its operations, foster diversity and local talent, and continue to reinforce the engagement level of its employees.
n Sustainable growth: develop infrastructure projects with high concessional value. The company reaffirms its focus on toll roads and airports, with a pipeline of more than 12 B in infrastructure projects.
In Toll Roads, Ferrovial will continue developing greenfield projects, proactively generating pipeline in Managed Lanes, while maintaining its competitive advantages in standard traffic risk and availability projects.
In Airports, the company will leverage its expertise in development and operation, actively managing its portfolio and partnering to grow.
Ferrovial will reinforce its Construction presence where it is key to develop greenfield infrastructure projects. The core concessions markets for Ferrovial are USA,UK,Canada,Poland,Spain,Chile,Colombia and Peru, and the company will also invest selectively in other regions.
Additionally, Ferrovial will also explore new sustainable infrastructure related opportunities, such as electrification, mobility and water.
n Operational excellence: continue to focus on efficiency at all levels, both in the design and execution of construction projects as well as in the management of the assets in portfolio. In construction, the company will maintain its references and capabilities in the design and construction of complex projects, and will review and optimize its core processes. In concessions, Ferrovial will continue leveraging its distinctive operation skills, such as revenue management, traffic optimization and customer service, with expertise in unique assets, such as the 407ETR, the Texas managed lanes and Heathrow.

CHAPTER 1.2 | STRATEGY AND VALUE CREATION

22

The company will implement a new operating model to become more agile, innovative and efficient. The new model maintains the emphasis on accountability, promotes entrepreneurship and collaboration, and increases the level of digitalization and automation. In order to implement this new of operating model, the company will simplify processes, create shared service centers and review non-personnel expenses.
Solutions for a low carbon environment and corporate social responsibility are at the core of Ferrovial's strategy. The company is implementing

a decarbonization roadmap and has also defined a CSR plan aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Ferrovial will continue to be proactively engaged with the sustainable development of its operations to maintain its presence in sustainability indexes such as the Dow Jones Sustainability, Carbon Disclosure Project and FTSE4Good among others.
n Innovation: generate new competitive advantages and anticipate potential disruptions that may impact the company's businesses or that could present new business opportunities. In order to reinforce its value creation in the future, Ferrovial will develop both incremental innovation at the business unit level and disruptive at the corporate level, and will continue sponsoring the company's entrepreneurial culture.

Stepping on it

Cintra helps reduce the investment shortfall in infrastructures mainly in increasingly congested urban settings with sustainable concession models that minimize the need for public funds.

was awarded and closed the financing of the Silvertown project in London, a greenfield project with an investment of over 1,200 million pounds, which required over 1,100 million pounds of debt and which will be executed in the next 5 years to go into operation during the next 25.

C intra carries out its activity in markets with predictable institutional frameworks, good economic perspectives (North America, Australia and Europe), with developed financial markets, and with high demand for transport infrastructures, especially those that are resolving traffic congestion problems in urban areas (complex greenfield concessions) and with toll rate freedom. Its more than 50 years of experience, in-depth knowledge of new technologies applied to pricing (advanced analytics), as well as the synergies with Ferrovial Agroman make Cintra a company with high value creation and strong competitive advantages.
MAIN ASSETS
Cintra possesses 43.23% of the 407 ETR Toll Road in Toronto, Canada, and 62.97%, 54.6% and 53.67% of the NTE, LBJ and NTE 35W Managed Lanes in the state of Texas, respectively. In 2019, the I-77 (50.10%) in North Carolina was fully opened to traffic. The I-66 (50%) in Virginia remains in the construction phase.
In Managed Lanes, toll rates are dynamic and can be changed every five minutes according to the level of congestion, guaranteeing drivers a minimum speed at all times. Free-flow toll systems (no barriers) are notable for the long term of the concession, and broad rate flexibility and for an optimized long-term financial structure, making Cintra a leader in the private development of high-complexity transport infrastructures.
VALUE CREATION
High-complexity greenfield projects
Cintra is centered on complex greenfield projects owing to their high value-creation potential. Its ability to assess and assume higher levels of risk associated with the project in the bidding phase (construction, financing, operation and traffic) allows it to opt for higher initial rates of return (IRR). Thus, Cintra led a Consortium that in 2019

The value creation process lies in the reduction in the discount rate of future cash flows and in the elimination (construction) or reduction (traffic/financing) of the project's risks as the concession progresses.
One example of this decrease in the discount rate is the refinancing of all of NTE's debt. 400 million dollars were raised in the market of private activity bonds (PAB's) at 20 years with an all-in cost of 3.05% and 871 million dollars in taxable bonds at 30 years with an all-in cost of 4.03%. Both issues were quite successful among investors. The result was a drop in the average cost of 1.50% (to 3.80%), an increase in the repayment term of the debt and an improvement of the rating (BBB from Fitch/Baa2 from Moody's), all this maximizing the payment to shareholders through the first dividend subscribed by the project in December 2019. Another example was the sale of 11.7% of the Ruta del Cacao Toll Road to the British infrastructure company John Laing for 28.6 million euros, which generated capital gains of close to 11 million euros, thanks to the fact that it materialised after the financial closure of the project and therefore eliminated that risk.
Cintra's advanced analytics team was consolidated in 2019 in Austin, Dallas and Toronto. It works on highvalue projects like machine learning for dynamic realtime pricing or artificial intelligence for automatic vehicle detection. It is also developing new toll projects targetted at different client segments to support the use of Managed Lanes.
Turnover of mature assets
By reducing risks, the value created is materialised in the sale of mature projects, with use of the revenue for investment in new assets with greater value-creation potential. An example is the transfer to the Meridiam infrastructure fund of 65% of the Ausol toll roads for 451 million euros (with an implicit valuation 60% above the market consensus, showing the strong appetite for this asset category). Cintra continues to be the key industrial partner, with 15% of the asset, on which it has reserved a put option and granted a call option to Meridiam. In addition, Cintra has signed a management contract for the provision of certain long-term concession services.

Socially responsible infrastructures
Owing to their complexity, innovation and efficiency, Cintra's projects offer sustainable solutions that improve congestion in large cities, reduce pollution, reduce accidents, increase users' satisfaction by improving its safety and people's quality of life. In the state of Texas, Cintra is operating the first carbon neutral toll road, the NTE, a feature that is evident when comparing the pre-existing scenario (existing road) and the present (the existing road plus the NTE), meaning that there is no emissions increase in the region despite the greater capacity of the infrastructure because of the reduction in congestion.
Users: excellence in service
Client satisfaction is a priority for Cintra. In 2019, the 407 ETR Toll Road achieved its high levels of client satisfaction of 87% in toll road service and in its call center, which handled 3.3 million requests and again won awards for its excellence in the quality of service for the sixth consecutive year as a World Class Call Center.
Employees: support for merit
Cintra offers opportunities for the professional development of all its employees by promoting internal mobility and ensuring that merit is the decisive factor in their career. In 2019, 16% of estructure employees changed their job or location, and one of each four people are working in an international assignment.
URBAN MOBILITY PRICING
Cintra actively participates in initiatives to reduce pollution and congestion in urban areas through a sustainable approach. Ferrovial is developing a strategy to generate the right incentives to use more sustainable modes of transport in the city. Applying intelligent tariffs to available capacity can encourage the use of less polluting and higher occupancy vehicles at off-peak times, giving citizens more options, while reducing congestion and pollution, and ultimately creating more liveable cities.

NEW MANAGED LANES IN THE 35W: 3C SECTION
In 2019, Cintra financially closed a new section of the NTE 35W Toll Road,the 3C,in Texas,a Managed Lanes project of high technical complexity and high concession value, with an investment of roughly 1 billion dollars and a concession term of nearly 50 years. The agreement includes work on a section of nearly 11 kilometres of road, with renovation of existing lanes, which will remain toll-free; and the construction of two Managed Lanes in each direction, in addition to acceleration lanes. To finance the investment, Cintra has undertaken an issue of 750 million dollars in private activity bonds (PABs), with profitability (yield to worst) of 3.25% and maturing in 2058. The issue was also very successful among investors. The debt received a BBB rating from Fitch Ratings and Baa3 from Moody's.

Airports
Growth and service quality

Ferrovial Aeropuertos is one of the leading private investors and operators of airports in the world. It has four assets in the United Kingdom: Heathrow (25%), the airport with the highest volume of passenger traffic in Europe and the seventh highest volume worldwide, as well as AGS (50%), consisting of the Aberdeen Glasgow and Southampton airports. Ferrovial is also developing its transmission lines business with current operations in Chile.

I n 2019, Heathrow registered a record number of 80.9 million passengers, which represents an increase of 1% over the previous year and the ninth consecutive year of growth. After a period of strong growth, the aviation market in AGS is becoming consolidated, especially with regard to low-cost airline companies.

Furthermore, in 2019 the business dedicated to the development and management of electrical transmission lines continued to make progress in the construction and operation of the Centella substation and 250 kilometres of lines in the city of Salamanca, north of Santiago de Chile.
In conjunction with Transchile, which owns a 204-kilometre line in the Araucanía region in southern Chile, Ferrovial has an cumulative capacity of 2,160 MW and has become one of the most significant players in the country.

The assets in the United Kingdom have detailed plans in place to guarantee proper operation and passenger service after the final break with the European Union. Regarding the effects of Brexit on the activity, the United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed to extend current agreements, which will significantly reduce the risk of flights being interrupted.
It should be noted that Ferrovial Aeropuertos has bolstered its offices established in 2018 in Austin (USA) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) to provide support for the division's tendering activities in the American and Asian markets.

VALUE CREATION
Operational efficiency and service quality
Heathrow stands out for its solid financial performance, which has resulted in a 4.5% increase in EBITDA compared to the previous year, due to the investments made in improvements to luggage systems, immigration control, security services, business initiatives and passenger services.
The improvements to service quality are evidenced by the results of the passenger satisfaction surveys (ASQs), which have reached record levels of approval at 4.17 over 5 (4.15 in 2018). Moreover, 82% of passengers scored their experience as "excellent" or "very good".

During 2019, Great Hall Partners LLC (a consortium led by Ferrovial Aeropuertos) received written notice for the termination of the contract to remodel Denver Airport. At the end of this contract, the excess cash flow was distributed to the shareholders. Ferrovial received 21 million euro in dividends.

Heathrow was recognised by the Skytrax World Airport Awards as the "Best Airport in Western Europe" and "Best Airport for Purchases" for the fifth and tenth consecutive time, respectively. In addition, Terminal 5 of the London-based hub headed the list of best airport terminals in the world for the sixth time in its eleven-year history.
AGS, in turn, has established a new operating model focused on service quality, simplifying processes and reducing costs. Among the most important initiatives are the closure

HEATHROW IS NOW CARBON NEUTRAL
After two years of work and an investment of more than 100 million pounds, Heathrow has become a carbon neutral airport, as set forth in the Heathrow 2.0 strategic plan announced in 2017. All of its terminals operate with 100% renewable energy sources, while it currently operates the largest fleet of electric vehicles in Europe. The airport also intends to make investments in upcoming years to eliminate the emissions caused by its operations by mid 2030.
In addition, the airport is working on capturing carbon in the atmosphere through projects such as renewal and restoration of peat bogs and research in new methods of agriculture.
Heathrow is promoting the elimination of flight emissions by working alongside airlines, industry partners and government organisations to continue making progress in the development of alternative fuels and providing support for the development of technologies that can reduce flight emissions.

of the defined benefit pension plans, outsourcing of the security and fire prevention services and the optimization of supplier contracts.
Sustainability
The airports operated by Ferrovial are firmly committed to operate at the highest possible levels of sustainability by promoting economic and social development and putting in place initiatives that will minimize the impact of the industry on the environment.
Throughout 2019, Heathrow continued its strategy to implement initiatives and achieve milestones such as the Wildlife Trust's Biodiversity Benchmark award for the eleventh time and becoming the first airport in the world to reach the maximum Carbon Trust rating for its active participation in reducing emissions in its supply chain. Currently, 96% of the vehicle fleet at Heathrow is electric or hybrid. Glasgow airport has become the first airport in the United Kingdom to make use of a fleet of buses that are 100% electric, operating between the terminal and the long distance parking lot.
Innovation
Among the main innovation projects developed in 2019, the following are worthy of mention:
n Artificial intelligence for landing strip maintenance. The Aberdeen airport has chosen artificial intelligence to control the condition of the asphalt in the airport by using a mobile application and a web platform.
n Using drones to inspect transmission lines. In collaboration with the innovation team, a new project has been carried out with drones that intends to replace the traditional and manual inspection method with a method that is more efficient, automated and safer.

BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE EXPANSION OF HEATHROW
During 2019, Heathrow has continued making progress in its intention to expand the airport, which includes the construction of a third runway. The airport presented its second public appraisal midway through 2019. The results will be included in the final plan, which will be submitted to the British Government (Development Consent Order) at the end of 2020.
This plan will include the details of the investment made by Heathrow in the 2022 - 2036 period to create an airport that provides service to and connects more than 130 million passengers from all over the world. The plan will also make it possible to reduce ticket prices significantly, increase airline offers and improve passenger satisfaction.

Construction
Project selection
The Ferrovial Construction division is key in its strategy, focused on the development of complex infrastructure assets.

F

errovial Agroman is the business unit that carries out civil engineering construction, building and industrial projects. It is internationally renowned for its design

capacity and construction of

exceptional projects, and primarily for its major trans-

port infrastructures.

In recent years the construction sector has been experiencing particularly, at international level, low profitability margins due to excessively aggressive commercial strategies, imbalances in risk transfer with customers and cost inflation processes. The strong competitiveness in 2019 affected the profitability of Ferrovial Agroman, which has registered losses mainly due to the provision in first quarter of 2019 of 345 million euros (100%) to cover potential losses in some projects in the United States due to the increase in prices in subcontracting and raw materials, as well as the extension of the approval periods in the design phase.

To recover the positive path of profitability margins, Ferrovial Agroman's Management has introduced as mitigating measures the selective bidding of projects in strategic areas for the company, reinforcing its execution with its own means, intensifying risk management with improvements in operational processes and including a digital transformation plan oriented to process control in all phases of the project, tender, design and execution. Additionally, design capabilities in projects have been strengthened and teams have been formed to improve collaboration between bidding and execution departments. The improvement in margins is expected to culminate in 2024, where an operating profit margin target of 3.5% has been set for the division, although by 2020 cash flow consumption is expected from the repayment of part of the advances and payments for the execution of major works, especially in the USA.

Ferrovial Agroman focuses on the international market, in which it faces fierce competition from global construction companies and local businesses alike. It targets complex projects in countries that have stable economies and are committed to modernizing their infrastructure.

Poland continues with good and stable prospects for medium-term contracting thanks to current investment plans in roads and railroads extended

until 2025-26. After a period of increases in the prices of raw materials and labor resources, a more stable environment is expected over the next few years.
In Spain, the parliamentary situation has not allowed the approval of the General Budgets, while the expected recovery in the sector has not taken place, although the good dynamics of public initiatives happening for the construction or improvement of railroad infrastructure (ADIF), or of airports (AENA).
In the United States and Canada, states and provinces are continuing to step up their investment with the support of the federal government. Highlights here include the privately-funded P3 and DBF projects, where Ferrovial has extensive experience. In 2019, bidding on road infrastructure in Texas reached an all-time high.
VALUE CREATION
Construction is a key part of Ferrovial's strategy thanks to its expertise in complex international construction projects. Together with its own profitability and cash generation capacity, this division provides value by coordinating the design and construction of transportation infrastructure concessions in which other investment divisions of the Group participate. At the same time, it offers optimal technical solutions and closed prices and construction deadlines, maximizing the added value to the customer and the competitiveness of the bids. This collaboration has resulted, in the financial closures of the NTE Segment 3C (USA) and the Silvertown Tunnel in London (United Kingdom), both in 2019.
Portfolio diversification
The company specializes in highly technical projects, which it is able to carry out thanks to its experience and the international presence of over 300 employees from its Technical Office, who are adept at seeking out unrivaled engineering solutions. In this respect, sector diversification and bidding for less strategic projects, which allow technical expertise to be maintained, enable Ferrovial Agroman to have materials and human resources continually prepared for the company's needs when bidding for complex infrastructure concessions. In 2019, numerous awards were received, including those awarded to the NTE 35W projects, Best Design-Build Award by JLT Build America, and Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, named Most Innovative Road Construction by Build Magazine.
Selective internationalization
The international business remains focused on the US and Polish markets, which account for 62% of total sales. Among other countries with a stable presence, the United Kingdom, Canada, Chile and Australia stand out, as well as Spain as the home market.
Committed to society: environment, quality and safety
Ferrovial Agroman undertakes its operations under strict criteria of minimizing its contribution to climate change through sustainable infrastructure and buildings, and based on waste management according to the circular economy model. A good example of this is LEED Platinum certification, the highest international standard a building can earn for sustainability awarded by the US Green Building

NEW TUNNEL UNDER THE THAMES RIVER
Transport for London has again chosen Ferrovial to build the first infrastructure to cross the River Thames that it has been developing since 1991. The Silvertown Tunnel project will be executed along with Bam Nuttal and SK E&C for 1.15 billion euros, and includes the design and construction of two 1.4-kilometer long twin tunnels under the river with their corresponding access ramps.
Silvertown Tunnel will be the largest road tunnel in the United Kingdom that includes bus lanes in both directions, allowing approximately 37 buses per hour to run in each direction, and will enable an estimated saving of one million hours per year for drivers crossing the river in its area of influence. In addition, it will have a positive impact on air quality by reducing congestion, and tolls will be set up in order to promote sustainable forms of transport and facilitate the increase in the supply of public transportation.

Innovation driving improvement
Ferrovial Agroman remains committed to R&D+i and digital transformation, as shown by the enhancement of BIM (Building Information Modeling) in all geographical areas, or the participation in various research projects such as Shift2Rail of the EU Horizon 2020 program, to optimize and maximize the performance of track equipment, or the development, together with its subsidiary Ditecpesa, of a smart road surface for driving autonomous cars.
Employees: talent management
The employees of Ferrovial Agroman possess extensive experience and professional value imbuing projects with a local know-how. In 2019, the Technical Manager of Ferrovial Agroman was awarded the gold medal with distinction by the Road Association 2019.

COMMITMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
Ferrovial Agroman shows its commitment to the environment by using renewable energy, recycling materials and recovering waste. A good example of this is the use of night lighting towers with photovoltaic LED panels in the regeneration work of the Adolfo Suarez MadridBarajas Airport runway, with an emission savings of 13,771 kg of CO2, the reuse of recycled material to manufacture retaining walls on the I-66 and Grand Parkway toll roads, and the collaboration with MIT to develop technology for waste recovery through hydrothermal carbonation for its transformation into nanostructured materials for later use.

Services
Innovative and sustainable solutions

Ferrovial Servicios contributes to sustainable development on the geographical areas where it operates by designing and providing solutions that are efficient, both economically and environmentally, for the comprehensive maintenance of infrastructures and, the implementation of the circular economy model.

A s announced in February 2019, Ferrovial has decided to sell its Services business with the aim of concentrating on developing its infrastructures business. The process of divesting in Services is in progress, and within this framework an agreement was reached in December for the sale of Broadspectrum (Services business in Australia and New Zealand) to a company controlled by Ventia Services Group for an enterprise value of 327 million euros. Also, in July 2019 Ferrovial Servicios ceased its operations in Poland on the sale of its 51% share in the FBSerwis company to its local partner Budimex, a subsidiary of Ferrovial Agroman. The rest of the Services business (including Spain, United Kingdom and International markets) remains under the classification of discontinued activity and classified as maintained for sale.
BACKGROUND
Ferrovial Servicios undertakes its activity in nine countries, with its main markets being the United Kingdom, Spain and North America.
In the United Kingdom, the difficult market conditions prevailing in recent years continue, with very tight margins and severe financial difficulties for some companies within the sector, pending further clarity in public entity budgets following the recent elections. In 2019, Amey signed an agreement with Birmingham City Council for early termination of the contract for maintenance and management of the road network for a payment of 215 million pounds (of which 160 were paid in 2019). Also, with the arrival of Amanda Fisher as the new CEO, the company is undertaking an in-depth review of its activities to concentrate on railways, consultancy and "facility management". In order to achieve higher operational efficiency, in addition to optimizing the structure of the support functions, the company is considering selling, on the one hand, the waste and treatment energy business and, on the other, divesting the services business to electricity and water companies.

In Spain, political and macroeconomic uncertainty has given rise to a slow down in new public contracts and a search for efficiency by the private sector. Ferrovial Servicios has grown profitably as a result of the combination of effective sales with investment in management systems and applied innovation.
Meanwhile, the favourable macroeconomic and industrial situation in North America has enabled the company to expand in the toll roads maintenance and crude oil infrastructures sectors.
VALUE CREATION
Ferrovial Servicios' sales showed an organic growth of 4.3% in 2019. This growth was the result of good positioning in all markets where it operates (especially in their Spanish and international business), as well on its distinguishing skills that enable it to compete successfully in highly demanding and complex projects.
Occupational safety
The occupational safety of its 71,852 employees is a priority for Ferrovial Servicios. The accident frequency index was 15.09% lower in 2019 as a result of implementing strategies and programs adapted to the circumstances prevalent in each country. Here are a few examples:
n Zero Code (United Kingdom): a code that highlights what should constitute key behaviour in a job position to guarantee safety.
n Safe for Life (Australia and New Zealand): a strategic health and safety model to be applied in all working environments.
n +Vial (Spain): a programme focussing on improved safety in road maintenance activities.
Sustainable growth
Ferrovial Servicios centers its activity on providing sustainable services for cities, infrastructures and facilities:
In Spain, in the environmental services activity, the company has started up a new recycling plant with a capacity for processing 50,000 tons yearly of PET plastic waste that is transformed into raw materials for industry. In the United Kingdom, the North Yorkshire and Milton Keynes energy recovery plants, that are both currently fully operative, are part of the facilities operated by the company with an installed capacity of 66 MW, equivalent to the energy consumed by 80,000 homes.
Another area of sustainable growth is energy efficiency, with an order book of over 400 million euros in Spain, that generates annual energy savings equivalent to 2% of the global objective in the National Energy Efficiency Plan. As proof of their know-how in this activity, the company has been awarded new contracts in Spain,

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | MANAGEMENT REPORT

RECYCLING OF 50,000 TONNES OF PLASTICS ANNUALLY
In a social environment that encourages the circular economy and a reduction in the use of plastics, Ferrovial Servicios have opened a plant for recycling PET (polythene terephthalate) plastic flakes from recovered containers. The facility is located in Les Franqueses del Vallès (Spain) and is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity for processing 50,000 tons a year, equivalent to the yearly generation of this type of plastic waste by 5 million people. The plant makes use of the latest technologies, resulting in minimum energy consumption and the ability to re-use water. The quality of the PET obtained at the plant has been approved for use in food and drink containers by the European Food Safety Authority. This activity contributes to reaching the objectives for the recovery of containers as laid down by the European Commission for the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, which aims to recycle 25% of the material used to produce plastic containers by 2025.
ROAD MAINTENANCE IN NORTH AMERICA
Ferrovial Servicios Internacional implemented a transformation program that has led to average sales growth of 18% and an improvement in the RBE of 20% during 2017-19 period. This change has been possible thanks to the incorporation of new professionals who are experts in the sector, the improvement of operations and customer satisfaction levels, and the restructuring of the bidding department. The company currently manages about 23,000 kilometres of roads in eight US states and the province of Ontario (Canada). In 2018 it won contracts in Ottawa, York and Peel Halton in Ontario, as well as several contracts in Florida and other states. In 2019, it was awarded, among others, the first comprehensive maintenance contract, tendered by the Michigan Department of Transportation.

as well as its first contract for public lighting in New Zealand, in the city of Dunedin.
Ferrovial Servicios has also been awarded significant contracts for the maintenance of infrastructures, such as an extension to the facility management contracts with the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (886 million euros), the maintenance of infrastructures for Sydney Water in Australia (660 million euros), toll roads maintenance in Ottawa and York in Canada (183 million euros) and the Kwinana British Petroleum refinery in Australia (116 million euros).
Operational efficiency
The company plans to simplify its support structure in a context of business growth, specially in all geographical areas' were there has been cost reduction programs with positive results. One example are the actions undertaken by Oil & Gas business units in the United States and defence units in Australia. Another example is the implementation of an Energy Control Centre, with savings of 4% in facilities managed in Spain, Portugal, Australia and the United States.
Digitalization
The application of new technologies and data analysis has provided a great opportunity for improving the safety, efficiency and functionality of services, while strengthening collaboration with customers and other interested parties. Ferrovial Servicios has a order book of over 100 innovate projects, including:
n DUGUD: an application to encourage the separation of organic waste in origin by citizens.
n Kuiko Pro: an intermediary platform between customers and suppliers in the facility management sector.
n XPERIoT: first remotely controlled hub for public lighting compatible with 5G technology.

Ferrovial, through its subsidiary Cintra, reached an agreement to sell 65% of Ausol for EUR451mn. Cintra will retain a 15% interest in Ausol, on which it has reserved a put option, and has granted a call option to Meridiam on this 15%.
NTE MANAGED LANE REFINANCING
Ferrovial, via Cintra, completed the refinancing of the original NTE debt (PABs and TIFIA). The new debt structure includes PABs and taxable bonds. This refinancing agreement has led to a lower cost of debt (yield to maturity of 3.8% vs previous average coupon of 5.3%) and longer maturity terms (30 years of the tranche subject to tax vs. 15 years of previous TIFIA loan).

BROADSPECTRUM SALE AGREEMENT

Ferrovial reached an agreement for the sale of Broadspectrum (Services business in Australia and New Zealand) to Ventia Services Group for an enterprise value of AUD524.5mn (c. EUR327mn) in December. The completion of the transaction is subject to usual conditions, including regulatory and competition authorizations.

RESULTS BY DIVISION
Toll roads: significant revenue growth with higher contribution from US Managed Lanes and improvements in traffic on the majority of toll roads. 407 ETR traffic was flat (-0.2%) affected by adverse weather conditions and fewer incidents on alternative routes, partially offset by higher economic growth and more construction activity on alternative routes. Managed Lanes were boosted by new connections in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and continued to post strong EBITDA growth on the back of robust traffic (NTE +14.7%, LBJ +9.1% y NTE35W +25.3% in 4Q vs. 4Q 2018) and toll rates.
Airports: passengers at Heathrow reached a record high of 80.9mn, (+1.0%). AGS traffic declined by -7.8%, due to lower traffic at all three airports. Revenue growth in all our airports.
Construction: revenues (+0.3% LfL) in line with 2018, with 86% of international contribution. EBIT stood at -EUR365mn, impacted by the provision registered in 1Q 2019. The order book stood at EUR11,424mn (+2.8% LfL), not including pre-awarded contracts exceeding EUR600mn.
Services ex-Birmingham (discontinued operations): net income from discontinued of -EUR198mn mainly due to the fair value adjustment of Broadspectrum. The company remains committed to divest the Services division.
EUR1,631mn net cash ex-infra projects (including discontinued operations). Net debt infra reached EUR4,588mn (EUR4,885mn in December 2018). Net consolidated debt reached EUR2,957mn (EUR3,649mn in December 2018).

· Toll revenues (93% of total): +8.3% to CAD1,402mn, mainly due to tariff increases effective since February 2019 offset by a slight decrease in trips and VKTs. Average revenue per trip increased +9.4% vs. 2018.
· Fee revenues (6% of total) CAD95mn (+6.6%), mainly due to an increase in the annual transponder lease fee rate, coupled with higher volumes of transponders in circulation and higher late payment interest charges.
· Contract revenues (0.5% of total) CAD7.7mn, on the back of work completed for the construction, installation & maintenance of tolling sites on the 407 Extension II (phase 2b).

OPEX +9.2%, (+4.9% underlying, ex-2018 one off), primarily due to higher customer operations expenses coupled with higher contract expenses relating to the completion of 407 extension II Phase 2b, along with the one-time recovery of certain indirect taxes in 2018.

EBITDA +8.1%, with an 87.0% EBITDA margin due to revenue growth, offset by higher operating expenses. Excluding the aforementioned tax recovery, EBITDA would have increased by +8.8%, with an 87.1% EBITDA margin vs 86.5% in 2018.

407 ETR tariff
In December 2019 a toll rate increase was announced, which came into force on 1 February 2020. 407 ETR is aligning its pricing structure with seasonal traffic patterns. This means that drivers will pay less per kilometre in spring and winter when traffic is lower compared to summer when the highway is busiest.

Dividend: NTE toll road distributed its first dividend, for USD292mn, after five years of operations. Shareholder remuneration took place after the closing of c. USD1.3bn refinancing.

Refinancing: Ferrovial, via Cintra, completed the refinancing of original NTE debt (PABs and TIFIA). The new debt structure includes PABs (USD400mn) and taxable bonds (USD871mn). This refinancing agreement has led to a lower cost of debt (yield to maturity of 3.8% vs previous average coupon of 5.3%) and longer maturity terms (30 years of the tranche subject to tax vs 15 years of previous TIFIA loan).

NTE net debt reached USD1,234mn in December 2019 (USD996mn in December 2018), at an average cost of 3.48% after refinancing.

Traffic: grew by +9.1% in 2019, bolstered by the opening of the 183 TEXpress (Midtown Express) in October 2018 and the increase in traffic from the US-75 following the completion of construction works at the intersection of the President George Bush Turnpike in 2Q 2019, leading to improved traffic levels in 4Q 2019 (+12.5%). 183 TEXpress connects directly to LBJ Segment 1, providing a new and direct connection between the two managed lane corridors. Preparation works prior to the start of works at the 635 East managed lanes project did not have a

Development, design, construction and operation of Segment 3C:
· Construction of 2 managed lanes in each direction, c.6.7 miles from north of US 81/287 to Eagle Pkwy.
· Reconstruction of existing general-purpose lanes.
· Construction of access ramps & frontage roads.
· Construction of IH820/I-35W managed lanes direct connector
· Installation of Intelligent Transportation System "ITS" & tolling systems.

Duration: concession term ends 2061
Operation & Maintenance (O&M) and toll collection: exclusive right and obligation to operate, maintain, repair and collect tolls. · Tolls collected by North Texas Tollway Authority are in line
with tolling agreement with TxDOT. TxDOT assumes collection risk.
I-77 (50.1%, globally consolidated)
The northern stretch of the I-77 Express opened on 1st June 2019, and the southern stretch opened on 16th November 2019. The project includes:
· 26.4 miles of express lanes between the I-277 in Charlotte and Exit 36 in Mooresville.
· 8 segments in each direction, including 3 direct connections in each direction and multiple entry and exit points.
After two months of the project being completed and operational, average speeds on the corridor are faster than levels prior to construction, despite more traffic on the toll road. Adoption of I-77 express lanes has been quick.
The managed lanes are operating with dynamic rates since December. Toll rates adjust in real time based on traffic conditions, which guarantees that drivers on the I-77 Express will have a quick and safe journey, even on days of high levels of congestion.
OTHER TOLL ROADS
Ferrovial includes in its portfolio a number of toll roads which are, mainly, availability projects located in countries with low government bond yields (Spain, Portugal and Ireland) and long duration (with an average maturity of 16 years overall). Among the most relevant availability projects with no traffic risk or equivalent to availability projects held by Ferrovial are: Autema, A-66, Algarve, Norte Litoral and M3 (except for Autema, all of them are equity-accounted).
The evolution of the traffic in the locations aforementioned were as follows:

· Spain: the Spanish toll roads have shown another year of growth in 2019. Ausol I traffic grew by +4.5%, accumulating a rebound of +60% growth since the end of the crisis. Traffic in Ausol II increased by +2.8% and accumulates growth above +40% since 2013.
· Portugal: remarkable traffic growth in Algarve (+5.6%), and Azores (+4.5%) that still maintains the trend following the liberalisation of its airline market in 2015.
· Ireland: maintains the positive performance observed in recent years. Both toll roads have registered growths above 5% for the fifth consecutive year (+ 5.0% in M4 and + 5.5% in M3).

OTHER EVENTS

In December 2019, Ferrovial, via its subsidiary Cintra, completed the transfer of 65% of the share capital of Ausol for EUR451mn (100% equity value c. EUR700mn). Cintra retains a 15% ownership interest in Ausol, on which it has reserved a put option, and has granted Meridiam a call option on this 15%.
This deal generated net capital gains of EUR474mn for Ferrovial, while allowing it to deconsolidate the gross third-party debt for the project, which amounted to EUR611mn (EUR531mn of net debt).
In August 2019, Ferrovial, via its subsidiary Cintra, agreed to sell an 11.75% stake in Ruta del Cacao (Bucaramanga Barrancabermeja Yondó) to John Laing for c. EUR28.6mn. The deal generated capital gains of close to EUR10mn for Ferrovial. Following this transaction, Ferrovial holds a 30% stake in the concession.

· In Maryland, Cintra is working as part of a consortium and bidding for the Maryland Congestion Relief Program, the first project of which is expected in 1Q 2020.
· Georgia Managed Lanes Program (Atlanta) is being analysed. The Georgia Department of Transport (GDOT) has confirmed that the first project, the SR-400 (c. USD1,800mn construction project, totaling 17 miles), will be tendered as a design-buildfinance-operate-maintain contract (DBFOM), as an Availability Payment Project, with a prequalification date of 1Q 2020; but they are analysing the model to adopt in the other 4 projects that form part of the programme.
· Cintra is following various projects of interest in various States (Illinois, Virginia and Texas), which are Managed Lanes structures.
In other markets, in November 2019 Cintra achieved the commercial and financial close of the "Silvertown Tunnel" project in London, with an estimated construction investment of GBP1,000mn.

Adjusted operating costs: following the adoption of IFRS 16, GBP52mn of lease costs are reported below EBITDA. Prior to the adoption of IFRS16 these costs would have been presented included in operating costs and within EBITDA.
Operational costs have increased as Heathrow gears up for growth with investment in expansion, security, resilience & passenger experience. Heathrow spent more on services for passengers with reduced mobility, upgrading drone defence capabilities, implementing new hold baggage screening and investing in IT systems. Utilities costs also increased due a rise in government levies on usage, whilst overall consumption declined. Ex-IFRS 16, operating costs +6.0% to GBP1,201mn, and +5.0% per passenger.

Heathrow Expansion: Heathrow expansion took a significant step forward in 2019, as Heathrow completed the statutory consultation after unveiling the Draft Preferred Masterplan for the project. The consultation outlined the latest plans for the future airport, how Heathrow proposes to operate and manage its growth and how Heathrow will deliver a sustainable, affordable and financeable expanded airport at no cost to the taxpayer.
Heathrow is now working to finalise the Masterplan and will hold a further eight-week public consultation between April and June before submitting its application for development consent order (DCO) toward the end of 2020. Heathrow's DCO application will detail how the airport proposes to expand and connect all of Britain to global growth, whilst meeting the requirements of the Airports National Policy Statement.
Sustainable Expansion: Heathrow remains committed to the long term sustainable expansion of the airport. A key component of this is set out in Heathrow's proposals for an Environmentally Managed Growth framework. It sets out Heathrow's proposals for how its growth would be managed in accordance with environmental limits on air quality, surface access, noise and carbon, and supports growth in flights at the airport while ensuring Heathrow's environmental performance stays within maximum limits.
Regulatory developments: In November, the CAA extended Heathrow's economic licence until the end of 2021 to better align the next regulatory period (`H7') with the overall expansion time-table and related statutory process. The period encompassing 2020-21 is known as iH7 (`iH7'). A Commercial Agreement defining the rebate on aeronautical charges that will be applicable during iH7was reached with Heathrow's airline community. The Agreement is built by overlaying fixed and volume-based rebates onto an extension of the existing RPI -1.5% path and regulatory frame-work. The deal aims to incentivise airlines to maximise the use of current capacity ahead of new capacity being released.
In December, Heathrow submitted their Initial Business Plan for expansion to the CAA. The plan proposes an evolution to the regulatory framework by extending the price control period to 15 years with the aim to balance predictability, risk and flexibility. Heathrow proposes fixing the cost of equity for the duration of the price control while implementing periodic or performance-based resets for some building blocks such as passenger forecasts, operating expenses and commercial revenue. Feedback on Heathrow's IBP is being collected from airline partners and other key stakeholders at the time of this report. This feedback will be reflected in Heathrow's Final Business Plan due to be published in the second half of 2020.
In January 2020, the CAA published a further consultation on the regulatory framework and financial issues related to H7. The CAA outlines the importance of setting price control arrangements that are consistent with Heathrow's credit rating commitments and the importance of providing longer term regulatory certainty. It also signals that it will use the most up to date information from the Competition and Markets Authority when defining the WACC for H7. Heathrow continues engaging on these issues with the CAA and respond to the consultation by March 5, 2020.
Summary of current regulatory & legal challenges to expansion: The publication of the CAA policy document in December 2019 on the early design and construction costs associated with expanding Heathrow (category B and early category C costs) represents further progress towards providing the regulatory certainty necessary to deliver an expanded Heathrow. A final decision and policy statement from the CAA is currently expected to be received in April or May 2020.
The Court of Appeal judgement is awaited on the current judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of State for Transport relating to the Government's decision to designate the Airports

National Policy Statement. We remain of the view that a robust process has been applied to date, including the extensive evidence gathered by the independent Airports Commission, multiple rounds of public consultation and the overwhelming vote in Parliament.
If the appeal were to go against the Secretary of State for Transport, depending on the detail of the judgement, we will carefully consider our next course of action.
Heathrow has concluded expansion is probable and therefore it is appropriate to have recognised GBP450mn of spend to date as an asset in the course of construction. Our current plan assumes that investment will continue growing in 2020 to circa GBP1bn as set out in the Investor Report published on 20 December 2019. If either the policy statement setting out the CAA's final decisions does not resolve our concerns, or the Airports National Policy Statement is set aside in the event of an adverse court judgement against the Secretary of State for Transport, a reassessment of the probability of expansion occurring would take place. If the likelihood of expansion occurring were no longer considered probable, the expansion related capital investment incurred as of date of reassessment would be required to be impaired and expensed to the income statement. It should also be noted that we expect most of the assets will remain in the Regulatory Asset Base and continue to generate a return through the regulatory framework.
In relation to the above and for further information please see note 3.5.1. (information details related to Heathrow) at the end of section (a) of the 2019 Ferrovial Consolidated Accounts.
Sustainable Growth: Heathrow has progressed against its Heathrow 2.0 sustainability strategy. Heathrow 2.0 sets out how Heathrow will improve life for colleagues and communities, contribute to a thriving economy, and help to tackle global challenges including climate change. Heathrow plan has four pillars (A great place to work, A great place to live, A thriving sustainable economy & A world worth travelling), underpinned by 12 objectives.
Decarbonising aviation: Heathrow has outlined its new carbon plan that brings together partners in the industry, Government and passengers to help aviation achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. These are Heathrow's measures to get aviation to net-zero emissions:
· Remove carbon from Heathrow's operations: Heathrow's terminals are powered by 100% renewable energy and green gas.
· Eliminate carbon from the ground: Heathrow is making it easier for passengers and colleagues to travel to the airport sustainably.
· Cut carbon from atmosphere: Heathrow is helping passengers to offset their flights and increasing Heathrow's own investment in natural climate solutions to capture carbon emissions.
· Decarbonise flights: Heathrow is working with industry partners and governments to scale-up the production of sustainable alternative fuels and support the development of technologies which can get aviation to entirely zero-carbon flight.
High Service Quality: Heathrow achieved a score of 4.17 out of 5.00 (4.15 in 2018). 82% of passengers surveyed rated their Heathrow experience `Excellent' or `Very good' (2018: 82%).
· T5: World's `Best Airport Terminal' (1st time)
· Best Airport in Western Europe (5th consecutive year)
· Best Airport in the world for Shopping

Traffic: number of passengers fell by -7.8% (13.6mn pax) due to traffic decrease across the three airports, mainly due the following events:
· In Glasgow due to the Ryanair base closure in October 2018 and the collapse of Thomas Cook.
· In Aberdeen on the back of the cancellation of the EasyJet route to Gatwick and the Eastern London City route.
· In Southampton on reduced rotations on Flybe's Manchester and Belfast and the cessation of KLM's Amsterdam route.

Revenues increased by +1.8% to GBP217mn, on the back of a oneoff from the full granting of the construction of a new radar in Glasgow from a third party and positive car parking yields at Aberdeen and Glasgow, partially offset by the decrease on aeronautical and commercial revenues across the three airports caused by lower traffic.

EBITDA reached GBP94mn, decreased by -2.6% in 2019 vs. 2018 negatively impacted by lower passenger volume and the exceptional cost of executing the contingency plan for the days of strike during the negotiations with the trade unions and restructuring costs in the three airports. This was partially offset by the positive impact of nonrecurrent items as the full granting of the construction of a new radar and the past service cost for the closure of the pension scheme.

AGS net bank debt: at 31 December 2019, the AGS' net bank debt stood at GBP693mn.

Glasgow becomes 1st UK airport to introduce a fleet of 100% electric `zero-emission' buses'
The fleet of all-electric battery buses will replace the current diesel fleet used to shuttle passengers between the terminal and the airport's Long-Stay Car Park. The introduction of the new fullelectric bus fleet is one of a number of projects introduced to help reduce Glasgow Airport's carbon footprint.
Glasgow Airport, as part of AGS Airports, also made a commitment to Airports Council International (ACI) Europe's NetZero 2050 in October. Glasgow joins 203 airports run by more than 47 operators across 24 European countries who have signed the resolution to formally commit to becoming net zero carbon emissions airports by 2050.
DENVER
On August 12, 2019, Great Hall Partners LLC received written notification for the termination of the Denver airport remodeling contract with due date November 12, 2019. Upon termination of this contract excess cash flow was distributed to shareholders. Ferrovial received EUR21mn. This project was included in the construction order book in the amount of USD534mn.

In 2019 Construction EBIT stood at -EUR365mn, mainly due to the losses recognized in previous quarters. Budimex showed an improvement on its profitability in 4Q (5.0% EBIT mg in 4Q 2019 vs 3.6% in 9M 2019), and Webber maintains positive earnings for the year with similar profitability to previous quarters.
Ferrovial Agroman reported losses of -EUR49mn in 4Q 2019 standalone, primarily due to:
· Overhead costs allocated to onerous contracts in the US (1Q 2019 provision). According to IFRS regulations, these costs may not be included in the provision amount.
· Ongoing costs in some projects close to completion, that we expect to offset with income from claims, based on our contract rights. Several claims have already been presented to the clients, although they have not yet been settled. According to IFRS and our internal accounting regulations, we have not included any potential income from these claims in our results.
· The negative impacts abovementioned were partially offset by the capital gains from the real estate sale in Spain (Valdebebas) along with the improvements in Spain due to the finalization of some contracts.

EBITDA ex-BMH & ex-IFRS 16:
· Spain (+5.3% LfL) was driven by its waste treatment and industrial management contracts, which has allowed an improvement in profitability reaching a 10.7% EBITDA margin in 2019 (10.4% in 2018).
· International (+26.3% LfL, margin 5.4%) due to growth across all territories, particularly noteworthy were North America and Chile. Poland (FB Serwis) has been excluded from Services International in 2019, as Budimex acquired the controlling interest that Services had on 1st July (2018 FB Serwis figures are included in International, excluded in comparable figures).
· Reduced profitability in the UK due to final settlements in Rail contracts, as well as a decrease in Utilities volumes. EBITDA excluding utilities, collections and environment reached GBP56mn.

Amey and Birmingham Agreement: Amey has reached an agreement to terminate the Birmingham Highways PFI contract. The agreement will have no impact on Ferrovial P&L. Amey will pay GBP215mn, of which GBP160mn was paid in 2019 and the remaining GBP55mn will be paid over the next 6 years.
The Services order book (EUR17,656mn) decreased by -6.9% LfL vs Dec 2018 due to the Birmingham exit and the delay in awarding of major projects in Spain.

Broadspectrum sale agreement: In December 2019, Ferrovial reached an agreement for the sale of Broadspectrum (business in Australia and New Zealand) to an entity controlled by Ventia Services Group Pty Limited.
Equity value (price of shares and shareholder's loans) amounted to AUD485.5mn (EUR303mn approximately). Enterprise value stood at AUD524.5mn (EUR327mn approximately).
In 2019, Broadspectrum's activity cash flow reached -EUR5mn, including EUR17mn of factoring.
The completion of the transaction is subject to usual conditions in this type of operations, including the obtention of regulatory and competition authorizations. Therefore, the cash impact of this transaction is not included in 2019. The deal is expected to close in first 9M 2020.
The transaction had a negative impact on Ferrovial's P&L of approximately EUR270mn in 4Q 2019.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Ferrovial classified all of its services activities as "discontinued operations" as of 31 December 2018. In accordance with IFRS 5, the reclassification of the Services business activities to discontinued operations has been carried out in the report, as well as re-expressing the 2018 income statement. An adjustment in carrying value took place after the agreement of Broadspectrum's sale resulting in a net income from discontinued operations of -EUR198mn in December, compared to EUR28mn reported in September 2019.

(*) Related to the provision registered in 1Q 2019 corresponding to three contracts in US.
Revenues stood at EUR6,054mn (+2.6% LfL) with a higher contribution from Toll roads (+28.5% LfL) and revenue from the Construction Division in line with 2018 (+0.3% LfL).

EBITDA EUR76mn excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR479mn in 2018) negatively affected by the ­EUR345mn provision (100%), registered in Construction in 1Q 2019, due to potential future losses in various projects in the US.
· IFRS 16 improved EBITDA figure by EUR45mn reaching EUR121mn of EBITDA due to the reclassification between EBITDA, amortization and financial result, with no significant impact at EBIT and net income.
Depriciation grew by +41.0% in 2019 (+6.7% LfL), to EUR180mn.

Impairments and fixed asset disposals amounted to EUR460mn at year-end 2019 (EUR82mn in 2018), mainly due to the following impacts:

· The main impact comes from the capital gains from the sale of the 65% stake in Ausol that reached EUR475mn (pre-tax)
· Other effects included were the capital gains from the sale of a 11.75% stake in Ruta del Cacao, results from the cancellation of Denver airport remodelling contract and the impairment at Autema.
Financial result, financial expenses in 2019 were in line with 2018:

· Infrastructure projects: expenses of -EUR263mn compared to EUR230mn in 2018 due to NTE 35W and I-77 starting to operate, as well as the refinancing of NTE, partially offset by higher interest rates with a positive impact on the gross cash position.
· Ex-infrastructure projects: EUR69mn in financial income in 2019 compared to EUR39mn in 2018, mainly due to higher interest rates with a positive impact on the gross cash position and equity swap hedges linked to payment plans, with no impact on cash flow. These hedges led to income of EUR25mn in 2019 (-EUR3mn in 2018), due to the positive performance of the share price, as compared with its negative performance in 2018, as shown in the following table:

Tax: the corporate income tax for 2019 amounted to -EUR47mn (vs -EUR24mn for 2018), impacted by the regularization of previous years' deferred tax assets in Spain given the potentially long period of time to recover them. Excluding this impact and the profit from equity-accounted companies, which is already net of tax (EUR296mn), and considering the expense due to adjusted corporate income from previous years (-EUR54mn), the resulting effective corporate income tax rate is 25%.
Net income from continuing operations stood at EUR457mn in 2019 (EUR457mn in 2018). This profit includes a series of impacts, notable among which were:
· The impact of the provision in the Construction Division in 1Q 2019 at net income level: -EUR212mn.
· Fair value adjustments for derivatives: EUR54mn (EUR25mn in 2018), primarily impacted by the positive evolution of HAH's derivatives.
· Impairment at Autema: -EUR58mn (-EUR13mn in 2018).
· Capital gain after tax on the sale of the Ausol and Ruta del Cacao shareholdings: EUR482mn (EUR80mn in 2018 from the sale of the Central Greece and Ionian Roads toll roads in Greece).
Net income from discontinued operations stood at -EUR198mn vs. -EUR848mn in 2018.

Net cash position (NCP) excluding infra projects: stood at EUR1,631mn in December 2019 vs EUR1,236mn in December 2018. The main drivers of this change were:
· Project dividends: EUR729mn vs. EUR623mn in 2018 (+17%), particularly noteworthy was the contribution from toll road dividends, which increased 67% in 2019, including the first dividend from the NTE toll road (EUR166mn). The contribution of dividends from Services reached EUR47mn vs. EUR131mn in 2018.
· EBITDA ex IFRS 16 from ex-infra projects: ­EUR210mn which includes EUR233mn from Services.
· The EBITDA figure was negatively impacted by the ­EUR345mn non-cash Construction Provision registered in 1Q 2019.
· Of the abovementioned provision, EUR143mn has already been applied (cash out) in 2019.
· EUR129mn from the rest of Construction provision variation, impacted by Industrial works in Budimex, after taking a prudent approach to this particular risk.
· EUR165mn of working capital, mainly supported by the improved WC in Construction which reached EUR132mn (-EUR140mn in 2018) and the positive WC in Services of EUR1mn (ex-Birmingham) vs. -EUR188mn in 2018.
· Birmingham CF stood at -EUR204mn, including GBP160mn paid in 2019 related to the settlement agreed with the City Council for the termination of the PFI contract (total settlement amounts to GBP215mn, the remaining GBP55mn will be paid over the coming 6 years).
· Net Investment reached EUR189mn in 2019 vs -EUR94mn in 2018. Investments reached -EUR295mn, below the -EUR332mn in 2018. Divestments reached EUR484mn in 2019, most noteworthy of which was the EUR476mn for the sale of the stakes in the Ausol and Ruta del Cacao toll roads.
· Shareholder Remuneration: -EUR520mn, in line with 2018.
· Others: includes other minor cash flow movements, such as forex impact (-EUR60mn).

Financing cash flow

Financing cash flow includes the payment of dividends and the repayment of equity by concession-holding companies to their shareholders, along with the payments for share capital increases received by these companies. In the case of concession holders which are fully integrated within Ferrovial, these amounts represent 100% of the amounts paid out and received by the concession-holding companies, regardless of the percentage share that the Company holds in such concessions. No dividend or Shareholder Funds' repayment is included for equity-accounted companies.
The interest cash flow refers to the interest paid by the concessionholding companies, together with other fees and costs closely related to the acquisition of financing. The cash flow for these items relates to interest costs for the period, along with any other item that represents a direct change in the net debt amount for the period.

The financing cash flow also includes the impact that changes in the interest rate have had on the debt held in foreign currency, which in 2019 was a negative impact in the amount of -EUR66mn, primarily as the result of the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro, which has had a significant effect on the net debt figure for the US toll roads.

AVERAGE PAYMENT TERM
In compliance with the obligation to disclose the average supplier payment period provided for in Article 539 and Additional Provision Eight of the Spanish Companies Act (in accordance with the new wording of final provision two of Law 31/2014 reforming the Spanish Companies Act), the Company hereby states that the average period of payment to the suppliers of all the Group companies domiciled in Spain (excluding the discontinued operations transactions) in 2019 was 39 days.
The following table details, as required under Article 6 of the Ruling of 29 January 2016 by the Institute for Accounting and Accounts Auditing, the information relating to the average supplier payment period in 2019 and 2018:

People
Distinguishing talent

The 90,000 Ferrovial professionals represent a culture based on excellence, innovation, safety, integrity and collaboration. The value of each professional is, quite simply, the value of Ferrovial.
I n 2019, as a response to its strategy of listening to its employees, Ferrovial launched an opinion poll for its entire workforce, in which 6,866 employees participated. The results showed a notably high rate of commitment at 79%, and a favourable perception of the health and safety culture, at 80%. The attributes with the highest percentage of positive responses included the following:
OPINION SURVEY (% of positive answers)

Employee mobility is also a means of promoting talent. The company has the Global Mobility Portal ­ a job bank ­ in which employees can consult all vacancies existing around the world. The 15,785 registered job offers received 417,065 candidates, with an internal coverage of 16%.
YOUNG TALENT
Given that attracting the best young talent is one of the ways to ensure the future of the company, Ferrovial has 29 dedicated programs lasting between three months and three years to draw young and recent graduates.
Inspire the new generations in STEM vocations means ensuring the future need for key talent, while contributing to employability in the countries where the company operates. In Spain, together with the Junior Achievement Foundation, and through the OrientaT programme, a total of 59 volunteers from Ferrovial were taught in various workshops at educational centres to develop the skills required in the labour market for technical professions. Other featured programmes are run in the United Kingdom, where the subsidiary Amey participates in the Girlguiding STEM programme, and were some professionals from Ferrovial Agroman United Kingdom have been certified as STEM Ambassadors.

"Ferrovial offered the most complex and complicated projects as well as giving graduates the chance to take on as much responsibility as they can handle ­ with guidance and support, of course. To me that sounded like signing up to a life school ­ the bigger the challenge the bigger the learnings".

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT

MOHAMMED BOLBOL, Graduate Civil Engineer, Heathrow Q6

Training is one of the levers for developing internal talent. The SUMMA Corporate University, which has now existed for 12 years, offers solutions for ongoing learning and promotes the exchange of knowledge and experiences among professionals. The number of training hours received in 2019 was 885,947 of which 55,660 were at SUMMA. Total investment in training amounted to 26.24 M (SUMMA is included).

"Ferrovial is a very diverse place to work and the culture is one of hard work and drive to deliver challenging projects to the client's satisfaction. I started at Ferrovial Agroman as a summer placement and by the end of my three months, I felt like I had so much more I still wanted to learn and this would be the perfect place to do so".

The professional development of employees is also a priority. In 2019, 29,457 conducted evaluation and development processes, and succession plans that have enabled us to identify 403 potential candidates for the critical positions of 167 identified.

Safey Culture Leadership Diversity Efficiency

59

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY
At Ferrovial achievements and merit are rewarded in a fair and transparent manner. One of the main objectives within the diversity strategy is fostering an inclusive culture. Among other lines of action, this exercise has put focus on unconscious bias training on a global level.
In addition, the wage gap is analysed at regular intervals. In the case of Spain, following the adoption of the Equality Act in 2007, equality plans were signed with the main union federations in the sector which perform wage diagnostics.
The wage gap, published in the Annex to this report, can be explained primarily by the current percentage of women in the company as a whole, by the type of positions they hold in line with the sectors in which we operate and by the current gender distribution in different professional categories.
In this regard, Ferrovial was included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for fostering an environment of equal opportunities, its measures of flexibility and conciliation in accordance with applicable legislation and the conditions in each country, and for its ongoing work to achieve an inclusive environment, as reflected in the employee opinion poll.

WOW: NEW WAYS OF WORKING
Ferrovial runs the "WOW project: New Ways of Working", which is the Office suite 365 adoption plan as a tool for collaborative work, and it is part of the digital transformation strategy Play the Future, which aims to develop digital competences of employees through training programs: drones, Internet of Things, 3D printing, big data, artificial intelligence, user experience, digital skills, Office 365 and mobility of the future.
In one year, the number of employees that use it in their day-to-day digital tools has multiplied by six, which facilitates the reduction of the digital divide and makes the work more efficient, secure, flexible and collaborative.

Health and Safety
Creating safer workplaces and operations

Ferrovial actively works to create safe and harm free environments and operations for everyone, every day.

FREQUENCY RATE(1)
-15.6%
compared to 2018

I n 2015, Ferrovial established a roadmap to align the Health and Safety management systems of each business area, making sure the necessary resources and tools were available to deliver safer operations. The changes included, amongst others, developing a reporting system that would give more weight to proactive indicators (leading indicators), to develop a more forward-thinking culture, and to focus action on an improved Health and Safety management model.
Since the implementation of this model, 393,624 inspections and audits have been carried out and 3,956,424 hours of Health and Safety training have been given, of which 580,740 and 91,414 were in 2019. Thanks to the improvement actions implemented and the commitment of all workers, frequency and severity rates have dropped by 48.5% and 41.86% compared to 2015, respectively, and 15.6% and 13.8% compared to last year.

these facts and has taken the necessary measures to face this situation. For this reason, Ferrovial has reassessed what it measures and where it seeks to drive improvement. Whilst continuing to monitor existing indicators, the work has begun on identifying "high potential incidents", those events that could have resulted in either serious or fatal outcome but didn't, ensuring the development of an agile and resilient business.
Ferrovial have revised the strategy to address this critical aspect of Health and Safety, ensuring it is prepared and equipped to deliver safer work environments. Given their relevance, high potential incidents are now reported on a weekly basis, analyzed by the Management Committee, and reviewed by an executive team.
NEW FOCUS
Health and Safety of workers is a strategic enabler for Ferrovial, with a proactive focus on risk management, with employees who are aware of how to improve their own safety, where innovation is a lever to reduce risks, creating real links between safety and productivity. The cornerstones of this new focus are as follows:
n The design of the "global" Health and Safety management system focuses on the context of the local system, and vice versa. Therefore, safety is incorporated into the lifecycle of each project, giving flexibility to the role that each stakeholder performs.
n Variability in the execution of each project and during its lifecycle is inevitable, and this variability must be considered and integrated in the management focuses. That's why the risk control hierarchy is used, which prioritizes the elimination of the possible risk (if feasible), thus promoting the thinking about and resolving problems through teams.
n Workers are a source of inspiration and innovation, and they are needed for the resilience of the management system.

However, despite this positive progress, the number of fatalities and significant incidents has not followed this downward trend. Sadly, there have been fourteen fatalities during 2019 (five of employees and nine of contractor workers). The company is unsatisfied with

NEW STRATEGY 2020-2023
The Board of Directors of Ferrovial has approved its 2020-2023 Health and Safety Strategy, which focuses on four strategic elements:

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | MANAGEMENT REPORT

61

n Leadership: our people inspire, care and are uncompromising in delivering our H&S expectations.
n Competence: we have colleagues, who are trained and competent to deliver their roles
n Resilience: we are agile and prepared to protect our people, stakeholders and business from adverse events.
n Communication: we have a learning environment that enables knowledge sharing, innovation and effective risk management.
This strategy enables Ferrovial to:
n Celebrate success, rewarding and recognizing people and stakeholders. n Empower and enable competent people to make choices and
manage risk. n Demand uncompromising leadership and be intolerant to incidents. n Manage risk by embedding H&S into the business and project lifestyle. n Create environments where everyone has a voice. n Nurture a culture of innovation and learning.
The health and wellbeing of workers also constitutes another important element within the new strategy, seeking to acknowledge that the health and wellbeing of Ferrovial's employees are critical to its continued success. The focus will support an improved working environment, create more cohesive teams, reduce absenteeism and job presence, increase productivity and contribute to a more caring workplace.
The new Health and Safety Strategy will pave the way to offer a corporate culture truly aligned with the vision of "creating safe and free harm workplaces and operations for everyone, every day".
COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION
For Ferrovial, innovation is a key lever for change to drive improved performance in Health and Safety. For this reason, it has continued with the work started in 2018 at the Safety Lab to become a tool to be used to provide solutions to the challenges that workers face every day during operations at all workplaces. More information is available about the Safety Lab in the "Innovation" section of this report.

"ARMADILLO" IN LBJ AND NTE
In 2019, the Managed Lanes continued to register incidents where maintenance teams, as they carried out assistance work on the hard shoulder and/or in lanes, were exposed to high levels of risk from members of the public who were driving under the influence of alcohol or distracted by some other issue. To find solutions to this problem, the company talked directly to the workers who regularly use these vehicles, concluding that the best available option was to use new lorries with a modified version of the impact attenuators (TMA), which are known as "Armadillo". This collaboration of leadership, management team and workers resulted in this end product, which already has one unit in operation and three more on the way.
SAFETY INTERACTIVE PAUSE (SIP) AT FERROVIAL AGROMAN CANADA
Ferrovial Agroman Canada has launched the Take a SIP program to refresh the health and safety knowledge of workers who do not always do on-site work. The online program uses case studies with specific themes, which are explained using photos and videos that show real situations. Workers must then answer a series of questions about these cases, receiving a score for each case study that they can compare against the correct answers to check their level of knowledge. This establishes a ranking of employees with their scores, thus promoting competition amongst them and an appetite to improve their personal knowledge.

Innovation
At the forefront of transformation
For Ferrovial, innovation is a strategic priority and a mature discipline that is deeply rooted in its culture and processes and aimed at creating value for society.

F errovial's innovation strategy is not only aimed at consolidating the strength and competitive advantages of its traditional business models but also at exploring new markets and technologies. Accordingly, the company coordinates a broad consolidated portfolio of projects focused on defined priority themes and that is appropriately proportioned between disruptive, strategic and incremental projects. In 2019, this portfolio included more than 100 projects under development that entailed an investment of approximately 45 million euros in R&D. This balanced strategic management of its innovation has made it possible to make the innovation objectives set out below tangible.
DISRUPTIVE: ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORT
Ferrovial faces the constant development of the technological, socio-economic and environmental context of the infrastructure and mobility sectors through a proactive approach that allows it to anticipate and adapt dynamically to change. Through its "What if?" program it periodically analyzes plausible future scenarios to determine the key lines of action to respond to threats and take advantage of any opportunities that have been identified.

stages of the infrastructure life cycle. In this context, Ferrovial undertakes both strategic intelligence projects to help its business units understand the impact of technology on infrastructure management as well as projects to generate additional added value in the promotion, design, construction, operation and maintenance of these assets. The first type include its studies on the impact of autonomous and connected cars, 5G technology and new means of payment. The second type include its projects with innovative technologies such as virtual or augmented reality, drones and artificial intelligence.
INCREMENTAL: AT THE SERVICE OF BUSINESS UNITS
All of Ferrovial's exploration, ideation, experimentation and learning activity takes on a special practical sense when it is generated from a detailed knowledge of the specific objectives, needs and challenges of its business units. That is why a large proportion of its project portfolio is aimed at achieving short-term impact on its traditional business models through, for example, automation, digitization or data processing and analytics. Ferrovial's methodical and incremental innovation has allowed the company to consistently achieve improvements in profitability, sustainability and efficiency in its operations; increase the safety of users and employees and, ultimately, generate additional competitive advantages for its businesses

In addition, Ferrovial has the Venture Lab, its corporate launchpad of business models with a high uncertainty and disruptive capacity. This program allows Ferrovial to anticipate new markets and take advantage of incipient business opportunities that have great future potential. Some of the Ventures launched in recent years include the Wondo Mobility as a Service platform and KUIKO, the digital market of facility management services for SMEs and freelancers.

SAFETY LAB ­ SAFE ROADS
Ferrovial has launched an innovation program focused on improving the safety of its employees and users of its infrastructure through the use of new technologies. The program, which consists of several initiatives, has focused its first project on improving road safety in the area of urban mobility. The initiative aims to reduce the number of accidents in the urban environment with the use of IoT, artificial intelligence and driving assistance technologies (ADAS). The system helps drivers prevent possible collisions while providing information on the risk points detected in the infrastructure. The Safety Lab has also launched projects in the field of construction and mobility.

PROMOTING AN INNOVATIVE CULTURE
Ferrovial undertakes a wide range of technology and trend watch activities that are reflected in its monthly Innovation Insights newsletter, its Infobits reports on periodic trends and its White Papers, in which it discusses both the opportunities generated by the trends and the potential use cases for its business units. Ferrovial's internal knowledge ecosystem is completed with the Digital Hub, the Centers of Excellence in the areas of data and mobility and the multiple specialized technical offices of the different business units. These units function as nodes of the organization's network of experts centralizing knowledge, skills and experience and providing consulting and technical advice.
The insight, talent and knowledge of the immense innovation community disseminated throughout the organization are added to the analysis work and the initiative of these teams devoted entirely to innovation. Every two years the Zuritanken program captures the creative explosion of all company employees, prioritizing and providing resources to prototype ideas with the greatest potential. In addition, as far as innovative talent is concerned, Ferrovial has launched the Play the Future initiative to train its employees in digital skills and new technologies. The company also launched the Executive Forum, an annual meeting of executives to analyze emerging trends and define projects on topics such as mobility or data-based management.
GROWING AN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE ECOSYSTEM
Ferrovial Open Innovation teams work to expand and enhance the organization's network of collaborations and alliances in major global innovation centers such as Israel, the US, Finland and Singapore. This network includes public innovation agencies and programs such as H2020, the European Innovation Council, Innovate UK and the Climate-KIC and Digital-KIC communities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; research centers and universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Standford University and, of course, accelerators, incubators and startups. In particular, in 2019 Ferrovial had 11 collaboration agreements in place with universities and research centers and conducted 32 pilot projects with startups.

SMART MANAGEMENT OF TRANSPORT ASSETS
The digital revolution is making the union between the physical and the digital world possible by enabling interaction between all the organizations involved in the life cycle of transport assets. Ferrovial has opted to adapt to this scenario by incorporating these methodologies on the day of its operations. To this end, the company has defined and developed a common framework for the integral implementation of these asset management tools within the group in a complementary way with the strategies of the different business units. The initiative contemplates the development and deployment of a digital platform that captures the information requirements between the stages of the life cycle of the assets, allowing a "digital fingerprint" to be generated collaboratively for them. All this will make it easier to manage, operate and maintain the company's infrastructure and detect opportunities for operational improvement through efficiency and process optimization.
PLAY THE FUTURE
Two years ago Ferrovial launched the `Play the Future' initiative, a learning platform for digital skills and knowledge for its employees with training itineraries in the area of drones, internet of things, 3D printing, big data and artificial intelligence, user experience, the future of mobility and digital competencies. In the first half of 2019, the initiative's online portal was launched and throughout the year more than 900 professionals signed up for different courses or initiatives. Also, in June a new edition of the Digital Day took place in the Ferrovial Digital Hub aimed at those employees who took the online Digital Competency course. During the event, participants from the various Ferrovial businesses had the opportunity to have an experience guided by the internal experts in the different topics. Additional courses in Agile, Cybersecurity, Future of Work and the Data Academy are underway.

Quality
Committed to excellence

Ferrovial applies innovation to achieve process improvements, make them more efficient and competitive, and offer customers top quality products and services.

A chieving complete satisfaction of infrastructure users and excellence in the quality of services provided are two priorities for Ferrovial. To achieve these goals, the company undertakes specific innovation projects aimed at improving the perception that customers and users have about the services provided. Digitization, artificial intelligence, use of new technologies such as drones and Big Data are some examples of innovation projects applied to the projects.
DIGITALIZATION
In 2019, Ferrovial, along with other companies, created a platform for digital identity management of the main suppliers in blockchain format. The main benefits are that the process for certifying and validating suppliers has been streamlined by making it more efficient and secure, and reducing bureaucratic and administrative tasks.
Likewise, the Construction division continues to extend the use and dissemination of the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology. It was the first major construction company to obtain BSI® BIM Level 2 certification in Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom and Australia. The application of BIM involves incorporating digitalization into construction processes and procedures, providing greater efficiency in information management.
DRONES
Ferrovial relies on the use of drones for maintaining street lighting and roads, inspecting infrastructure, building management and for the monitoring and

control of construction work. Thanks to the drones, operation times are reduced, it increases the efficiency and automation in the operations, improves the quality of the processes, decreases the environmental impact, increases the conditions of security for the workers. In short, it improves the quality of services provided.
BIG DATA AND USER EXPERIENCE
In 2019, a project was undertaken to analyze the opinion of the users who make use of the products and services offered by Ferrovial. For the analysis, information available on social networks, CRM and management indicators is used. The results have allowed us to obtain, in addition to a global satisfaction rating, details of the strengths and weaknesses in the company's performance and thus establish new improvement actions.
Another example of using Big Data applied to quality improvement is the Sentinel project. Led by Ferrovial Agroman, it consists of integrating a data capture device that is integrated into railroad line maintenance vehicles and feeds a database related to a geographic information system, so that an automatic or semi-automatic inventory of the railroad assets is performed, while the elements of the track are interpreted and characterized and maintenance operations are thus optimized. Thanks to this project, still in the prototype test phase, the railroad manager will be able to rely on real infrastructure data for a management system that makes it possible to analyze, predict and act on the assets in an efficient way.
USER SATISFACTION WITH TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
In 2019, Heathrow Airport holds its position as the "Best Airport in Western Europe" and the "Best Airport Shopping" for the fifth and tenth year running, respectively, in the Skytrax World Airport Awards. The key to success goes beyond operating efficient terminals and trying to offer the passenger a unique experience.

cases. It should also be noted that Budimex, Ferrovial Agroman (in Spain and the UK), Cadagua and Ferrovial Servicios España are currently certified under the ISO 50001 energy management standard.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
In 2019, customer satisfaction was evaluated in an innovative way following a new procedure. The objective is to establish a methodology that homogenizes all the surveys that exist in the different business areas to find out comprehensively the perception of the clients regarding sustainability, operational excellence, innovation, responsiveness, reliability and trust, the supervision process and management of agents involved in each project.
QUALITY SYSTEMS AND CERTIFICATIONS
Ferrovial has implemented quality and environmental systems certified in accordance with ISO 9001 and 14001 standards by 86% in both

In addition, the company has digital platforms to ensure compliance with technical legislation and regulations throughout all phases of the life cycle of contracts. This has enabled all environmental requirements to be met, including those related to noise, air and light pollution.

FERROVIAL CERTIFIES ITS CRIME PREVENTION MODEL

All employees adhere to the principles and commitments contained in the Code of Ethics. They commit to comply with it and enforce it upon external collaborators who perform activities on behalf of Ferrovial.

In March 2019 Ferrovial, S.A. was certified by AENOR (Spanish Standards and Certification Association) for its Crime Prevention Model in accordance with the UNE 19601 reference standards "Penal compliance management system" and UNE-ISO 37001 "Antibribery management systems."
Together with Ferrovial, S.A. and, as part of its Crime Prevention Model, the companies of its Group also obtain certification: Ferrovial Agroman, S.A., Ferrovial Aeropuertos España, S.A and Cintra Infraestructuras España. S.L.
These certifications guarantee the commitment of Ferrovial and its group of companies to ensure regulatory compliance and crime prevention, responding to the regulatory requirements of markets, customers, stockholders and investors and other stakeholders, and position the company with a high ethical standard and commitment to best corporate governance practices.
CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS
The Ferrovial Code of Business Ethics*, which is applicable to all Group companies, establishes the basic principles and commitments to which said companies and their administrators, managers and employees must adhere.
These principles are embodied in a number of commitments toward stakeholders in Ferrovial's professional activity and are reflected in policies and procedures aimed at fostering professional performance in accordance with ethics, integrity and compliance with pertinent legislation. Highlights of the regulations include:

COMPLIANCE MODEL
Ferrovial has a Compliance Model in place that aims to provide a transversal process spanning the entire company for monitoring and controlling compliance risks under the principle of zero tolerance toward criminal acts. This due diligence framework embodies the company's firm commitment to observing applicable law and to applying the highest ethical standards when going about its business. The management and analysis of how the Model works is the responsibility of the Compliance and Risk Division, whose independence and effectiveness has been reinforced, providing it with new resources and it reports directly to the Audit and Control Committee.
The Compliance Model is described in the Compliance Policy and its main objective is to foster a culture of business ethics across the organization and permeating all decision-making processes in order to shape and guide the conduct and intentions of directors, managers and employees and erect a common and standard framework for monitoring, controlling and managing compliance risks (especially measures to prevent criminal conduct). The policy also develops the different phases of the Compliance Model in place at the company and stipulates the competencies and remit of its governance and management bodies and those of its employees in relation to regulatory compliance.
The phases in which the Compliance Model is structured cover the phases of a continuous improvement cycle:
1. Identification and evaluation of risks. n  Identification of compliance risks based on the company's activities. n  Assessing risks based on their impact and probability of occurrence.

Ferrovial has an Ethics Channel as a complement to other internal communication channels. Its purpose is to facilitate the reporting of any possible irregularity, noncompliance or conduct that is not in keeping with the ethics, legality and policies that govern Ferrovial. The channel is accessible to employees through the intranet and for any interested counterpart through the website, and allows communications to be made anonymously and confidentially.
A total of 57 reports were filed in 2019, 34 of which were anonymous and 23 made by name. All complaints give rise to an investigation by the Management Committee, guaranteeing confidentiality and anonymity (if applicable), the rights of those involved and the absence of reprisals of any kind. The Management Committee regularly informs the Audit and Control Committee of the communications received and the steps taken. No investigated case has had a significant impact on Ferrovial from a criminal, financial or reputational point of view. No need for revisions to company policies and procedures has been identified from the cases investigated.
RECEPTION VIA

ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

Ferrovial has an Anti-Corruption Policy that governs the behavior of all administrators, managers and employees, and their collaborators, in the development of the business, under the principle of "zero tolerance" with any practice that could be qualified as active or passive corruption or bribery.

The policy requires strict compliance with pertinent anticorruption

laws, notably the Spanish Criminal Code (and that of the other juris-

dictions in which Ferrovial operates), the US Foreign Corrupt Practices

TRAINING
Training for employees in the values and principles enshrined in the Code of Ethics and the Compliance Policy is one of the cornerstones of the company's Compliance Model. During 2019, the online training plan on the Code of Business Ethics and Compliance Policy (Prohibited Behaviors) and the face-to-face course on anticorruption matters continued according to the level of risk exposure of certain groups, including the Management Committee. The training volume of these courses amounted to 4,923 hours, accumulating more than 12,000 hours in the last two years.

Human rights
Dignity and respect

Ferrovial bases its commitment on this matter on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its adaptation to the business world included in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

The company's Ethical Channel addresses various key aspects relating to Human Rights. The functionalities are there to identify and report cases of harassment (broadly meaning any kind of abusive, hostile or offensive conduct) and to report and denounce discriminatory practices or behavior based on culture, political ideas, religious beliefs, race or other types of discrimination in any of the countries where the company operates.

FERROVIAL BUILDS ITS HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTION, RESPECT AND REMEDY

S

ince 2014 Ferrovial has had a Human Rights Policy that is promoted and approved by the Board of Directors aligned with its Code of Business Ethics, the prin-

ciples of the UN Global

Compact, the Guiding Principles for Business and

Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter-

prises and the rules and regulations of the Interna-

tional Labor Organization.

Through this policy, the necessary means are established not only to enforce compliance of Human Rights, but also to raise awareness of the principles among its stakeholders and throughout its value chain. It also guarantees respect for the labor rights of all its employees and contractors in all countries where it operates, in accordance with local law and regulations.

To identify, prevent, mitigate and respond to potential breaches of Human Rights, and given that the associated risks can change over time, Ferrovial conducts a continuous due diligence process of its own business activities and of those directly related to its operations and services. In the case of infrastructure projects involving vulnerable communities, it analyzes the social and environmental impact on the affected communities. Following the initial diagnostic, the company designs contingency plans with measures to mitigate and/or offset the impact.
In addition, Ferrovial has due diligence procedures of ethical integrity of business partners, suppliers and candidates that establish the obligation to perform a due diligence process of integrity, including the field of Human Rights, before engaging in any type of business relationship or hiring a new employee. These procedures, which imply extending the company's values included in its Code of Ethics to its entire value chain, also establish mechanisms for monitoring trade relations during their validity.

DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Ferrovial's responsibility to enforce Human Rights is manifested in its refusal to tolerate any type of discrimination in communities where it operates, in promoting a respectful and suitable working environment and its commitment to labor market integration.
The company fosters respect for Human Rights among all employees by providing courses on the Code of Ethics and the Code of Prohibited Conduct, which include specific modules on this subject.

Ferrovial's measures for safeguarding and respecting Human Rights also include those that respond to new realities such as the right to digital disconnection, the right to confidentiality and privacy of all the people with whom it interacts by making appropriate use of their personal data at all times.
The company has committed to the 31 principles enshrined in the National Business and Human Rights Action Plan developed by the Spanish Government. The actions performed in this area are also supported by the 2nd Equality Plan, which seeks to guarantee

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | MANAGEMENT REPORT

71

the principle of equal treatment and opportunities between men and women. There is also a Procedure for the Prevention of Workplace and Sexual Harassment, and the company is adhered to the Companies project for a society free of gender-based violence.
In addition, Ferrovial signed the Diversity Charter in 2011. This European initiative, falling within the antidiscrimination directives enacted by the European Union in the year 2000, is supported directly by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
COMMITTED TO LABOR RIGHTS
Within the commitment to labor rights, Ferrovial guarantees the right to strike, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining

in all countries where the company operates. Ferrovial employees are protected by employment regulations in each of the different territories. 73.7% of the workforce is adhered to collective agreements.
Ferrovial has also put in place internal communication channels, internal social networks and the corporate intranet (known as Ferronet) to help create collaborative, dynamic and flexible working environments that promote healthy habits and behaviors among employees. In 2019 Ferronet registered 2,941,862 sessions and 4,858,036 page views.
The link between labor rights and Human Rights has also been reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically in SDG 8, decent work and economic growth. From this perspective, an emerging issue that Ferrovial is working on is guaranteeing the future employability of its employees by helping them to acquire digital skills, which shall be essential in the future work environment.

COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY: FERROVIAL AGROMAN UK & IRELAND
Ferrovial is still firmly committed to the diversity of its workforce aligned with the commitment to avoid any type of discrimination established in the Human Rights Policy.
In its latest annual population report, the United Kingdom government highlighted the low presence of minorities in the construction sector, specifically the so-called BAME (black, asian and minority ethnic), which represent only 7% of employees in the sector. Therefore, it appealed to companies in the industry, including Ferrovial Agroman UK & Ireland, to change this situation. This division currently has 18% of BAME employees in its workforce, and 29% of new hires in 2019 corresponded to BAME minorities, 70% of which were university graduates.

A GLOBAL CHALLENGE WITH LOCAL ANSWERS
In some countries Ferrovial has been involved in initiatives that help raise awareness of Human Rights and promote safeguard measures adapted to the characteristics of each country, assuming positions of responsibility in different initiatives to support corporate responsibility and Human Rights. Examples of such include the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of Forética in Spain.
Other networks and working groups in Spain in which the company actively participates to promote Human Rights across the business world and the rest of society are the Human Rights Lab of Fundación Seres, the Executive Committee of the Global Compact Network, where it continues to be a member of the Board, and the new CEO Alliance for Diversity initiative led by the Adecco Foundation and the CEOE Foundation that Ferrovial Agroman and Cadagua have joined.

In the words of Mario Móstoles, Managing Director of Ferrovial Agroman UK & Ireland:
"We understand the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce, which is also essential for the success of the business. We know the benefits of having an organization where everyone is and feels represented fairly. There are still challenges to face, but we are satisfied with the progress we have made so far."

In the United Kingdom, Agroman UK, Amey, AGS, Heathrow Airport and AGS have commitments aligned with the UK Parliament's Modern Slavery Act, which is there to prevent events related to slavery in any of its forms and human trafficking. This commitment not only covers their own business activities but permeates the entire value chain.

The environment
An emission-free future
Ferrovial's climate strategy is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations. The company prioritizes activities with less environmental impact, promotes the circular economy, prioritizes low emission products and services, reduces its carbon and water footprint, and preserves and enhances natural capital.

F

errovial offers products and services that promote decarbonizing the economy and reducing the environmental impact. The

company actively works to

optimize the use of natural resources and actively

manage the risks and opportunities presented to it.

CLIMATE STRATEGY

Through its climate strategy, Ferrovial is aligned with SDG 13, Climate Action, set by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda. Climate change is a key element in the company's governance, which incorporates both the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), as well as climate risks within the corporate risk identification and assessment system, Ferrovial Risk Management.

True to its commitment to support international initiatives, in 2019 Ferrovial participated in COP25 in Madrid, as a United Nations observer. Thanks to its own emission reduction objectives and those of customers and users of products and services, the company can be considered a strategic partner in achieving the objectives of mitigating emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change, offering solutions through its low carbon products and services, consistent with the global trend toward a low emission economy.

CARBON FOOTPRINT

The calculation and reporting of the carbon footprint is applicable to the entire company and covers all business areas and subsidiaries. The calculation method is based chiefly on the GHG Protocol (WRI&WBCSD), which is the most internationally accepted approach, while also adhering to ISO14064-1 standards. The market-based method was used to calculate scope 2.

Ferrovial has set ambitious emission reduction targets, which have all been Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) certified, for the 2020 and 2030 horizons, and for the three scopes.

2030 -32%
vs
2009 -42,9%

scope 1&2 (absolute) scope 1&2 (intensity)

2030 vs 2012

-20%

scope 3 (absolute)

A progressive reduction of relative emissions can be observed, in general terms, as a result of the various initiatives promoting energy efficiency, sustainable purchasing, the optimization of waste and water treatment processes and the use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Examples of the latter are the introduction of a fleet of 100% electric buses to transport passengers at Glasgow airport, the installation of solar panels at the offices of the NTE and LBJ toll roadss to reduce the network's electricity consumption by up to 30% and the fact that all the electricity consumed by Heathrow comes from renewable sources.
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Throughout 2019, a review of the company's risk matrix was carried out, following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), improving the identification and classification of risks and opportunities related to climate change. This analysis has considered three scenarios based on the degree of implementation of policies against climate change, the so-called current policies scenario (CPS)*; new policies scenario (NPS)* and sustainable development scenario (SDS)*. As a result of this study, it can be concluded that in the short, medium and long term, Ferrovial's main environmental risks are physical and transitional.
Transition risks are related to the increase in operational costs due to rising prices of raw materials,

SCOPE 1: GHG from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. These mainly come from fuel combustion in stationary equipment, diffuse, channeled and fugitive emissions.

SCOPE 2: GHGs as a result of consuming electricity purchased from other companies that produce or control the power.

SCOPE 3: GHGs issued indirectly by Ferrovial attributable to purchased products and services, or by the use of products and services produced by third parties.

increased prices of fossil fuels, payment for emissions produced or incorporating activities included in the emissions market. Policies restricting the allocation of emission quotas, carbon rates, water shortages, restrictions or incentives for land use, changes in the supply and demand of services or interruption of operational processes.
The physical risks refer mainly to possible physical damages in infrastructure and temporary stoppage the activity, decrease of productivity in extreme climatic conditions, increase of the risk premium or a delay in delivery of products and services.
The probability of occurrence of physical risks and the financial impact is higher in the CPS scenario and decreases when moving toward the SDS scenario. The progress of transition risks is the reverse. The company has the appropriate measures to mitigate, reduce and manage the risks related to climate change that have been identified.
SHADOW CARBON PRICING
In the preinvestment process in large contracts, a tool is available to consider variable prices for a ton of carbon over different time horizons and across different regions and project types, internalizing the potential economic risk linked to climate change (including physical impacts, as well as those of a social, regulatory and socio-economic nature, among others). This helps reduce the inherent uncertainty associated with legislation relating to climate change, considering a realistic quantification of the possible costs associated with each project.

BIODIVERSITY
Ferrovial continued its activities under strict criteria of respect for the mitigation hierarchy working toward the goal of zero net impact. In this regard, during 2019 the Biodiversity Initiative Catalogue was published in which the various initiatives carried out by Ferrovial to protect flora and fauna are detailed.
In 2019, the preparation and testing of a methodology of Monetization of Impacts on Biodiversity (INCA), a project carried out in collaboration with Climate Kic, was completed. This methodology will facilitate decision-making related to biodiversity by providing quantitative information.
In addition, the company adhered to The Natural Capital Commitment, which implies belonging to a community that shares its knowledge and has a common goal of carrying out actions in favor of natural capital.
CIRCULAR ECONOMY
Ferrovial has consolidated incorporating the principles of the circular economy in its processes, products and services. To avoid and minimize waste generation, the use of renewable natural resources is enhanced and, as far as possible, they are recovered for reuse as raw materials. The waste treatment division works on the continuous improvement of triage and recovery of materials in order to avoid, minimize and offset emissions released into the atmosphere.
A good example of the latter is the ZRR Project for Municipal Waste, which applies robotic technology in classifying and selecting urban waste. The application of artificial intelligence increases the rate of recovery of materials and their quality, improves the efficiency and speed of processes, and minimizes the risk of workplace accidents.
Another relevant project in the field of the circular economy is the Secasol Project, in which Ferrovial Servicios participates with other partners with the objective of applying solar energy in drying sludge from water purification waste and leachate from the treatment of household waste. With this project it is expected to reduce the economic and environmental impact of managing this waste by designing a specific facility to reduce the volume of final leaching from evaporation using a renewable energy source through heat exchangers and accumulators.

Ferrovial also applies sustainability criteria in its construction activity. The company includes eco-design criteria ensuring efficient management during the life cycle of the building or infrastructure. In 2019, the first Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) was obtained in a track assembly contract, concluding that Ferrovial Agroman's bid had an impact per functional unit at least 30% less than the competition.
The percentage of buildings constructed, managed or owned by Ferrovial that incorporate environmental improvements in the design, construction and operation phases has been increasing in recent years. These buildings have considerably lower energy consumption than conventional buildings.

Water footprint makes it possible to measure offsetting global water consumption (Water Business Index, WBI*) with the contribution of treated water (Water Treatment Index, WTI*), returning it to the environment in better conditions to those in which it entered, as well as the actions that allow local communities in developing countries to access drinking water (Water Access Index, WAI*) through the Social Infrastructures social action program.
In 2019, the company set a goal to reduce its global water footprint by 10% by 2022, considering 2017 as the baseline year. The reduction of the water footprint implies a positive net impact, entailing a gradual increase in offsetting the volume of water consumed through the treatment of waste or saline water and accessibility to drinking water. To achieve this objective, the company has projects such as demand prediction implemented in the Águilas desalination plant, which uses artificial intelligence and big data to optimize resource planning and thus improve process efficiency.

Within the construction activity, earthmoving is one of our aspects that generates the greatest environ- + mental impact, so efforts are focused on its management to minimize the final waste. Reusing earth on the construction site effectively eliminates the emissions that would otherwise be generated by having it transported off-site, while also ensuring the project's better integration with the landscape. Ferrovial has set a target to reuse 80% of earth on the construction site by 2020.
WATER FOOTPRINT
Ferrovial has a methodology to calculate and report its water footprint, through which it identifies the value of water in processes and the environment, taking into account its availability and quality, as well as the balance of the ecosystems in which it is located.

Supply chain
Sustainability criteria

Ferrovial is working to extend sustainability to a supply chain in permanent continuous improvement, with innovation always present, formed by the best partners and suppliers.

F

errovial integrates environmental, social and good governance (ESG) principles into all stages of its supply chain by using an integrated

model that aims to foster

quality, sustainability, efficiency and transparency,

respect for Human Rights and nondiscrimination and

equal opportunities.

INTEGRATION OF ESG PRINCIPLES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Ferrovial has a Global Purchasing Policy that is applicable to all Ferrovial companies and subsidiaries. The policy sets out the commercial, environmental, social and good governance principles that underlie the company's relations with all its suppliers. They are based on the Code of Business Ethics, the Corporate Responsibility and Human Rights Policies and the Due Diligence Process to Ensure Supplier Integrity and Ethics.

The business purchase procedures were updated in 2019 to establish more rigorous criteria in managing suppliers in aspects related to ESG criteria, especially with regard to compliance with Ferrovial's ethical and anticorruption policy principles, in line with the procedure of due diligence of ethical integrity of suppliers, established in the previous year. This has also been reflected in the contractual clauses of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Policy with suppliers. In addition, the company is developing a Supplier Code of Ethics through which the company expects to promote responsible behavior in its value chain, complying with the main standards in ethics and integrity, Health and Safety, the environment and Human Rights.

NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS
84,429
NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS ASSESSED

Supplier management starts with a preliminary classification based on their degree of criticality. A supplier will qualify as critical when its purchasing volume is deemed significant in financial terms or if the goods or services they provide could have a negative impact on business continuity in the event of an incident.
Throughout the purchasing life cycle, both in the screening and initial assessment stages, such as bidding and final control, evaluation and monitoring specific quality management, classification, evaluation and risk control processes that include ESG criteria are applied, as well as the usual criteria of product/ service quality, technical capacity, price compliance, meeting deadlines and compliance with occupational Health and Safety. All suppliers are subjected to evaluation and monitoring processes, the result of which may result in them receiving a warning, an improvement action plan being established, or even them being disqualified from working with Ferrovial depending on its severity. In the case of a verified breach of the Anti-Corruption Policy, the supplier is automatically disqualified.
In 2019, 25,840 suppliers joined the Ferrovial supply chain and 14,458 of them were evaluated, less than 1% of which were rejected. A total of 1,523 suppliers were considered critical, which accounted for 24.3 % of total supplier invoicing.
INNOVATION IN SUSTAINABLE PURCHASES
Ferrovial undertakes innovation projects and applies new technologies to achieve a more agile, efficient and transparent supply chain, which in turn allows the gradual incorporation of sustainable purchases, thus extending sustainability principles throughout its value chain. The most noteworthy initiatives in this regard are the following:
n Efficient vehicle fleet: the vast majority of the fleet is managed through agreements of up to three years, which has enabled the fleet to be completely renewed by efficient vehicles. This has resulted in a substantial and continuous reduction in emission levels. During 2019, the first hybrid, gas and electric

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | MANAGEMENT REPORT

vehicles were incorporated into the fleet. The company expects to reach 33% of zero emission fleet vehicles by 2030. n Smart vehicle fleet: Ferrovial Servicios Spain is undertaking the Smart Fleetprogram, which includes a set of initiatives that seek to optimize use of the fleet (more than 10,000 vehicles) and provide a differential value in the contracts. As part of this program, progress was made in the "fuel tank management" initiative in 2019. This program aims to unify the software installed in fuel tanks, from which online information is obtained on refueling, users, level of filling the tanks and warnings by reordering point, which makes it possible to control and optimize the use of fuel. Smart Fleet was awarded the "2019 Fleets" award by AEGFA (Spanish Association of Fleet and Mobility Managers), while the fuel tank management initiative was awarded the ENERTIC Prize. n Purchase of renewable electricity: the company encourages, whenever possible, purchasing electricity with guarantee of origin. In this regard, the commitment has been established to continuously increase the percentage of purchasing renewable electricity compared to the total consumed, hoping to reach 100% in 2025. The agreement between Zity, Ferrovial's electric carsharing, with Iberdrola for recharging the batteries of vehicles with certified renewable energy is noteworthy. n Catalog of Green Purchases: the information available in the catalog has been updated and increased in the last year with the intention of encouraging more of these types of sustainable products to be purchased and this has reached more areas of the company.

77
SUPPLIER 360 PROJECT IN FERROVIAL
During 2019, the "Supplier 360" project was carried out during the testing phase in order to develop a computer tool for monitoring suppliers that, using advanced data analytics techniques and through internet searches, allows potential risks in suppliers to be detected, both for possible insolvencies and for environmental, legal or reputational problems, generating reports on the analysis performed.
This tool will help to provide additional information to be considered in the phase of selecting and contracting relevant suppliers, as well as when monitoring them by applying it in a standardized way to the relevant suppliers in Spain. Based on this, the adjustments and improvements deemed necessary will be implemented, and in 2021 its adaptation is planned for use with suppliers from other strategic markets, initially the United States and the United Kingdom.

Water that gives life

Through its social programs, Ferrovial conceives investment in the community as a strategic instrument for the progress of society and a way to boost its contribution to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

F

errovial is aware that its activity has implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so to reinforce the company's contribution in achieving the

2030 agenda and the SDGs,

the company has aligned its social action strategy

with these global goals.

ACCESS TO WATER AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

As part of its commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 6, ensuring access to water and sanitation for all, Ferrovial has the Social Infrastructure Program, which promotes infrastructure that provides access to water and sanitation to vulnerable communities in Africa and Latin America, emphasizing the sustainability of actions and the appropriation of infrastructure by local communities.

Ferrovial's collaboration with NGOs and local administrations goes beyond the financial contribution, since the program includes employees participating as volunteers who apply their professional knowledge going to the communities where each project is carried out. Since its launch in 2011, 121 employees have already participated, and more than 220,000 people are direct beneficiaries.

In 2019, three new projects were started that benefit 9,601 people:

The Social Action in Spain initiative is also focused on infrastructure, but in this case, those aimed at preparing and distributing food to extremely vulnerable segments of society. The seventh edition of the program was held in 2019 and it supported improving the Altius Foundation's cooking and food distribution facilities in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.
STEM EDUCATION
STEM careers (acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are the jobs of the future and are key profiles in innovation, social welfare, inclusive growth and sustainable development. Aligned with goal 3 of SDG 4, quality education, Ferrovial understands that it is a key challenge to promote equal access to education without discrimination based on gender or financial resources. Therefore, Ferrovial collaborates with various initiatives in Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom, with different approaches: raising awareness of the problem by supporting International Women in Engineering Day, in the United Kingdom; direct actions with children and young people in which it promotes its employees participating as volunteers such as South Florida Construction Career Days, in the United States; the Orienta-T Program in collaboration with Junior Achievement and the Talent Rescuers Program with Fundación Princesa in Girona, Spain; and the Amey Challenge Cup, in the United Kingdom.
It has also contributed to creating spaces and programs for students to have methodologies and tools at their disposal to enhance their knowledge of technology in specialized foundations such as Discovery Place in Charlotte, North Carolina; the Northwest ISD Education Foundation and Birdville ISD Education Foundation STEM camp, both in Texas; and also educational centers through agreements such as the one in place with the Foundation for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, also in the United States.

INVOLVING THE EMPLOYEES
Ferrovial's main social action programs reflect the company's commitment to its employees and its willingness to be a development actor particularly in the environment where it operates by identifying priority social issues in various countries.
In Spain, the Juntos Sumamos program is being promoted, which has engaged employees who want to contribute to social projects throughout the year since 2005. At year end the company doubles the amount contributed and it is the employees themselves who

choose the projects that will finally be financed. The program has had more than 170,000 beneficiaries worldwide since it was launched.
In addition, Ferrovial promotes integrating people with disabilities into the workplace, through agreements with the ONCE Foundation and the Integra Foundation. Moreover, Cadagua maintains its commitment to the Adecco Foundation Scholarship Program for students with disabilities. Also in collaboration with the Adecco Foundation, the company participates in the Family Plan, aimed at disabled family members of employees.
In the United Kingdom there is an important commitment to the employability of young people who are at risk of exclusion. In this regard, Amey has had a collaboration agreement in place with the Duke of Edinburgh Foundation for 14 years. This commitment is also boosted by Ferrovial Agroman UK with collaborations with educational centers and by building bridges with the business world.
In Canada and the United States, their employees' engagement with their local communities is driven through various social initiatives encouraging youth sports,supporting local social centers and promoting environmental protection. For example, 378 employees of the 407 ETR

participated in the One Big Day annual volunteer day.
In Poland, Budimex has been involved in several initiatives focused on children, including Strefa Rodzica, to create separate areas in the pediatric rooms of hospitals where parents can accompany their children, and the Domofon ICE program, which has been fostering child safety in educational centers since 2009.
In Australia, Broadspectrum remains committed to integrating indigenous people through its Reconciliation Action Plan, thanks to which the company is seeking to raise awareness among its employees of the culture, history and values of Indigenous Australians.

HELP FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY THE `EL NIÑO COSTERO' FLOODS IN PERU
Ferrovial together with the NGO Ayuda en Acción has launched a project to improve access to drinking water and sanitation in the communities of Chato Chico and Chato Grande, located in the district of Cura Mori,in the city of Piura.Both districts located in the north of the country were strongly affected by the `El Niño Costero' phenomenon that devastated the country in 2017. This project is being carried out as part of the Social Infrastructure program.
In 2019, the more than 1,000 people living in these two communities are still suffering the effects of this disaster. The heavy rains caused floods, landslides and overflows that affected the main infrastructure and communication routes. El Niño Costero took the lives of 162 people, affected 1.4 million people and there were more than 280,000 victims.
The overflow of the Piura River in Cura Mori caused both communities to flood, destroying the water supply systems and limiting access to water to one hour every two days. They do not have bathrooms or any kind of sanitation. Most of the residents of these communities had to spend months in various shelters located near the Pan-American Toll roads. Many people continue to live in these fields without being able to return to their homes waiting for the provision of basic services such as access to drinking water.
The project allows this situation to be corrected by installing a new distribution network, building a storage tank and installing ecological latrines.

Responsible Tax Management
Transparency, responsible management

Ferrovial's tax contribution reached 2,087 million euros, in line with previous financial years, with special mention for that corresponding to employment, which stood at 1,156 million euros, and that arising from the company's activity, 636 million euros. The effective management of these tax obligations is based on the criteria of caution and transparency, as well as maximum cooperative compliance.

I n 2010, Ferrovial agreed to comply with the Contributor's Good Practices Code promoted by the Spanish Tax Agency, and included these recommendations in all its activities worldwide through its Policy of Compliance and Good Practices in Taxation. Finally, in February 2015 the Board of Directors approved Ferrovial's Tax Policy, in compliance with the provisions of Article 529 ter of the Corporate Company Law.

n Transparency: Ferrovial is committed to not making use of companies registered in tax havens of other jurisdictions lacking transparency, except when the activity, a Construction project for example, is located within the territory of these jurisdictions. In this case, information will be provided for the corresponding authorities in accordance with legislation.
n Compliance: correct payment within the deadline of all applicable taxes, in compliance with the law in each country.
n Professional behaviour: management of taxes and their inherent risk by a team of professionals in the Tax Department with the support of external consultants.
n Efficiency: management consistent with business strategy, maximizing value for shareholders.
n Cooperation: good relationships with the authorities with proactive management of taxation to avoid conflict.
n Sustainability: establishing procedures and policies to manage tax risks.
n Participation: contributing its international knowledge in taxation to legislative processes.
n Market price: in all transfers made between Ferrovial companies.

*Incurred, paid and collected.

TAX RISK PREVENTION
In line with the recommendations in the Contributor's Good Practices Code, the company will:
n Promote measures to prevent and reduce tax risks. n Avoid conflicts arising from the interpretation of
regulations by consulting the tax authorities and prior assessment agreements. n Collaborate with the corresponding administrations in the detection of fraudulent tax practices with the aim of eliminating them. n Provide any information and documentation required by the administrations as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. n Resort to adversary procedure to reach agreement with tax administrations.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board of Directors, via the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Management, will encourage compliance with the principles and good practices relating to taxation. It will undertake the approval of control policy and tax risk management, as well as those operations that involve special tax risk.
When the annual accounts are drawn up, the Board will be informed on the tax policies applied during the financial year and on the effective compliance with the commitments included in the Contributor's Good Practices Code and this will be included in the Annual Report on Corporate Governance. In compliance with these commitments, Ferrovial has presented the so-called "transparency report" for 2018 to the Spanish tax authorities (as it did in 2017), having received a very favorable assessment from these authorities in terms of the company's collaboration and transparency. For further information, please see section 6.6 of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.

Risks
Anticipating and searching for opportunities

Achieving Ferrovial's strategic and operating objectives requires effective risk management.

F

errovial has a Risk Control and Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors that sets a general framework for action for control and management of the diverse risks the management team may

encounter in working towards the business

objectives, as well as the tolerance level for each risk factor.

EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT

(FRM) led by the Management Committee and implemented in all the company's business areas under the regular supervision of the Audit and Control Committee of the Board of Directors.
This risk management process has been subject to independent verification that confirms the high degree of alignment with the good practices and principles within the 2017 COSO ERM framework, particularly aspects related to governance and culture, connection with the business strategy and operating objectives or performance.

In order to detect sufficiently in advance the risks that threaten the attainment of the business objectives, the company has a risk identification and assessment process called Ferrovial Risk Management

By applying common metrics, the process can detect risk events early and assess them by their probability of occurrence and their possible impact on business objectives, including corporate reputation. In

this way, Ferrovial can take more appropriate steps of management and protection according to the nature and location of the risk.
For each risk event identified, two assessments are made: one inherent, prior to specific control measures implemented to mitigate the risk, and a residual one, after implementation of specific control measures.
Ferrovial, in achieving its business objectives, is exposed to diverse risk factors that are intrinsic to the nature of the activities it carries out and to the countries in which it operates. The following risks can impact the progress of the strategy, depending on their residual assessment:
n Economic environment: the policies of fiscal consolidation being carried out in some of the countries where Ferrovial operates is weakening the financial capacity of the public authorities that are the company's clients, which may adversely impact in operations and margins and contracting volumes of certain projects, and in expectations of fulfillment of the business plan, thus affecting its viability.
In response to these risks, Ferrovial selects assets in settings with proven legal certainty and actively manages the risks of projects by putting in place contingency plans and the contractual and financial guarantees necessary to safeguard the company's interests in any eventuality. Further, the weakening of public finances, along with the need to improve transport infrastructures, may give rise to new business opportunities in the field of public-private partnerships.
n Competitive tension: the slowdown of the European economy and the financial difficulties being experienced by emerging economies are adversely impacting the investment capacity of public and private clients in these territories and, therefore, in demand for infrastructures. This situation is triggering a movement of capital movement towards international markets with greater availability of resources and, consequently, greater business opportunities.

The concentration of business opportunities in certain geographical areas is increasing competitive tension and demand for qualified human resources, reliable suppliers of products and services, as well as partners with sufficient financial solvency and technical proficiency, with the resulting pressure on prices and margins in large-scale projects with a long life cycle. This risk led to losses in 2019 in Construction under onerous contracts in a number of largescale projects. To meet this challenge, Ferrovial Agroman has strengthened its tender processes in order to obtain several prices per project tendered of independent teams that combine resources of contracting and execution. Along the same lines, greater weight is sought in execution with own resources, and a focus on geographies where the construction firm can be considered local.
In addition, the increase in infrastructure-focused investment funds in a low interest rate environment and these funds' readiness to take on more segments of the value chain of projects is increasing competition in Ferrovial's target markets.
Further, the concentration of competitors in some geographical areas is stimulating the creation of entry barriers by local companies and public authorities towards international competitors, which is hindering growth in these areas.
Ferrovial has an approval procedure in place for investments in which the most significant risks of each project are identified and assessed, including those generated by the competitive environment and by the high demand for factors of production, and the decision is made to offer those for which the company has suitable risk management capabilities and that offer a competitive edge. Hence, tendering is focused on technical complex projects in which effective management of risk stands as a differentiator against the competition.
n Brexit: finally, January 31, 2020 saw the consummation of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the start of an eleven-month transitional period in which the two parties are to reach a definitive agreement for the exit and future collaboration. The current uncertainty regarding the outcome of this negotiation is generating short and medium-term economic instability in the United Kingdom and in the rest of the European Union. The consequences of the type of exit agreement could affect the profitability and value-creation capability of Ferrovial's assets in the country.
In the case of Heathrow Airport, the principal asset in which Ferrovial holds a share in the United Kingdom, this uncertainty could impact the progress of the project for the airport's expansion. In addition, any stagnation or slowdown of the British economy could affect the overall activity of the airport, although this is not considered likely due to the significance of the asset and the fact that it is now operating at full capacity.

CHAPTER 1.4 I RISKS

INFORME ANUAL INTEGRADO 2019 | INFORME DE GESTIÓN

86
In response to the risks that may arise from Brexit, Ferrovial is continuously following developments in the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU, planning measures of operational efficiency in its diverse business areas in order to adapt to new market conditions and monitoring the situation in financial markets with a view to adapting contingency plans and hedging measures.
Section 5.4h of the Consolidated Financial Statements explains the impact of Brexit on key financial figures. The pound sterling appreciated against the euro in 2019 in anticipation of a negotiated exit from the single market. Interest rates have declined due to the economic slowdown as a result of uncertainty relating to the final exit agreement. This has a positive impact on derivatives that hedge the risk of lower inflation and on exchange rate hedge options that materialized during the year.
n Regulatory environment: A majority of Ferrovial's operations are in countries with a high degree of legal certainty, where socio-economic stability and visibility in tax regulation is expected. However, the overall situation of low growth forecasts is encouraging public authorities to make changes in tax regulation in order to boost revenues by increasing the tax contribution made by large companies. Further, the rise of protectionist policies in some areas where Ferrovial operates and political instability in others may lead to regulatory changes that adversely impact management of assets and expose the company to new risks.
In the specific case of Spain, growth prospects may be conditioned by a possible slowdown in the economy.
Ferrovial is keeping a constant watch of regulatory and legislative processes that might affect its activities, and of political movements that may occur, with the aim of anticipating any changes sufficiently in advance so as to adequately manage them.
n Quality of service and contractual breaches: Ferrovial's strategy is centred on technically complex projects with long periods of maturation and whose development may involve many risk factors that are difficult to foresee, which may lead to non-compliance of agreed quality levels and/or committed deadlines. These may give rise to disputes with clients or counterparties.
To manage this risk, Ferrovial has quality management systems by business area (ISO 9001) and with key conditions that measure the quality and execution of projects and of the provision of services. It also uses digital platforms to ensure compliance with legislation and technical standards throughout

all phases of the life cycle of contracts and it monitors projects in accordance with the established audit plan to ensure compliance with regulations, contractual requirements and objectives.
n Cyber-attacks: the infrastructures in which Ferrovial holds a share are exposed to cyber-attacks, with the resulting impact on persons and the infrastructures themselves, and which may either paralyze operations and/or compromise privacy and information integrity. The infrastructures most exposed to such risks are airports and roads, in addition to mobility projects.
Ferrovial is working with the authorities with respect to security in order to implement more suitable security measures and systems with a view to preventing attacks on its infrastructures. In addition, the implementation of cybersecurity measures is reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the company's information and operating systems.
Financial risks: section 5.4 of the financial statements describes the financial risks and how they are handled.
In addition to the aforementioned risks, Ferrovial assesses and monitors emerging risks that may adversely affect the attainment of its strategic objectives and others that, in spite of their low probability of occurrence, would cause significant adverse impacts on business objectives. Among others, these include humanitarian crises, anti-globalization and protectionist political movements that reduce international investment and endanger free competition, technological disruption and/or obsolescence and the impact of technological innovation in the management of infrastructures.
Ferrovial also pursues a policy of insurance coverage in international markets so as to transfer risks of material damage in assets, and lost profits that may result from such damage. The company has civil and professional liability policies in place to cover damage the company's activity may cause to third parties, including policies to cover liability for damage to the environment and the civil liability of directors and executives. With respect to coverage of cyber-risks, Ferrovial is negotiating the taking out of specific coverage that will be in effect in the coming weeks.
Also, Ferrovial has a Compliance Model for identifying and assessing the risk of the commission of criminal acts, and for identifying and assessing the control measures designed to mitigate such risks. This is all based on the principle of "zero tolerance" with fraud and corruption (see Integrity section).
Further, the company monitors environmental risks with a special focus on risk exposure relating to

87

climate change, with the aim of anticipating them sufficiently in advance so as to implement programs of remediation and adaptation to the new environment. In the process, it distinguishes between physical risks; extreme climate events that may affect infrastructures and transition risks; economic effects (increase in cost of raw materials); and technology effects relating to regulatory changes designed to reduce pollutant gases (increase in taxes on fossil fuels, prices of greenhouse gas emissions, new forms of transport with an impact on projects' business plan, etc.). The Environment section of this report outlines Ferrovial's strategy with respect to climate change.

Lastly, the increase in trade tensions between the major world economic powers - i.e., China, the US, the EU and Russia - and the protectionist measures being put in place are adversely affecting world trade, capital markets and the regulatory environment. In this setting of socio-economic uncertainty, the weight of some risks presently deemed to be of low probability or negligible may increase.

utive directors, i.e. the remuneration corresponding to a standard level of target attainment, is equivalent to 125% of the fixed remuneration for the Chairman. The quantitative targets have an associated scale for rewarding overachieved targets up to a certain limit. The annual variable remuneration therefore has a cap of 190% on the fixed remuneration.
For the new CEO, Ignacio Madridejos, a variable target remuneration has been established, equivalent to 100% of the fixed remuneration, and overachivement with objectives up to a limit of 150% of the fixed remuneration.
Quantitative targets comprise metrics to guarantee a suitable balance between financial and operational aspects relating to the

management of the company. Qualitative targets are pegged to an assessment of the individual performance of executive directors.
b) Current long-term incentive plans Executive directors participate in a long-term variable remuneration system involving the delivery of shares. The current remuneration policy has a limit of 150% of the fixed remuneration as the incentive value at the time the remuneration is awarded.
It is structured into overlapping multi-year cycles (currently set at three years). Units are assigned each year and then converted into shares at the end of the cycle (currently three years). For the current plan (2019), they are determined by the relative weight of the metrics in the attached table.

Ferrovial's internal regulations stipulate that the remuneration of External Directors will be that necessary to suitably remunerate the responsibility and dedication required by the position, without compromising their independence.

Expected Business Performance 2020

TOLL ROADS

AIRPORTS

The foreseeable behavior of toll roads in operation in 2020 will depend on macroeconomic developments in the countries or states where they are located and on their impact on traffic volumes and revenue. The company will continue to concentrate its efforts on maximizing the quality of the service provided, with optimization of income and costs and within the framework allowed by the concession agreements.
In Canada, the 407 ETR Toll Road will continue with an ambitious digital investment program in customer management systems, in gross revenues and with the launch of a new App to improve the toll road's value proposition and user experience. There will also be continued investment in the data lab to obtain a better understanding of user behavior and to personalize value propositions to the requirements of the different customers. The company will also intensify its presence in the corridor's communities to broaden its collaboration with a significant number of educational, environmental, health and wellness establishments.

In the coming year Ferrovial Airports will continue to focus on the presentation of tenders and in maximizing the performance of its assets.
In spite of the delay of Brexit to 2020, the aviation sector is still well positioned as a result of the contingency plans already established for 2019. These plans ensure that airlines will continue to be able to operate between the European Union and the United Kingdom even if an agreement is not reached.
Heathrow Airport will continue with negotiations for the new regulatory period and for expansion, with the development of a final Business Plan, and in compliance with sustainability objectives (Carbon Neutral) in 2020.
Regarding the airports of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton, a new Master Plan for Glasgow is expected to be published and for work to continue on the project to extend the runway for Southampton.

In the U.S., the good behavior of assets, the recent successful refinancing of NTE and the growth experienced in the area, make us confident that NTE, LBJ and NTE 35W will continue to meet expectations for revenue, user satisfaction and a reduction in congestion in the area. NTE paid its first dividend in 2019 and LBJ will do so in 2020. Also, the first results since the I-77 toll road in North Carolina became operational, the first Managed Lanes toll road in this state, continue to validate the Managed Lanes concept as a solution to traffic congestion in urban corridors. Construction of the I-66 and 3C segment of the NTE35W will also continue.
In the remaining markets, Cintra will continue to manage the assets in operation, conclude the opening to traffic of the Western Roads Upgrade project in Australia; various sections of the Ruta del Cacao toll road in Colombia; and continue with work on the projects in the construction phase: Silvertown, in the United Kingdom; Ruta del Cacao, in Colombia; and D4R7, in Slovakia.
Cintra will also continue to submit tenders in the regions where the company operates (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, Chile and Peru), concentrating mainly on complex greenfield projects because of its high potential for creating value.

In 2020 Ferrovial Airports will continue to analyze opportunities for investment that arise at a global level, with special interest in those detected in the North American market, as well as those areas in which a potential for generating value is identified.
CONSTRUCTION
The perspectives by market for 2020 are as follows:
In Spain a slow-down in the recovery initiated in the sector in recent years is expected, in spite of favorable public works tenders for railways and airports. The order book in 2019 has increased slightly compared to the previous year, with sales in 2020 expected to stabilize.
In international markets and after the unfavorable results for 2019, there is a positive outlook as a result of improvements in operating processes in all phases of the project, the high pipeline and the differential technical capabilities of the Construction division. Nevertheless, there is still considerable pressure on profitability margins because of strong competition and inflationary trends in costs in the main markets:
n In the U.S. and Canada investment in transport infrastructures continues to increase, with federal support in the form of the Fast

Act in the U.S. and the Federal Infrastructures Plan in Canada, as well as increases in the budgets for states and provinces, with a special mention for Texas in 2019 with a new historic maximum in tenders for toll roads. This momentum, highlighted by P3/ DBF projects in which Ferrovial is a leader together with Ferrovial Agroman as constructor, guarantee a good pipeline to the future. An increase in the sales level is expected for 2020 because of an increase in the work rhythm for a number of major projects awarded in previous years, as well as new contracts for the NTE toll road Segment 3C (Texas) and IH35 Waco (Texas), both together with the Webber subsidiary.
n In Poland public tenders continue at a high level as a result of extensions to plans for roads and railways until 2025-26, with the support of EU 2014-2020 Funds. A high level of funds is also expected to be assigned under the new EU multiannual financial framework for 2021-27, currently under negotiation, that will guarantee future stability for investment in the country. In 2020 a slow-down in sales growth is expected due to greater selectivity in new contracts to mitigate stress in profitability in the sector after a period with increased costs for labor and materials that are now somewhat more stable.

continued with an agreement reached for the sale of its business in Australia and New Zealand (Broadspectrum). This process is expected to continue in 2020, where a change in the interest of potential buyers has been observed, moving on from consideration of the full perimeter of Services to concentrating on specific assets and/or geographical areas.
In United Kingdom, with a new government, the country is expected to begin a new era of political stability and investment in infrastructures. Amey will combine cost adjustment with greater emphasis on its consultancy, transport and facility management activities. Specifically, important tenders are expected for customers like the Ministry of Defense, Network Rail and Transport Scotland.
In Spain, consolidation of the new political scenario will enable the activation of major tenders by regional administrations, as is the case of the contract for waste collection and road cleaning in Barcelona. In a favorable context for improving environmental sustainability, Ferrovial Servicios Spain will continue to propose and develop projects linked to the circular economy and energy efficiency, highlighting the importance of the differential provided by its technical and market knowledge.

n In the United Kingdom, in spite of Brexit uncertainty, there is still political will to promote major works in the plan for infrastructure both in the short and the medium term, as can be seen in tenders required for significant public works programs such as Toll Roads England, Network Rail and Transport for London. Sales will remain stable in 2020, with growth in the medium term as a result of recent, significant awarded contracts like the Silvertown Tunnel in London.
n Also, in Latin America and other markets expectations are favorable, especially in Australia, with a great pipeline promoted by the Federal Government, and in Chile, with a strong investment plan for 2018-22, with special mention for concession projects. For 2020 sales are expected to be similar to 2019.
To summarize, moderate growth in sales is expected for 2020, with good opportunities for new contracts in the future. Finally, profit margins are expected to return to positive levels once the unfavorable results for 2019 have been overcome and measures for the control and improvement of operating processes have been implemented although some cash flow consumption is expected due to the reimbursement of advances and payments for executing major works, especially in the U.S.

In North America, continued growth in the toll road maintenance business is expected with the contribution made by the Ottawa, York and Michigan contracts, and the tenders for new contracts in U.S. states like Virginia, and Canadian provinces like Alberta. Activity in the crude-oil infrastructures sector will remain stable, as seasonal activity as high as in 2019 is not expected. Margins are expected to improve in operations in Chile and Portugal.
In 2020, Ferrovial Servicios will consolidate recovery to become a benchmark company in its sector. To do this, it will continue activities in four strategic priorities:
n Occupational safety, with the objective of "zero accidents" in all its facilities, strengthening its health and safety management systems by adapting them to new international regulations, and promoting the transfer of good practices.
n Sustainable growth, optimizing the order book of services, the assignment of human and financial resources and growing above the market in its activities with a substantial competitive advantage.
n Ongoing improvement, promoting cost and investment efficiency programs in line with international best practices.

SERVICES
Ferrovial maintains the commitment to selling its Services business. The disinvestment process, announced in February 2019, has

n Digitalization, optimizing the information systems platform and encouraging the efficient application of new technologies and data analysis.

Alternative Performance Measures (APM)

The company presents its results in accordance with generally accepted accounting

standards (IFRS). In addition, in the Management Report and Consolidated Financial

Statements released in December, the management provides other non-IFRS regulated

financial measures, called APMs (Alternative Performance Measures) according to the

directives of European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Management uses those

APMs in decision-taking and to evaluate the performance of the company. Below there are

details of disclosures required by the ESMA on definition, reconciliation, explanation of

use, comparisons and coherence of each APM. More detailed information is provided on the

corporate web page: https://www.ferrovial.com/en/ir-shareholders/financial-information/

comparable "like for like growth", order book, proportional results and total shareholder

return are provided.

and the adjustment of the depreciation of assets of discontinued operations, which will only be made during the current period. We consider that this is the best way to present comparable figures for EBITDA and operating profit in order to see the evolution of the business with respect to the previous year. On the one hand, IFRS 16 on leases is the first year of adoption and has been applied retroactively, adjusting the balances at 1 January 2019, without restatement of comparatives. With respect to the second concept, assets classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 are not depreciated; however, on presenting the result of the Services division, the information is provided as if they were continuous operations for both periods.
FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
n Definition: the adjustments to the Consolidated P&L relative to previous results derived from: changes in the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities; asset impairment and the impact of the two above elements in the `equity-accounted results'.
n Reconciliation: a detailed breakdown of the Fair Value Adjustments is included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account (see the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account in the Management Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements).
n Explanation of use: The Fair Value Adjustments can be useful for investors and financial analysts when evaluating the underlying profitability of the company, as they can exclude elements that do not generate cash and which can vary substantially from one year to another due to the accounting methodology used to calculate the fair value.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparisons with previous years.
n Coherence: the criteria used to calculate the Fair Value Adjustments is the same as previous year.
CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT (NCP)
n Definition: this is the net balance of cash and cash equivalents (including short and long-term restricted cash), minus short and long-term financial debt (bank debt and bonds), including the balance related to exchange-rate derivatives that cover both the issue of debt in currency other than the currency used by the issuing company and cash positions that are exposed to exchange rate risk. The lease liability (due to the application of the new IFRS 16 standard) is not part of the Consolidated Net Debt.
n Reconciliation: a detailed breakdown of the reconciliation of this figure is given in the section 5.2 headed Net Debt and Corporate Credit Rating in the Management Report.
n Explanation of use: this is a financial indicator used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies, creditors and other parties to determine the company's debt position. In addition, Ferrovial breaks down its net debt into two categories: - Net debt of infrastructure projects. This is the ring-fenced debt which has no recourse to the shareholder or with recourse limited to the guarantees issued. This is the debt corresponding to infrastructure project companies.

- Net debt ex-infrastructure projects. This is the net debt of Ferrovial's other businesses, including the group holding companies and other companies that are not considered infrastructure projects. The debt included in this calculation is mainly with recourse, and is thus the measure used by investors, financial analysts and rating agencies to assess the company's leverage, financial strength, flexibility and risks.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparisons with previous years.
n Coherence: the criterion used to calculate the net debt figure is the same as the previous year.
ORDER BOOK
n Definition: the income pending execution, which correspond to contracts which the Company has signed up to a certain date, and over which it has certainty on its future execution. The total income from a contract corresponds to the agreed price or rate corresponding to the delivery of goods and/or the rendering of the contemplated services. If the execution of a contract is pending the closure of financing, the income from said contract will not be added to the order book until financing is closed. The order book is calculated by adding the contracts of the actual year to the balance of the contract order book at the end of the previous year, less the income recognized in the current year.
n Reconciliation: the order book is presented under key figures under Services and Construction sections of the Management Report. There is no comparable financial measure in IFRS. However, a breakdown of reconciliation with Construction and Services sales figures is provided in Note 2.1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This reconciliation is based on the order book value of a specific construction being comprised of its contracting value less the construction work completed, which is the main component of the sales figure. The difference between the construction work completed and the Construction and Services sales figure reported in Ferrovial's Financial Statements is attributable to the fact that consolidation adjustments, charges to JVs, sale of machinery, confirming income and other adjustments are made to the latter. In addition to contracts awarded and the construction work completed, the exchange rate of contracts awarded in foreign currency, rescissions (when a contract is terminated early) or changes to the scope are all aspects that also have an impact on the movement between the original order book (corresponding to the previous year) and the end order book (for the year in question), as shown in the tables at the end of this document. Management believes that the order book is a useful indicator in terms of the future income of the company, as the order book for a specific construction will be comprised of the final sale of said construction less the net construction work undertaken.
n Explanation of use: the Management believes that the order book is a useful indicator with respect to the future income of the Company, due to the order book for a specific work will be the final sale of said work less the work executed net at source.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparisons with previous years. n Coherence: the criteria used to calculate order book is the same as
the previous year.

CHAPTER | APPENDIX

108

WORKING CAPITAL VARIATION
n Definition: measurement that explains the conciliation between the EBITDA and the operating cash flow before taxes. It is the result of the non-cash-convertible gross income primarily from changes in debt balance and commercial liabilities.
n Reconciliation: in Note 5.3 Cash flow of the Consolidated Financial Statement, the company provides a reconciliation between the working capital variation on the balance (see description on Section 4 Working Capital of the Consolidated Financial Statement) and the working capital variation reported in the Cash Flow Statement.
n Explanation of use: the working capital variation reflects the company's ability to convert EBITDA into cash. It is the result of company activities related with inventory management, collection from customers and payments to suppliers. It is useful for users and investors because it allows a measurement on the efficiency and short-term financial situation of the company.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparative reports from previous years.
n Consistency: the criteria employed for calculating the working capital variation is the same as the previous year.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
n Definition: sum of the dividends received by shareholders, revaluation/depreciation of the shares and other payments such as the delivery of shares or buy-back plans.
n Reconciliation: the total shareholder return is presented under the share part of section 1.1 of the Management Report. There is a breakdown of the reconciliation with the shareholder return in the financial statements.
n Explanation of use: it is a financial indicator used by investors and financial analysts to evaluate the performance that shareholders have received throughout the year in exchange for their contribution in capital of the Company.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparative reports from previous years.
n Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating shareholder return is the same as the previous year.
MANAGED INVESTMENT
n Definition: managed investment is presented under Toll Roads in section 1.2 of the Management Report. During the construction phase, it is the total investment to make. During the operating phase, this amount is increased by the additional investment. Projects are included after signing the contract with the corresponding administration (commercial close), on which date the provisional financing terms and conditions, which will be confirmed after the financial closing, are normally available. 100% of investment is considered for all projects, including those that are integrated by the equity method, regardless of Ferrovial's participation. Projects are excluded with criteria in line with the exit from the consolidation scope.
n Reconciliation: Managed investments at the end of December 2019 came to 21,949 million euros and are made up of 24 concessions in 9 countries. The composition of managed investments by asset type is as follows:

(1) Model projects Intangible Assets IFRIC 12 (in operation), 7,324 million euros (6,196 million euros at December 31, 2018). The managed investment coincides with the gross investment balance in these projects included in the table in section 3.3.1 of the Consolidated Financial Statement: 6,937 million euros from NTE, NTE35W, LBJ and I-77 included in USA Toll roads (5,074 million euros at December 31, 2018). This year the I-77 was transferred to operation for 659 million euros (479 million euros were under construction last year). Additionally, 387 million euros from the Azores are included in other Toll roads. Of the total investment, 713 million euros relating to Ausol (736 million euros at December 31, 2018) has been transferred to the equity method as control was lost during the year.
(2) Model projects Intangible Assets IFRIC 12 (under construction), no project currently exists.
(3) Model projects Accounts Receivable IFRIC 12 (in operation), 448 million euros (232 million euros at December 31, 2018). Includes the managed investment in Autema. The balance at year-end comes to 716 million euros (669 million euros at December 31, 2018), including the long term and short term (see section 3.3.2 of the Consolidated Financial Statement) and, amongst others, financial remuneration of the accounts receivable, which is not considered an increase in the managed investment in the asset.
(4) Consolidation using the equity method, 14,177 million euros (11,565 million euros at December 31, 2018). Includes both projects in operation and under construction that are consolidated using the equity method, such as 407 ETR and extensions 4,421 million euros of 100% managed investment (4,095 million euros at December 31, 2018) or I-66, with 2,695 million euros at 100% (2,642 million euros at December 31, 2018). In the consolidated statement of financial position, these projects are included under Investments in associates, meaning the investment cannot be reconciled with the balance sheet.
n Explanation of use: data useful by Management to indicate the size of the portfolio of managed assets.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparisons with previous years.
n Coherence: the criteria employed for calculating the managed investment is the same as the previous year.
PROPORTIONAL RESULTS
n Definition: this is the contribution to the consolidated results in the proportion of Ferrovial's ownership in the group subsidiaries, regardless to the applied consolidation method. This information is prepared to EBITDA.
n Reconciliation: a reconciliation between total and proportional figures is provided in the website.
n Explanation of use: the proportional results can be useful for investors and financial analysts to understand the real weight of business divisions in the operative results of the group, especially keeping in mind the weight of certain assets consolidated under the equity method as 407 ETR from Toronto and the airport of Heathrow. It is an indicator that other competitors with significant subsidiaries in infrastructure projects consolidated under the equity method present.
n Comparisons: the company presents comparisons with previous years.
n Coherence: the criteria used to calculate proportional results is the same as the previous year.

Corporate Responsibility Management

CORPORATE POLICY
Ferrovial understands Corporate Responsibility (CR) as a voluntary but essential commitment to participate in the economic, social and environmental development of the communities where it operates. The CR Policy is based on the principles of the Global Compact and internationally accepted agreements and resolutions related to the subject. It is the responsibility of the Ferrovial Board of Directors to ensure that these principles that the company has voluntarily assumed are complied with. The policy is available at www.ferrovial.com.
The content of this document constitutes a CR Policy report in itself. This offers its stakeholders detailed information on the policy support instruments to enforce compliance; the Corporate Responsibility strategy, formulated in the Plan 20.19 and continues in the Plan 20.22; and the specific practices in the field of CR, which are mentioned in their corresponding sections.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is the link between the business areas and the corporation with Senior Management, reporting results and proposing actions to the Management Committee, as well as transmitting to the rest of the company the approval of the proposals and results reported.
The RC Committee is chaired by the Communications and CR Manager and is composed of representatives from the business areas (Toll roads, Airports, Construction and Services) and corporate areas (Human Resources, General Secretariat, Occupational Health and Safety, Quality and Environment, Risks and Innovation).
The objective of this Committee is to ensure the follow-up of the CR Strategic Plan. The chairman of the CR Committee reports annually to the Board of Directors.

of the business, the generation of trust among its stakeholders and the fulfillment of the objectives in the medium and long term.
Ferrovial develops its CR Strategic Plan every three years, performing an annual analysis of its degree of compliance. In 2019, the period of application of the company's third CR plan, called Plan 20.19, which was in force during the period 2017 - 2019, has been completed. The main achievements in each area of action are summarized in the table on the next page.
For the period 2020-2022, the CR Committee has promoted the new Plan 20.22, prepared considering the main global macro trends, the regulatory environment, the requirements of ASG investors, the main reporting frameworks (Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD)), as well as reports on trends in CR from various prestigious institutions. In addition, like the previous Plan, it is aligned with the global agenda set by the Sustainable Development Goals, focusing especially on SDGs 6 (water and sanitation), 9 (innovation and infrastructure) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).
It has specific areas of action and objectives for each year it is in force, aligned with the business strategy and covering Ferrovial's value chain, from customers to suppliers. The initiatives are grouped around six global macro-trends that will end up irrevocably conditioning the business of any company and that Ferrovial intends to address through this plan. They are the following:
n Digital transformation. n New mobility and urban congestion. n Climate change. n Ethics and corporate governance. n Gender equality and diversity. n Occupational Health and Safety.

His functions can be summarized as follows:

SUSTAINABILITY INDEXES

and sustainability indexes. n Information and application of CR regulations. n Approval and monitoring of projects and sponsorships. n Follow-up of recommendations after external verification. n Advise other departments on CR.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGIC PLAN
For Ferrovial, CR is a priority function that reinforces the sustainability, competitiveness and reputation of the company and contributes to creating long-term value for all stakeholders and for society. The CR Strategic Plan is the indispensable tool to ensure that CR is effective in fulfilling its mission and contributing to the development

Ferrovial is periodically evaluated by analysts who take into account the company's ESG performance. In 2019, the company formed part of the main sustainability indexes:
n Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI): Ferrovial is a world leader in its sector, Construction and Engineering, and has been a member of this selective index for the past 18 years. The company recently received the Gold distinction in the Sustainability Yearbook 2020.

Reporting Principles

INFORMATION PERIMETER
Ferrovial is made up of the parent company, Ferrovial S.A. and its subsidiaries. For detailed information on the companies, see the group in the Consolidated Annual Accounts.

ated with these assets are those related to indirect emissions (scope 3), user satisfaction, taxes paid and collected, and number of passengers travelling through airports.
TRACEABILITY

In 2019, there were operations that involved changes in the group due to the acquisition of companies, the awarding of new contracts and the start of new businesses. There have also been corporate restructurings. For more information, see pages 102-103 of business performance.
CONSOLIDATION PROCESS
The report includes all the companies in which Ferrovial has economic control, meaning a participation of more than 50%. In these cases, 100% of the information is reported. The list of dependent and associated companies can be found in Annex II of the Consolidated Annual Accounts, pages 218-223. Although the Services business is treated as an activity classified as financially discontinued because it is available for sale, to comply with the requirements of Law 11/2018, non-financial information does include this division in its perimeter, offering a complete vision of all aspects and impacts of the business. Therefore, in cases where material is considered, data from the Services division are disaggregated.
Also, following the indications of the GRI Guide Sustainability Reporting Standards, Ferrovial provides information on the indicators and material aspects of "outside the organization", when the data has sufficient quality, and always separately. Ferrovial considers that the most relevant impacts are those related to the 407 ETR Toll Road in Canada and the airports in the United Kingdom, companies in which its shareholding is less than 50%. Some indicators of interest associ-

Ferrovial guarantees the traceability of information related to the Corporate Responsibility scope thanks to a reporting system, which has been available since 2007, which provides detailed information on a company level, facilitating partial consolidation by geographical location or business. In 2019, a thorough review of the requested information was carried out to adapt the system to the information requirements of the different stakeholders of the company. The software used has enabled corporate management to gather quarterly information for management and internal reporting to Senior Management.
In 2019, the reporting system collected 550 quantitative and qualitative indicators, in 118 companies, thanks to the collaboration of more than 200 users.
REFORMULATION OF THE INFORMATION
During 2019 there have been a series of changes in the scope of the companies or in the information available from previous years that may affect comparability with the data contained in reports from previous years. To guarantee the maximum transparency and comparability of the data, the body of the report shows when an indicator from previous years has been modified or shows significant changes that affect the comparability of the information. The preparation of the report has taken into account the comments or recommendations on the Statement of Non-Financial Information for 2018 made by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).

STAKEHOLDERS
Ferrovial is committed to the transparency of the information it shares with the market, through the continuous improvement of communication channels with all its stakeholders, based on innovative corporate information that, in addition to financial aspects, considers the environmental and social variables.
The company considers stakeholders to be individuals or social groups with a legitimate interest, who are affected by the present or future actions of the company. This definition includes both the stakeholders that form part of the company's value chain (shareholders, employees, investors, customers and suppliers), considered as partners in the development of the business, as well as external stakeholders (Administrations, Governments, media, analysts, business sector, unions, third sector and society in general), starting with the local communities in which the company develops its activities.
This relationship is dynamic since the environment changes more and more rapidly. To a large extent, Ferrovial's business depends on its relations with the Public Administrations of the countries in which it operates. Ferrovial holds decision-making positions in organizations that promote Corporate Responsibility at a national and international level, such as Fundación SERES, Forética, Spanish Network of the Global Compact and the Spanish Association for Quality (AEC). In 2019, Ferrovial chaired the Spanish Group for Green Growth.
Ferrovial is characterized by absolute political neutrality, developing its activities for both Public Administrations and private clients in the countries where it operates. The company does not make economic or in-kind contributions to political parties or electoral candidates. However, Ferrovial forms part of business or foundation representa-

tion organizations for commercial exchange between countries associated with the development of its activity or to the geographical area in which it operates. Through its presence and collaboration with these organizations, the company aspires to contribute to the progress and development of all those fields of action in which it is present. In recent years the economic contribution with these entities was around 1.2 million euros per year, which includes the Association of Construction Companies and Infrastructure Concessionaires (SEOPAN).
Ferrovial's considerations of the principles related to the content of the report are explained in the specific section on materiality. For more information on the AA1000 APS2008 and GRI Standards, see page 119 of GRI Indicators.
MATERIAL MATTERS
Ferrovial considers relevant matters to be all those that can exert a substantial influence on the assessments and decisions of the stakeholders, affecting the ability to meet their present needs without compromising future generations.
The company has established a biennial process for carrying out its materiality study, whose last edition took place in 2018. In its analysis phase, the requirements of reporting frameworks such as GRI and SASB, requests from socially responsible investors and sustainability indexes and relevant sector reports were considered, and an online survey was conducted with representatives of various stakeholders in the main markets in which the company operates. In 2019, using the base of the previous year, the issues that were the most relevant for the company and its stakeholders during the year were analyzed. Therefore, the Report offers a balanced and objective view of those issues that, due to their nature, have affected the company significantly.

Most of the projects undertaken by Ferrovial require a preliminary environmental impact assessment. In some cases, the performance of the project may generate certain impacts on the local communities where they are carried out. Where this is the case, the company ensures two-way dialog and explains to the affected communities the possible implications of each phase of the project. It also sets up communication channels to collect grievances, suggestions and complaints. The company also carries out a two-year consultation process with its stakeholders as part of its materiality study, and provides an Ethics Channel on its website, which is available to absolutely everyone. All donation, sponsorship, patronage and association ventures are scrutinized in strict accordance with the company's own internal Procedure for approving and monitoring sponsorship, patronage and donation projects. In 2019, the company engaged in sponsorship action to promote art, culture, innovation and education. The company belongs to SEOPAN and various associations from the construction and infrastructure sectors both at home and abroad.

102-9. SUPPLY CHAIN
Due to the diverse nature of Ferrovial's activities, the supply chains are different for each. Around 97% of suppliers are concentrated in Construction and Services, registering the largest volumes of orders. The Global Purchase Committee, composed of the highest representatives of business purchases, coordinates this activity, looking for possible synergies and sharing best practices.
In the Construction area, the vast majority of purchases are destined for works in progress at any time. A small part goes to the offices, departments and services that support the execution of the same. The supply chain is made up of suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and subcontractors.
The specific characteristics of the construction supply chain are: high number of suppliers; degree of significant subcontracting, which varies depending on the type and size of the work and the country in which it is carried out; high percentage of local suppliers, since the sector is closely linked to the country / area in which each work is executed; very diverse supplier typology, from large multinationals with global implantation and highly technified, to small local suppliers (mainly subcontractors) for less qualified jobs; and need to adapt to the requirements of each local market.
In the Services business,the supply chain includes all the main and secondary suppliers (suppliers of raw materials, industrial supplies or energy, suppliers of capital goods, machinery and finished product) as well as the subcontractors and service providers involved in the company's activities, evaluating them to ensure adequate training. In Spain, from the Procurement and Fleet department, guidelines are drawn up for the different business areas regarding contracting with third parties and all the critical suppliers involved in the provision of services and supply of products for the company are managed. In the international part, each country has its procurement procedure, based on the Global Procurement Procedure defined by the Global Procurement Committee. In the United Kingdom, the typology of the supply chain is very diverse due to the wide range of activities that are carried out.

305-3 OTHER INDIRECT GHG EMISSIONS (SCOPE 3)
Below are the activities, products and services subject to scope 3 calculations:
· Purchased goods and services: Includes emissions related to the life cycle of materials bought by Ferrovial that have been used in products or services offered by the company. This includes emissions derived from the purchase of paper, wood, water and other significant materials (concrete and asphalt), descibed in the indicator 301-1. Subcontractors data and purchases of corrugated steel are not included.
· Capital goods: Includes all upstream emissions (i.e. cradle-to-gate) from the production of capital goods bought or acquired by the company in the year, according to information included Consolidated Financial Statements.
· Fuel and energy related activities: This section includes the energy required for producing the fuel and electricity consumed by the company and electricity lost during transport.
· Upstream transportation and distribution: Includes emissions from transport and distribution of the main products purchased in the year, detailed in indicator 301-1 except for corrugated steel.
· Waste generated in operations: Emissions under this heading are linked to waste generated by the company's activities reported in 2019.
· Business travel: Includes emissions associated with business travel: train, plane and taxi, reported by the

main travel agency that the group works with in Spain. · Employee commuting: This includes emissions from journeys made by employees commuting from their
homes to central offices in Spain. · Investments: This calculates emissions linked to investments in British airports. Data for 2019 is not avail-
able as of the report release date, and therefore emission figures for 2018 are used. · Use of sold products: Ferrovial calculates emissions generated by use of land transport infrastructure
managed by Cintra. · End of life treatment of sold products: This category includes emissions from the elimination of waste
generated at the end of the useful lives of products sold by Ferrovial in the reporting year. Only emissions derived from products reported in the "purchased goods and services" category are taken into account. · Upstream leased assets: Includes emissions related to the consumption of electricity at client buildings where maintenance and cleaning services, as well as consumption anagement, are provided by Amey.

F. Notes to the consolidated annual accounts for 2019

SECTION 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

This section presents the information considered important to know prior to reading the Ferrovial consolidated financial statements.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Ferrovial consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the IFRS standards that apply within the European Union. The accounting policies applied are explained in Note 1.2 of this section.
Of the standards first-time adopted at 1 January 2019, the most relevant impact relates to IFRS 16 Leases, assets (right-of-use, inventories and investment property) having been recognised on transition in the amount of EUR 125 million and additional lease liabilities in the same amount.
Company activities
The disclosures presented in these financial statements include most notably, given their importance, those relating to the distinction between infrastructure project companies and noninfrastructure project companies (see Note 1.1.2 for a definition). Also noteworthy are those relating to the Group's two main assets, the 25% ownership interest in Heathrow Airports Holdings (HAH), which owns Heathrow Airport, and the 43.23% ownership interest in the company that owns the 407 ETR toll road in Toronto (Canada).
Discontinued operations
As of 31 December 2019 the Company reports the main assets and liabilities linked to the Services Division as discontinued operations. On 23 December 2019, the company entered into an agreement for the sale of the Services business in Australia, the effectiveness of which is pending fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent (essentially relating to approval by the competition authorities), an associated impairment loss of EUR 270 million having been recognised in the final quarter.

As regards the remaining business areas in the Services Division (see Note 1.1.3), and in accordance with paragraph 9 of IFRS 5, the company considers that the conditions for continuing to classify these assets as discontinued operations have been met, despite the fact that a period of one year has elapsed since their reclassification. In addition, at year-end the company has revised the fair value estimation of these business areas, concluding that in all cases this value is higher than the carrying amount registered at 31 December 2019.
Changes in the consolidation scope
Note 1.1.4 provides detailed information on the main changes in the consolidation scope in the reporting period, primarily highlighting the sale of the shareholding in the Autopista del Sol toll road.
Judgements and estimates
This section includes the main estimates made by Ferrovial when measuring its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and obligations (see Note 1.2.4).
Exchange rate
Although Ferrovial's functional currency is the euro, a significant portion of its activities is carried out in countries outside the eurozone, its exposure including most notably that to the pound sterling, the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty. The evolution of these currencies visà-vis the euro is shown in Note 1.3.
During 2019 all of the currencies appreciated against the euro, except for the Chilean peso closing exchange rate.
The impact recorded in this regard on shareholders' funds attributable to the parent company is EUR 105 million (see Note 5.1.1 Changes in Equity).

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

1.1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, COMPANY ACTIVITIES AND CONSOLIDATION SCOPE
1.1.1. Basis of presentation
The consolidated annual accounts are presented in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group and, are therefore a true and fair view of the Group's equity, financial position and profit/(loss). The regulatory framework consists of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as established by Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 19 July 2002.
1.1.2 Company activities
Ferrovial comprises the parent company, Ferrovial, S.A., and its subsidiaries, which are detailed in Appendix II. Its registered office is in Madrid, at Calle Príncipe de Vergara 135.
Through these companies, Ferrovial engages in the following lines of business, which are its reporting segments pursuant to IFRS 8:
· Construction: Design and construction of all manner of public and private works, including most notably the construction of public infrastructure.
· Toll Roads: Development, financing and operating of toll roads.
· Airports: Development, financing and operating of airports, as well as integrated solutions for the development and management of electrical networks.
· Services: maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure, facilities and buildings; waste collection and treatment; maintenance of energy and industrial facilities and rendering of other kinds of public services. As detailed in Note 1.1.3, this business activity has classified as a discontinued operation since 31 December 2018.
For a more detailed description of the various areas of activity in which the consolidated Group conducts its business operations, please consult the Group's website: www.ferrovial.com.
For the purpose of understanding these Financial statements, it should be noted that a part of the activity carried out by the Group's business divisions consists of the development of infrastructure projects, primarily in the toll road and airport areas, but also in the construction and services fields.
These projects are conducted through long-term arrangements with public authorities under which the concession operator, in which the Group generally has an ownership interest together with other shareholders, finances the construction or upgrade of public infrastructure, mainly with borrowings secured by the cash flows from the project and with the shareholders' capital contributions, and subsequently maintains the infrastructure. The investment is recovered by collecting tolls or regulated charges for the use of the infrastructure, or through amounts paid by the authority awarding the contract based on the availability for use of the related asset. In most cases the construction and subsequent maintenance of the infrastructure is subcontracted by the concession operators to the Group's Construction and Services Divisions.
From an accounting standpoint, most of these arrangements fall within the scope of application of IFRIC 12.
Accordingly, and in order to aid understanding of the Group's financial performance, these consolidated Financial Statements separately detail the impact of projects of this nature in "fixed assets in infrastructure projects" (distinguishing between those to which the intangible asset model is applied and those to which the financial asset model is applied), in long-term financial assets and, mainly, in the net cash position and the cash flow disclosures, in which the cash flows called "ex-infrastructure projects", which combines the cash flows generated by the construction and services businesses, the dividends from the capital invested in infrastructure projects and

147
investments in or divestments of the share capital of these projects, are presented separately from the cash flows of the infrastructure projects, which include the cash flows generated by the related concession operators. A list of the companies regarded as infrastructure project companies can also be consulted in Appendix II.
It is also important to highlight that two of the Group's main assets are its 25% ownership interest in Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH), the company that owns Heathrow Airport in London (UK), and its 43.23% ownership interest in 407 ETR, the concession operator of the 407 ETR toll road in Toronto (Canada), which are equityaccounted companies since 2011 and 2010, respectively. In order to provide detailed information on the two companies, Note 3.5, Investments in equity-accounted companies includes information relating to the changes in the two companies' balance sheets and income statements, and this information is completed in other Notes within the annual accounts with data considered to be of interest.
Lastly, it should be noted that the Real Estate and Services businesses carried out by Budimex in Poland are included in the Construction segment. In 2018, the Services business carried out by its subsidiary FB Serwis was classified under discontinued operations and was 51% owned by Ferrovial Servicios and 49% by Budimex. In 2019 Budimex acquired the remaining 51% owned by Ferrovial Servicios, therefore it now owns 100% of the company, which is now reported within the Construction Division under continuing operations.
1.1.3. Discontinued operations
Reclassification of assets to discontinued operations
As of 31 December 2019 the Company classifies all assets and liabilities linked to the Services Business Division as discontinued operations and keeps open several divestmenr processes about the different business areas of the division.
As regards Australia, in December 2019 the company closed a sale and purchase agreement, the effectiveness of which is pending fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent, essentially relating to approval by the competition authorities.
As regards other activities, at the Ferrovial Board of Directors meeting held on 19 December 2019, it was unanimously confirmed to divest the Services Division.
The status of the sales process at the closing date of these consolidated financial statements is as follows:
· As regards the Spain and International businesses, although the initial intention focused on selling both activities together, after the experience achieved in the last months, the process has focused in separate divestment operations by geography, being the three most relevant areas Spain, North America and Chile.
· As regards the United Kingdom, the process has been delayed in relation to the other activities, due firstly to the time required to exit the agreement with Birmingham City Council and then to global uncertainties surrounding the UK economy caused by Brexit. However, at the closing date of these annual accounts, an active sale process was still underway, which aims to sell certain business areas separately in a first phase, and then go on to sell the rest of the United Kingdom business.
Based on the conditions indicated above, and in accordance with paragraph 9 of IFRS 5, the company considers that the conditions for continuing to classify these assets as discontinued operations have been met, despite the fact that a period of one year has elapsed since their reclassification.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

148
Valuation of assets at fair value
In line with the legislation in force, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations must be measured at fair value at yearend.
With respect to the Australia and New Zealand business, the transaction closing price (EUR 303 million), minus estimated costs to sell (EUR -3 million), were used as references to determine fair value. This entailed recognising an impairment loss of EUR -270 million in the final quarter of 2019, in addition to the EUR -170 million already recorded in the third quarter.
As regards the other Services businesses, fair value was determined as follows:
· Spain and International: An enterprise value has been calculated based on a multiple over the EBITDA planned for 2020 in each of the geographies that are planned to be sold separately. The multiple has been estimated based on the references obtained during the year due to the sale process. This enterprise value has been adjusted for the amount of the net debt of each of the activities and for the estimation of other adjustments that could be considered as assimilable to the debt.
· United Kingdom: an independent expert valuation was used, which used a similar calculation method as indicated for Spain and International.
In all cases, following the analysis conducted, the conclusion was drawn that no impairment need be recognised in addition to the amount already recognised for Amey in 2018.
Impact on Financial Statements
The reclassification of the Services Division to discontinued operations has had the following impacts on these financial statements:
· The profit/(loss) after tax generated by the Services business is not reported in each line of the income statement, instead it is reported in one line "net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations", both for 2019 and 2018. In accordance with IFRS 5, this result does not include the amortization of these assets. The aforementioned impairment loss forms part of this line and relates to the Australia business. Note 2.9 includes the disclosures required in connection with profit/(loss) from discontinued operations, including a breakdown of the main lines.
· With respect to cash flow, the main financial statement includes, within the global figures, the cash flow figures relating to discontinued activities, adjusting in the line "cash flow variation and equivalents for discontinued operations", such that the "variation of cash and cash equivalents "final matches with that of the Balance Sheet. The cash flow in Note 5.3, which explains the variation in the net cash position, has been prepared using the same criteria. This note also includes a breakdown of the flow of operations, investment and financing of discontinued activities
· For the purposes of the balance sheet, all assets and liabilities attributed to Services division have been reclassified as "assets/liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations".
· The following table details the different types of assets and liabilities that are classified as discontinued operations as at December 2019 and December 2018:

· As it can be seen from the table, the net balance of assets and liabilities related to the discontinued Services activity is 1,445 million euros, 1,434 corresponding to equity attributable to the shareholders.
· Excluding Australia's business, the balance reaches 1,173 million euros. This figure already excludes the Services business in Poland, which, as mentioned, is now reported within the Construction division as a continuing activity and is also impacted by a dividend of 78 million euros that Ferrovial Servicios, S.A. has distributed to Ferrovial S.A. last December.
· Regarding the book value of the Australian business, it should be noted that the reported figure does not include the impact that the restructuring operations that are currently being carried out by which certain international businesses that are transferred to the rest of Ferrovial from Broadspectrum will have on the book value as of December 31, 2019. The acquisition of such shares will involve an estimated cash outflow of 60 million euros and will be compensated within the price of 303 million euros that has been set for the transaction.
1.1.4. Changes in the consolidation scope and other disposals in investees
Set forth below is a description of the most significant movements in the consolidation scope in 2019. The information was prepared taking into account IFRS 3, and the other disclosures required by the standard, which do not appear in this Note, are included in the Note on consolidated goodwill (see Note 3.1).
Toll roads
In December 2019, Ferrovial, via Cintra, closed the transfer of 65% of the Autopista del Sol toll road in Malaga, to the French infrastructure fund Meridiam for EUR 451 million.

The transaction gave rise to capital gains of EUR 474 million for Ferrovial, (see Note 2.5) (EUR 473 million of net profit), of which EUR 95 million relate to the updating of the fair value of the holding retained (15%), which has been classified as Investments in associates, on the grounds that it still has significant influence over the company.
The contract also includes a cross-purchase option between the parties for this remaining 15% that the company holds in the aforementioned toll road, which can be exercised between April and September 2022.
In October 2019, an agreement was also reached with the British infrastructure firm John Laing to transfer 11.7% of the Ruta del Cacao company, the concession operator on the BucaramangaBarrancabermeja-Yondó project in Colombia, for EUR 28 million (COP 103,000 million). The transaction generated a capital gain of EUR 10 million for Ferrovial (EUR 9 million in net profit). As a result of this transaction, Ferrovial's ownership interest in the concession operating company will now be 30%.
1.2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1.2.1. New accounting standards
1.2.1.a) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union mandatorily applicable for the first time in 2019:
On 1 January 2019, the following standards which might have an impact on the consolidated financial statements came into force in the European Union: IFRS 16 Leases, Amendment to IAS 28 Longterm Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures, Amendment to IAS 19 Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement of the Plan, Amendment to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, Annual Improvements Cycle 2015-2017. Of these standards adopted for the first time, the most relevant impact relates to IFRS 16 Leases.
i) IFRS 16 Leases criteria
A new standard, which establishes one sole accounting model for lessees, where the amounts in the balance sheet are increased by the recognition of right of use assets and the financial liabilities for the future payment obligations relating to leases classified previously as operating leases.
The right of use of the asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment losses; adjustments are made for any new measurement of the lease liability due to the amendment or reassessment of the lease.
The lease liability is measured using the present values of future lease payments. When calculating lease liabilities, the Group applied discount rates (incremental rate), depending on the lease term and the country of the company holding the lease.
The Group considers a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
In determining the lease term, the non-cancellable period of the lease agreement and the periods covered by the option to extend the lease are taken into account, if the lessee is reasonably certain that they will exercise this option. Available historical data has been taken into account pursuant to paragraph B.40 of IFRS 16, this general criterion having been included in a specific standard whereby, for asset leases related to construction projects or contracts for services in which the lease term is shorter than contract term, it is presumed that the extension option will be exercised to the contract end date.
IFRS 16 was applied retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard as an adjustment to the

149
opening balances for 2019 of the statement of financial position and not restating the information from comparative periods, where IAS 17 is still applicable.

The Group has also applied the following practical solutions permitted by the standard:

· Exclusion of short-term leases. The company considered those which had a duration of less than 12 months (unless there is reasonable certainty that they can be extended), or those that, at the date of first application, the outstanding lease term was less than 12 months regardless of the contract start date as indicated in paragraph C10(c) IFRS 16.
· Exclusion of low-value leases. As regards the definition of low value contracts, the company has considered in line with what is indicated in the basis of conclusions of the standard in its paragraph FC 100, those whose value was less than 5,000.
· For previous lease agreements with initial direct costs, these have been excluded from the right-of-use asset calculation in the transition adjustment.
In terms of the presentation, of note is that the lease liabilities do not form part of the net cash position (Note 5.3) and are presented in the "long- and short-term lease liability" balance sheet lines, based on their maturity.

ii) Impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements

At the date of transition, the group has recognised total assets amounting to 125 million euros reduced by the impact on equity of 25 million euros of investment in associates in HAH (Note 3.5.1) from certain rights of use assets that have been calculated in transition for its book value at inception of the contract (for the net amount of amortization), as allowed by the standard.

The mentioned amount of 125 million euros corresponds to the following concepts: 96 million euros for right of use asset in operating leases, 27 million euros as inventories and 2 million euros investment properties. The assets that have been classified as inventories or investment properties correspond to the real estate activity in Poland, since in this market there are specific use rights on the land on which their productive activity is carried out and that are part of the cost of these.

When calculating lease liabilities at 1 January 2019, the Group applied discount rates of between 2% and 6%, depending on the lease term, currency and the country of the company holding the lease.

The detailed breakdown of the financial statements affected by this adjustment at 1 January 2019 is as follows:

(Millions of euros) Right of use Investment property Investments in associates Deferred taxes Inventories

For the Services Division classified as discontinued operations, the transition adjustment at 1 January 2019 for the rights of use and lease liabilities amounts to EUR 273 million.

* At 31 December, of the total EUR 389 million for operating lease commitments, EUR 281 million relate to Services (Discontinued operations).
iii) Leases registered in the Consolidated Income Statement

Lease expenses recorded during the year in the consolidated income statement amount to EUR 255 million (note 2.2) corresponding to the following concepts: · Contracts that, even if they meet the definition of lease in IFRS 16,
fall within one of the exceptions to the application of the rule mentioned above. In this sense, given the nature of the group's activity, the assets are normally leased to undertake the different phases of a project for periods that are less than one year or that are considered of low value.
· Contracts that do not meet the definition of lease primarily because the assets are not identified and are easily substitutable by the provider of the same.

1.2.1.b) New standards, amendments and interpretations mandatorily applicable in annual reporting periods after December 31st, 2019:
The new standards, amendments and interpretations approved by the IASB but not yet mandatorily applicable at 31 December 2019 that might have an effect on the Group are as follows:

None of these standards are expected to have any significant impact on the company.
1.2.2. Basis of consolidation
In 2019 and 2018 the reporting dates of the individual annual accounts of all the companies included in the consolidation scope were either the same as, or were temporarily brought into line with, that of the Parent company.
As indicated above, the consolidated Group applied the basis of consolidation established in the IFRS adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS). In this regard, in order to calculate the degree of control, joint control or significant influence existing at each company in the Group, a review has been carried out of the consistency between the stake held and the number of votes controlled in each company under their articles of association and shareholder agreements.
In the case of business activities with companies in which the existence of joint control is identified, the general basis of consolidation is the equity method.

In relation to these jointly controlled businesses, apart from the situations in which there are two venturers, each with a 50% ownership interest, the cases requiring a more in-depth analysis are those relating to infrastructure projects in which Ferrovial is the shareholder with the largest ownership interest (less than or equal to 50%) and has the right to propose the Chief Executive Officer or other executives of the investee, while the other shareholders, mainly infrastructure funds, have a direct participation in the Board of Directors. In all these cases, it has been concluded that the projects in question should be equity-accounted, because Ferrovial does not have the right to nominate the majority of the Board of Directors of these companies, and the decisions of the said Boards (including the appointment of the main executive positions) always require a simple or qualified majority, when Ferrovial does not itself have a casting vote in the event of a tie. Notable cases in this regard are the stakes held in the companies that own the following Toll Road projects (the percentage stake held in each is shown in brackets): I66 (50%), 407 ETR (43.2%), Slovakia (35%), Toowoomba (40%) and Osars (50%).

The contracts that are undertaken through Unincorporated Temporary Joint Ventures (UTEs) or similar entities that meet the IFRS 11 requirements for being classified as "joint arrangements" are proportionately consolidated. It is considered that, in these cases of joint control, the partners have direct control over the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of these entities and joint and several liability for their obligations. Operations of this nature contributed to the consolidated Group assets, profit/(loss) and revenues of EUR 182 million, EUR -133 million and EUR 963 million, respectively (2018: EUR 86 million, EUR -42 million and EUR 923 million). For assets, profit/(loss) and revenue, discontinued operations contribute EUR 652 million, EUR 49 million and EUR 660 million during the year. Particularly worthy of note due to their materiality (sales representing more than 0.5% of consolidated sales) are the following companies relating to construction projects:

The companies over which Ferrovial, S.A. exercises significant influence or joint control and which do not meet the requirements in IFRS 11 to be classified as "joint operations" are equity-accounted. A breakdown of the equity-accounted companies can be found in Note 3.5. and in Appendix II.
Certain companies are also consolidated using the equity method, in which it holds a direct or indirect stake of less than 20%, so long as Ferrovial can appoint one of the members of the Board of Directors.
Intra-Group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. However, the transactions recognised in the income

statement in relation to construction contracts performed by the Construction Division for infrastructure project concession operators are not eliminated on consolidation, since contracts of this kind are treated as construction contracts under which the Group performs work for the concession grantor or regulator in exchange for the right to operate the infrastructure under the terms pre-established by the grantor or regulator. The grantor or regulator thus controls the asset from inception and grants the above-mentioned right in exchange for the work performed, and, therefore, the conclusion may be reached that at Group level the work is performed for third parties. This is in line with IFRIC 12. The non-elimination of these transactions had an impact of EUR -127 million on the income statement, after taxes and non-controlling interests (2018: EUR 22 million). The detail of the transactions not eliminated on the basis of the foregoing is shown in Note 6.8, Related party transactions.
Appendix II contains a list of subsidiaries and associates.
Finally, as regards transactions for the purchase or sale of a percentage stake that does not lead to any change of control in the company in question, the minority stake may be measured at its fair value or at its proportional value in the identifiable net assets of the company being acquired.
The general criterion applied by the Group will be the one that avoids the advance recognition of capital gains in the company's equity. Thus, a minority stake is recognised at its fair value in the event that shares are sold for an amount that exceeds their carrying amount or purchased for less than their carrying amount. Similarly, the corresponding capital losses are recognised as part of the company's equity in the event that shares are sold for less than their carrying amount or purchased for more than their carrying amount.

1.2.3. Accounting policies applied to each line item in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement
Set forth below is a detail of only those accounting policies adopted by the consolidated Group in preparing these consolidated annual accounts with respect to which there is an option permitted by IFRS or, as the case may be, on the basis of the specific nature of the industry in which it operates or of its materiality.

1.2.3.1. Property, plant and equipment, Investment property and Intangible assets

· Subsequent to initial recognition, the items included under "Intangible assets", "Investment property" and "Property, plant and equipment" are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

· The Group uses the straight-line method to calculate the amortisation charge for the assets included under "intangible assets", "investment property" and "property, plant and equipment", except in the case of certain machinery in the construction business, which is depreciated using the diminishing balance method.

The consolidated companies depreciate their various items of "property, plant and equipment" basically within the following ranges of years of useful life:

YEARS OF USEFUL LIFE

Buildings and other structures

10-50

Machinery, fixtures and tools

2-25

Furniture and fittings

2-15

Vehicles

3-20

Other fixed assets

2-20

1.2.3.2. Investments in infrastructure projects
This line item includes investments in infrastructure made by companies that hold infrastructure projects within the scope of IFRIC 12 (mainly toll roads), where remuneration consists of an unconditional right to receive cash or other assets, or a right to

151
charge the corresponding fees based on the degree to which the public service is used.
The assets acquired by the concession operator to provide the concession services but which do not form part of the infrastructure (vehicles, furniture, computer hardware, etc.) are not included in this line item because they are not returned to the concession grantor. Assets of this nature are classified under "Property, plant and equipment" and are depreciated over their useful life, using a method that reflects their economic use.
IFRIC 12 Intangible Asset Model
All initial investments relating to the infrastructure that is subsequently returned to the grantor, including compulsory purchase costs and borrowing costs capitalised during construction, are amortised on the basis of the expected pattern of consumption applicable in each case (normally forecast vehicle numbers in the case of toll roads) over the term of the concession.
The investments contractually agreed on at the start of the concession on a final and irrevocable basis for being made at a later date during the term of the concession, and provided they are not investments made to upgrade infrastructure, are considered to be initial investments. For investments of this nature, an asset and an initial provision are recognised for the present value of the future investment, applying a discount rate to calculate the present value that is equal to the cost of the borrowings associated with the project. The asset is amortised based on the pattern of consumption over the entire term of the concession and the provision is increased by the related interest cost during the period until the investment is made.
Where a payment is made to the grantor to obtain the right to operate the concession, this amount is also amortised based on the pattern of consumption over the concession term.
A provision is recognised systematically for replacement investments over the period in which the related obligations accrue, which must have been set up in full by the time the replacement becomes operational. The provision is recognised on the basis of the pattern of consumption over the period in which the obligation arises, and applying financial criteria.
Infrastructure upgrade investments are those that increase the infrastructure's capacity to generate revenue or reduce its costs. In the case of investments that will be recovered over the concession term, since the upgrade investments increase the capacity of the infrastructure, they are treated as an extension of the right granted and, therefore, they are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when they come into service. They are amortised from the date on which they come into service based on the difference in the pattern of consumption arising from the increase in capacity. However, if, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the concession, these investments will not be offset by the possibility of obtaining increased revenue from the date on which they are made, a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the present value of the cash outflow required to settle the obligations related to the investment that will not be offset by the possibility of obtaining increased revenue from the date on which the investments are made. The balancing entry is an addition to the acquisition cost of the intangible asset.
In the case of the proportional part of the upgrade or increase in capacity that is expected to be recovered through the generation of increased future revenue, the general accounting treatment used for investments that will be recovered in the concession term will be applied. The main assumptions used in relation to these arrangements correspond to vehicle number and replacement investment estimates, which are updated each year by technical departments.

Financial Asset Model IFRIC 12
This line item includes the service concession arrangements related to infrastructure in which the consideration consists of an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset, either because the grantor guarantees to pay the operator specified or determinable amounts or because it guarantees to pay the operator the shortfall between amounts received from users of the public service and specified or determinable amounts. Therefore, these are concession arrangements in which demand risk is borne in full by the grantor. In these cases, the amount due from the grantor is accounted for as a loan or receivable under assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
To calculate the amount due from the grantor, the value of the construction, operation and/or maintenance services provided and the financial income in arrangements of this nature are taken into consideration.
Revenue from the services (mainly construction and maintenance) provided in each period increases the amount of the related receivables with a balancing entry in sales. The financial income on the consideration for the services provided also increases the amount of the receivables with a balancing entry in sales. Amounts received from the grantor reduce the total receivable with a balancing entry in cash.
When reporting this financial income in concessions of this type it is classified as ordinary income, since it forms part of the ordinary concession activity and is earned on a regular and periodic basis.
At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the financial income included in sales revenue amounted to EUR 113 million and EUR 108 million, respectively (see Note 2.1). Also, the borrowing costs associated with the financing of concessions to which the financial asset model is applied amounted to EUR 26 million in 2019 and EUR 24 million in 2018).

1.2.3.3. Other line items in the balance sheet and income statement
Cash and cash equivalents of infrastructure project companies: Restricted cash (Note 5.2.1).
This line item includes investments of the same type and maturity that are assigned to the financing of certain infrastructure projects, the availability of which is restricted under the financing contracts as security for certain obligations relating to the payment of debt principal and interest and to the maintenance and operation of the infrastructure.
Fair value measurement
In such derivative valuations, the credit risk of the parties to the related agreement is taken into account. The impact of credit risk will be recognised in profit and loss, unless the derivatives qualify as effective hedges, in which case they will be recognised in reserves. The Group uses appropriate valuation techniques based on the circumstances and on the volume of inputs available for each item, attempting to maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and avoiding the use of unobservable inputs. The Group establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three levels:
· Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.
· Level 3: Unobservable market inputs for the asset or liability.
As indicated in Note 5.5 Derivative financial instruments, all the Group's derivative financial instruments are categorised within Level 2.
During 2019, a fair value measurement was also carried out with relation to the assets and liabilities that were reclassified to discontinued operations (see Note 1.1.3 with regards to the measurement criteria applied). This analysis is also framed in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments
Impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 is based on an expected loss model whereby the loss provision is calculated based on 12-month or lifetime expected losses, depending on the significance of the related increase in risk. To this end, the Group has therefore established a procedure under which accounts receivable will not only become impaired when they are no longer recoverable (losses incurred), it will also consider losses that are potentially expected based on changes to the credit rating that are specific to the customer, business sector and country. This model applies to all financial assets, including commercial assets contracted under IFRS 15, non-trade assets and receivables under the IFRIC 12 model. For its calculation, the Group has developed a method whereby certain rates are applied to financial asset balances that reflect expected credit losses based on the credit profile of the counterparty (the customer, in the case of trade and other receivables and the awarding entity for financial assets under IFRIC 12). These percentages reflect the probability that payment obligations will not be met and the percentage lost, which, in the event of non-payment, will ultimately be irrecoverable. The assignment of ratings and trends in the rates are overseen by the financial risk department, which performs an update at each year end based on credit risks. If during the analysis a significant increase in risk is identified with respect to that initially recognised, the expected loss is calculated taking into account lifetime probability of default.
The Group applies the simplified approach to trade and other receivables including the contract assets. In order to calculate expected loss, an average rating is obtained for customers by business and geographic area and is used to generate the rates to be applied to the balances, depending on whether the customer is a

153
public or private entity and on its business sector (only in the case of private customers). Moreover, if the customer is declared insolvent, a claim is filed against it or it defaults on payment, a breach is deemed to have occurred and the entire trade receivable will be provisioned. To this end, the Group has defined payment periods per type of customer that trigger a breach and thus the posting of a provision.
In the case of receivables under the IFRIC 12 model (see Note 3.3.2), the expected loss provision is calculated individually for each asset based on the awarding entity's credit quality. If the credit risk has not increased significantly, the calculation will be made based on the same amount as the expected credit losses over the next 12 months. The risk is deemed not to have increased significantly if the awarding entity has a rating above investment grade and has maintained this level since initial recognition.
· Classification and valuation of financial assets. According to IFRS 9 the classification and valuation method is based on two aspects, these being the features of the contractual cash flows from the financial asset and the entity's business model. The three new categories are amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) and fair value through profit or loss. The Group's financial assets are mainly assets held to maturity, the cash flows of which are only payments of principal and interest, so, on this basis, financial assets are carried at amortised cost. We would solely note that for its equity instruments that are measured by default at their fair value with changes reported in profit/(loss), there is an option to report changes in fair value in other comprehensive income from the outset. This decision cannot be revoked and must be taken for each asset individually.
· Hedge accounting. IFRS 9 attempts to align hedge accounting more closely with risk management, and the new requirements establish a principle-based approach. IFRS 9 also generally permits the designation of specific components of non-financial items and financial instruments as hedged items, provided that they are separately identifiable and reliably measurable, and that there is always a liquid market for the items concerned (IFRS 9 B6.3.8 and subsequent), and in certain cases it specifically allows for hedging against inflation for certain financial instruments (IFRS 9 B6.3.13 to 6.3.15).
Other equity instruments
These are perpetual bonds with payment at the discretion of the party that issues the coupon in question. They do not meet the conditions to be considered as a financial liability for accounting purposes, because they do not include any contractual obligation to make payment in the form of cash or any other financial asset, nor do they include any obligation to exchange financial assets or liabilities. They are therefore entered as part of the company's Equity, in the line item showing other equity instruments.
Non-refundable grants related to assets
Non-refundable grants related to assets are measured at the amount granted under "deferred income" (see Note 6.1) in the consolidated statement of financial position, and are taken to profit or loss gradually in proportion to the period of depreciation on the assets financed with these grants, which is recognised under "depreciation and amortisation charge". From the cash flow standpoint, the amount of the grants collected in the year is presented as a reduction of the amount of the investments made.
Trade payables
Trade payables include the balances payable to suppliers under reverse factoring arrangements with banks.
These balances are classified as trade payables and the related payments as cash flows from operating activities, since the payments are made to the banks under the same conditions as those agreed

with the supplier, the company bound by the obligation to make payment does not agree an extension with the financial institutions beyond the due dates agreed with the supplier, the cost of the reverse factoring is paid by the supplier, and there are no special guarantees to secure the payments to be made.
1.2.3.4 Revenue recognition
In order to ensure that policy is standardised across all its different business areas, Ferrovial has prepared a common revenue recognition policy adapted to IFRS 15 "revenue from contracts with customers". The following section contains an explanation of the criteria on which this policy is based, which mainly affect Construction and Services activities. The final part of this section gives a summarised explanation of some specific aspects that may affect the recognition of revenues in each of the Group's business segments.
i) General revenue recognition criteria
The first step in the revenue recognition process involves identifying the relevant contracts and the performance obligations that they contain. The number of performance obligations included in a contract will depend on the type of contract and business activity involved, as explained when each of the Group's business segments are discussed.
Generally speaking, the performance obligations in the Construction and Services activities carried out by Ferrovial are met over time, rather than at a specific moment, since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits offered by the company's performance as the service is provided.
As regards the criterion for recognising revenues over time (the method of measuring the progress of performance of an obligation), Ferrovial has established certain criteria that are consistently applied in respect of similar performance obligations.
In this regard, the Group has chosen the output method as its preferred method for measuring the value of assets or services for which control is transferred to the customer over time, which is applied whenever the progress of the work performed can be measured on the basis and over the course of the contract.
In contracts for the provision of different, highly interrelated goods or services required to produce a combined output, which often occurs in contracts for construction activities, the applicable output method is that of measurement of units produced ("surveys of performance" under "output methods"), in which the revenue recognised relates to the work units completed, based on the price assigned to each unit. In accordance with this method, the units produced under each contract are measured and the output for the month is recognised as revenue. The costs of carrying out works or service projects are recognised on an accrued basis, and the costs actually incurred in producing the units of output are recognised as an expense together with those which, because they might be incurred in the future, have to be allocated to the units produced to date.
In routine or recurring service contracts (in which the services are substantially the same), such as maintenance and cleaning services, which are transferred with the same pattern of consumption over time and whose remuneration consists of a recurring fixed amount over the term of the contract (e.g. monthly or annual payment), in such a way that the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the services as the entity provides them, the method selected by the Group to recognise revenue is the "time elapsed output method". Under this method, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and costs are recognised on an accrual basis.
Only in those contracts that are not for routine or recurring services and for which the unitary price of the units to be performed cannot be determined, use of the of the stage of completion measured in

terms of the "costs incurred" (input method) is permitted. Under this method, the company recognises revenues based on the costs as they accrue, as a percentage of the total costs forecast for completion of the works, taking account of the expected profit margins for the whole project, according to the most recently updated budget. This method entails measuring the costs incurred as a result of the work completed to date as a proportion of the total costs forecast, and recognising revenues in proportion to the total revenues expected. Using this method, the percentage of costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total costs is used to determine the revenues to be recognised, based on the estimated margin for the entire term of the contract. As indicated above, this method only applies to those complex, lump-sum construction or services contracts in which it is not possible to break down and measure the units completed.
Finally, as regards determining whether the company acts as a principal or agent, Ferrovial is the principal in both construction and service contracts if it provides goods and services directly to the customer and transfers control of them without involving intermediaries. In the case of concession agreements in which Ferrovial both builds and operates the toll road, the construction company is the principal if it is ultimately responsible for fulfilling the commitment to execute the work in accordance with the concession agreement specifications and assumes the contractual obligations in the event of a claim or delay.
ii) Recognition of revenue from contract modifications, claims and disputes
Modifications are understood to mean changes to the scope of the work that are not provided for in the original contract and that could result in a change to the revenues attached to the contract in question. Changes to the initial contract require the customer's technical and financial approval prior to the issue of billings and collection of the amounts relating to additional work. The criterion applied by the Group is not to recognise any revenue from this additional work until the additional work has been approved by the client. In cases where the work has been approved but its valuation remains pending, the "variable consideration" requirement (as explained below) will apply. This entails recognising revenue in an amount that will be most likely not to suffer any significant reversal. Any costs associated with the units completed or services rendered will be recognised at the time at which they are incurred, regardless of whether or not the modification has been approved.
A claim is a request seeking payment or compensation from the customer (for example, cases involving compensation, reimbursement of costs, legally mandatory inflation-linked review), subject to the submission of a direct application to the customer. The criterion followed by the Group with regard to claims is to apply the method mentioned above in relation to changes, when such claims are not covered by the contract, or to apply the variable consideration method, when they are covered by the contract but need to be quantified.
A dispute is the result of an incident of non-compliance or rejection after a claim has been made to the customer under the terms of the contract, the result of which is pending in a procedure being pursued directly with the customer or in court or arbitration proceedings. In line with the criteria followed by the Group, in the event that the revenues relating to a dispute in which the enforceability of the amount being claimed are in doubt, these revenues will not be recognised and any recognised earlier will be cancelled, since the dispute shows that the customer has not given its approval for the completed work. In the event that the customer questions the value of the work completed revenues will be recognised on the basis of the criteria applied in cases of "variable consideration", as explained below.
Only in cases in which a legal report confirms that the rights forming the subject of the dispute are clearly enforceable and, therefore, at

least the costs directly associated with the service relating to the dispute are recoverable, revenues may be recognised up to the maximum amount of the costs incurred.
(iii) Determination of the transaction price
The purpose is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation (or distinct good/service) for an amount that represents the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services committed to the customer.
In order to fulfil the allocation purpose, the transaction price of each performance obligation identified in the contract is allocated as a selling price that is separate in relative terms.
The best evidence of a separate selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.
Variable consideration
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, this amount is recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. For example, it is stipulated that a bonus may only be recognised once a high percentage of completion of the contract has been reached.
Financing component
Generally speaking, in order to calculate the price of a performance obligation, an implicit financing component is calculated, in cases in which the period between the date on which the goods or services are delivered and the date on which the customer is expected to pay for the goods or services is greater than a year. This component is treated as financial income.
Where a performance obligation involves a period of less than one year between the date on which the company transfers goods that have been promised to the customer and the date on which the customer pays, the practical solution permitted under the regulations is applied to avoid adjusting the financial amount of the payment.
In cases in which there is a contractual or legal right to charge late payment interest for a payment that is delayed with regard to the contractually agreed terms, this interest is only recognised when it is highly probable that it will be effectively paid.
iv) Balances relating to revenue recognition
Works completed and pending certification/work certified in advance
Unlike the method used to recognise revenues, the amounts billed to the customer are based on achievement of the various milestones established in the contract and on acknowledgement thereof by the customer, which takes the form of a contractual document referred to as a certificate of completion. Thus, the amounts recognised as revenue for a given year do not necessarily coincide with the amounts billed to or certified by the customer. In those contracts in which the revenues recognised exceed the amount billed or certified, the difference is recognised in an asset account entitled "Work Completed and Pending Certification" (since it is an asset under the contract), in the section "Trade receivables for sales and services", while in contracts in which the revenues recognised are lower than the amount billed or certified, the difference is recognised in a liability account entitled "Work certified in advance" (since it is a liability under the contract), in the section "Short-term trade and other payables".

Bidding and mobilisation costs

155

In addition to the balance sheet entries described above, the Group also recognises assets connected with the cost of obtaining contracts (bidding costs) and the costs incurred in order to comply with contracts, or the start-up costs (mobilisation costs) that relate directly to the main contract, provided that they are recoverable during the performance of the contract. These amounts are included in a different account on the assets side of the balance sheet, under "inventories" (Note 4.1).

Bidding costs are only capitalised when they are directly related to a contract, it is probable that they will be recovered in the future, and either the contract has been awarded or the company has been selected as preferred bidder. The costs incurred, regardless of whether or not the contract is won, are recognised as an expense, unless they are explicitly recoverable from the customer in any case (whether or not the contract is won). They are amortised systematically as the goods and services connected with the asset are transferred to the customer.

Any costs that are necessary in order to implement a contract, mobilisation costs, are capitalised whenever it is probable that they will be recoverable in the future and when they do not include costs that would normally be generated for the company if the contract had not been won. They are gradually recognised as an expense on the basis of the proportion of actual output to estimated output under each contract. Otherwise, the expenses are entered directly to profit or loss.

v) Provisions related to customer contracts

The main provisions relating to customer contracts are provisions for deferred costs and for budgeted losses.

· Provisions for deferred expenses. These cover expenses that are expected to be generated at the end of a contract, such as the removal of construction machinery or dismantling costs, together with estimates of the repairs that will be required during the warranty period. These provisions are connected with an existing obligation set out in the contract, on the basis that the company will probably allocate resources to complying with the obligation, the amount of which can be reliably estimated. The provisions are allocated on the basis of the best possible estimates of total costs. They may be calculated as a percentage of the total revenues expected from the contract, if there is historical information from similar contracts.
· As regards the warranty obligations included in this type of provision, these will not be treated as a separate performance obligation, unless the customer has the option of engaging the warranty separately, meaning that the obligation will be entered in accordance with IAS 37 on "provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets".
· Provisions for budgeted losses. These provisions are recognised as soon as it becomes obvious that the total costs expected to be incurred in a contract exceed total expected revenues. For the purposes of calculating this provision, where necessary, the criteria set out in paragraph 14 (b) of IAS 37 are applied. In this way, the estimate of the total contract budget will include the forecast revenues that are considered probable. These criteria are different from those set out in IFRS 15, mentioned above in Note 1.2.3.4 "revenue recognition", under which the said revenues are only recognised when considered highly probable. Likewise, in the event that the total profit expected from a contract is lower than the amount recognised according to the rules set out above for revenue recognition, the difference is entered as a provision for negative margins.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

156
vii) Specific criteria for the recognition of revenues by segment
Construction business
For construction contracts, as a general rule, single performance obligation will be identified owing to the high degree of integration and customisation of the various goods and services to provide a combined output that is transferred to the customer over time.
As mentioned above, the Group has chosen the "measured work unit" (output method) as its preferred method. This is applied whenever the progress of the work can be measured as it is being carried out, and a price has been allocated to each work unit.
It is only with regard to contracts in which it is not possible to determine a unit price for the units to be completed that the input method known as "measure of progress based on costs incurred" may be applied.
Services business
In the case of the Services business, there is no single type of contract, given the wide diversity of services offered. In general, contracts include a range of different tasks and unit prices, in which revenues are entered in the income statement when the services are provided, based on time elapsed, i.e. when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the performance of the service as it is being provided. This happens, for example, with recurring or routine services such as facility management, street cleaning or waste collection services.
Certain contracts include different types of activities, subject to a scale of fixed unit tariffs for the provision of the services that are provided and that form part of the contract as a whole. In these contracts, the customer requests each service by submitting work orders which are classified as independent performance obligations, and any associated revenues will be recognised on the basis of the specific requirements set out for approval in each contract.
In the case of complex, long-term contracts that include the provision of various services involving different performance obligations (construction, maintenance, operation, etc.), payment of which is made regularly and for which the price relating to the obligations in question is indicated in the contract or can be calculated, revenues are recognised for the recurring services on an elapsed time basis, using the progress achieved criterion for the more complex performance obligations in which it is not possible to allocate a price to each of the units completed.
Lastly, it should be noted that the revenue from certain contracts that fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 is recognised as described in Note 1.2.3.2.
Toll roads business
The arrangements included in this line of business are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 12, which provides for the classification of the assets assigned to such arrangements on the basis of the intangible asset model and the financial asset model (bifurcated arrangements can also exist) (see Note 1.2.3.2).
In the case of concession arrangements accounted for using the intangible asset model, the customer is the user of the infrastructure and, therefore, each use made of the infrastructure by users is considered a performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognised at a point in time. In the case of concession arrangements accounted for using the financial asset model, in which the customer is the concession grantor, revenue recognition depends on the various services provided (e.g. operation or maintenance), which will be accounted for as different performance obligations, to which market prices have to be allocated. In cases in which an isolated sale price cannot be directly identified, it is estimated on the basis of the best possible estimate, applying the margin expected for this business.

Airports business
Generally speaking, these are short-term services rendered to the customer (airlines or airport users), in which regulated revenues will be recognised at a specific moment, which means there are no changes with regard to this activity. It should be noted that the revenue from certain contracts that fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 is recognised as described in Note 1.2.3.2.
Real estate business
This consists mainly of revenues associated with the sale of flats, retail units and garages, which are entered when the purchaser obtains legal rights and takes physical possession of the asset. Each unit (flat, etc.) will be classified as a separate performance obligation and recognised upon the legal and financial transfer of the asset to the purchaser, and there are no changes to the current way in which revenues are recognised.
Energy distribution business
Contracts with a series of services that are substantially the same and are transferred using the same standard model. The monthly tariff reflects the value of the services rendered. These types of contract will only have a performance obligation that is transferred over time, and revenues are recognised using the output method.
1.2.3.5 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale if it is considered that their carrying amount will be recovered when sold, rather than via continued use. This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable, and they are available for immediate sale in their current condition, and that the sale is likely to be completed in the space of one year from the classification date. The period may be extended if the delay is caused by events and circumstances beyond the company's control and there is sufficient evidence of the commitment to the sales plan. The total of these assets is registered in one line, and valued at the lower value of their carrying amount and their fair value, less the costs to sell them, and are not subject to depreciation from the moment they are classified as held for sale. The profit/(loss) contribution of these assets to the Group's profit/(loss) is registered in the income statement, classified by type.
An entity that is committed to a sale plan that entails the loss of control of a subsidiary will classify all that subsidiary's assets and liabilities as held for sale when the requirements indicated in the previous paragraph are met, irrespective of whether or not the entity retains a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary following the sale.
1.2.3.6 Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations are those that have been sold or otherwise disposed of, or have been classified as held for sale and represent a full segment for the consolidated Group, or form part of a single plan or relate to a subsidiary acquired solely for resale. The profit/(loss) generated from discontinued operations, both for the current financial year, as well as those presented alongside it, is presented in a specific line in the income statement after tax, with the total comprising the follow amounts:
· Profit/(loss) after tax of the activities and/or discontinued operations.
· Profit/(loss) after tax recognised for the fair value measurement, less sales costs, or for divestment.

1.2.4. Accounting estimates and judgements
In the consolidated annual accounts for 2019 estimates were made to measure certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and obligations reported therein. These estimates basically relate to the following:
i) The estimates that are taken into account for the purposes of recognising revenues from contracts with customers (see Note 1.2.3.4), particularly important being those relating to:
· determining whether there are enforceable rights to recognise revenues;
· determining whether the modification of a contract has been approved;
· establishing whether the criteria have been met to recognise revenue as variable consideration;
· recognising revenues in relation to a claim or dispute;
· establishing whether there are one or more performance obligations and the price to be allocated to each of them;
· defining the method applicable to each performance obligation in order to recognise revenues on the basis of time, bearing in mind that, according to the accounting policy established by the company, the preferred method is the output method (analysis of work completed), based on either percentage completed or time elapsed, while the input method (measure of progress based on costs) is applied in cases in which the services rendered do not represent recurrent and routine services in which it is not possible to determine the unit price for the units to be completed;
· in the case of contracts entered under the criterion of examination of work completed, measurement of the units completed and the price to be allocated to them;
· in the case of contracts entered using the input method (measure of progress based on costs), defining the degree to which costs have been incurred and the margin expected to be obtained from the contract;
· determining capitalisation of bidding and mobilisation costs;
· assessment of whether to act as principal or agent;
· estimates relating to the calculation of provisions for expected losses and deferred expenses.
ii) The judgement regarding meeting the conditions to classify the assets and liabilities of the Services Division as discontinued operations in line with IFRS 5, and for the fair value estimation of those assets (see Note 1.1.3).
iii) The assessment of possible legal contingencies (see Note 6.5, contingent liabilities, and Note 6.3, provisions).
iv) The recognition for accounting purposes of the subordinated guaranteed hybrid bond (see Note 5.1.2 equity instruments).
v) The estimates for the selection of the accounting method to be applied in relation to the loss of control, as in the case of the Autopista del Sol in 2019 (see Note 1.2.2, basis of consolidation).
vi) Estimates regarding the valuation of derivatives and the expected cash flows associated with them in order to determine the existence of hedging relationships (see Note 5.5, derivative financial instruments at fair value).
vii) The measurement of possible impairment losses on certain assets (see Notes 3.1, goodwill, and Note 3.5, investments in associates).
viii) Business performance projections that affect the estimates of the activation of tax assets and the possible recoverability of the same (see Note 2.8 on tax matters).

157
ix) Estimates that take account of the future vehicle numbers on toll roads for the purpose of preparing financial information for toll roads pursuant to IFRIC 12 (see Note 3.3, Investments in infrastructure projects, and Note 6.3, Provisions).
x) The assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of liabilities due to pensions and other obligations to employees (see Note 6.2, Pension plan deficit).
xi) The measurement of share award plans (see Note 6.7, Sharebased payment).
xii) Estimation to determine the term of lease agreements when they include cancellation or extension options; assessment of whether the exercise of such options, which affect the value of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability, is reasonably certain (see Note 1.2.1.a.).
These estimates were made using the best information available at 31 December 2019 on the events analysed. However, it is possible that events that may take place in the future might make it necessary to change these estimates. Changes in accounting estimates would be applied prospectively in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8.
1.2.5. Disclosures
It should also be noted that in preparing these consolidated annual accounts the Group has omitted any information or disclosures which did not require disclosure due to their qualitative importance and were considered to be unimportant or not material in accordance with the concept of relative materiality, as defined in the IFRS conceptual framework.

1.3. EXCHANGE RATE

As indicated above, Ferrovial engages in business outside the eurozone through various subsidiaries. The exchange rates used to convert these financial statements for their inclusion in the Group's consolidated financial statements are as follows:

The impact recorded in this regard on shareholders' funds attributable to the parent company is EUR 105 million (see Note 5.1.1 Changes in Equity).
Note 5.4 explains how exchange rate risk is managed. The Note also contains an analysis of the impact that Brexit has had or might have in the future vis-à-vis the different financial risks affecting Ferrovial. This overview is further extended with a global analysis of Brexit in the Risk section of the Management Report.
In addition, the impact caused by exchange rates is also analysed in the Notes where this is a relevant issue.

1.4. INFORMATION BY SEGMENT
Appendix III contains the statements of financial position and the income statement for each business segment, both for the financial year in course and for the comparative period.
It also includes a breakdown by segment of the sections in which this information is important or required under accounting legislation.

SECTION 2: PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE YEAR

This section comprises the Notes relating to the profit/(loss) for 2019.
Net profit/(loss) for 2019 amounted to EUR 268 million, as compared with EUR -448 million in 2018.
Profit/(loss) in 2019 has been impacted by various nonrecurring elements:
· Capital gains from the sale of 65% of the Autopista del Sol toll road (EUR 473 million).
· Impact of discontinued operations totalling EUR -263 million, mainly comprising EUR -440 million for value adjustments, of which EUR -270 million was recognised in the final quarter and EUR 216 million mainly due to the nondepreciation of the assets under IFRS 5 and eliminations of internal operations.

In addition to the impacts indicated, of note in 2019 were the recognised losses in the Construction business, with an operating loss of EUR -365 million, primarily relating to the provisions recognised in the first quarter of 2019 for potential future losses at various projects in the US.
Profit/(loss) in 2018 was affected by the fair value provision recognised in relation to the Services business in the UK, following its classification to discontinued operations (EUR 774 million).
For clarity, this section addresses income statement movements in continuing operations on each line and ends with a breakdown of discontinued operations.

The sum of these headings increased by EUR 593 million, from EUR 4,314 million at 31 December 2018 to EUR 4,907 million at 31 December 2019. This increase is explained essentially by the provision posted during the first quarter of the year for potential future losses at various projects in the US in the Construction Division as well as services rendered by subcontractors, also in that division.

2.4. EBITDA AND EBIT BEFORE IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSALS
EBITDA at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 121 million (31 December 2018: EUR 479 million), representing a decrease of -75% compared to 2018, primarily due to the aforementioned recognised losses in the Construction Division.

The amortisation charge for 2019 is EUR 180 million, compared to EUR 127 million in 2018.
The Management Report provides a detailed analysis of the way these line items have performed by business.

2.5. IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSALS

The following section contains a breakdown of the main gains and losses relating to impairment and disposals:
Profit/(loss) recognised in 2019:
The amounts recognised in respect of impairment and disposals in 2019 came to a total of EUR 460 million and primarily related to the following items:
· Capital gain on the disposal of the Autopista del Sol toll road, amounting to EUR 474 million (EUR 473 million in Net profit) of which EUR 95 million relate to the fair value of the shareholding retained (15%). This transaction is described in Note 1.1.4 Changes in the consolidation scope.
· Impairment loss of EUR -58 million on the Terrassa Manresa toll road (AUTEMA) receivable (see Note 3.3.2).

2.6. NET FINANCIAL INCOME/(EXPENSE)
The following table gives a detailed, item-by-item breakdown of the changes in net financial income/(expense) in 2019 and 2018. The profit/(loss) generated by the infrastructure project companies is presented separately from the result of non-infrastructure project companies (see the definition in Note 1.1.2) and in each of them a further distinction is made between the financial income on financing (which includes the finance costs on credits and loans with credit institutions and bonds, and the returns on financial investments and loans granted) and the net financial income/(expense) from derivatives and other items, which includes the impact of the fair value measurement of ineffective hedges and other income and expenses not directly related to financing.

(*) Included in the fair value column in relation to the net financial income/(expense) in the consolidated income statement for a total amount of EUR 35 million in 2019 and EUR 24 million in 2018.
· The net financial income/(expense) on the financing of the infrastructure project companies: amounted to EUR -264 million in 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR -233 million). Of this profit/(loss), EUR -282 million relates to the external financing of these companies. The following table provides a breakdown of this financial expense, which includes the expenses capitalised as a result of toll roads under construction:

FINANCIAL EXPENSES IN P&L

2019 -302
20 -282

2018 -271
32 -239

The movement in net financial income/(expense) is explained mainly by the reduction in the amount capitalised compared to 2018 (EUR -12 million) in respect of Toll roads under construction, due mainly to the opening of sections of the I-77 and NTE Segment 3, as well as the increase in interest accrued on US toll road borrowings (EUR -34 million).

· The other net financial income/(expense) from infrastructure projects: mainly refers to all other net financial income/(expense), which includes exchange rate differences and other profit/(loss) that are classified as financial income but are not directly linked to financing. The main impacts are detailed in the following table:

· The financial income from ex-infrastructure projects in 2019 amounted to EUR 28 million (31 December 2018: EUR 9 million), relating to external borrowing costs (EUR -47 million) and financial income primarily obtained from financial investments (EUR 75 million). The improvement over the 2018 financial year is primarily due to the higher return from cash resources compared to the previous financial year (improved position in Canadian dollars, which earn a higher return than the euro).
· Other financial results from ex-infrastructure projects include the impact of derivatives and other fair value adjustments

primarily relating to the impact of the derivatives not designated as hedges, including most notably, equity swaps arranged by the Group to hedge the impact on equity of share-based variable remuneration schemes (see Note 6.7) with a positive impact in 2019 of EUR 25 million due to the good performance of the share price in 2019.
· Excluding the effects caused by derivatives, the remaining net financial income/(expense) from ex-infrastructure project companies are shown below:

This sub-section principally includes the cost of guarantees, late payment interest, foreign exchange differences, interest on loans granted to equity-accounted companies, financial expenses on pension plans and interest on tax proceedings. In 2019, bank guarantee income reflects the billing of bank guarantees to equityaccounted projects (EUR 19 million), in particular the I-66 toll road.
Impact on cash flow: As can be observed in the following table, the difference between the net financial income/(expense) on financing and the interest cash flows reported in the cash flow statement is EUR -44 million.

This difference at project level primarily comes from the US toll roads (NTE, LBJ, NTE Segment 3 and I-77), in which the financing agreements allow for the capitalisation of interest during the early years of the concession, in such a way that it is added to the principal and means that there is no outflow of cash during the financial year (EUR -83 million), as well as the impact of the reclassification of the Services Division as a discontinued operation (EUR 24 million), given that it is not reflected in the net financial income/(expense) of the division in the line item "Net financial income/expense on financing" in the income statement, but the interest cash flow is in the Cash Flow Statement.

2.7. SHARE OF PROFITS OF EQUITY-ACCOUNTED COMPANIES

The share of the net profit of equity-accounted companies in 2019 amounted to EUR 296 million (2018: EUR 239 million). The detail of the most significant companies is as follows:

HAH
407 ETR
Other
TOTAL

2019 106 153 37 296

2018 70 136 33 239

In 2019 HAH's profit/(loss) most notably includes non-recurring impacts due to the impact of the fair value adjustments relating to

the valuation of derivatives (primarily due to the performance of the ILSs contracted), which had a positive impact of EUR 31 million (2018: EUR 3 million). Excluding these non-recurring impacts, HAH's profit/(loss) improved by EUR 7 million compared to the previous year, reaching EUR 80 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 66 million).
In terms of 407 ETR, the positive performance compared to December 2018 (EUR 17 million) is primarily due to the increase in toll rates.
Within the item "Other", of particular note are the Portuguese toll roads Auto-Estrada Norte Litoral (EUR 9 million) and Autoestrada do Algarve (EUR 6 million), as well as AGS Airports (EUR 9 million) and other projects for the amount of EUR 13 million.
Note 3.5 provides greater detail on the profit/(loss) of these companies.
2.8. CORPORATE INCOME TAX AND DEFERRED TAXES
2.8.1. Explanation of the corporate income tax expense for the year and the applicable tax rate
The corporate income tax rebate for 2019 amounted to EUR -47 million (2018: EUR -24 million), this amount:
· Does not include the corporate income tax expense relating to equity-accounted companies (see Notes 2.7 and 3.5) which, pursuant to accounting legislation, the result is presented net of the related tax effect.
· Includes a corporate income tax rebate relating to prior financial years in the amount of EUR 7 million (2018: EUR 39 million), primarily due to the regularisation of assets and liabilities for deferred taxes from prior years.
Once the pre-tax profit/(loss) (EUR 504 million), the profit from these equity-accounted companies (pre-tax profit of EUR 296 million), permanent differences (EUR -34 million) and consolidated results without tax effects (EUR 46 million) have been excluded, and considering the expense due to corporate income tax adjusted for regularisations in prior years (EUR 54 million), the resulting effective corporate income tax rate is 25%, as detailed in the following table.
This effective tax rate is in line with the rates applicable in the main countries in which Ferrovial has a presence.

The following is an explanation of the various items that must be adjusted in order to calculate the effective tax rate:

· Permanent differences. This item relates to the year's expenses or income which, pursuant to the tax legislation applicable in each of the countries, are not deductible (expenses) or taxable (income) in the year, and are not expected to be deductible or taxable in future years. The cumulative balance in this item is income of EUR -34 million. The most significant of these adjustments are broken down below:
· Capital gains generated by the sale of assets in the Toll Roads Division (EUR -480 million), primarily for the sale of Autopista del Sol, which are exempt from tax (see Note 1.1.4).
· Losses that are generated in specific contracts performed outside Spain and do not generate a tax credit, primarily in the US Construction Division (EUR 407 million).
· Impairment of the Autema toll road receivable, without any tax impact (see Note 2.5), in the amount of EUR 58 million.
· Limited deductibility of financial expenses for corporate income tax equating to an impact of EUR 7 million in the Toll Roads Division in Portugal.
· Various different types of non-deductible expenses, primarily related to Budimex for EUR 12 million.
· Prior years' deductions of EUR -16 million.
· Profit/(loss) on consolidation with no tax impact. This item relates to profit/(loss) derived from accounting consolidation criteria which do not have any tax implications. The accumulated balance for this concept is an expense of EUR 46 million that relates to profit in concession project companies in the US, Canada and Portugal, in which other companies have ownership interests and which are fully consolidated. The tax credit is recognised solely at Ferrovial's percentage of ownership as these companies are taxed under pass-through tax rules; the shareholders of these companies are the taxpayers, at the percentage of ownership that they hold therein.

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities most notably include the impact of the exclusion from the consolidation scope of Autopista del Sol, which lead to a decrease in deferred assets of EUR 81 million (see Note 1.1.4).
The deferred tax assets and liabilities entered at 31 December 2019 arose mainly from:

a) Tax credits
These are tax credits that have not yet been used by companies in the Group. This line item does not include all the existing tax credits, but rather only those that, based on the Group's projections, are expected to be able to be used before they expire. The total balance recognised amounts to EUR 54 million, of which EUR 39 million relate to negative tax loss carryforwards. The remaining effect relates to deductions that Ferrovial has accredited on the basis of double taxation, reinvestment and other items that remained pending application on 31 December 2019, amounting to a total of EUR 50 million (2018: EUR 61 million), of which EUR 15 million have been carried forward.
The detail of the total tax loss carryforwards, distinguishing between the maximum tax asset and the tax asset recognised based on the projected recoverability of continuing and discontinued operations, is as follows:

Spanish consolidated tax group:
For the purpose of ascertaining the recoverability of the tax-loss carryforwards and tax credits, a model was designed based on the Group companies' latest available results projections, the decision having been taken not to recognise all of the tax credits given the current uncertainty surrounding the sale of Autopista del Sol (Note 1.1.4) and the divestment of the Services division (Note 1.1.3).
US consolidated tax group:
At 31 December 2019, the balance of tax-loss carryforwards pending use of the consolidated tax group in the US totalled EUR 70 million. In line with the approach adopted in prior years, the Group has decided not to enter all of its tax credits, given the uncertainty of whether they will be recoverable, and that they could be delayed by new projects being awarded.
Australia:
Following the acquisition of Broadspectrum, Ferrovial formed a consolidated tax group with all of its Australian companies. When Broadspectrum is effectively divested, the company owning all the rights to the tax credits will be the parent of the Services Division tax group, so it has been decided to transfer the credits generated by the Construction and Toll Road divisions to 31 December 2018 to discontinued operations (EUR 19 million). Based on profit projections, tax-loss carryforwards were recognised in Australia in the amount of EUR 91 million for discontinued operations.
UK:
From 1 April 2017, new tax rules came into effect in the United Kingdom, with the application of new regulations that have an impact on the consolidated tax Group in the country. The main movements consist of a restriction on the use of tax losses; possible offset of 100% of taxable income up to GBP 5 million and 50% of the remaining taxable income for an unlimited time, whether the credit was generated before or after the date on which the reform came into effect. Tax-loss carryforwards may also be used by any company in the consolidated Group. Based on this new scheme, in the 2019 financial year tax-loss carryforwards were recognised in the United Kingdom in the amount of EUR 33 million and EUR 7 million for discontinued and continuing operations respectively.

b) Assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between accounting and tax criteria
This line item relates to the tax impact resulting from the fact that the timing of recognition of certain expenses or depreciation and amortisation charges is different for accounting and tax purposes.
The recognition of a tax asset in this connection means that certain expenses have been recognised for accounting purposes before their recognition for tax purposes and, therefore, the company will recover these expenses for tax purposes in future years. Conversely, a liability for this item represents an expense that is recognised for tax purposes before its recognition for accounting purposes.
The deferred tax assets include most notably:
· Provisions recognised for accounting purposes which do not have a tax effect until they are materialised (EUR 206 million).
· Deferred tax assets of EUR 106 million arising as a result of differences between the tax and accounting methods used to recognise income, mainly in the Construction Division.
· Accelerated depreciation and amortisation for accounting purposes (EUR 9 million).
The balance of the liabilities relates mainly to:
· Differences between tax and accounting criteria in relation to the recognition of provisions (EUR 93 million).
· Deferred tax liabilities for differences between tax and accounting amortisation (EUR 99 million).
· Deferred tax assets of EUR 25 million arising as a result of differences between the tax and accounting methods used to recognise income, mainly in the Construction Division.
· Deferred tax liabilities of EUR 46 million arising as a result of differences between the tax and accounting methods used to recognise income in accordance with IFRIC 12, mainly in the Toll Road Division.
c) Deferred taxes arising from equity measurement adjustments
This reflects the cumulative tax impact resulting from measurement adjustments recognised in reserves. This impact appears as an asset or liability since there is generally no direct tax effect until this amount in reserves is transferred to profit/(loss).
The asset balance relates to accumulated losses in reserves that will have a tax impact when they are recognised in profit/(loss). Conversely, the liability balance relates to gains not yet recognised for tax purposes. Noteworthy are the deferred tax asset and liability relating to financial derivatives amounting to EUR 114 million and EUR 115 million, respectively.
d) Deferred taxes relating to goodwill
These relate to deferred tax liabilities relating to the tax credit for goodwill amounting to EUR 38 million, which mainly include those related to the amortisation of Webber, LLC goodwill.
The detail of the movements in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in 2018 is as follows:

2.8.4. Years open to tax inspection
In accordance with prevailing tax legislation, taxes may not be deemed to be finally settled until the returns filed have been inspected by the tax authorities or the four-year limitation period has elapsed. The tax authorities have a period of 10 years to verify and investigate tax-loss carryforwards and certain deductions pending offset.
Ferrovial S.A. is currently undergoing a tax inspection relating to a Recovery Procedure for Spanish State Aid linked to the tax writedown of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Amey (EU Decision 2015/314 of the European Commission of 15 October 2014 (Third Decision)) (see Note 6.5.1), in connection with corporate income tax for the years 2016 to 2018. The tax inspection is currently at the documentation submission stage and tax assessments are expected to be raised during 2020.

The verification and inspection proceedings that began in July 2017 on the companies Ferrovial S.A. and its Spanish tax consolidated group, Ferrovial Agroman S.A., Ferrovial Servicios, S.A. and Ferrovial Internacional S.L.U. in respect of corporate income tax for 2012 to 2014, value added tax for June 2013 to December 2015, withholdings and payments on account of earned income and professional fees for June 2013 to December 2015, and withholdings on account of non-resident income tax for June 2013 to December 2015 were completed in the second half of 2019, when notifications were received of the settlement resolutions derived from the tax assessments accepted and not accepted. Claims have been lodged against the settlement resolutions in the economic-administrative courts and are currently being processed pending a ruling. Given these proceedings a net tax provision of EUR 15 million has been set aside during 2019.
The last four years are open to inspection for all applicable taxes.
The criteria that the tax authorities might adopt in relation to the years open for review could give rise to contingent tax liabilities which cannot be objectively quantified. It is considered that any possible material tax contingencies had been adequately provisioned at year-end.

2.8.5. Tax regime applicable to Ferrovial S.A.
Ferrovial, S.A. has filed consolidated tax returns since 2002. The companies composing the Consolidated Tax Group together with Ferrovial, S.A. in 2019 are detailed in Appendix II. In 2014, the entity adopted the tax system laid down in Articles 107 and 108 of Corporate Income Tax Act ("LIS") 27/2014, of 27 November. Given that the implementation of such system affects the taxation of potential dividends or capital gains obtained by company shareholders, a note describing the tax treatment applicable to

shareholders is attached as Appendix I to these consolidated annual accounts, as well as information on tax results by Ferrovial S.A. to be considered by the shareholders for the purposes of applying this system.
NOTES ON PROFIT/(LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
2.9. PROFIT/(LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
As discussed in Note 1.1.3, at 31 December 2019, and as in 2018, the Services Division is classified to discontinued operations, the impact on the income statement of this business area is now reported in one line item "net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations". This line also includes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value of the assets and their carrying amount.
With respect to the Australia and New Zealand business, the transaction closing price (EUR 303 million), minus estimated costs to sell (EUR -3 million), were used as references to determine fair value. This entailed recognising an impairment loss of EUR -270 million in the final quarter of 2019, in addition to the EUR -170 million already recorded in the third quarter (see Note 1.1.3).
For a better understanding of the profit/(loss) of the Service business and the way in which it has been included in the Group's consolidated profit/(loss), the accompanying table provides a breakdown by line of the profit/(loss) of the discontinued operation:

When analysing the different components of the profit/(loss) for discontinued operations, the following is noteworthy:
EBITDA in 2019 stood at EUR 382 million, compared to EUR 136 million in 2018. This improvement is primarily due to 2018 profit/(loss) recognising the impact of the Birmingham contract amounting to EUR -235 million (GBP -208 million).
The net financial income/(expense) amounted to EUR -74 million in 2019, in line with the figure for 2018 (EUR -78 million).
Adjustments for discontinued operations in 2019 mainly comprise the elimination of asset depreciation and the elimination of internal operations amounting to EUR 216 million (see Note 1.1.3).
The fair value provision relates to the aforementioned impairments at the Australia business.

2.10. PROFIT/(LOSS) FROM NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS

In 2019 the profit/(loss) attributed to non-controlling interests amounted to EUR 9 million (December 2018: EUR -57 million).

This figure relates to the profits obtained by Group Companies that may be allocated to other partners with a stake in the said companies. The figures shown as positive numbers refer to companies that generate losses, and the figure is therefore shown as a negative number.

The main change was the decline in results at FAM Construction LLC (EUR 38 million) and Sugar Creek LLC (EUR 30 million), due to losses recognised in the first quarter of the year in relation to construction contracts in the US, as detailed in Note 6.3., offset by the improved results recognised at the North Tarrant Express and LBJ Infrastructure Group toll roads.

-8 -456 738,479 -8,259 730,220 -0.61 449 0.61 -848 -1.16

Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing profit for the year attributed to the parent company's shareholders, adjusted for the net coupon for the year on the subordinated perpetual bonds issued by the group and taken directly to equity (see Note 5.1.2.d), by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding the average number of treasury shares held during the year.

As regards diluted earnings per share, it should be noted that the Group did not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares, since no convertible debt instruments were issued and the share-based remuneration schemes described in Note 6.7 will not give rise to any share capital increases at the Group. Consequently, no dilutive impact is envisaged when employee rights under the plans are exercised. Hence there is no difference between the basic and diluted earnings per share.

The capital increases carried out by the Group in 2018 and 2019 to meet commitments to make share-based payments to shareholders availing themselves of scrip dividend arrangements (see Note 5.1.1.) do not distort earnings per share since the company's policy is to reduce share capital in the amount approximately equivalent to the shares issued (see Note 5.1.2.a).

SECTION 3: NON-CURRENT ASSETS

This section includes the Notes on non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet, excluding deferred tax assets (Section 2) and financial derivatives (Section 5).
The main components of the non-current assets at December 2019 at Ferrovial are "fixed assets in infrastructure projects" amounting to EUR 6,880 million, accounting for 56% of total non-current assets (see Note 3.3), "investments in associates" amounting to EUR 2,557 million (relating mainly to the investments in HAH and 407 ETR), accounting for 20% of total non-current assets (see Note 3.5). The "Goodwill on consolidation" (EUR 248 million) accounts for 2% of total noncurrent assets.

as well as the exchange rate effect (appreciation of the US dollar against the euro), which has caused an impact of EUR 108 million.
Investments in associates increased by EUR 70 million, due principally to the share of the profit of these companies (EUR 296 million), the exchange rate effects, primarily due to the appreciation of the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar (EUR 148 million), as well as the classification to Investments in associates of the 15% held in Ausol for EUR 111 million, following the disposal carried out in 2019 (see Note 1.1.4), partly offset by the distribution of dividends amounting to EUR 479 million, primarily from HAH and 407 ETR.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

As regards the performance of fixed assets in infrastructure projects, the movement as compared with the previous financial year is primarily due to changes in the consolidation scope due to the sale of 65% of Autopista del Sol (see Note 1.1.4), as well as fixed asset additions (EUR 247 million) and disposals (EUR 110 million) arriving to the net amount of EUR 137 million, primarily in projects under development in the US,

Goodwill decreased by EUR 124 million due mainly to the aforementioned sale of Autopista del Sol (EUR -70 million) and to the reclassification of Autema's receivable (EUR -58 million), increasing the balance.

3.1.1. Movements over the year
The following is a description of the main changes by type of change:
Changes in the consolidation scope
The impact of changes in the consolidation scope relates to the goodwill allocated to Autopista del Sol, the company sold to the French infrastructure fund Meridiam (see Note 1.1.4).

Reclassifications
In 2019, the company reclassified the goodwill allocated to the Autema project (EUR 58 million) as an increase in the amount of the account receivable recognised in respect of the concession, since the recoverability of both assets is tied to the receipt of the same contractual flows (see Note 3.3.2).
3.1.2. Goodwill impairment tests
A. Construction Division goodwill (Webber and Budimex):
Methodology and discount rate
The goodwill of Webber (US) and Budimex (Poland) amounted to EUR 137 million and EUR 68 million, respectively, at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 134 million and EUR 68 million, respectively).
In the case of Webber, five-year projections are adopted and the residual value is based on the cash flow for the last year projected, provided that this cash flow is normalised, and applying a growth rate that in no case exceeds the long-term growth rate estimated for the market in which the company operates. The cash flows are discounted at a discount rate (WACC) after tax of 7.1% (compared to 8.5% in 2018) and a growth rate into perpetuity of 2.0% (2018: 2.25%). The risk-free interest rate used to calculate the WACC is 2.25%, 34 basis points above the ten-year US bond rate at 31 December 2019.

In 2019, the approximate discount rate (WACC) before tax amounted to 8.5% (compared with 10.0% in 2018).
In the case of Budimex, since it is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the goodwill was tested for impairment by ascertaining whether the closing market price at 31 December 2019 of the Budimex share was higher than its carrying amount plus the allocated goodwill. The test did not show the existence of any impairment.
Main factors that affect the valuation and performance compared with the previous year and budget:
The projected cash flows are based on the latest estimates approved by the company, which take into account recent historical data. The main factors that affect the cash flow projections of Webber are revenue forecasts and the projected operating margins. These projections are based on four basic components: the existing order book, winning new contracts, estimated future margins and the perpetuity growth rate. It should be noted that the forecast operating margins are lower than the historical margins of recent years, in line with average margins in the industry. The perpetuity growth rate used was 2.00%, which is similar to long-term inflation forecasts for the US without considering present economic growth.
Impairment test results:
The value of Webber resulting from application of this impairment test model is 107% higher than its carrying amount (compared to 75% in 2018).
The residual value of Webber represents 42% of the total value after the specific forecast period.
The quoted market price of the Budimex share at 31 December 2019 was 546% higher than its carrying amount (compared to 278% in 2018).
Sensitivity analysis:
A sensitivity analysis was performed on Webber's goodwill, particularly in relation to the operating profit margin, the discount rate and the perpetuity growth rate, so as to ensure that possible changes in the estimate do not have an impact on the possible recovery of the goodwill recognised.

169
Specifically, a pessimistic scenario was taken into consideration with a perpetuity growth rate of 1% and a reduction in the profit from operations of 50 basis points. The value disclosed in this scenario presents a buffer of 80% over the carrying amount.
On this basis, the valuation disclosed would equal the carrying amount if the reduction in the margin with respect to the projected figure was 395 basis points, thereby leaving the assumption of perpetuity growth at 1%.
Lastly, it should be stated that in a scenario maintaining the margins but assuming a zero perpetuity growth rate (compared to 2%), there would be no impairment.
At Budimex, due to the significant buffer between the quoted market price and its carrying amount, the company considers that there is no evidence of impairment.
C. Transchile goodwill:
In addition to the goodwill relating to Budimex and Webber, the remaining goodwill relates to Transchile (the transmission line operating company in Chile).
Based on the goodwill impairment test findings, the buffer is 14% with respect to the carrying amount of EUR 61.6 million. The flows were discounted at a 6.8% cost of capital (8.1% before taxes), which is in line with the rate used to calculate goodwill impairment in 2018.
3.2. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At year-end 2019, the balance of intangible assets other than infrastructure projects amounted to EUR 62 million (2018: EUR 32 million).
This line item includes:
· "Rights on Concessions" includes the rights to operate the tenders that are not classified as projects (see definition in Note 1.1.2). At 31 December 2019, this is not a significant amount (31 December 2018: EUR 4 million).
· "IT applications" with a net value of EUR 7 million (31 December 2018: EUR 6 million).
· "Contracts with customers and commercial relations", relating to the net value of the commercial order book, customer databases and other intangible assets, in the amount of EUR 57 million (31 December 2018: EUR 24 million) primarily derived from the Budimex Services business included in the Construction Division.
· During the financial year, no significant fully depreciated assets have been written down.
The impact on cash flows (see Note 5.3) from additions to intangible assets rose to EUR -8 million.

The most significant changes in 2019 were as follows:
· Exchange rate fluctuations resulted in an increase of EUR 109 million (2018: EUR 249 million) in the balance of these assets, the full amount of which was attributed to the change in the euro/US dollar exchange rate at the US toll roads (see Note 1.3).
· There were gross Toll road additions of EUR 219 million, relating in particular to the US toll road assets, which increased by EUR 214 million. Of these, the most significant involve the I-77 Mobility Partners LLC for EUR 131 million (2018: EUR 266 million), and EUR 80 million at North Tarrant Express (2018: EUR 214 million).
· Scope changes relate to disposals of the assets of Autopista del Sol which, following the sale and purchase transaction completed during the year (see Note 1.1.4), has been classified on the line Investments in associates.
· Also, "investment in other infrastructure projects" includes concession arrangements awarded to the Airports Division that are classified as intangible assets under IFRIC 12, primarily associated with electricity transmission lines in Chile for a net investment of EUR 5 million euros.
In the case of the infrastructure project companies, all their concession assets have been pledged as security for the existing borrowings (see Note 5.2). The borrowing costs capitalised in this connection in 2019 are detailed in Note 2.6.

The movements to these assets in 2018 were as follows:

Note: balances shown net of allowance provisions
As mentioned in note 3.1.3 as of December 2019, the company has reclassified the total amount of the goodwill allocated to Autema project as an increase in the amount of the account receivable recognised in respect of the concession, since the recoverability of both assets is tied to the receipt of the same contractual flows.

After this reclassification, new recalculation has been performed of the asset's book value in the account receivable, as stablished in paragraph 5.4.3 of IFRS 9, calculated as the present value of the new flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. As a result of this calculation, an impairment of 58 million euros has been recorded, equivalent to the amount of the reclassified goodwill.

Regardless of this deterioration, and as indicated in note 6.5.1.a) regarding the dispute that Autema maintains with the Generalitat of Catalonia in relation to the change of the concession regime of this project, it has been concluded that there are very solid arguments to

win the resources interposed and therefore it has been decided to keep the project registered as an account receivable.

3.3.3 Impact on cash flows
The total cash flow impact of the additions to projects accounted for using the intangible asset amounted to EUR -156 million and in the case of financial asset models, disposals of EUR +115 million (see Note 5.3), which differs from the additions recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, primarily due to the following reasons:
· In projects in which the intangible asset model is applied, due to differences between the accrual basis and cash basis of accounting, as well as the capitalisation of the borrowing costs attributable to projects under construction, which do not generate cash outflows.
· In projects in which the receivable asset model is applied, due to the increases in receivables as a balancing entry to income for services rendered, which do not generate cash outflows either.
· The impact on cash flows reflects movements associated with the discontinued operation, which are not recognised in the balance sheet due to being reclassified to held for sale.

3.4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Impact on cash flow: The impact on cash flows arising from additions to property, plant and equipment amounted to EUR -51 million (see Note 5.3).

Disposals:
The property, plant and equipment disposals and reductions amounted to EUR 30 million and arose largely as a result of the derecognition of fully depreciated or obsolete items, which did not have a material effect on the consolidated income statement. Specifically, EUR 26 million were removed in the Construction Division.

Other disclosures relating to property, plant and equipment:
The property, plant and equipment not used in operations are not material with respect to the final consolidated balances. Impairment losses on other items of property, plant and equipment total EUR 14 million (2018: EUR 14 million), associated with the Construction Division.

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which its property, plant and equipment are subject and the claims that might be filed against it for carrying on its business activities. These policies are considered to adequately cover the related risks.

The property, plant and equipment in the course of construction amount to EUR 7 million (2018: EUR 4 million).

At 31 December 2019, no significant property, plant or equipment items were subject to ownership restrictions or pledged as collateral for liabilities.

Movements: The movements in this item were primarily due to the distribution of dividends of EUR -479 million, offset for the following impacts:

· The exchange rate effect due to the appreciation in value of the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the euro, which had a positive effect of EUR 148 million.
· The increase of EUR 296 million due to the share of results for the year.
· There was also an increase of EUR 108 million in the item relating essentially to the fair value of the 15% shareholding that the group holds in Ausol for EUR 111 million, once control was lost following the sale described in Note 1.1.4.
· Impact on cash flow: The difference between the dividends of EUR 478 million in the foregoing table and the dividends of EUR 529 million disclosed in the cash flow statement (Note 5.3) relates mainly to interest received on loans granted to equity-accounted companies, recognised under non-current financial assets in the balance sheet (Note 3.6), and to the effect of certain exchange rate hedges related to dividends received.

In view of the importance of the investments in HAH and 407 ETR, below is a detail of the balance sheets and income statements of these two companies, adjusted to bring them in line with Ferrovial's accounting policies, together with comments on the changes therein in 2019.

Also, since both ownership interests were remeasured when control was lost, registering goodwill, pursuant to IAS 28 p.40 and subsequent paragraphs, the possible existence of indications of impairment is assessed on an annual basis.

3.5.1. Information relating to HAH
a. Impairment test
Based on the measurements and sensitivity analyses performed, the reference values of the most recent transactions performed by third parties and the positive changes to assets during the financial year, it was concluded that there was no impairment.
The trend was positive in 2019, with EBITDA improving by 4.5% compared to 2018. RAB grew up to GBP 16,584 million in 2019. Traffic in 2019 was also 1.0% higher than in 2018.
The main assumptions used to value this asset for impairment testing purposes were as follows:
· The most recent business plan approved by the company was considered. This plan is based on the return on assets established by the regulator for the period of six years, extended by one, ending on 31 December 2019.
· The regulator has agreed to extend the current regulatory period, iH7, by two years (2020 and 2021).
· During the following regulatory periods, and following the British Parliament's approval of the "National Policy Statement" for the

expansion of Heathrow, plans to increase the capacity of the airport (third runway project) were taken into account.
· The value of the investment was calculated by discounting the future cash flows per the business plan, using the adjusted present value (APV) method until 2051. A period of more than five years has been used to capture the high volume of investment envisaged in the medium and long term and thanks to the visibility of cash flows from the assets, allowing the projection of a longterm capital structure. A five-year projection period would not adequately reflect the value of the assets.
· Terminal value is calculated using the EV/RAB multiple, which stands at 1.15x. The growth rate implicit in the terminal value calculation is 2.6%.
· Flows are discounted at the deleveraged rate (7.1%), discounting the tax shield at the cost of borrowings rate.
The valuation analysis shows a sizeable buffer is in place compared to its carrying amount. The value of the assets would be equal to the carrying amount were the discount rate to rise by 165 basis points (deleveraged rate of 8.7%), assuming the base case assumptions were unchanged.
In turn, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the EV/RAB multiple (reducing it from 1.15x to 1.0x) in the terminal value calculation, obtaining a value that shows a considerable buffer with respect to the carrying amount.
Lastly, after a sensitivity tests carried out in a scenario without the expansion of the third runway, there would also be no impairment. However, Heathrow records assets reflecting the capacity increase in the amount of GBP 450 million for a 100% ownership interest. If this increase were not finally approved, this asset should be written off and an impairment loss recognised, despite the fact that they would be included in the RAB and could be recovered by applying higher tariffs. In this case, the net result impact for Ferrovial could be close to EUR 102 million, once considered Ferrovial ownership interest in HAH and the impairment tax impact.
Regarding this matter, today February 27th 2020, there has been knowledge of a Court´s ruling that requires to introduce a number of amendments to the project that ensures the compatibility of it with the British government´s strategy in compliance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. This resolution expressly says that it does not prevent the third runway from going forward and that the "National Policy Statement" to which the decision refers is considered under suspension, not cancelled. Following the knowledge of the ruling, Heathrow has announced that they will appeal and that at the same time they will collaborate with the Government to resolve the issues included in said ruling. In accordance with the above, Ferrovial at the date of closing of these annual accounts, has considered that the probability conditions established in IAS16 are met, and has not registered any accounting impact at the December 2019 accounts related to the mentioned Court´s ruling.
b. Movements in the balance sheet and income statement 2019-2018
In view of the importance of this investment, the following is a detail of the balance sheet and income statement for this Group of companies, adjusted to bring them into line with Ferrovial's accounting policies, together with comments on the changes therein over the course of the 2019 financial year.
The balance sheet figures shown relate to the full balances of HAH and are presented in pounds sterling. The exchange rates used in 2019 are EUR 1=GBP 0.84665 (2018: GBP 0.89842) for the balance sheet figures and EUR 1=GBP 0.87453 (2018: GBP 0.88585) for the income statement figures.

· Equity
At 31 December 2019, equity amounted to GBP 15 million, down GBP -198 million from the year ended 31 December 2018. In addition to the profit for the year of GBP 370 million, the main movements are the payment of dividends to shareholders in the amount of GBP -500 million, the negative impact of GBP -11 million recognised in reserves in relation to pension plans, and GBP -88 million (EUR -24 million net assignable to Ferrovial) due to the impact of the transition to IFRS 16 Leases on 1 January 2019 (see Note 1.2.1), all offset by the positive impact of hedging derivatives amounting to GBP 31 million.
25% of the shareholders' funds of the subsidiary does not relate to the carrying amount of the investment, since the carrying amount also includes the amount of capital gain arising from the measurement at fair value of the investment retained following the sale of a 5.88% ownership interest in HAH in October 2011. The gain was recognised as an addition to goodwill. Therefore, in order to obtain the carrying amount of Ferrovial, it would be necessary to apply 25% of the shareholders' funds presented above (GBP 3 million) by the amount of the aforementioned gain (GBP 581 million), giving a total of GBP 584 million which, translated at the year-end exchange rate (EUR 1 = GBP 0.84665), equates to a shareholding of EUR 690 million.

· Financial borrowings
The borrowings of HAH (short and long-term) amounted to GBP 16,093 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of GBP 1,291 million with respect to the prior year (31 December 2018: GBP 14,802 million). This increase was primarily due to the effect of:

· Amortisation and a bond issue in the amount of GBP -513 million and GBP 1,157 million respectively, as well as a net increase of GBP 629 million in bank borrowings.
· Decrease of GBP 34 million as a result of the fair value adjustments made to bonds issued in foreign currencies and of the related exchange rate effect. This impact is offset by the changes in value of the cross currency swaps arranged to hedge this debt (EUR -21 million).
· Other movements of EUR -10 million (mainly payable accrued interest and commissions).
· Derivative financial instruments at fair value
The notional principal amount of HAH's derivatives portfolio at 31 December 2019 totalled GBP 26,875 million, including interest rate derivatives (IRSs) with a notional amount of GBP 2,309 million (hedging floating-rate borrowings), cross currency swaps (hedging bonds issued in foreign currencies) with a notional amount of GBP 18,171 million and index-linked swaps (ILSs) with a notional amount of GBP 6,395 million). The purpose of the indexlinked swaps is to offset the imbalance that can arise between the business revenue and the regulated asset base, which are indexed to inflation, and the interest payments on fixed-rate borrowings, which do not fluctuate in response to changes in inflation.

The net change in the value (asset/liability position) of these financial instruments gave rise to a GBP 275 million reduction in liabilities in the financial year. The main impacts relate to:

· Cash settlements (net payments) of GBP 234 million.
· Accrual of financial expenses (net financial income/(expense) on financing) of GBP -121 million.
· Effect on reserves of changes in the value of hedging instruments in the amount of GBP 37 million.
· Value adjustments to these instruments (results at fair value) of GBP 125 million, primarily due to the index-linked swaps (GBP 167 million), interest rate swaps (GBP -14 million) and cross currency swaps (GBP -28 million, although these are partially offset by the fair value adjustments to the currency bonds hedged by the instruments).

Operating income improved primarily as a result of an increase in the number of passengers. Expenses are in line with the previous year. These effects were reflected in EBITDA, which improved by 4.5%.
In addition, for the purposes of comparison, it should be noted that the 2019 Income Statement reflects the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, entailing a reduction of GBP 52 million in operating expenses for the year, offset by an increase in depreciation/amortisation and financial charges (GBP 34 million and GBP 17 million, respectively).
However, the biggest change was in net financial income/(expense), which was adversely affected by the fair value adjustments to derivatives and liabilities at fair value (mainly index-linked swaps and interest rate swaps), which were an improvement compared to the previous year of GBP 116 million (EUR 33 million net attributed to Ferrovial), primarily as a result of the change in inflation forecasts.
The management report includes more detailed information on the changes in HAH's results.
3.5.2. Information relating to 407 ETR
As with HAH, given that Ferrovial's stake in the 407 ETR was remeasured when control was lost, and the implicit existence of goodwill was considered, pursuant to the contents of page 40 et seq. of IAS 28, the possible existence of indications of impairment is assessed on an annual basis.
a. Impairment test
Based on Ferrovial's valuation of this concession, the positive change in the asset seen in recent years and the sensitivity tests carried out, it has been concluded that there is no impairment.
The evolution of this asset over the last ten years has been very positive, with average annual growth in revenue of 10%, in EBITDA of 11% and in dividends of 19%. On a year-on-year basis, revenue and EBITDA increased by 8.1%.
The valuation that Ferrovial made of this concession shows a very large buffer over its book value. Sensitivity to increased revenues and the discount rate has been measured, and a broad buffer is maintained.
To calculate the recoverable value of a concessionary company with an independent financial structure and a limited duration, an assessment is made discounting the expected cash flows for the shareholder until the end of the concession. The Group believes that to reflect the value in use, models that consider the entire concessional life should be used as it is an asset with very different phases of investment and growth, and there is visibility to use a specific financial economic plan during the life of the concession.
The Cost of Equity has been estimated according to the CAPM model. To calculate the discount rate, a risk-free rate was used, which referenced the 30-year bond in Canada, a beta coefficient reflecting the asset's leverage and risk, and a market premium of 6.0% (same as last year) are used. The result is a post-tax discount rate (equity cost, or Ke) of 6.25% (7.45% before taxes).
Based on the valuation and its positive evolution in recent years, no signs of impairment have been identified.
b. Changes in the balance sheet and income statement for 2019-2018 relating to this Group of companies at 31 December 2019 and 2018.
These figures relate to the full balances of the Company and are presented in millions of Canadian dollars. The exchange rates used in 2019 are EUR 1=CAD 1.45730 (2018: CAD 1.56013) for the balance sheet figures and EUR 1=CAD 1.47988 (2018: CAD 1.53115) for the income statement figures.

Below is a description of the main changes in the balance sheet of 407 ETR at 31 December 2019 compared to the previous year:

· Equity
· Equity fell by CAD 475 million with respect to 2018, as a result of the inclusion of the profit for the year of CAD 576 million and the reduction of CAD 1,050 million due to the payment of a dividend to shareholders.
· 43.23% of the shareholders' funds of the subsidiary does not relate to the consolidated carrying amount of the holding, since the latter also includes the amount of the gain arising from the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained following the sale of a 10% ownership interest in this company in 2010, recognised as an addition to the value of the concession, and the goodwill that arose in 2009 as a result of the merger of Grupo Ferrovial, S.A. and Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transportes, S.A. Therefore, in order to obtain the consolidated carrying amount at Ferrovial, it is necessary to increase the 43.23% of shareholders' funds presented above (CAD -1,854 million) by the amount of the aforementioned gain and of the goodwill (CAD 2,607 million and CAD 1,319 million, respectively), giving a total of CAD 2,300 million which, translated at the yearend exchange rate (EUR 1 = CAD 1.45730), is equivalent to the investment of EUR 1,422 million.
· Financial borrowings
Borrowings as a whole (short-term and long-term) increased by CAD 555 million with respect to December 2018, due mainly to a bond issue in March with a nominal value of CAD 800 million (Series 19-A1 maturing in 2030 for CAD 300 million and Series 19-A2 for CAD 500 million maturing in 2030). This increase was offset by the CAD -300 million repayment of bond series 10 A-2 and the ordinary redemption of bond series 99 A-3 and 00 A-2, respectively, for CAD -13 million.
· Income Statement 2019-2018
The following table shows the income statement movements of 407 ETR in the years ended December 2019 and December 2018:

The main change in the income statement relates to "operating income" (CAD +112 million) as a result of the increase in tolls rates.
It should be noted that the profit/(loss) attributed to Ferrovial also includes the depreciation and amortisation over the concession term of the remeasurement recognised following the loss of control of the company as a result of the sale in 2010 mentioned above.
Therefore, CAD -22 million of amortisation would have to be deducted from the 43.23% of the local profit (CAD 249 million). Translating the resulting CAD 227 million at the average exchange rate (EUR 1 = CAD 1.47988) gives the EUR 153 million allocable to Ferrovial in 2019 (see Note 2.7). (EUR 1 = CAD 1.47988) gives the EUR 153 million attributed to Ferrovial in 2019 (see Note 2.7)
(EUR 1 = CAD 1.47988) gives the EUR 153 million attributed to Ferrovial in 2019.

3.5.3. Other disclosures relating to associates
a) Movements relating to the remaining associates
The associates breakdown, showing their consolidated carrying amount and the main data is disclosed in Appendix II.

The movements in 2019 in the investments in these companies were as follows:

2019 (Millions of euros)

OTHER
275 37
-28 3 -2

The share of profit/(loss) most notably includes the contributions of the joint ventures of Portuguese toll roads (EUR 15 million), AGS Airports Holding (EUR 9 million) and other associates (EUR 14 million).
The dividends received relate to AGS Airports Holding, amounting to EUR 12 million and toll roads EUR 16 million (primarily A66 Benavente-Zamora and Blackbird Infraestructure).

The net increase of EUR 108 million relates essentially to the recognition of the investment held in Autopista del Sol (EUR 111 million) explained in point 3.5. above.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

176
Finally, the Group has reclassified the amount of EUR 36 million as an increase in provisions in connection with the additional losses in certain Toll Road division companies in respect of which there are contractual obligations to contribute additional capital and/or guarantees when the value of the relevant shareholdings falls to zero (see Note 6.3. and 6.5.)
See additional comments below in point b.3).
b) Other disclosures relating to equity-accounted companies
b.1) Investment in AGS
Notable among the equity-accounted companies are AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports. Given that goodwill was generated at the time at which they were acquired, an impairment test has been carried out. The net carrying amount of AGS amounts to EUR 163 million, i.e. the sum of the investment of EUR 57 million and the value of the participating loan of EUR 106 million (see Note 3.6, Non-current financial assets). AGS was valued using a discount rate (Ke) of around 7.5% (approximate pre-tax rate of 8.5%) and presents a very significant buffer over its carrying amount. In addition, the analysts' average valuation also provides a very high buffer over its carrying amount. It should also be noted that revenue in 2019 was 1.8% higher than in 2018, while EBITDA declined by -2.7%.
b.2) I-66 toll road
November 2017 saw the financial close of the I-66 toll road in Virginia. The stake held in the concession-holding company for this toll road is 50%, and it is equity-accounted.
Although at 2019 year-end the investment in the capital of this company was not material, there is a commitment to invest an additional EUR 670 million in the next five years.
At 31 December 2019, the main toll road assets are fixed assets used in infrastructure projects in the amount of EUR 1,222 million (EUR 835 million at 31 December 2018). In terms of liabilities, of particular note is financial borrowings in the amount of EUR 1,319 million (EUR 993 million at 31 December 2018).
b.3) Other information
There are also some associates with a carrying amount of zero. Under IAS 28, if an entity's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses, unless the entity has incurred legal or constructive obligations that make it necessary to recognise a liability for additional losses after the entity's interest is reduced to zero.
There are no significant restrictions on the capacity of associates to transfer funds to the parent company in the form of dividends, debt repayments or advances other than such restrictions as might arise from the financing agreements of those associates or from their own financial position, and there are no contingent liabilities relating to associates that might ultimately be assumed by the Group.
There are no significant companies in which the ownership interest exceeds 20% that are not equity-accounted.
The guarantees provided by Group Companies to equity-accounted companies are detailed in Note 6.5.
3.6. NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS

· The net increase of EUR 497 million primarily relates to NTE Mobility Partners Segments 3 LLC amounting to EUR 618 million, due to the financial close of the 3C stretch being completed in 2019 (see Note 5.2.) and the restricted cash of this financing in relation to the payment of future investments; LBJ Infrastructure Group for EUR 79 million and I-77 Mobility Partners LLC for EUR 22 million and NTE Mobility Partners for EUR -195 million net (relating to dividend payments of USD 292 million from the project, once the contract timeframes have been met).
· The Note on the Net cash position provides details of the main balances and changes recognised in relation to this line item.
· Lastly, "Other receivables" includes:
· Other trade receivables, mainly from various public authorities in connection with long-term contracts, amounting to EUR 88 million (31 December 2018: EUR 87 million). Notable within this figure was the EUR 76 million for the M-203 toll road, relating to the recoverable amount from the Grantor (see Note 6.5.1 a)).
· Long-term deposits and guarantees amounting to EUR 16 million (December 2018: EUR 20 million).
· There has been a consolidation scope change of EUR -46 million due to the classification of Autopista del Sol as an investment in an associate (see Note 3.5.).

3.7. RIGHT OF USE ON LEASE ASSETS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES

This Nota details the right-of-use assets recognised under IFRS 16 Leases and the liabilities associated with them.

Note 1.2.1.a) details the accounting policy affecting lease agreements. The new IFRS 16 affects the group for those agreements in which it acts as a lessee. The transition impact at 1 January 2019 is detailed in Note 1.2.1.

The group primarily has lease agreements for buildings, vehicles and technical installations and machinery. Buildings provide the greatest right-of-use asset value and primarily relate to the offices of the different long-term businesses.
The most significant variations in the item relate to additions totalling EUR 74 million, of which EUR 68 million is associated with Construction division leases (primarily the business in Poland and construction activities abroad).

177
As a balancing item for the rights of use in the amount of EUR 126 million, the lease liabilities amount to EUR 153 million, of which EUR 82 million is carried as a long-term item and EUR 71 million as a short-term item.
As mentioned in Note 1.2.1.a), the Poland real estate business records certain leased assets in inventories and investment property, therefore these leases have a net cost of EUR 23 million at 31 December 2019 and this is the main reason for the difference between the closing balance of the right-of-use assets and the lease liability.
The movements in 2019 related to lease liabilities associated with contracts in force were as follows:

Of the trade inventories recognised at 31 December 2019, EUR 383 million (2018: EUR 310 million) relate to the Construction division real estate business in Poland. The impact of IFRS 16 amounting to EUR 27 million should be noted, relating to leased assets recognised in the Poland real estate business (see Note 1.2.1).
EUR 233 million of raw materials and other supplies relate to the Construction Division, primarily at Budimex amounting to EUR 112 million (2018: EUR 64 million) and via its subsidiaries in the US and Canada, amounting to EUR 102 million (2018: EUR 64 million).
Lastly, bidding and mobilisation costs includes contract costs for EUR 73 million (2018: EUR 83 million).
Both for bid and mobilisation costs, amortisation is carried out systematically, in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to which the asset corresponds. In 2019, EUR 12 million of bid costs and EUR 4 million of mobilisation costs were amortised.

"Trade receivables for sales and services" increased by EUR 90 million from a balance of EUR 801 million at 31 December 2018 to EUR 891 million at 31 December 2019. This change is primarily as a result of the following:
· The exchange rate effect has led to an increase in the balance of EUR 7 million due essentially to the depreciation of the euro against the main currencies.

179
· Variations due to scope changes/transfers amount to EUR 24 million and primarily relate to the Services business in Poland, which in 2018 was classified as a discontinued operation and in 2019 is now reported within the Construction Division, as detailed in Note 1.1.2.
· The remainder of the change (EUR 60 million), is explained primarily by the increase in this line item in Construction (EUR 43 million), particularly business activity in Poland.
·
At 31 December 2019 a total of EUR 1 million was deducted from "Trade Receivables for Sales and Services" relating to assets derecognised as a result of factoring arrangements, since it was considered that they met the conditions stipulated in paragraph 3.2.3 of IFRS 9 regarding the derecognition of financial assets (31 December 2018: EUR 4 million).

In order to manage credit risk relating to private customers, the Group has implemented pre- and post-contracting measures. Precontracting measures include the consultation of debtor registers, ratings, solvency studies, etc., while post-contracting measures during the execution of construction work include the follow-up of contractual incidents, non-payment events, etc.

"Sundry receivables" includes mainly receivables relating to normal business activities but not with the mayor customer. The change with respect to December 2018 is primarily due to pending collections under construction work insurance policies.
Also, "infrastructure project receivables" includes short-term financial assets arising from the application of IFRIC 12 relating mainly to amounts receivable from public authorities in return for services rendered or investments made under a concession arrangement, as detailed in Note 3.3.
Lastly, "receivables from public authorities" includes tax receivables other than income tax receivables.

The line item "Trade Payables" increased by EUR 13 million compared to the balance recognised at 31 December 2018, mainly as the result of exchange rate effects (EUR 11 million) and changes in the consolidation scope and transfers for EUR 18 million. As regards other movements, the main change relates to trade payables subject to reverse factoring, that is balances pending payment to suppliers under reverse factoring arrangements (see Note 1.2.3.3 on accounting policies) amounting to EUR -37 million, the balance having decreased from EUR 209 million at 31 December 2018 to EUR 172 million in December 2019.
Group management considers that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates their fair value.

b) Disclosure obligation in relation to payments to suppliers provided for in Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010
In compliance with the obligation to disclose the average supplier payment period provided for in Article 539 and Additional Provision Eight of the Spanish Companies Act (in accordance with the new wording of final provision two of Law 31/2014 reforming the Spanish Companies Act), the Company hereby states that the average period of payment to the suppliers of all the Group Companies domiciled in Spain (including the discontinued operations transactions) in 2019 was 39 days.

The following table details, as required under Article 6 of the Ruling of 29 January 2016 by the Institute for Accounting and Accounts Auditing, the information relating to the average supplier payment period in 2019 and 2018:

The mutual intra-group commercial transactions between companies belonging to the Ferrovial Group are not included in the consolidation process, meaning the consolidated balance sheet contains no outstanding balances due to companies within the Group. Thus, the information detailed in the previous table refers solely to suppliers outside of the Group, noting for information purposes that the average payment period between Group Companies is generally 30 days.

"Remunerations Payable" relates to the employee remuneration earned but not paid during the year amounting to EUR 133 million.

Also, "Payables to public authorities" includes tax payables other than corporate income tax payables, relating mainly to VAT and employer social security taxes.

4.4. INFORMATION ON BALANCES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND OTHER DISCLOSURES RELATING TO IFRS 15

Information on the balance sheet from contracts with customers
As mentioned in Note 1.2.3.4, relating to the policy with regard to recognising revenues from contracts (IFRS 15), in contracts in which the performance obligations are measured over time, the difference between the revenues recognised for services rendered and the amounts actually billed to the customer are systematically analysed on a contract by contract basis. If the amount billed is lower than the revenue recognised, the difference is recognised as an asset under "trade receivables for sales and services - completed work pending certification" (see Note 4.2.a.), whereas if the amount of revenue recognised is lower than the amount billed, a liability is recognised under "short-term trade and other payables - Works certified in advance" (Note 4.3).
Also, in certain construction contracts, advances are agreed upon that are paid by the customer when work is commenced on the contract, the balance of which is offset against the various progress billings as the contract work is performed. These amounts are included on the liabilities side of the balance sheet, under "trade payables" (Note 4.3.a).
In contrast to the advance payments, in some contracts the customer retains a portion of the price to be paid in each progress billing to guarantee the satisfaction of certain obligations under the contract. These "retentions" are not reimbursed until the contract is definitively settled. These amounts are included on the assets side of the balance sheet, under "trade receivables for sales and services" (Note 4.2.a).
Unlike "work completed and pending certification" and "Work certified in advance", the "advances" and "retentions" are balances that will have an impact on future cash flows, since in the case of the "advances" a lower amount will be collected in the future as the advances are discounted from the progress billings, whereas the "retentions" will give rise to higher collections in the future, since the customer will reimburse the related amounts as and when the contract work is settled.
The detail of the amounts recognised in this connection at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

The balance at 31 December 2019 of work completed and pending certification relates almost entirely to amounts relating to revenues from the main contract signed with the customer, since, in line with the general policy established by the Group, only works that are due and payable may be recognised, i.e. amounts that have been approved by the customer. The balance shown under claims includes only the cases in which it is deemed highly probable that there will be no reversal of revenues in the future.
As mentioned in Note 1.2.3.4, there are different methods for calculating revenues, depending on the nature of the contract. Generally speaking, performance obligations in the construction business are satisfied over time, meaning that in the case of contracts in which the output method is applied (given that the amounts relating to changes and claims are not relevant), the balance recognised primarily relates to work that has been completed and remains pending certification under the main contract, due to the difference between the time at which it is completed and the time at which it is certified.
In contracts in which such obligations do not relate to recurrent and/or routine work, and in which the level of progress method is used because it is not possible to determine the unit price of the work units to be carried out, the balance includes both the difference between the level of progress and the certification achieved, as well as the difference between the current margin obtained from the contract and the expected margin at the end of the contract at the current point of completion. The balance of "Construction work pending certification" corresponding to this type of contract amounts to EUR 168 million.
In 2018 the total for "Construction work pending certification" in relation to these types of contract amounted to EUR 77 million.
Other disclosures relating to IFRS 15:

Other quantitative and qualitative disclosures
The information relating to the disclosures that describe when performance obligations are paid under the various contracts, the existence of a significant financing component, and how the variable consideration criterion is applied, including the conditions to be met in order for revenues to be recognised in this regard and in respect of guarantees, is included in Note 1.2.3.4. Information relating to the main value judgements and estimates used to recognise revenues is also set out in Note 1.2.4.
As regards assets originating from bidding and mobilisation costs relating to contracts with customers, information on the statement of financial position recognised at 31 December 2019 is set out in detail in Note 4.1, Inventories.

SECTION 5: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING

The Notes in this section describe the changes in the financial structure of Ferrovial as a result of variations in equity (see Note 5.1) and in its consolidated net debt (see Note 5.2), (taken to be the balance of cash and cash equivalents net of the financial debt, bank borrowings and debt securities), making a distinction between infrastructure project companies and ex-infrastructure project companies. They also describe the Group's exposure to the main financial risks and the policies for managing them (see Note 5.4), as well as the derivatives arranged in connection with those policies (see Note 5.5).

The equity attributable to shareholders (see Note 5.1) decreased with respect to 2018, primarily due to shareholder remuneration. This effect is partly offset by the net profit for the year.

Ferrovial's net consolidated debt for non-infrastructure projects remains at a positive net figure of EUR 1,473 million, higher than the amount in December 2018 (EUR 975 million). This figures not included the net cash position of discontinued operations.
The positive cash flow evolution (including discontinued operations) explains the increased in the net cash position, especially noteworthy was the positive flow of business generated during the year (EUR 974 million), primarily from the

divestment of Autopista de Ausol (EUR 451 million) and by the receipt of dividends from infrastructure projects (EUR 729 million) and an operating flow ex infrastructure projects (EUR 81 million), offset by the negative Birmingham cash flow (EUR 204 million( related to the termination of the PFI contract.
This positive net figure continues to make it possible to amply achieve the objective of maintaining an investment grade rating, where the Company considers a relevant metric a ratio, for ex-infrastructure projects, of Net Debt (gross debt less cash) to gross operating profit (EBITDA) plus dividends from projects of no more than 2:1. Ferrovial's current rating stands at BBB.
In relation to gross project borrowings, the variation on the previous year (EUR 5,494 million in December 2019 vs. EUR 5,385 million in December 2018) is explained essentially by the debt issues at NTE Mobility Partners Seg 3 following the financial close of the Segment 3C and the exchange rate effect (EUR 72 million), due mainly to the appreciation of the US dollar, offset by the impact of scope changes (EUR 508 million) owing to the sale of 65% of Autopista de Ausol.

The following is a description of the main changes in shareholders' funds in 2019, which gave rise to a reduction of EUR -226 million in equity attributed to shareholders.

Transition to IFRS 16. As indicated in Note 1.2.1.a), negative impact in the parent company's reserves of EUR -25 million relates to the retroactive application of IFRS 16 carried out by HAH.

The consolidated profit for the year attributed to the Parent company totalled EUR 268 million.
The income and expenses recognised directly in equity relate to:

· Hedging instruments: Recognition of the changes in value of the effective portion of derivatives designated as hedges, as detailed in Note 5.5, the negative impact of which was EUR -35 million, of which EUR -23.2 million relates to fully consolidated companies and EUR -12.2 million to equity-accounted companies.
· Defined benefit plans: This item includes the impact on equity of actuarial gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes to the Group's defined benefit plan assumptions, which had a total impact for the parent company of -EUR 5 million net of taxes relating to the equity-accounted companies (HAH/AGS).
· Translation differences: The currencies in which Ferrovial has the greatest exposure in terms of its equity (mainly the Canadian dollar, US dollar and the pound sterling), as detailed in Note 5.4, have given rise to translation differences of EUR 105 million attributed to the parent company. These translation differences are presented net of the effect of the foreign currency hedging instruments arranged by the Group (see Note 5.5). The following table provides a breakdown by currency of movements in currency translation differences attributed to the parent company:

Shareholder remuneration
· Scrip dividend: For the third successive year, the Ferrovial S.A. Annual General Meeting held on 5 April 2019 approved a flexible shareholder remuneration scheme, whereby the shareholders can freely choose to receive newly issued Company shares by subscribing to a share capital increase with a charge to reserves, or an amount in cash through the transfer to the Company (if they have not already done so in the market) of the bonus issue rights relating to the shares held by them. As a result of this resolution, in 2019 two share capital increases were performed with the following characteristics:
· In May 2019, 5,936,542 new shares were issued with a charge to reserves at a par value of EUR 0.20 per share, representing a share capital increase of EUR 1.2 million, and EUR 102 million of bonus shares were purchased, representing a payment per share of EUR 0.311.
· In November 2019, 6,531,283 new shares were issued with a charge to reserves at a par value of EUR 0.20 per share, representing a share capital increase of EUR 1.3 million, and EUR 136 million of bonus shares were purchased, representing a payment per share of EUR 0.408.
· EUR -238 million are included in this connection in the foregoing table.
· Buy-back Programme: The Annual General Meeting of Ferrovial, S.A. held on 5 April 2019 approved a treasury share Buy-Back Programme for a maximum amount of EUR 275 million, the objective of which was a subsequent share capital reduction through the retirement thereof. This transaction is described in Note 5.1.2 c) below.
· As can be observed in the preceding table, the cash flow impact of the shareholder remuneration in 2019 amounted to EUR 520 million (see Note 5.3), of which EUR 238 million related to the scrip dividend and EUR 282 million due to the acquisition of treasury shares.
Other transactions:
· Share capital increases by non-controlling interests: There was an increase of EUR 66 million in the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests, primarily relating to the I-77 Mobility Partners LLC and North Tarrant Express Segment 3 toll roads for EUR 49 million and EUR 2 million, respectively and at Sugar Creek Construction LLC for EUR 15 million.
· Share-based remuneration schemes: in 2019 a total of 372,943 treasury shares were acquired, representing 0.25% of the share capital of Ferrovial, which were subsequently delivered, together with the treasury shares existing at the beginning of the year, to beneficiaries under share-based remuneration schemes. The total cost of acquisition of these shares was EUR 1.2 million and the total result recognised for these remuneration schemes in the Company's equity amounts to EUR 3 million.
It should be noted, as discussed in Note 5.5, that the Company has arranged Equity Swaps in order to hedge against the possible impact on equity resulting from the exercise of the share-based remuneration schemes. These instruments gave rise to cash inflows of EUR 16 million and the changes in the fair value thereof had an impact on the net financial income/(expense) of EUR +25 million.

· Hybrid subordinated bond: the movement reflects the costs associated with this equity instrument described in the following Note 5.1.2 d), equating to a negative impact of EUR -8 million in 2019.
5.1.2 Equity components
The following is an explanation of each of the equity line items presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity:

a) Share capital
As of 31 December 2019 the share capital amounted to EUR 147,043,088.60, all fully subscribed and paid up. The share capital is represented by 735,215,443 ordinary shares of a single class and with a par value of twenty euro cents (EUR 0.20) per share. The changes in 2019 detailed in the table below relate to the share capital increase and reduction transactions described in the preceding paragraph.

At 31 December 2019, the only company with an ownership interest of over 10% is Rijn Capital BV, with 20.196% of the shares. This company is controlled by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors Rafael del Pino y Calvo Sotelo. The shares of the Parent Company are traded on the Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System (SIBE) and on the Spanish Stock Exchanges and all carry the same voting and dividend rights.

b) Share premium and merger premium
At 31 December 2019, the share premium and merger premium, which arose as a result of the merger of Grupo Ferrovial, S.A. with Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A. (currently Ferrovial, S.A.) in 2009, totalled EUR 995 million. Both line items are classed as unrestricted reserves.

c) Treasury shares
At 31 December 2018, 7,411,668 treasury shares were held. The following changes took place in 2019:

The Annual General Meeting of Ferrovial, S.A. held on 5 April 2019 approved a treasury share Buy-Back Programme for a maximum amount of EUR 275 million, the objective of which was a subsequent share capital reduction through the retirement thereof. Over the course of 2019 11,548,591 shares were acquired at an average price of EUR 24.43 per share, giving rise to a payment totalling EUR 282 million. Subsequently, it was resolved to reduce share capital by 15,708,219 shares, giving rise to a share capital reduction of EUR 3 million and an impact of EUR -279 million, which was recognised against unrestricted reserves (merger premium) and related to the difference between the acquisition price and the par value of the retired shares.

185
The market value of the treasury shares held by Ferrovial at 31 December 2019 (3,276,261 shares) was EUR 88 million.
d) Other equity instruments
Through its subsidiary Ferrovial Netherlands BV, with a guarantee from Ferrovial, S.A., the Group made a perpetual subordinated bonds issue in 2017 in the nominal amount of EUR 500 million and with an annual coupon of 2.124% until the first recalculation date (May 2023). Following the first recalculation date, the coupon will be changed to a rate equivalent to adding 2.127% to the 5-year swap rate that applies at that time. The same calculation will be made again every 5 years until 2043 from when, the 5-year swap rate that applies at that time will be increased by 2.877%.
These bonds may be repaid for the first time, at the issuer's discretion, in five and a half years (2023) from the date of issue (from 14 February 2023 to 14 May 2023 inclusive), and subsequently on each coupon payment date. Ferrovial also has the right to defer the payment of coupons over time, and such payment cannot be demanded by the holders.
As mentioned in Note 1.2.3.3, when it is the issuer that has the right to decide regarding both the repayment of principal and the possibility of deferring the payment of coupons on the bond, the instrument is entered under equity.
Thus, these subordinated perpetual bonds are recognised under "Other Equity Instruments". The costs associated with the issue of these bonds and the accrued interest and payment of the coupon, which at the end of 2019 amounted to an accumulated figure of EUR -19 million (EUR -8 million accrued in this financial year), are recognised under "Reserves" and treated in a similar way to dividends.
Irrespective of this type of instrument being classified as shareholders' funds from an accounting standpoint, the method followed by the rating agencies for the purpose of analysing the Group's debt level is to consider the hybrid bond issue fully or partially as debt and/or partially as equity, according to the current methodologies applied by each of these rating agencies.
e) Valuation adjustments
"Valuation adjustments" in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the balance of which at 31 December 2019 was EUR -1,195 million, includes the accumulated amount in reserves of the valuation adjustments made to translation differences (EUR -466 million), pension plans (EUR -447 million) and valuation adjustments made to derivatives (EUR -282 million).
As regards the requirements of IAS 1 in relation to the disclosure of "income and expenses recognised directly in equity", it is important to note that the only items that under the related accounting legislation may not be transferred in a future period to profit or loss are the items relating to pension plans.
f) Retained earnings and other reserves
This line item includes prior years' retained earnings and other reserves totalling EUR 3,928 million (2018: EUR 3,993 million). The other reserves include restricted reserves of the Parent, relating mainly to the legal reserve of EUR 30 million.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

186
Adjustments relating to share-based remuneration schemes and the impact of the subordinated perpetual bond's coupons and associated costs are also recognised under this heading.
g) Proposed distribution of profit for 2019
The Company has obtained a profit for the year amounting EUR 672,387,541.14, of which EUR 444,000,000 euros arises from dividend distributed by Ferrovial International SE, and the rest (228,387,541.14 euros) has been originated in Spain.
The Board of Directors will propose to the shareholders at the Company's duly convened Annual General Meeting that the profit of FERROVIAL, S.A. (individual company) be distributed as follows:

The item "other impacts" primarily includes the effect of EUR -5 million from the exit of non-controlling interests from Autopista del Sol caused by its sale to the French infrastructure fund Meridiam, as explained in Note 1.1.4.
5.2. NET CONSOLIDATED DEBT
In order to present an analysis of the Group's net debt position, the following table contains a breakdown of the Net Cash Position, distinguishing between infrastructure project companies and the other companies. The net cash position is understood to be the balance of the items included under "cash and cash equivalents", together with the long-term restricted cash of infrastructure projects, less financial borrowings (short-term and long-term bank borrowings and bonds).
The Net Cash Position also includes Forwards totalling EUR -24 million that hedge the cash held by the Group in US and Canadian dollars, as well as Cross-Currency Swaps, with a value of EUR 11 million, associated with the borrowings and cash denominated in US dollars. The derivatives are accounted for in this way because they are associated in full with the aforementioned borrowings/cash and the related exchange rate effect is netted off therefrom.

5.2.1. Infrastructure projects
a) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
Infrastructure project financing agreements occasionally impose the obligation to arrange certain restricted accounts to cover short-term or long-term obligations relating to the payment of the principal or interest on the borrowings and to infrastructure maintenance and operation.
Restricted cash is classified as short-term or long-term depending on whether it must remain restricted for less than or more than one year. In any event, these funds are invested in highly-liquid financial products earning floating interest. The type of financial product in which the funds may be invested is also restricted by the financing agreements or, where no restrictions are stipulated, the decision is made on the basis of the Group's policy for the placement of cash surpluses.
Short-term balances, which amount to EUR 6 million (31 December 2018: EUR 9 million), are recognised under "Cash and Cash Equivalents" in the balance sheet, whereas long-term balances, of EUR 963 million (31 December 2018: EUR 472 million), are classified as financial assets. Therefore, the restricted cash at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 969 million, relating entirely to the NTE Segment 3, LBJ, I-77 and NTE toll roads, along with other European toll roads, amounting to EUR 685 million, EUR 253 million, EUR 22 million, EUR 3 million and EUR 6 million respectively (December 2018: EUR 481 million), including both long- and shortterm amounts. Accordingly, there was a net change of EUR 487 million, due to:
· A net increase in the restricted cash amount of EUR 521 million (excluding exchange rate effects), primarily from the NTE Segment 3 (EUR 618 million), following the financial close of the Segment 3C, LBJ and I-77 (EUR 79 million and EUR 22 million respectively), the result of business operations, as well as NTE (EUR -195 million), primarily due to the dividend payment in December 2019.
· The exchange rate effect, which had an impact of EUR 7 million, caused mainly by changes in the value of the US dollar (see Note 1.3).
· The impact due to the change in the consolidation scope following the sale of 65% of the Autopista del Sol (see Note 1.1.4) amounting to EUR -41 million.
Other cash and cash equivalents relate to bank accounts and highlyliquid investments subject to interest rate risk.
b) Infrastructure project borrowings
b.1) Breakdown by project, significant changes in the year and main characteristics of the borrowings
The following is a breakdown of borrowings by project, distinguishing between bonds and bank borrowings, short- and long-term, and changes during the year.

Infrastructure project borrowings increased by EUR 109 million with respect to December 2018, a change that was mainly due to the following reasons:

· Exchange rate effect amounting to EUR +72 million, mainly due to the depreciation of the US dollar.
· Increase in borrowings already arranged at the end of 2018 and capitalisation and accrual of interest for a net amount of EUR 542 million, of which:
· There was an increase of EUR 752 million primarily due to US toll roads, with the most noteworthy changes being:
- NTE Mobility Partners Seg 3 LLC (EUR 687 million), mainly due to debt issues following the financial close of the Segment 3C, as well as interest capitalised and accrued unpaid interest in the amount of EUR 16 million.

- LBJ (EUR 42 million), mainly due to interest capitalisation and accrued interest payable.
- NTE Mobility Partners (EUR 18 million), due to the new debt structure following the refinancing carried out in 2019 (EUR 20 million), as well as interest capitalised in the amount of EUR 16 million. Conversely, accrued unpaid interest and debt refinancing costs amounted to EUR 18 million (net).
- I-77 (EUR 5 million), mainly due to interest capitalisation
· In contrast, there was a repayment of the borrowings at the Denver project amounting to EUR -191 million.
· The impact due to changes in the consolidation scope following the sale of Autopista del Sol (see Note 1.1.4) amounting to EUR 505 million.
US toll roads:
NTE Mobility Partners, LLC
During 2019, the refinancing of the project debt was completed, consisting of the repayment of USD 1,248 million (USD 400 million in Private Activity Bonds and USD 848 million of the TIFIA loan) and a new bond issue of USD 1,203 million (total of USD 1,271 million with a premium), of which USD 871 million relates to Taxable Bonds and USD 400 million to PABs (Private Activity Bonds).
This refinancing agreement has led to a lower cost of debt (yield to maturity of 3.8% vs. previous average coupon of 5.3%) and a longer maturity term (30 years tranche subject to tax vs. the previous 15 year TIFIA loan).
NTE Mobility Partners Seg 3 LLC
In terms of segment 3A-3B, the borrowings for this project were structured through the issue of USD 274 million of Private Activity Bonds (PABs), maturing at 25 and 30 years (7.00% fixed interest on USD 128 million and 6.75% fixed interest on USD 146 million), and a TIFIA loan of USD 531 million at a fixed rate of 3.84%, with final maturity in 2054 and fully drawn down at 31 December 2019. In addition, USD 64 million of capitalised interest has been capitalised, therefore the carrying amount at 31 December 2019 amounts to USD 595 million.
As regards Segment 3C, following the financial close during 2019, USD 654 million (total of USD 750 million with premium) in Private Activity Bonds (PABs) were issued, to be paid from 2047 to 2058, at a fixed interest rate of 5.00%.
LBJ Infr. Group LLC
This concession operator is financed through a USD 615 million issue of PABs with final maturity in 2040 (7.00% fixed interest on USD 473.5 million, of which USD 419 million have final maturity in 2040 and USD 54.5 million in 2034; and 7.50% fixed interest on USD 142 million, of which USD 91 million have final maturity in 2032 and USD 51 million in 2033). LBJ also has a TIFIA loan of USD 850 million granted by the US Federal Government with a repayment profile from 2036 to 2050, against which USD 1,124.5 million had been drawn down at 31 December 2018 (USD 850 million of principal and USD 274.5 million of capitalised interest). This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.22%.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

The differences between the total maturities of bank borrowings (EUR 5,431 million) and the carrying amounts thereof at 31 December 2019 (EUR 5,494 million) are explained mainly by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the borrowings, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation. Thus, the accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method represent an impact of EUR 62 million, taking into account that the maturities of the borrowings do not include interest.

The fair value reflected in the table above is calculated as follows:

· For fixed-rate bonds, subject to changes in value due to fluctuations in market interest rates: since they are quoted in an active market, the related market value is used.
· For fixed-interest bank borrowings, also subject to changes in value due to fluctuations in rates: future cash flows are discounted using a market interest rate, calculated using an internal valuation model.
Lastly, for floating-rate bank borrowings: no significant differences are deemed to exist between the fair value of the borrowings and their carrying amount and, therefore, the carrying amount is used.

The differences between the total bank borrowings drawn down and the carrying amount of the related debt at 31 December 2019 are explained mainly by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the debts, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation (primarily accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method, as detailed in point b.2).
Of the EUR 45 million drawable (31 December 2018: EUR 25 million), EUR 25 million relates to amounts not drawn down against Spanish toll roads, and EUR 20 million to amounts not drawn down against US toll roads. It should be noted that this drawable amount is associated exclusively with the projects, based on the nature and performance thereof, as discussed below.
b.4) Guarantees and covenants for project borrowings
The borrowings classified as project borrowings are without recourse to the shareholders of the projects or with recourse limited to the guarantees provided. The guarantees provided by subsidiaries of Ferrovial in relation with the borrowings of these projects are described in Note 6.5, Contingent liabilities.
At 31 December 2019, all the Project companies were achieving the significant covenants in force.

a.1.1) Corporate Debt

The corporate debt comprises the following debt instruments:

Corporate Bonds:
The debt consists of four corporate bonds the carrying amount of which totals EUR 1,807 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 1,807 million). These are broken down in the following table:

ISSUE DATE 07/06/2013 15/07/2014 14/09/2016 29/03/2017

ANNUAL COUPON
3.375% 2.500% 0.375% 1.375%

The bonds issued in 2013 are traded on the secondary market of the London Stock Exchange, while those issued in 2014, 2016 and 2017 are admitted to trading on the Spanish AIAF Fixed-Income market.

191
All these issues are guaranteed by Ferrovial S.A., the Parent Company of the Group. It should be noted that the Group has interest rate derivatives associated with the corporate bonds issued, with a notional amount of EUR 250 million; these derivatives convert the fixed interest rate into a floating one, see Note 5.5.

Euro Commercial Paper:

In the first quarter of 2018, the company formally completed a Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) programme for a maximum amount of EUR 1,000 million, with maturities between 1 and 364 days from the issue date, allowing for greater capital markets finance sourcing diversification and more efficiency when managing available liquidity. Towards the end of 2019 this limit was increased up to EUR 1,500 million, EUR 973 million recognized at December 2019 balance sheet.

Liquidity facility:

In July 2018, Ferrovial refinanced the liquidity facility, incorporating sustainability criteria. Of the current maximum limit on the facility (EUR 900 million and potential to draw down the balance in EUR, USD, CAD and GBP), USD 279 million is to be utilised and renewed monthly to September 2019 and USD 286 million from September 2019 to May 2020.

The foreign currency and interest rate risks on these drawdowns were hedged using the cross currency swaps (Note 5.5) at an interest rate of -0.439% until September 2019 and -0.01% from September 2019 to May 2020, always guaranteeing a notional amount of EUR 250 million, thus giving rise to income for the Group.

The variation in corporate debt with respect to December 2018 (EUR 284 million) is due basically to the increase in ECPs issued (EUR 273 million), at an average rate of -0.29%.

Information on the credit limits and credit drawable of the corporate debt.

The differences between the total maturities of financial borrowings and the carrying amounts of the debt at 31 December 2019 are primarily explained by the difference between the nominal values and carrying amounts of the borrowings, as certain adjustments are made in accordance with applicable accounting legislation (basically accrued interest payable and the application of the amortised cost method).
The fair value of bank borrowings excluding infrastructure project companies coincides with the related carrying amount because the borrowings are tied to floating market interest rates and, therefore, changes in the benchmark interest rates do not affect their fair value.
As regards corporate bonds: since they are quoted in an active market, the related market value is used.
In line with the aforementioned criteria, the estimated total fair value of bank borrowings and bonds excluding infrastructure project companies at 31 December 2019 is estimated at EUR 3,181 million.
The 2020 maturities amount to EUR 979 million and primarily relate to the maturity of the ECPs. The borrowing maturities do not include interest.
b) Cash and cash equivalents of other companies
In general the method used to classify the cash and cash equivalents at short- and long-term coincides with that used in the preparation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2018.
Also, at 31 December 2019 there were certain restricted accounts totalling EUR 87 million (31 December 2018: EUR 78 million) primarily relating to Construction, for operating motives in construction projects in the US, as well as the Budimex real estate works in progress.

5.3. CASH FLOW
The consolidated cash flow statement has been prepared in accordance with IAS 7. This note provides an additional breakdown, based on internal criteria established by the Company for business purposes, which in certain cases differ from the provisions of IAS 7. The main criteria applied are as follows:
· In order to provide a clearer explanation of the cash generated, the Group separates cash flows into "Cash flows excluding infrastructure projects", where infrastructure project concession operators are treated as financial assets and the investments in the capital of these companies are therefore included in cash flows from investing activities and the yields from the investments (dividends and capital reimbursements) are included in operations cash flow, and "cash flows from infrastructure projects", consisting of cash flows from the operating and financing activities of infrastructure project concession operators.
· The treatment given to interest received on cash and cash equivalents differs from that in the cash flow statement prepared in accordance with IAS 7, since this interest is included in financing cash flows, as a reduction of the amount of interest paid, under "Interest Cash Flow".
· This cash flow endeavours to present the changes in the net cash position as the net amount of financial borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. This method also departs from that established in IAS 7, which explains the changes in cash and cash equivalents.
· With regard to the treatment of leases, as the nature of the payment is also tied to business operations, the related cash flow is included in changes in working capital in cash flows from operating activities, which differs from the treatment afforded in

the cash flow statement, where it is included in cash flows from financing activities (EUR -135 million at December 2019), considering that EUR -46 million relate to continuing activities (See Note 3.7.) and EUR -89 million relate to discontinuing activities.
· It should finally be noted that dividends received derive mainly from infrastructure projects and equity-consolidated companies. This includes both dividends and other similar items, mainly interest on subordinated borrowings and participating loans, and repayments of capital, debt and loans.

193
· As outlined in Note 1.1.3, the cash flow reported in this note includes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities discontinued and held for sale, as adjusted to reflect net borrowings of discontinued operations such that the net cash position in the cash flow statement matches the balance sheet figure.
The change in Cash flow is also discussed in the management report that was formally prepared together with these Consolidated financial statements.

Changes in working capital:
The changes in working capital disclosed in the foregoing table (EUR 206 million) are the measure used to explain the difference between the Group's EBITDA (Gross Operating Profit/(loss)) and its cash flows from operating activities before tax, and they arise from the difference between the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for accounting purposes and the date on which the aforementioned revenue and expenses are converted into cash, due

mainly to changes in the balances of trade receivables and payables to suppliers or other items in the balance sheet. Thus a reduction in the balance of trade receivables will give rise to an improvement in working capital and a reduction of the balance of payables to suppliers will give rise to a worsening of working capital.
The changes in this line item do not coincide with the changes in working capital reported in Section 4 of the consolidated annual accounts as detailed in the following table:

Change in working capital (Note 4)
Change in working capital for discontinued operations and assets held for sale (see Note 1.3)
Change in working capital including discontinued operations

The differences detailed in the table relate to the following items:
· Changes in working capital with an impact on other lines in the cash flow statement (mainly investment cash flow). The working capital accounts reported in Note 4, in particular the payables to suppliers, can relate to transactions that do not affect operating cash flow, such as fixed asset purchases.
· Changes in provisions with an impact on EBITDA or on working capital for EUR 166 million, which relates to:
· Construction provisions variations (EUR 330 million) as a result of the net provision EUR 356 million (see Note 6.3), and other similar effects, as asset provisions, totalling amount to EUR -26 million.
· Changes in discontinued operations provisions (EUR -164 million), mainly by the provision used related to the settlement

agreed with the City Council for the termination of the PFI contract in Birmingham.
· Changes in other balance sheet items with an impact on operating cash flow. The changes in working capital reported in Note 4 reflect only movements in items included under "short-term trade and other receivables", "short-term trade and other payables" and "inventories". In certain cases, operating income and expenses relate not only to items shown in working capital (shortterm items) but also to certain items recognised as long-term assets and liabilities, such as long-term trade receivables and long-term trade payables, or even to items in equity accounts such as operations relating to share-based remuneration schemes.

5.4. MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL
The Group's business is affected by changes to the financial variables that have an impact on the Group's accounts, these being mainly interest rate risk, exchange rates, inflation, credit, liquidity and variable income. The policies adopted by the Group in managing these risks are explained in detail in the Management Report.
Following are specific data on the Group's exposure to each of these risks and an analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the various variables, together with a brief description of the way in which each risk is managed.
In addition, in view of the importance of the UK's decision to leave the European Union both economically and politically (Brexit), this Note includes a separate in-depth analysis of the impact it has had for Ferrovial with respect to the various financial risks and how these risks are being managed.
a. Exposure to interest rate variations
Ferrovial's businesses are subject to changes in the economic cycles and interest rate risk management takes this into consideration, modelling interest rate settings against financial instrument liquidity management. When interest rates are low, the Group seeks to fix future levels at non-infrastructure project level, although such hedging can affect liquidity in the event of cancellation. At infrastructure project level, the banks and rating agencies require a higher percentage of fixed-rate debt. These strategies are

implemented by issuing fixed-rate debt or by arranging hedging financial derivatives, a breakdown of which is provided in Note 5.5, Derivative financial instruments at fair value. The aim of these hedges is to optimise the financial expenses borne by the Group.

The accompanying table shows a breakdown of the Group's borrowings, indicating the percentage of debt that is considered to be hedged (either by a fixed rate or by derivatives).

Based on the foregoing, at the fully consolidated companies, a linear increase of 100 basis points in the market yield curves at 31 December 2019 would increase the finance costs in the income statement by an estimated EUR 4 million, of which EUR 1 million relate to infrastructure projects and EUR 3 million to noninfrastructure project companies, with a net impact on the profit of Ferrovial of EUR -3 million.
It is also necessary to take into account changes in the fair value of the financial derivatives arranged, which are indicated in Note 5.5.
As regards these interest rate hedging instruments, a linear increase of 100 basis points in the market yield curves at 31 December 2019 would, in the case of the effective hedges, have a positive impact of approximately EUR 101 million on the shareholders' funds attributable to the parent from fully consolidated companies, while a decrease of 100 basis points would produce a negative impact of approximately EUR 107 million.

As a counterpart to this impact, it must be considered that a drop in interest rates would lead to an increase in the value of the projects, as this implies a lower discount rate in their valuation.
b. Exposure to foreign currency risk
Ferrovial regularly monitors its expected net exposure with regard to each currency over the coming years, both for dividends receivable and as regards investments in new projects, or potential divestments.

Ferrovial establishes its hedging strategy by analysing past changes in both short- and long-term exchanges rates, establishing monitoring mechanisms such as future projections and long-term equilibrium exchange rates. These hedges are established by using foreign currency deposits or arranging derivatives (see Note 5.5 for more details).

The following tables show, by type of currency, the value of assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and shareholders' funds attributed to the parent company at December 2019, adjusted by the aforementioned currency forwards relating to each currency:

Note 1.3 contains a breakdown of the changes in the year in the closing exchange rates. As a result of these changes, the impact of translation differences on equity at 31 December 2019 was EUR 105

million for the Parent company. The breakdown by currency is detailed in Note 5.1.1.

Analyzing sensitivity to an impact on the exchange rate, Ferrovial estimates that a depreciation of 10% of the main currencies that the Group holds investments in against the euro at year end, would cause a change in the shareholders equity of 307 million euros, of which 52% would correspond to the Canadian dollar, 23% to the sterling pound and 15% to the US dollar. Also, the detail of net profit/(loss) attributed to the shareholders by currency for 2019 and 2018 is detailed in the following table.

Note 1.3 contains a detail of the changes in the year in the average exchange rates. In this regard, the impact of a 10% appreciation of the euro against other currencies on the income statement would have amounted to a change of EUR -38 million.

c. Exposure to credit and counterparty risk
The Group's main financial assets exposed to credit or counterparty risk are as follows:

VAR. 19/18 433 500 17 167

(1) Included in cash and cash equivalents
· Ferrovial actively monitors the risk that it assumes with its Banks: Ferrovial constantly analyses the performance of risk via internal credit quality studies for each of the financial institutions at which it is exposed. Its internal regulations for managing surpluses sets maximum investment limits for each counterparty, based on objective criteria: a minimum acceptable risk is required in order for surplus cash to be invested, and limits are also set on the amounts invested, depending on the risk given to each of these counterparties. In addition, the Risk Department monitors the performance of each of the different counterparties, proposing the appropriate protective or corrective measures on the basis of specific events.
· Territories: Ferrovial monitors the performance of the markets (territories) in which it has a presence, along with that of its target markets. The Financial Risk Department proposes the potential action to be taken in the event that some change in risk levels is expected in a particular territory or market.
· Customers: Ferrovial analyses and monitors its customers' credit risk, using an internal methodology for the rating of Ferrovial customers that is standardised for the whole Group.
d. Exposure to liquidity risk

The Group has established the mechanisms necessary to preserve the level of liquidity that reflect the cash generation and need projections, in relation to both short-term collections and payments and obligations to be met at long term.

Ex-infrastructure project companies
At 31 December 2019, cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 4,617 million (2018: EUR 3,766 million). Also, at that date undrawn credit lines totalled EUR 796 million (2018: EUR 743 million).
Infrastructure project companies
At 31 December 2019, cash and cash equivalents (including shortterm restricted cash) amounted to EUR 119 million (2018: EUR 239 million). Also, at that date undrawn credit lines amounted to EUR 45 million (2018: EUR 25 million), which were primarily arranged to cover committed investment needs.
e. Exposure to variable income risk
Ferrovial is also exposed to the risk relating to the fluctuation of its share price. This exposure arises specifically in equity swaps used to hedge against risks of appreciation of share-based remuneration schemes, the detail of which is shown in Note 5.5 to these consolidated financial statements.
Since these equity swaps are not classified as hedging derivatives, their market value has an impact on profit or loss. Accordingly, a EUR 1 increase/decrease in the Ferrovial share price would have a positive/negative impact of EUR 2 million on the net profit of Ferrovial.
f. Exposure to inflation risk
Most of the revenue from infrastructure projects is associated with prices tied directly to inflation. This is the case of the prices of both the toll road concession contracts and those of HAH, which are equityaccounted. Therefore, an increase in inflation would increase the cash flow derived from assets of this nature. Fixed benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom also include obligations that are linked to inflation. These are covered individually, since they are not consolidated within Ferrovial.
Unlike the other company assets, from the accounting standpoint the derivatives arranged at HAH, the objective of which is to convert fixed-rate borrowings into index linked debt, are measured at fair value through profit and loss, since up until now they are considered to be ineffective derivatives. HAH is assessing their classification as an accounting hedge under the new accounting standards (IFRS 9). The accounting impact to date means that an increase of 100 b.p. throughout the inflation curve would have an effect on the net profit attributable to Ferrovial (in proportion to its percentage of ownership) of EUR -241 million.
Also, in the case of the toll road concession operator Autema, there is a derivative tied to inflation that is deemed to qualify for hedge accounting, in which an increase of 100 b.p. throughout the inflation curve would have a negative effect on reserves of EUR -104 million.
g. Capital management
The Group aims to achieve a debt-equity ratio that makes it possible to optimise costs while safeguarding its capacity to continue managing its recurring activities and the capacity to continue to grow through new projects in order to create shareholder value.
With regard to financial borrowings, Ferrovial Group's objective is to maintain a low level of indebtedness, excluding infrastructure project borrowings, in a way that will allow it to retain its investment grade credit rating. In order to achieve this target it has established a clear and adequate financial policy in which a relevant metric refers to a maximum ratio, for non-infrastructure project companies, of net debt (gross debt less cash) to gross operating profit/(loss), plus dividends from projects of no more than 2:1.
At 31 December 2019, the net cash position is positive (assets exceeded liabilities) and, therefore, the difference with respect to the maximum debt-equity ratio established is very significant. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, "net debt excluding infrastructure

197
project companies" is defined in Note 5.2 and "gross operating profit/(loss) from operations plus dividends" is the profit from operations before impairment losses, disposals and depreciation and amortisation of the Group Companies other than infrastructure concession operators, plus the dividends received from infrastructure project companies.

h. Impact of Brexit on financial risks
This section includes an analysis of the impact that Brexit is having for Ferrovial with respect to the financial risks and how these risks are being managed. The risk section of the Management Report contains a comprehensive analysis of Brexit and how it may affect the Group's various business areas.

Ferrovial's UK exposure on the basis of the various financial and business variables is detailed in the following table:

Exchange rate
During 2019, and once much of the uncertainty around the future of Brexit has been removed following the general elections in the United Kingdom and the subsequent passing of the Brexit law, the pound has strengthened against the euro. At 31 December 2019, the pound sterling had increased in value by 6% year-on-year. As a hedge against foreign currency risk against a negative outcome regarding the effect of Brexit, Ferrovial arranged hedges with a notional amount of GBP 416 million, which covers a figure similar to the dividends it expects to receive on its UK airport assets over the next 4 years.
Inflation and interest rates

Analysing performance between 2018-2019, the market has reduced its inflation forecast in relation to the future Retail Price Index (RPI) by an average of 0.25%, with figures standing at around 3.25% and a present rate that is also lower (for periods greater than 2 years), due to the more marked decline in nominal interest rates.

An adverse scenario in EU trade agreement negotiations in 2020 could result in a sharp rise in inflation, negatively affecting the value of the obligations in the defined benefit pension plans, as well as a significant increase in the nominal interest rate, leading to an increase in financing costs.

With regard to this adverse scenario, the Group has put in place natural hedges for the business (for example an increase in profit due to inflation) and financial hedges (for example an increase in financial products linked to inflation and nominal rates under pension plans).

One must also take into consideration that an increase in inflation has a positive impact on Heathrow, increasing the regulatory asset base (RAB), which is indexed to inflation and could have a positive impact on commercial revenues.

Toll road derivatives
Interest rate swaps, toll roads
In order to hedge the interest rate risk in toll road infrastructure projects, the borrowings of which bear interest at a variable rate (primarily Autema and Euroscut Azores), the concession holders have arranged interest rate hedges on the projects' debt, establishing a fixed or increasing interest rate for a total notional amount of EUR 872 million at 31 December 2019. Overall, the fair value of these hedges increased from EUR -334 million at 31 December 2018 to EUR -370 million at 31 December 2019.

In general, since these derivatives are considered to be effective, the changes in their fair value are recognised in reserves, with an impact of EUR -36 million (EUR -27 million attributable to the Parent, after tax and non-controlling interests).
The changes in settlements and accruals gave rise to an impact on the financial result of EUR -46 million and of EUR 46 million in cash.

Index linked swaps, toll roads
This item relates exclusively to Autema, which in 2008 arranged an index linked swap to hedge income variability, by means of which an annual CPI of 2.50% was fixed.
This hedge, which was considered effective, had an impact of EUR 68 million on reserves (EUR 23 million after tax attributable to the Parent).
Cross currency swaps, toll roads
In 2019, the company 4352238 Canada Inc arranged cross-currency swaps to hedge a financial investment in US dollars (see Note 5.2.2). The notional amount of these instruments is CAD 594 million (EUR 408 million) and they expire in 2020, with a fair value of EUR 7 million.
Corporate Business Derivatives
Interest Rate Swaps, Corporate Business
In relation to the bond issues launched in 2013, the Group arranged interest rate derivatives for a notional amount of EUR 250 million expiring in 2021. Since they convert a portion of the fixed interest rate on the bonds into a floating interest rate, these derivatives constitute a partial fair value economic hedge of the aforementioned bond issues and they all qualify for hedge accounting. This means that the fair value changes in both the derivative and the hedged item (in this case, a part of the bond) are carried at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value impact of these bonds on the financial result amounted to EUR 1 million. It should be noted that the change in the fair value of the hedged bond amounts to EUR 2 million, while the effect on profit and loss of the fair value change in the IRS is EUR -3 million, so a net fair value loss of EUR -1 million (2018: EUR 1 million) is recognised.
In addition, on 4 July 2018, the group arranged interest rate derivatives (Interest Rate Swaps, IRS) for a total notional amount of EUR 500 million in order to secure the rate applicable to the potential refinancing of one of the bonds issued by the Company. At 31 December 2019, these derivatives have a fair value of EUR -41 million (31 December 2018: EUR -9 million) and are designated as cash flow hedges, value changes being recognised with a balancing entry in reserves.
Therefore, at year-end 2019 the fair value of these derivatives amounts to EUR -33 million.
Cross Currency Swaps, Corporate Business
In 2016, Ferrovial arranged cross-currency swaps to hedge a drawdown of borrowings in US dollars (see Note 5.2.2). The notional amount of these instruments is USD 287 million (EUR 250 million) and they expire in 2020, with a fair value of EUR 5 million.

199
Equity swaps
Ferrovial has arranged equity swaps in order to hedge against the possible impact on equity resulting from the exercise of the sharebased remuneration schemes granted to its employees.
The modus operandi of these equity swap contracts is as follows:
· The calculation base is a given number of Ferrovial shares and a reference price, which is normally the market price of the share on the grant date.
· For the duration of the contract, Ferrovial pays interest equivalent to a given interest rate (EURIBOR plus a spread, to be applied to the result of multiplying the number of shares by the exercise price) and receives remuneration equal to the dividends relating to those shares.
· When the swap expires, if the share price has increased, Ferrovial will receive the difference between the market price and the reference price. If the share price has fallen, Ferrovial will pay the difference to the bank.
At 2019 year-end, these derivatives had a notional amount equivalent to 2.7 million shares, which, based on the exercise price of the equity swaps (the price at which they must be settled with the banks), represented a total notional amount of EUR 65 million.
Exchange rate derivatives, Corporate
These derivatives relate to Corporate hedges of foreign currency risk, the main aim of which is to protect against the volatility of future cash flows in foreign currencies (basically the pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the US dollar, and the Canadian dollar). Their notional value amounted to EUR 1,131 million at 31 December 2019, of which EUR 411 million relate to pound sterling, EUR 581 million to the Australian dollar, EUR 132 million to the US dollar, EUR 7 million to the Canadian dollar. They expire in the short-term. The changes in their value are recognised as translation differences and amounted to EUR -40 million in 2019 (for effective derivatives). Options, which are not classified as accounting hedges, are recognised in net financial income/(expense) at fair value and in 2019 represented an expense of EUR 1 million.
Other derivatives
This item includes the other derivatives contracted by the Group for a fair value of EUR -39 million, of which EUR -10 million relates to foreign exchange derivatives in the Toll Roads business, largely hedging volatility in future Canadian dollar flows (see Note 1.3), and EUR -27 million relating basically to interest rate swaps, hedging certain project borrowings in the Construction business.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

Derivatives are recognised at market value at the arrangement date and at fair value at subsequent dates. Changes in the value of these derivatives are recognised for accounting purposes as follows:
· The changes in the year in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are recognised with a balancing entry in reserves (column I).
· The changes in fair value of the derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that are considered to be held for speculative purposes are recognised as a fair value adjustment in the Group income statement (column II) and are reflected separately in the income statement.
· "Impact on Financial Result" (column III) reflects the impacts on the financial result due to financing arising from the interest flows accrued during the year.
· "Impact on Cash" (column IV) indicates net payments and collections during the year.
· The impact of the difference between closing translation differences at December 2019 and 2018 is also presented separately (column V).
· The "Other Impacts" column shows the impacts on operating profit/(loss), financial result (exchange rate effect) or other effects not considered in the other columns (column VI).
C) DERIVATIVE VALUATION METHODS
All the Group's derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments carried at fair value are included in LEVEL 2 of the Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy, since although they are not quoted on regulated markets, the inputs on which their fair values are based are observable, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value measurements are performed by the Company using an internally developed measurement tool based on best market practices. However, they are in any event compared with the measurements received from the counterparty banks on a monthly basis.
Equity swaps are measured as the difference between the market price of the share on the calculation date and the unit settlement (strike) price agreed at inception, multiplied by the number of shares under the contract.

The other instruments are measured by quantifying the net future cash inflows and outflows, discounted to present value, with the following specific features:
· Interest rate swaps: the future cash flows with floating reference rates are estimated by using current market projections at the measurement date for each currency and settlement frequency; and each flow is updated using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the valuation date.
· Index-linked swaps: the future cash flows are estimated by projecting the future behaviour implicit in the market curves on the valuation date for each currency and settlement frequency, for both reference interest rates and reference inflation rates. As in the cases described above, the flows are discounted using the discount rates obtained at the measurement date for each flow settlement period and currency.
· Cross currency swaps: the future cash flows with floating reference rates are estimated by using current market projections at the measurement date for each currency and settlement frequency; and each flow is discounted using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the measurement date, including the cross currency basis spreads. The present value of the flows in a currency other than the measurement currency is translated at the spot exchange rate prevailing at the measurement date.
· Foreign currency derivatives: as a general rule, the future cash flows are estimated by using the exchange rates and market curves associated with each currency pair (forward points curve), and each flow is updated using the market zero-coupon rate that is appropriate for the settlement period and currency in question at the valuation date. For other more complex instruments (options, etc.), the valuation models appropriate for each instrument are employed, taking into consideration the necessary market data (volatilities, etc.).
· Lastly, credit risk, which pursuant to IFRS 13 was included in the valuation of derivatives, is estimated as follows:
· In order to calculate the adjustments associated with own and counterparty credit risk (CVAs/DVAs), Ferrovial applies a methodology based on calculating the future exposure of the various financial products using Monte Carlo simulations. To this potential exposure, a probability of default and a loss given

default based on the parties' business and credit quality are applied, as well as a discount factor based on the currency and applicable maturity at the valuation date.
· In order to calculate the probabilities of default of the Ferrovial Group Companies, the credit risk management department assesses the rating of the counterparty (company, project, etc.) using a proprietary, rating agency-based

201
methodology. This rating is used to obtain market spread curves according to the currency and term in question (generic curves by rating level).
In order to calculate the probabilities of default of the balancing entries, the CDS curves of those companies are used, if available. Otherwise, the CDS curves of a similar entity (proxy) or a generic spread curve (by rating level) are used.

SECTION 6: OTHER DISCLOSURES

This section includes other notes required under the applicable legislation.
Of particular note due to its importance is Note 6.5, Contingent liabilities and commitments, in which the main lawsuits that affect the Group Companies and guarantees provided are described, with particular emphasis on the guarantees provided by ex-infrastructure project companies on behalf of infrastructure project companies.

The changes in liabilities other than current liabilities and financial borrowings, such as the pension obligations (see Note 6.2) and provisions (see Note 6.3), are also analysed.

6.1. DEFERRED INCOME

The detail of Deferred income at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

The balance of "Deferred Income" totalled EUR 1,347 million at the end of 2019 (2018: EUR 1,241 million), primarily relating to the capital grants received from the infrastructure concession grantors. EUR 1,345 million of this amount relates to the Toll Roads Division.

These grants are mainly located in the following toll road projects: EUR 418 million for LBJ Infrastructure Group, EUR 508 million for NTE Mobility Partners, EUR 210 million for NTE Mobility Partners Segments 3 LLC and, lastly, EUR 207 million for I-77 Mobility Partners.

The main change during the financial year occurred at NTE Mobility Partners Segments 3 and I-77 Mobility Partners and Cintra subsidiaries in the USA, which received additional grants over the course of the year in the amount of EUR 65 million and EUR 27 million respectively.

The US companies have also seen their value rise by EUR 24 million due to the dollar's appreciation against the euro.

These capital grants are released to the income statement for the year at the same rate as the depreciation charged on the assets they finance, net of depreciation. The impact of these grants on cash flows is presented as a reduction of cash flows from investing activities.
6.2. PENSION PLAN DEFICIT
This line item reflects the deficit relating to pension and other employee retirement benefit plans. At 31 December 2019, the provision recognised in the consolidated balance sheet amounted to EUR 4 million and solely related to Budimex (31 December 2018: EUR 3 million).
6.3. PROVISIONS
The provisions recognised by the consolidated Group are intended to cover the risks arising from its various operating activities. They are recognised using the best estimates of the existing risks and uncertainties and their possible evolution.
This note provides a breakdown of all the line items composing provisions on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to these line items, there are other impairment losses and allowances that are presented as a reduction of certain asset line items and which are disclosed in the notes relating to those specific assets.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

The table above shows the changes in the year by detailing, on the one hand, the changes in the consolidation scope and transfers, the charges for the year and reversals that had an impact on the various lines in the income statement and, on the other, other changes which did not have an impact thereon, such as amounts used recognised under various headings in the balance sheet and the exchange rate effect.
In this regard, on analysing the effect on the consolidated income statement, mention should be made of the net provision (charge) of EUR 397 million with an impact on gross operating profit (EUR 462 million charge and EUR -65 million reversal), totally in the Construction Division following the provision recognised in the first quarter of the year for possible future losses at various projects in the US. Provisions have also been applied during the year with balancing items in working capital accounts in the amount of EUR -41 million, mainly relating to the Construction Division. The sums of charge/reversal (EUR 397 million) and the provision used (EUR -41 million), considering other effects such as bad debt provision (which is not included in the detail above (EUR -26 million), are explained for the purpose of working capital in the cash flow statement totalling EUR 330 million (see Note 5.3).
Litigation provisions
At 31 December 2019, the total litigation provisions for the group amounted to EUR 378 million. This item includes the following:
· Provisions to cover the possible risks resulting from lawsuits and litigation in progress, amounting to EUR 112 million (December 2018: EUR 82 million), largely relate to the Construction Division. These provisions are recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in provisions within EBITDA.

· Provisions for tax claims, amounting to EUR 266 million (31 December 2018: EUR 241 million), arising in relation to local or central government duties, income taxes and other taxes, as a result of the varying interpretations that can be made of the tax legislation in the various countries in which the Group operates (See Note 6.5.1.d). These provisions are recognised and reversed with a charge/credit to gross operating profit/(loss), net financial income/(expense) and/or corporate income tax, depending on the nature of the tax for which the provision has been recognised (penalties, related interest, and/or tax deficiencies in assessments signed on a contested basis). The impact of the Services business is recognised in the net profit/(loss) of discontinued operations (see Note 1.1.3).
Provision for replacements pursuant to IFRIC 12
This line item includes the provisions for investments in replacements established by IFRIC 12 (see Note 1.2.3.2), the total amount of which amounted to EUR 49 million. This provision is recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to the depreciation and amortisation charge over the period in which the obligations accrue, until the replacement becomes operational. The impact of this amortisation amounts to EUR 17 million.
We would note the variation due to changes in the consolidation scope of EUR -33 million, largely due to the sale of the Autopista del Sol (see Note 1.1.4), amounting to EUR -25 million.
Provisions for other long-term risks
This line item includes the provisions recognised to cover certain long-term risks other than those attributable to litigation or tax claims, such as third-party liability resulting from the performance of contracts, guarantees provided with enforcement risk and other similar items, which amounted to EUR 81 million at 31 December

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

204
2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 47 million). The variation with respect to 2018 is due essentially to the reclassification of EUR 36 million from investments in associates in relation to the additional losses in certain Toll Road division companies in respect of which there are contractual obligations to contribute additional capital and/or guarantees when the value of the relevant shareholdings falls to zero (see Note 3.5).
Provision for landfills
"Provision for landfills" contains the estimated cost of landfill closure and post-closure activities relating to the landfills operated in the Services business in Poland. The provision is calculated based on a technical estimate of the consumption to date of the total capacity of the respective landfills. This provision is recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in provisions within gross operating profit/(loss), as the costs required for closure of the landfill are incurred. The total provision (EUR 10 million) comes from services activity in Poland, which has been classified to continued activity during 2019 fiscal year as part of construction business.
Provision for compulsory purchases
The provision for compulsory purchases recognised by the Spanish toll roads, the balance of which at December 2019 is zero (31 December 2018: EUR 25 million), following the changes to the consolidation scope due to the sale of 65% of Autopista del Sol. This provision is charged against the concession infrastructure as the costs are incurred over the concession term.
Short-term provisions
At 31 December 2019, the short-term provisions balance amounted to EUR 750 million (31 December 2018: EUR 431 million).
This entry primarily covers provisions relating to customer contracts, such as provisions for deferred costs (relating to the completion of works and the removal of site equipment, pursuant to the contract) and provisions for budgeted losses. In this regard, these types of provisions are mainly focused on the Construction Division for EUR 733 million (2018: EUR 414 million). Particularly noteworthy was the aforementioned provision recognised for potential future losses at various projects in the US.
These provisions are recognised and reversed with a charge/credit, respectively, to changes in provisions within EBITDA.
6.4. OTHER LONG-TERM PAYABLES
This line item includes:
· The participating loans granted by the State to various infrastructure project concession operators amount to EUR 9 million (31 December 2018: EUR 115 million) from the Construction Division. The decrease is due to the sale of the Autopista del Sol to the infrastructure fund Meridiam (see Note 1.1.4).
· Long-term loans with associates of the Toll Roads Division, amounted to EUR 11 million (31 December 2018: EUR 11 million).
· Long-term trade payables amounted to EUR 6 million (31 December 2018: EUR 7 million).
6.5. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, CONTINGENT ASSETS, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
6.5.1. Litigation
In carrying on its activities the Group is subject to possible contingent liabilities of varying kinds. These contingent liabilities lead to lawsuits or litigation in relation to which a provision is recognised based on the best estimate of the foreseeable disbursements required to settle the obligation. These provisions are set out in Note 6.3.

Therefore, it is not expected that any significant liabilities will arise, other than those for which provisions have already been recognised, that might represent a material adverse effect.
The detail of the most significant litigation, in terms of amount, in the Group's various business divisions is as follows:
a) Litigation relating to the toll road business
Autopista Terrassa Manresa (Autema):
Contentious-administrative action against Decrees 161/2015 and 337/2016 approved by the Government of Catalonia:
On 14 July 2015, the Government of Catalonia published Decree 161/2015, which radically amended the rules governing the concession for the project originally established in Decree 137/1999. This legislative change was carried out in December 2016 via Decree 337/2016 (both referred to collectively as the "Decrees").
The change introduced by the new legislation entailed moving from a regime under which the Government of Catalonia paid the concession operator the difference between the tolls collected and the operating surplus established in the Economic and Financial Plan, to a system whereby the remuneration earned by the concession operator will depend on the number of the infrastructure's users, with the Government of Catalonia subsidising a portion of the toll paid by the user, reducing Autema's revenues by between 50% and 43%.
In this regard, the Concession Operator considers that there are sound arguments to conclude that the Grantor has clearly exceeded the limits of its power to amend the public arrangements by issuing these decrees. Accordingly, the company filed an appeal against the aforementioned Decrees at the High Court of Catalonia (TSJC).
Over the course of 2017, the co-defendants (the Catalan Government and Bages Regional Council) filed their written submissions in reply to the complaint and, during 1H 2018, evidence was heard. Following the submission of written conclusions by Autema in July and by the co-defendants in September 2018, the conclusions phase of the trial was brought to an end.
On 18 March 2019, AUTEMA was notified of the Catalan High Court's judgement rejecting AUTEMA's contentious-administrative appeal against the decrees. The Company then filed a cassational appeal with the Supreme Court against this judgement, so it is not yet final. Its effects are suspended until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal. The first stage in the filing of the cassational appeal has been completed, as the Catalan High Court has agreed to submit the appeal to the Supreme Court. It is now up to the Supreme Court whether or not to give the appeal leave to proceed. We estimate that this decision could take six to nine months (starting from June 2019). If the appeal is granted leave to proceed, the Supreme Court will decide whether to admit it or not, which we estimate will take approximately two years from the start of preparations (i.e. from June 2019). The final procedural stage completed in 2019 was the Supreme Court's acceptance of the case from the Catalan High Court, with the appearance of the parties before the Supreme Court and the appointment of the Presiding Judge, so that the Court may decide whether or not to admit the appeal for process.
Following an analysis of the available information on the proceedings, as of 31 December 2019 the company believed that there was a strong basis for the case to be admitted in cassation and for the merits of the action to be subsequently upheld, and it has therefore continued to treat this asset as a financial asset. It is felt that the aforementioned judgement could be an indication of the additional impairment of the assets connected with this project, to the extent that although it is believed that the action will be won on its merits, recovery of the outstanding unpaid amounts will be delayed until the cassational appeal has been resolved and enforcement of the judgement is subsequently achieved, so an

impairment of EUR 58 million has therefore been entered in 2019 (Note 3.3.2).
M-203 Toll Road:
Legal action filed by the Concession operator seeking the termination of the concession agreement on the grounds of a breach by the Administration:
On 24 April 2014, the Concession operator instigated a proceeding at the Madrid High Court of Justice requesting the termination of the concession arrangement due to a breach by the grantor and the annulment of the penalties imposed on the Concession Operator due to the halting of the construction work.
Following the favourable judgement by the Madrid High Court, in an Order from the CAM's Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure and Housing dated 3 November 2017 (the "Order for Termination"), the Community of Madrid (CAM) terminated the concession agreement. In 2018, the CAM took over the works and refunded the bank bonds provided as a definitive guarantee (which amounted to EUR 6 million).
With regard to the Authority's subrogation to the expropriation proceedings and compensation both for the investment made (net investment value - NIV) and for the damage suffered, in April 2019 the Company filed a complaint with the CAM, citing the Authority's failure to act and demanding that it comply with its obligation to issue a ruling on the NIV.
As the CAM did not respond to the Company's demand within 3 months, the Company filed a contentious-administrative appeal on 15 July 2019 in which it cited the CAM's failure to act and included an interim injunction asking the court to order the CAM to issue its ruling expeditiously.
This interim injunction was rejected in October 2019, and the legal procedure seeking to have the CAM hand down its ruling on the NIV has continued its course. The Company filed a claim at the Madrid High Court on 17 December, and on 11 February 2020 notification was received of the CAM's response, giving the Company a period of time to submit its written conclusions.
In addition, on 27 January 2020, the Company was notified via administrative channels of the CAM's valuation report on the amount of the NIV, in which it puts this figure at EUR 56 million (excluding VAT) plus the interest that accrues until payment is effectively made. An allegations period was granted and the Company presented its allegations on 12/2/2020, referring to the previous arguments and statements of claim, requesting that a ruling be issued as soon as possible and reserving the right to take action as admissible to claim the difference between the amount claimed (EUR 60 million, which the Company has recognised in its balance sheet) and the amount recognised in the report. The Company has decided not to set aside any provision for the amount that has yet to be received, given that its legal advisers believe that we have strong arguments for claiming its recovery.
As regards the damages payable by the CAM due to the early termination of the concession agreement, the CAM must initiate a separate action from the one relating to the NIV. This action for damages has not been initiated by the Authorities, and therefore the Company, which has not recognised any amount relating to this item in its balance sheet, filed a claim on 7 August 2019 for damages and lost profit with the CAM, seeking the amount that it believes it is owed and submitting documentation in support of its case. As six months had elapsed without a reply from the Authorities to the claim filed on 7 August, the Company lodged a contentious-administrative appeal on 14 February 2020 against the rejection of the claim due to administrative silence.
As a result of the termination of the concession arrangement, at 31 December 2019 the company reclassified the carrying amount of the

205
asset (EUR 76 million) as an account receivable from the grantor (see Note 3.6) and includes the EUR 60 million mentioned above, as well as EUR 13 million in VAT and EUR 3 million in interest.
Court proceedings instigated by the financial institutions of the radial 4 project:
With regard to Radial 4, in June 2013 a group of financial institutions from the banking syndicate that was financing the Project filed court proceedings with Madrid Court of First Instance No. 61 against the shareholders of the company that had guaranteed the contribution of contingent capital in certain circumstances, namely Cintra Infrastructures, SE ­ and Sacyr Concesiones, S.L.
In that lawsuit, they sought the enforcement of a guarantee that had been put in place by the shareholders, on the grounds of an alleged breach of certain ratios. This corporate guarantee amounts to a total of EUR 23 million, of which Cintra's share amounts to EUR 14.9 million. In their reply to the action, Cintra and Sacyr argued, inter alia, that the banks did not have active locus standi (a legitimate right to act), believing that they could not file an action against the Shareholders but should instead file it against the company that was the Investor in the Project. They also argued that the purpose of the guarantee was not to afford the borrower funds to cover payments relating to the financing, but rather to ensure its financial solvency in order to meet obligations arising from a refinancing process that has not taken place.
In the end, the First Instance Court accepted the plea for the lack of active locus standi on the part of the claimants, dismissing the banks' claim without entering into the merits of the case. The Banks appealed this judgement before the Madrid Court of Appeal, which upheld the first instance judgement in December 2016. Against this judgement, the financial institutions filed an extraordinary appeal for procedural infringement with the Supreme Court.
Notice of the Supreme Court's ruling admitting the Banks' appeal was given on 12 July 2019, and the Banks' active locus standi to make a direct claim against the Sponsors (Cintra and Sacyr) was recognised. The Court of Appeal was thus forced to enter into the merits of the case.
Lawsuit regarding insolvency of SH-130 toll road creditors
On 1 March 2018, "SH-130 Concession Company, LLC" filed an initial statement of case at the United States Bankruptcy Court Western District of Texas against Ferrovial, S.A, Cintra Infrastructures SE, Ferrovial Agroman, S.A. and other companies of the Ferrovial Group, and against the partner in the SH-130 toll road project.
SH-130 Concession Company, LLC was 65% owned by Cintra TX 56, LLC until 28 June 2017, when ownership of its share capital was transferred to the current shareholders as the result of the completion of the voluntary insolvency process (Chapter 11) filed on 2 March 2016.
The complaint is based on the claim that some of the payments made by the concession operator to the construction company in 2011 and 2012, during the toll road's design and construction phase, were allegedly made in a way that defrauded the creditors, since, in the claimant's opinion: (i) the works were completed incorrectly and should not, therefore, have been paid for; and (ii) the concession operator was insolvent.
The claimant is demanding the return of these payments, which amount to a total of USD 329 million.
It also accuses Ferrovial, S.A., Cintra Infrastructures SE and other companies in the group of having caused SH-130 Concession Company, LLC to make such payments, thus breaching the fiduciary

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

206
duties that it should have observed under the mercantile law of the State of Delaware, as well as accusing them of aiding and abetting the breach of such duties.
In an amendment to the initial statement of case filed on 28 September 2018, the claimant sought additional damages consisting of the return of the profits earned under the agreements for services for which the defendants had invoiced the claimants over the said period. The claimant is yet to specify the amount required for this item. It has also extended the initial complaint in relation to fulfilment of fiduciary duties.
The Ferrovial Group defendant companies presented various motions to dismiss on the initial legal action. On 7 September 2018, the court allowed the motions to dismiss relating to the Group Companies Ferrovial Internacional, S.L.U. and Ferrovial International Ltd. (which have been excluded from the legal action). The proceeding continues with respect to the other defendants.
On 5 August 2019 the claimant filed a third amendment to the complaint, in which it extended its accusations of an infringement of fiduciary duties to events that had occurred in 2007 as a result of the financial closure of the project.
At present, this lawsuit is in the discovery phase, which once completed will be followed by the submission and argument phases.
The analysis carried out so far by the legal advisors of the affected companies, based on the information available throughout the process, would lead to the conclusion that the Ferrovial Group Companies named as defendants in the process have strong arguments to defend their interests, and it is reasonable to think that they could succeed in having the actions brought against them rejected by the Court. Based on the above, Ferrovial has not set aside any provision in group companies as a result of these legal proceedings.
b) Litigation relating to the Construction business
The Construction Division is involved in a number of ongoing legal actions, relating principally to potential construction defects in the building work it has completed and claims for civil liability.
The provisions recognised in relation to these risks at 31 December 2019 totalled EUR 112 million (2018: EUR 82 million) and relate to a total of approximately 87 lawsuits.
The main lawsuit relates to the SH 130 toll road construction works in Texas, as detailed below, and this is in addition to the complaint described in the previous section relating to the toll road business.
Arbitration - construction works at the SH-130 toll road in Texas:
In addition to the legal action mentioned in the section relating to lawsuits in the toll road business, the concession operator for the SH 130 toll road (SH130 Concession Company, LLC) filed a request for the submission to arbitration of a dispute against Central Texas Highway Contractors, LLC, the toll road's constructor (in which Ferrovial Agroman holds a stake), and against the companies Zachry Industrial, INC. and Ferrovial Agroman S.A., as the joint guarantors of the aforementioned company. In the request for arbitration, the concession operator claimed in both general and specific terms that there were failings and defects during the construction, mainly in the aggregates used to surface the toll road, which it valued at no less than USD 130 million. Of this, 50% (USD 65 million) would be attributed to Ferrovial's stake in the company, though there is no joint and several liability with regard to the other stakeholder's involvement.

In March 2019, the company SH130 Concession Company LLC, filed a statement of claim for USD 161 million (which added to the initial USD 130 million, amounts to a total of approximately USD 291 million), which consists of the amounts that SH130 Concession Company, LLC alleges it has incurred or will incur to repair the damages claimed.
Of this amount, 50% (USD 145 million) would be attributable to the stake held by the Ferrovial Group.
To date, following the submission of the respondent's statement of defence, SH130 Concession Company, LLC has filed its statement of reply in December 2019, in which it basically maintains the same claims but has reduced the amount to USD 280 million (USD 140 million would be attributed to the Ferrovial Group's share). The hearing will begin on 9 March 2020. The International Chamber of Commerce (institution responsible for the arbitration procedure) has announced that the final arbitration decision will be handed down before 30 July 2020. It is possible that this date may be extended. After analysing all of the documentation that they have had access to over the course of the year, the legal advisors of the affected companies still believe that construction work at the toll road was carried out in accordance with the terms of the contract and industry best practices, and that, in any case, any liability that may result from this lawsuit could be reduced by certain factors, such as:
· The existence of insurance policies to the benefit of the construction company.
· Where applicable, liability for the defects being alleged should rest with the companies that were subcontracted by the construction company, both with regard to design and as regards the work done to lay the road surface.
· It would appear that the Texas Department of Transport and the concession operator have reached an agreement to carry out the work required to repair the defects at a value of USD 60 million, which represents much less than the amount being claimed.
A mediation process has begun with SH130 Concession Company, LLC (which also involves the partner in the project, Zachry, insurance companies, designers and subcontractors connected with the alleged construction defects), with the aim of bringing this claim to an end in a negotiated manner. Any agreement that might be reached would also entail the ending of the lawsuit that relates to the same project and is described in the section relating to lawsuits in the toll road business. As of the date on which the annual accounts were drawn up, no results had been achieved in this mediation process.
It was concluded that upon closing the accounts in December 2019, the risk arising from these proceedings could amount to USD 25 million, and a supplementary allowance of USD 15 million was therefore set aside during the 2019 financial year, in addition to the USD 10 million already set aside.

Construction Business in Spain:
On 1 October 2018, the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission's (CNMC) Competition Division (CD) agreed to bring sanctions proceedings against a number of companies, one of them being Ferrovial Agroman S.A, (FASA), for alleged prohibited behaviour that is contrary to competition regulations.
As outlined by the CD, this behaviour ostensibly consists of the exchange of certain information between companies for the purposes and/or with the effect of restricting competition during the course of the competitive tendering processes organised by Public Authorities in Spain for the construction and refurbishment of infrastructure and buildings.
The list of charges drawn up by the CD was received in October 2019. This document contains the conclusions reached in the investigation that was carried out and it gives details of the events that could constitute an infringement of the competition regulations. A statement of defence arguments was filed in December, arguing that the infringements indicated by the CD had not occurred. Subsequently, following completion of the necessary instruction process, notice of the proposed ruling will be given so that the relevant arguments may be put forward.
Lastly, the CNMC Board is expected to hand down its decision on the proceedings in April 2020.
This decision may be appealed in the National Court and, where applicable, in the Supreme Court. This risk is covered by the provisions mentioned in Note 6.3.
c) Litigation relating to the Services business
Services business in the UK:
The main lawsuits that remain ongoing are as follows: The main lawsuits that remain ongoing are as follows:
· Lawsuit relating to the Amey contract with Birmingham City Council:
· In June 2019 Amey reached an agreement to exit the Birmingham City Council contract. Pursuant to this agreement, Amey is required to pay GBP 215 million over a six-year period (GBP 100 million paid on 29 June 2019, two payments of GBP 30 million each at the end of September and December 2019, GBP 10 million each year from 2020 to 2024 and GBP 5 million in 2025) to fully discharge Amey's liability with respect to the Birmingham project and stakeholders.
· This agreement has no impact on Ferrovial's profit, as it falls into the calculation of the fair value provision recognised in December 2018 in relation to Ferrovial's stake in Amey.
Aggregate industries:
As detailed in the 2018 annual accounts, the Services business in the UK also had a claim by Aggregate Industries, the subcontractor in the Sheffield contract, amounting to GBP 32 million.
During 2019, Amey obtained a High Court judgement ordering Aggregate Industries to present the definitive claim for its evaluation. Following this judgement, the parties have reached an agreement, entailing an impact of GBP 2.2 million in the Amey income statement. The Group considers that the agreement reached marks the end of this lawsuit.
Services business in Spain:
· Litigation relating to the Ruling of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) in relation to the municipal solid waste sector.

207
On 12 June 2019, the CNMC set forth a list of the established facts in which it outlined anti-trust conduct or practices, divided into two blocks:
· participation in market-sharing agreements and recommendations in the municipal solid waste sector as a partner of ASELIP (Association of Waste Management and Street Cleaning Companies); and
· bilateral client-sharing agreements with a competitor in the non-hazardous industrial waste sector in Catalonia and Andalusia, and with another competitor in the same industrial waste sector in Andalusia.
As reported in the 2018 annual accounts, Ferrovial has filed a contentious-administrative appeal with the National Court on the grounds that the initiation of these new proceedings violates the basic right of Cespa S.A. and Cespa Gestión de Residuos S.A.U. not to be tried twice for the same offence, since proceedings were previously initiated for the same reason and later dismissed by the Courts. The appeal has been concluded and is now pending a date to be set for the voting and handing down of the judgement. On 31 July 2019, the CNMC handed down its ruling on a proposed penalty, and on 30 August 2019 CESPA and CESPA GR filed claims against this ruling. On 19 September 2019, the CNMC Board ordered the suspension of the term allocated to resolve the proceedings until the National Court has ruled on the contentious-administrative appeal for the protection of basic rights. The Group has decided not to set aside any provision, given that the Company's legal advisors believe that the arguments set out in the appeal seeking protection for basic rights are robust.
· Litigation relating to the penalty proceedings opened by the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) in relation to the road maintenance sector:
Following a period of investigation into reserved information, on 16 July 2019, the CNMC initiated penalty proceedings against FERROSER INFRAESTRUCTURAS, S.A. and its Parent FERROVIAL, S.A., along with other companies in the sector (ACS, ACCIONA, FCC, OHL, SACYR, ELECNOR, and others), due to potential antitrust practices during tendering for providing maintenance and operations services for the State Road Network, arranged by the Ministry of Public Works. The CNMC has only announced initiation and has provided access to part of the proceedings. In relation to the investigation period related to the reserved information, the Group has filed a contentious-administrative appeal with the Nation Court seeking protection for basic rights, essentially based on the fact that the Inspection order was very generalised and that the indicators of the investigation were not provided, and this has been admitted for process and has been challenged by the Public Prosecutor, pending a date for a vote and ruling. For the same reasons, on 11 January 2019, an appeal was filed with the Madrid High Court, asking for the Court Ruling that authorised the inspection to be revoked, though the appeal was definitively dismissed.
· Empresa de Mantenimiento y Explotación M-30, S.A. (Emesa).
As set out in the 2018 annual accounts, acting through the company Empresa de Mantenimiento y Explotación M-30, S.A. (Emesa) in which it holds a 50% stake, the Group is operating the contract for the maintenance of the M-30 infrastructure, and it holds a 20% stake in the mixed financial holding company Madrid Calle 30, which is the holder of the concession agreement for this infrastructure. During the 2017 financial year, Madrid City Council, which also holds a stake in Madrid Calle 30, formed a municipal Investigation Commission whose main recommendations (insofar as they affect the Group) are to reverse the management model for Madrid Calle 30 to one in which the company is 100% municipally owned and to request the relevant City Council bodies to determine who is liable for paying for the electricity supply, which to date has been paid for by Madrid Calle 30. On 31 December 2018, Emesa filed an appeal against the resolution in

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

208
which the Madrid City Council approved the Report by the Investigation Commission.
On 3 June 2019, a judgement was issued on the appeal, declaring that it was inadmissible due to a lack of legal standing on the part of the appellant (Emesa). Nonetheless, although it was not given leave to proceed, point of law four of the appeal states that the Investigation Committee's rulings are mere recommendations and are not binding on Emesa. In other words, the company could only be affected by any possible rulings that may be issued in the future that contain the said recommendations. In the opinion of the legal advisors, this judgement is positive for the company's interests.
d) Tax litigation
As indicated in Note 6.3, Ferrovial has recognised provisions for taxes for a total amount of EUR 266 million. In relation to the companies in the Services Division, located in the discontinued operations line item, these tax provisions amount to EUR 33 million.
These provisions primarily correspond to on-going tax-based legal actions relating to tax inspections in Spain, the most significant being those concerning corporate income tax and VAT for the periods 2002 to 2015. Therefore, the total amount for litigation in Spain amounts to EUR 363 million, of which the Group believes that it has strong arguments to defend its procedural position, therefore it has set aside partial allowance provisions to cover the risk that could arise from these actions in the amount of EUR 250 million, as well as EUR 24 million associated with companies in the Services Division, which are classified under discontinued operations.
These actions include one that relates to the tax write-down of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Amey and Swissport. Ferrovial has filed an appeal against the decision by the European Commission in 2014 ("Third Decision"), in which this kind of tax measure is classified as constituting state aid. Although we feel there are sound grounds supporting the Group's procedural stance, if a favourable court judgement is not issued, the amount of EUR 84 million will be payable to the Treasury, including the expected Corporate Income Tax for 2019, of which EUR 37 million was already settled in 2017 and EUR 5 million is expected to be paid in 2020. In this pessimistic scenario, the impact on the income statement would be EUR 0.5 million, having recognised the corresponding deferred tax liability of EUR 127 million, which is offset by applying tax credits available to the company in the amount of EUR 42 million.
e) Other litigation
In addition to the litigation discussed above, of particular note is the Group continuing to maintain its contractual position vis-à-vis certain tax claims that had been filed by Promociones Habitat, S.A., which was sold by Ferrovial Fisa, S.L. in 2016. These claims are currently pending resolution or payment and a provision for the amount thereof has been duly recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
6.5.2. Guarantees
a) Bank guarantees and other guarantees provided by insurance companies
In carrying on its activities the Group is subject to possible contingent liabilities ­ uncertain by nature ­ relating to the liability arising from the performance of the various contracts that constitute the activity of its business divisions.
In order to cover the aforementioned liability, the Group has bank guarantees and other guarantees issued by insurance companies. At 31 December 2019, the balance amounted to EUR 7,994 million (2018: EUR 7,524 million).
The following table contains a breakdown of the risk covered in each business area.

The EUR 7,994 million, by type of instrument, relate to: i) EUR 3,624 million of bank guarantees; ii) EUR 3,581 million of guarantees provided by bonding agencies and iii) EUR 788 million of bank guarantees provided by insurance companies.
These bonds and guarantees cover the liability to customers for correct performance in construction or services contracts involving Group Companies. Thus, if a project was not carried out, the customer would enforce the guarantee.
Despite the significant amount of these guarantees, the impact that might arise on the consolidated financial statements is very low, since the Group Companies perform contracts in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon with the customers and recognise provisions within the results of each contract for risks that might arise from performance thereof (see Note 6.3).
Lastly, of the total amount of the Group's bank guarantees listed in the above table, EUR 868 million (see Note 6.5.3.) secure its commitments to invest in the capital of infrastructure projects, fixed assets and company purchases.
b) Guarantees provided by Group Companies for other Group Companies
As indicated previously, in general guarantees are provided among Group Companies to cover third-party liability arising from contractual, commercial or financial relationships.
Although these guarantees do not have any effect at consolidated Group level, there are certain guarantees provided by noninfrastructure project companies to infrastructure project companies (see Note 1.1.2.) which, due to the classification of project borrowings as being without recourse, it is relevant to disclose (see Note b.1. on Contingent Capital Guarantees).
Other noteworthy guarantees have also been provided to equityaccounted companies (see b.2.).
b.1) Guarantees provided by ex-infrastructure projects to infrastructure project companies in relation to the borrowings of the latter that could give rise to future additional capital disbursements if the events guaranteed took place (Contingent Capital Guarantees).
Guarantees provided by non-infrastructure project companies to infrastructure project companies can be classified into the following two categories:
· Guarantees that address the correct performance in construction and service contracts which have been mentioned in Note 6.5.2.a).
· Guarantees related to risks other than the correct performance of construction and service contracts, which could give rise to future additional capital disbursements if the events guaranteed take place.
The latter guarantees are the ones that are going to be explained in further detail in this section since, as mentioned in Note 5.2., Net Cash Position, the borrowings for infrastructure projects are without recourse to the shareholders or with limited recourse to the

guarantees provided and, therefore, it is relevant to distinguish those guarantees that if the guaranteed event occurs, could be executed and could result in disbursements to the infrastructure projects or holders of their debt other than the committed capital or investment mentioned in Note 6.5.3. Such guarantees are called contingent capital guarantees.
The detail, by beneficiary company, purpose and maximum amount, of the outstanding guarantees of this nature at 31 December 2019 relating to fully consolidated infrastructure project companies is as follows. It should be noted that the amounts below relate to Ferrovial:

In addition, the Company has provided a guarantee amounting to EUR 14.9 million in relation to the Radial 4 toll road, which was excluded from the scope of consolidation in 2015. This amount had been provided for in full at 31 December 2019 (see Note 6.5.1.a)).

209
b.2) Other guarantees provided to equity-accounted companies other than infrastructure project companies
Certain construction and services contracts are performed by equityaccounted companies, often created specifically to perform contracts previously awarded to their shareholders. In these cases, the shareholders of those companies provide performance bonds relating to those contracts. The liability secured is similar to that indicated in Note 6.5.2.a.
Notable in this respect are the performance bonds provided in the Services Division by Amey UK PLC for various of its subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method totalling EUR 370 million, of which the most significant are those relating to contracts for the UK Ministry of Defence and the Manchester tram network. It should be noted that the aforementioned amount relates to the annual amount of contracts not yet performed in proportion to Ferrovial's percentage of ownership.
c) Security interests in assets
The security interests in assets are described in the following Notes:
· Guarantees given for fixed assets, see Note 3.4.
· Security interests in deposits or restricted cash, see Note 5.2.
d) Guarantees received from third parties
At 31 December 2019, Ferrovial had received guarantees from third parties totalling EUR 1,601 million (31 December 2018: EUR 1,098 million), mainly in the Construction Division in the Ferrovial Agroman companies in the United States (EUR 1,184 million), the Budimex Group (EUR 153 million) and other construction companies (EUR 264 million), particularly noteworthy were the companies in the UK (EUR 98 million) and national construction (EUR 66 million).
These third party guarantees are technical guarantees that are offered by certain subcontractors or suppliers in the construction business in order to guarantee complete compliance with their contractual obligations with regard to the work they are engaged to complete, and may not be sold or pledged.
6.5.3. Commitments
As described in Note 1.1, the infrastructure projects carried out by the Group are performed through long-term contracts where the concession operator is a company in which the Group has interests, either alone or together with other partners, and the borrowings necessary for financing the project are allocated to the project itself, without recourse to the shareholders or with recourse limited to the guarantees provided, under the terms set forth in Note 5.2. From the management viewpoint, therefore, Ferrovial takes into account only the investment commitments relating to the capital of the projects, since the investment in the assets is financed by the borrowings of the projects themselves.
a) Investment commitments
The investment commitments of the Group in relation to the capital of its projects are as follows:

At 31 December 2019, the investment commitments amount to EUR 976 million (2018: EUR 1,013 million). The curtailment in investment commitments is primarily related to the unexpected EUR 51 million equity contribution in 2019 from the cancellation of the Denver airport project.
As indicated in 6.5.2.a), a part of these commitments, amounting to EUR 976 million, EUR 846 million are secured by bank guarantees.
There are also property, plant and equipment purchase commitments in the Services Division totalling EUR 129 million (2018: EUR 162 million) which relate mainly to the acquisition of machinery or the construction of treatment plants. Also, EUR 23 million (2018: EUR 19 million) are due to the acquisition of companies, mostly related with Wales & Borders.

It should be noted that the foregoing commitments of acquisition of Property and companies, only Wales & Borders are secured by bank guarantees amounting EUR 22 million.

b) Environmental commitments
Any operation designed mainly to prevent, reduce or repair damage to the environment is treated as an environmental activity.
Costs incurred to protect and improve the environment are taken to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred, irrespective of when the resulting monetary or financial flow takes place.

Provisions for probable or certain environmental liability, litigation in progress and indemnities or other outstanding obligations of undetermined amount not covered by insurance policies are recorded when the liability or obligation giving rise to the indemnity or payment arises. These provisions include most notably the provisions for waste landfill closure discussed in Note 6.3, relating to the Services Division, which have been reclassified to discontinued operations.

6.6. REMUNERATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES

6.6.1. Bylaw-stipulated Board of Directors' remuneration
Under the Company's current remuneration scheme, regulated by Article 56 of its bylaws, the shareholders at the General Meeting determine the maximum annual remuneration for all the members of the Board of Directors, which is revised on the basis of the indices or aggregates defined by the General Meeting. This remuneration comprises (i) a fixed remuneration, part of which is paid in quarterly

instalments and the rest (the additional fixed remuneration) via a single payment at the end of the financial year; and (ii) fees for actual attendance at Board and Committee meetings. Remuneration is linked to the functions and responsibilities assigned to each Director, their membership of Board Committees and other objective circumstances that the Board of Directors deems relevant, thereby ensuring their long-term independence and commitment.

On the same date that these annual accounts were authorised for issue, the Board of Directors prepared and made available to shareholders the Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration referred to in Article 541 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act. That Report describes in greater detail matters relating to the Company's remuneration policy applicable in the year and contains an overview of how the remuneration policy was applied in 2019, as well as a detail account of the individual remuneration earned by each of the Directors in 2019.

The table below shows the itemised bylaw-stipulated remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors earned in 2019 and 2018. If because there are more meetings than initially envisaged or for any other reason the amount of the attendance fees added to that of the fixed components exceeds the total maximum remuneration amount for Board membership established for the year in question, the difference is deducted from the amount of the supplementary fixed remuneration proportionally for each Director on the basis of his or her position on the Board. This adjustment took place during 2019.

This table does not include the remuneration received by the Executive Directors for the discharge of their executive functions at the Company, which are described in Note 6.6.2.

6.6.3. Remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors due to membership of other managing bodies of Group Companies or associates
Joaquín Ayuso García, who stepped down from his role as Director of the Company at 30 of September 2019, was also up to this date a member of the managing body of another Group company, received EUR 23 thousand in this connection in 2019 (2018: EUR 38 thousand).

6.6.4. Pension funds and plans or life insurance premiums
As in 2018, no contributions were made in 2019 to pension plans or funds for former or current members of the Company's Board of Directors or for directors of the Company who are members of other Boards of Directors and/or senior executives of Group Companies or associates. Similarly, no obligations were acquired in these connections in 2019.

As regards life insurance premiums, the Company has insurance policies covering death (for which premiums totalling EUR 13 thousand were paid in 2019; EUR 12 thousand in 2018), of which the Executive Directors are beneficiaries. No life insurance premiums were paid for the Directors of the Company who are members of other Boards of Directors and/or senior executives of Group Companies or Associates.

Lastly, the Company has arranged a third-party liability insurance policy the insureds of which are the directors and executives of the Group Companies the parent of which is the Company. Those insureds include the Company's Directors. The premium paid in 2019 under the aforementioned insurance policy amounted to EUR 621 thousand.

6.6.5. Advances and loans
At 31 December 2019, no advances or loans had been granted by the Company to the Directors in their capacity as such or as members of other Boards of Directors and/or as senior executives of Group Companies or associates.

6.6.6. Remuneration of senior executives
The joint remuneration earned by the Company's Senior Executives in 2019 was as follows:

(1) Removal of three Senior Executive members (figure subject to personal income tax IRPF).

The aforementioned remuneration relates to the following posts: General Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, General Director of HR, General Director of Construction, General Director of Services, General Director of Airports, General Director of Toll Roads, General Director of Information Systems and Innovation, Director of Internal Audit, Director of Communications and Corporate Responsibility and Director of Corporate Strategy, Director of Risk and Compliance and Director of Mobility. This does not include remuneration for Senior Executives who were also Executive Directors, which was addressed in Note 6.6.2.

The Company has also introduced a flexible remuneration system called the "Flexible Remuneration Plan", which provides employees with the possibility of voluntarily modifying their remuneration package based on their personal needs, replacing a portion of their remuneration with the award of certain payments in kind. These products include a group life and retirement-related savings insurance plan. Participants may request that a portion of their gross annual remuneration be paid by the Company in the form of a premium for a Group life and retirement-related savings insurance policy. In this connection, the Senior Executives requested contributions of EUR 58 thousand from the Company, instead of the equivalent remuneration shown in the foregoing table (2018: EUR 193 thousand).

6.6.7. Other disclosures on remuneration
The agreements between the Company and Senior Executives, including one Executive Director, specifically provide for the right to receive the indemnities referred to in Article 56 of the Workers' Statute in the event of unjustified dismissal.
In order to encourage loyalty and long-service, a deferred remuneration scheme was recognised for thirteen Senior Executives, including one Executive Director. The scheme consists of extraordinary remuneration that will only be paid when one of the following circumstances occurs:
· Removal of the Senior Executive by mutual agreement upon reaching a certain age.
· Unjustified dismissal or termination by the Company at its discretion without any justification for dismissal, prior to the Senior Executive reaching the age initially agreed upon, if the amount of this remuneration exceeds that resulting from applying the Workers' Statute.
· The death or disability of the Senior Executive.
· To cover this incentive, each year the Company makes contributions to a Group savings insurance policy, of which the Company is both policy-holder and beneficiary. These contributions are quantified on the basis of a certain percentage of the total monetary remuneration of each senior executive. The contributions made in 2019 amounted to EUR 1,991 thousand (2018: EUR 2,628 thousand), of which EUR 562 thousand relate to Executive Directors. The figure displayed in the footnote to

Table 6.6.2 as "Other" (amounts to EUR 8,167 thousand) corresponds to the departure of an Executive Director. This impact does not affect the 2019 income statement, as the company expenses the amounts contributed during the year to the group savings insurance policy regardless of when these amounts are received.

6.7. SHARE-BASED REMUNERATION SCHEMES

Performance-based share plan

At year-end 2019, Ferrovial has two remuneration schemes in place for Ferrovial Group Executive Directors, senior executives and executives, consisting of a performance-based share plan.

Plan approved on 29 October 2015 by the Board of Directors. It covers the financial years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The annual cost of the plan may not exceed EUR 22 million for each of the three years and is conditional upon employees having at least three years' service at the Company from the moment it is granted (barring special circumstances) and upon the achievement during this period of ratios calculated on the basis of EBITDA as a percentage of net productive assets, investing activities and total shareholder return with respect to a comparable Group. As mentioned, the plan is intended for Executive Directors, senior executives and executives. The application of this plan to Executive Directors was authorised at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2016.

Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2019. This Plan will be in effect for one year and the annual cost of the Plan may not exceed EUR 22 million. The Plan is conditional upon employees having at least three years' service at the Company from the moment it is granted (barring special circumstances) and upon the achievement during this period of ratios calculated on the basis of the return obtained and total shareholder return with respect to a comparable Group. The plan is intended for Executive Directors, senior executives and executives. The application of this Plan to Executive Directors was authorised at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 5 April 2019, as communicated to the CNMV on the same day. The date of allocation of units for 2019 to the Executive Directors for the purpose of calculating the duration and terms and conditions of the aforementioned Plan was 15 February 2019.

There were 3,125,747 shares outstanding at 31 December 2019 relating to these plans.

The movements in the aforementioned share based remuneration schemes in 2019 and 2018 are summarised as follows:

Number of shares at beginning of year Plans granted Plans settled Shares surrendered and other Shares exercised Number of shares at year-end

2019
3,274,816 1,005,040
-724,787 -408,762 -20,560 3,125,747

2018
3,212,739 1,136,353 -1,030,008 -27,479 -16,789 3,274,816

This share award plan includes the plans described above in Note 6.6 on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives.
In 2019, the staff expenses recognised at the Group in relation to these remuneration schemes amounted to EUR 7 million (2018: EUR 12 million) with a balancing entry in equity. The decrease of staff expenses are due to the level of achievement related to the sharebased plans liquidated in 2019, which has stood at 71.88% compared to the 100% reached in 2018.

Lastly, on 19 December 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new long-term incentive plan. The plan will be in force for three years (from 2020 to 2022) and consists of providing Ferrovial, S.A. shares. The annual cost of the plan may not exceed EUR 22 million and is conditional upon employees having at least three years' service at the Company from the moment it is granted (barring special circumstances) and upon the achievement during this period of ratios calculated on the basis of business cash flow and total shareholder return with respect to a comparable Group. The plan is intended for Executive Directors, senior executives and executives. The application of this form of remuneration to Executive Directors will be submitted for approval at the next Annual General Meeting.
Valuation of performance-based share plan
These plans were accounted for as futures and, therefore, the value of the foreseeable dividends up to the delivery date is discounted to the value of the shares at the grant date, using a rate of return equal to the average cost of borrowings over the share award period, and they are equity settled and, therefore, they are measured when granted and the initially calculated value thereof is not reestimated. The related amounts are recognised under "Staff Expenses" with a balancing entry in reserves.

6.8. INFORMATION ON RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

213

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

c) Transactions between Group Companies
Also described are transactions between the subsidiaries and the Company which, in all cases form part of their ordinary businesses as regards purpose and conditions and were not eliminated on consolidation for the following reason.
As explained in detail in Note 1.2.2, the balances and transactions relating to construction work performed by the Construction Division for the Group's infrastructure concession operators are not eliminated on consolidation since, at consolidated level, contracts of this type are classed as construction contracts in which the work ­ to the extent that it is completed ­ is deemed to be performed for third parties, as the ultimate owner of the work is the grantor both from a financial and legal viewpoint.
In 2019 Ferrovial's Construction Division billed those concession operators for EUR 363,270 thousand (2018: EUR 509,764 thousand) for work performed and related advance payments and, in this respect, recognised sales totalling EUR 420,231 thousand (2018: EUR 483,211 thousand).

In 2019 the profit from these transactions attributable to the Company's holdings in the concession operators in question and not eliminated on consolidation, net of taxes and non-controlling interests, was EUR -127,354 thousand. In 2018, this amounted to EUR 22,491 thousand.
6.9. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
In accordance with the legislation in force (Article 229 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act), there were no direct or indirect conflicts of interest with the Company, without prejudice to the transactions of the Company (or the companies forming part of its Group) with related party transactions disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or, where applicable, to the resolutions relating to matters of remuneration or appointments.

6.10. AUDITOR FEES
Pursuant to Royal Decree 1514 of 16 November 2007, approving the Spanish National Chart of Accounts, following is a disclosure of the total fees relating to the "audit services" and "other consultancy services" provided by the auditors of the 2019 and 2018 financial statements of the Group Companies, including both the principal auditor of Ferrovial S.A. and the other auditors of all its subsidiaries, both in Spain and abroad.
"Fees for Audit Services" includes the following items:
· "Audit Services" relates to strictly statutory audit services.
· "Audit-Related Services" relates to services other than statutory audit services which by law or by regulation can only be provided by the Company's auditor, such as the review of financial information in bond issues and services which due to their nature are normally provided by the Company's auditor, such as the review of tax returns.
The total "other audit services" provided by the principal auditor represented 3.59% of the total fees for audit services in 2019.

Appendix I. Information related to the tax system

laid down in Articles 107 and 108 of Law 27/2014

-----

In 2014 Ferrovial opted to be taxed under the regime established currently in Articles 107 and 108 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act, of 27 November 2014, which became applicable from 1 January 2014 and, consequently, applied to all of 2019. Under this tax regime:
1. Dividends and capital gains obtained by Ferrovial arising from ownership interests in non-resident operating companies (which represent at least 5% of the share capital of these companies or which were acquired for more than EUR 20 million) are exempt from Corporate Income Tax if the requirements provided for in Article 21 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act ("exempt income") are fulfilled.
2. The dividends paid by Ferrovial with a charge to the aforementioned "exempt income", or to income arising from permanent establishments abroad to which the exemption provided for in Article 22 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act is applicable are treated as follows:

iii) Where the shareholder is a natural person resident in Spain subject to personal income tax, it shall pay tax on the capital gain obtained in accordance with the standard income tax rules.
The amount of exempt income pursuant to Article 21 and 22 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act obtained by Ferrovial in 2019 and the related tax paid abroad are as follows:

A) EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN SOURCE DIVIDENDS AND INCOME

A.1 Exemption for foreign source dividends:
(Amount in euros) FERROVIAL, S.A. Ferrovial International SE Dividend TOTAL

444,000,000.00 444,000,000.00 444,000,000.00

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019

i) Where the recipient is a non-resident shareholder in Spain (and does not operate through tax havens or by means of a permanent establishment in Spain), dividends are not subject to withholdings or taxation in Spain.
ii) Where the recipient is an entity subject to Spanish Income Tax, the dividends received shall give rise to the exemption in order to avoid double taxation of dividends of resident entities included in Article 21 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act ("exempt income"), if the requirements provided for in the aforementioned law are met.
iii) Where the recipient is a natural person resident in Spain subject to personal income tax (IRPF), the dividends received shall be considered savings income and the tax credit for the avoidance of double taxation in Spain may be taken in accordance with the terms of the Personal Income Tax Act, with respect to the taxes paid abroad by Ferrovial.
In 2019 all of the dividends paid by Ferrovial were paid out of "exempt income".
3. The capital gains obtained by the shareholders of Ferrovial arising from the transfer of their ownership interests in the Company are treated as follows:
i) Where the shareholder is a non-resident in Spain (and does not operate through tax havens or a permanent establishment in Spain) the portion of the capital gain that relates to the reserves recognised by Ferrovial with a charge to the aforementioned "exempt income" or to changes in value attributable to Ferrovial's investments in non-resident entities that meet the requirements to be able to apply the foreign income exemption established in Articles 21 and 22 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act shall be deemed not subject to taxation in Spain.

A.2 Exemption for income from permanent establishments abroad:
No income was obtained from permanent establishments abroad during the year.
B) EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN SOURCE CAPITAL GAINS
No capital gains have been obtained in 2019 from tax-exempt external sources.
The sale of the Greek toll roads in 2018 resulted in a capital gain, which is still pending application of the exemption set out in Article 21 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act (LIS) for EUR 84,825,069.03. The amount exempt from tax stands at EUR 11,307,039.92.
In the years prior to 2018, no capital gains were obtained to which the exemption included in Article 21 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act is applicable because (i) either the sales were made between Group Companies and were eliminated on preparation of the consolidated tax return, (ii) or they were reported in corporate restructuring transactions, which opted for the tax neutrality regime provided for in Article 76 et seq of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act. Nevertheless, the capital gains that would have been reported for tax purposes had these regimes not been not applicable (consolidated tax or tax neutrality) are as follows:

ii) Where the shareholder is an entity subject to Spanish income tax with an ownership interest in Ferrovial that meets the requirement (5% ownership interest in the share capital or that the acquisition cost of the ownership interest exceeds EUR 20 million and it has been held for one year), the exemption provided for in Article 21 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act may be applied.

B.1 Elimination of capital gains for intra-group sales of foreign companies:
None took place during 2019.
B.2 Deferred capital gains arising in corporate restructuring processes:

(Amount in euros) Ferrovial, SA Cintra Infraestructuras Irlanda, SLU TOTAL

1,940,292,200.15 6,143,952.38
1,946,436,152.53

In order to enable the shareholders of Ferrovial to adopt the aforementioned tax regime, the Company performed a market assessment at the end of the year of its ownership interests (held directly and indirectly through investments in other entities that have adopted this special tax regime) in non-resident entities and permanent establishments abroad that meet the requirements to be able to apply the foreign source income exemption established in Articles 21 and 22 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act.
At 31 December 2019, the result of this assessment means that these assets represent 90.8% of the total market value of Ferrovial. At 31 December 2018, this percentage amounted to 92%.
Taxation of Ferrovial's Scrip Dividend
In 2019 Ferrovial S.A. implemented two shareholder remuneration schemes under a framework known as the "Ferrovial Scrip Dividend", which provide the Company's shareholders with the free choice of (i) receiving newly issued bonus shares of the Company; (ii) transferring in the market the bonus issue rights relating to the shares held by them; or (iii) receiving a cash amount through the transfer to Ferrovial of the aforementioned bonus issue rights.
Set forth below are the main tax implications of these schemes, based on the tax legislation in force in Spain except for Navarre and the Basque Country and on the interpretation made by the Spanish Directorate-General of Taxes in its response to several requests for binding rulings.
Delivery of new shares: For tax purposes, the delivery of new shares is considered to be a delivery of bonus shares and, therefore, does not constitute income for the purposes of personal income tax, income tax or non-resident income tax, regardless of whether or not the recipients of these shares act through a permanent establishment in Spain. The delivery of new shares is not subject to withholdings or pre-payments. The acquisition cost per share for tax purposes, both of the bonus shares and the shares to which they correspond, will be the result of distributing the total cost of acquisition of the portfolio by the number of shares; both the original shares and the bonus shares that relate to them. The age of the bonus shares will be the age that relates to the shares that gave rise to them. Consequently, in the event of their subsequent transfer, the income obtained will be calculated by reference to this new value.
· Sale to the market of the bonus issue rights: If the shareholders sell their bonus issue rights to the market, the amount obtained will be subject to the tax rules indicated below:
Shareholders who pay personal income tax (people with tax residence in Spain). The amount obtained on the sale to the

217
market of the bonus issue rights is subject to the same rules established in tax legislation for pre-emption rights. As a result, the transferring shareholder will have been deemed to have made a capital gain in the tax period that the sale occurs. The amount obtained will be subject to 19% personal income tax withholdings. This withholding tax will be applied by the relevant custodian (and, failing this, by the financial intermediary or public notary involved in the transfer), Ferrovial not being required to make the withholdings or supply related tax information to its shareholders. Shareholders are therefore advised to contact the relevant custodians in this regard.
Shareholders who pay personal income tax, without a permanent establishment in Spain. In the case of non-resident shareholders, the amount obtained on the sale to the market of the bonus issue rights is also subject to the same rules established in tax legislation for pre-emption rights, therefore the transferring shareholder will be considered to have made a capital gain in the tax period that the sale occurs, subject to non-resident income tax at a general rate of 19%. At present, this payment is not subject to nonresident income tax withholdings and the shareholders must selfassess this income in their tax returns. However, the income will be exempt from non-resident income tax in certain cases, such as non-resident shareholders that transfer their rights in official secondary securities markets in Spain, that are residents of a State that has a double taxation treaty (DTT) with Spain containing an information exchange clause and that do not operate or reside in a tax haven for Spanish purposes.
Shareholders who pay Spanish Corporate Income Tax, or Personal Income Tax with a permanent establishment in Spain. To the extent that a full business cycle is completed, tax will be paid in accordance with applicable accounting legislation and, if appropriate, the adjustments applicable under corporate income tax (CIT) regulations and any special tax CIT schemes applicable.
· Sale to Ferrovial of the bonus issue rights: Lastly, if the holders of bonus issue rights decide to avail themselves of the Ferrovial Purchase Commitment, the tax regime applicable to the amount obtained on the sale to Ferrovial of the bonus issue rights received in their capacity as shareholders will be equivalent to the regime applied to the distribution of a cash dividend, and will therefore be subject to the corresponding withholding tax and taxation. Where shareholders provide evidence of non-resident income taxpayer status, no permanent establishment in Spain and non-residence in Spain or in a territory classed as a tax haven, the dividends paid by Ferrovial and therefore the amounts received from the sale of free allotment rights to Ferrovial will not be subject to tax or tax withholdings in Spain, since for tax purposes they are paid out of the exempt income from non-resident entities envisaged in Articles 21 and 22 of CIT Law 27/2014 of 27 November.
It should be borne in mind that the taxation scenarios of the various options relating to the scheme known as the "Ferrovial Scrip Dividend" set out above do not explain all the possible tax consequences. Accordingly, the shareholders should consult their tax advisers on the specific tax effect of the proposed scheme and pay attention to any changes that could take place, both in in-force legislation and in the criteria of the interpretation thereof, as well as the particular circumstances of each shareholder or holder of bonus issue rights.
