 Status Report

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

2019 was a highly successful year for your company, ALSO Holding AG. This Annual Report is proof that we are not only achieving our ambitious targets, but are even exceeding them.
ALSO has a unique growth profile. It consists of an excellent and constantly expanding ecosystem, the systematic implementation of our MORE strategy, the three business models Supply, Solutions and Service, and the continuous development of digital technology platforms.
We work on sustainably improving profitability with the following five key drivers: the business model mix, the mix of providers and buyers and the products offered, and constant optimization of operational excellence.
In the years since 2012, we have developed an excellent measurement and control system for the organization. As a customer-focused company, customer satisfaction ­ which we measure using the Net Promoter Score ­ is an important figure. Furthermore, we use amongst others EBITDA, ROCE and the Sustainable Growth Rate to manage the company. The latter figure is important for assessing the impact of acquisitions and the development of new business areas on the company.
With the goal of continuing our sustainably profitable growth, in 2019 we:
gained market share in the Supply business model (especially in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria)
gained market shares, generated further growth in the Solutions and Service business models, thereby stepping up both transactional (purchases) and consumptional (usage-based) routes to market
significantly strengthened our market position in Eastern Europe by way of acquisitions
launched additional technology platforms through acquisitions and partnerships
completed a profound structural optimization
optimized the net working capital employed
placed a revolving credit facility that gives us leeway for further acquisitions. It thereby also underscores the trust that the capital market places in ALSO's solidity and future prospects

ALSO Annual Report 2019 Letter to the shareholders

 Status Report

The ALSO Group's net sales increased from 9.2 billion euros to 10.7 billion euros (+16.5 percent). 52 percent of this increase was achieved by means of organic growth. In the Supply sector net sales increased by 16.4 percent, in Solutions by 16 percent and in Service by 21 percent. Within this business model especially cloud-based revenue increased significantly (+58 percent). The total number of seats grew from 2.3 million to 3.8 million.
The company generated EBITDA of 197 million euros in 2019 as compared to 153 million euros in the previous year. On a like-for-like basis (excluding the effects of IFRS 16), EBITDA climbed by around 20 million euros or 13 percent to around 173 million euros in fiscal year 2019. Consolidated net profit improved by 23.6 percent to around 100 million euros (previous year: around 81 million euros). Encouragingly, the acquisition in Poland has already started to contribute to earnings thanks to its rapid integration. Hence, ALSO has exceeded the analysts' consensus expectations.
The good earnings performance, combined with the optimization of the net working capital lead to an improved cash flow. Cash holdings were increased by 45.4 percent to 349 million euros (previous year: 240 million euros). This led to an improvement in net financial debt on a like-for-like basis, i.e. before the effects of IFRS 16. It was reduced by 79 percent from 163 million euros to 34 million euros.
It is remarkable that we were able to reach this result while at the same time transforming the organization as well as the net working capital.
Various IT market research institutes are forecasting an increase in IT spending of around 3 percent in the EMEA region in 2020. This growth will largely be driven by the areas of enterprise software and IT services.
In the next few years, ALSO will focus on the following tasks:
expansion of market share in our traditional business in countries where we do not yet have a dominant position
growth of the Solutions and Service business models
rollout of platforms for IoT, cybersecurity and streaming
full integration of the acquisitions made in Eastern Europe
additional acquisitions, whether geographically or technologically motivated

ALSO Annual Report 2019 Letter to the shareholders

 Status Report

For 2020, we are planning to improve our reported EBITDA to between 210 and 220 million euros. New technologies constantly offer new opportunities for our business. In combination with the velocity of response and strength of implementation of the employees we see excellent potential for growth. Hence, the ALSO Group increased the aim for mid term EBITDA to 250 to 310 million euros. ROCE is expected to be between 13 and 14 percent.
As shareholders who have been supporting the company for years in many cases, you are of course intended to share in our success. The Board of Directors will therefore propose a distribution from the foreign capital contribution reserve of 3.25 Swiss francs per share for approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting on March 24, 2020.
The transformation of your company shows in a lot of ways ­ not least in the new logo. Its colourfulness symbolises the variety and change of the business models. What has changed, too, is the fact that this year's Annual Report is available as a hard copy on request only. This reflects digitalisation as well as the increasing ecological engagement of the company.
On behalf of the ALSO Group, I would like to thank all our stakeholders, our buyers and providers for the trust they have placed in us and for the opportunity to be their partner. At the same time, we value the flexibility and support of our suppliers. My thanks also go to the investors and analysts whose constructive contributions provided us with valuable input for the further development of our business models and thus contributed to the continuous enhancement of our profile. Our sustained success in this fiercely competitive market would not be possible, however, without the great dedication of our employees and their expertise in the systematic implementation of the MORE strategy. My special thanks go to them.
Valuable new knowledge and insights were also gained from several discussions with customers, which we hold on a continuous basis, and in dialog with my colleagues on the Board of Directors. Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to you, our valued shareholders. Thank you to those of you who invested in us for the first time in 2019 for the trust you have placed in us, and thank you to the long-standing shareholders for your continuing strong association with the ALSO Group.
Yours,

G ustavo Möller-Hergt
CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

ALSO SHARE AND SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE

Outperformance in the reporting year

Share price performance from 2012 to 2019

2019 was a successful year on the capital markets. Share prices rose steadily from the beginning of the year onward, leading to new highs. In 2019, Western stock exchanges benefited from the fact that many companies performed well while at the same time the central banks continued their expansionary monetary policy in view of weakening economic signs.
The Swiss stock market also benefited from these general conditions. The Swiss stock index SPI climbed by 26.7percent compared with the previous year. Technology stocks in particular recorded high price increases in the reporting year. For example, the SWX ID TECH technology index rose by 39.5percent year on year.
The ALSO share performed better than average in 2019. Trading at 111.40 Swiss francs on January1, 2019, it closed the year at 163.40 Swiss francs, representing an increase of 46.7percent.
As of December31, 2019, the total market capitalization of ALSO was 2 100million Swiss francs (previous year: 1 431million Swiss francs).

With the systematic implementation of the MORE strategy introduced in the 2012 fiscal year, the share price steadily gained ground until the start of 2018 before temporarily correcting in line with global stock markets. This decline was compensated for in 2019 and the previous records were significantly exceeded. On July1, 2012, the share was being traded for 39.65 Swiss francs, peaking at 167.40Swiss francs on December16, 2019 and then closing the year at 163.40Swiss francs on December31, 2019.
Therefore, the net capital gain resulting from the positive share price performance and the dividend amounts to 348percent for the period from July 2012 to December 2019.
Listing
ALSO Holding AG's share have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange since 1986 (symbol: ALSN, security no.: 2459027, ISIN: CH0024590272) and are listed in various indices, including: SPI, SPI Extra, SWX ID TECH and UBS 100.

Dividend policy

Shareholders

The Board of Directors of ALSO Holding AG follows a continuous dividend policy and aims for a payout ratio of 25 to 35percent. Current earnings, financial position, and corresponding outlook are all considered when deciding on the size of the dividend each year. see Fig. 02 For 2020, the Board of Directors proposes a distribution to the shareholders from the foreign capital contribution reserve of 3.25 Swiss francs per share. This represents a total dividend payment of 41.7million Swiss francs, or 38.3percent of the net profit generated*. The proposal will be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting of March24, 2020.

In the event that the proposal is accepted by the shareholders, the dividend is tax-free for private Swiss shareholders, as it is paid from the foreign capital contribution reserve.

KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY'S DEVELOPMENT

The most important foundation for ALSO's success is the enhancement and development of business models based on the existing ecosystem as an IT technology provider, the clear strategy, and the company's employees.
Ecosystem

MORE­the ALSO Group's strategy
04 / The MORE strategy program
Sustainable growth

Marketing in the IT industry generally takes places in three steps. In the first step, providers­i.e. manufacturers of hardware and software­supply to the ALSO companies. In the second step, ALSO supplies to buyers­retailers, etailers, SMB resellers, corporate resellers, and value-added resellers­who then serve the end customers in the third step.

With this ecosystem, we have access to all market participants: technology manufacturers, technology service providers, distributors, and end users. see Fig. 05
The attractiveness of the ecosystem lies in the number and variety of different market participants and their technologies and products. These are driven by constant innovation. The newly created products and services form the basis for further business development.
ALSO's three business models­Supply, Solutions and Service(as-a-Service) ­cover the entire range from

to "off premise" (consumptional, usage-based IT-as-a-Service

including possible hybrid solutions. The three business models complement one another, with all three areas benefiting from the shift toward usage-based offers. see Fig. 06
Thanks to the variety of market participants and their specific composition, the ecosystem is robust, as potential critical developments in one individual segment are compensated by new developments and enhancements in other segments.

ALSO developed the MORE strategy in 2011. The company's field of action is defined by the elements of sustainable profitable growth and the capital structure. For ALSO, this means growth that is reproducible, scalable and profitable, as well as ethical and responsible toward current and future stakeholders. see Fig. 04
Four activities help ensure that we achieve our goals:
M for MAINTAIN stands for securing what has already been achieved­for example, the position as number one or two on the market. On this basis, we expand our Service and Solutions business further. The development of these two promising, high-margin business models also strengthens the transactional business model, which supplies the hardware for them.

 Status Report

O for OPTIMIZE stands for continuous optimization of processes, particularly to increase the profitability of the transactional business model. The introduction of our SAP system and Business Intelligence 2.0 will create solid foundations for the company's future growth.
R stands for REINVENT. ALSO aims to continue growing with the transactional business model while also generating additional growth and income with solution- and service-oriented business models and resulting offers.
Finally, E stands for ENHANCE. The main aim is to consolidate the market in which ALSO does not have a dominant market share and to expand market position through acquisitions in line with Reinvent's objectives in markets where ALSO does have a dominant market position. In markets in which we do not have a presence, but where the legal and economic conditions are in place, we carry out acquisitions or grow in new business models by means of joint ventures and partnerships.
Five key drivers to optimize income
ALSO steers the continual earnings optimization of the income using the following five key drivers:
Provider mix
By securing and developing the vendor portfolio, we can offer new technologies for new applications and thus keep our company attractive.
Buyer mix
Balanced mix of different reseller groups to stabilize and develop ALSO's profitability and optimize its capital employed.
Product mix
The most important component of the company's sustainable development is constant review of the product portfolio and its importance for our buyers.

Operational excellence
Continuously optimizing structures and processes to reduce operating expense.
Business model mix
With the mix of its three business models, ALSO can improve profitability, increase customer loyalty, and stabilize business by expanding access to the important partners in the ecosystem. ALSO uses digitalization to optimize the existing business models and continuously develop new ones.
Our 3S business model: Supply, Solutions and Service
For providers and buyers in the ICT industry, we have developed three business models with two marketing channels. These business models are characterized by very different dynamics.
Net sales in the traditional Supply business model include wholesale business with equipment for the IT, consumer electronics, and telecommunication sectors. Our customers are providers of hardware and software as well as buyers of these products and services, including retailers, etailers, resellers (SMBs), value-added resellers, and corporate resellers. Marketing (the route to market) is mostly transactional, taking place through the purchase or sale of hardware, software or services. The business model is characterized by a high number and frequency of transactions, high net sales, high scalability, high working capital requirements, low retention rates, and low margins.
Designing and implementing complex infrastructure, communicating in a network using the equipment, virtualizing networks, servers, and storage­all of this opens up new dimensions in IT but also requires a very high level of consultancy expertise. In the Solutions business model, ALSO therefore provides project-based support in particular to resellers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) on questions of IT architecture and design, rapidly translates requirements into specific configurations, and monitors the status of projects. This business model, which comprises all net sales from trading business with products that form part of comprehensive solutions, is characterized by consultancy and support across all phases of the project and the sale and provision of the required hardware and software. This business model is mainly implemented on a transactional basis through the sale of hardware and software.

14

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Status Report

In the Service area, ALSO acts as a service provider. Instead of being sold, the equipment, software, services or solutions are offered "as a service" based on usage. These IT services firstly include all technological components that a workstation (seat) requires, while use of all software components is generally cloudbased. Secondly, all services such as financing, maintenance, dimensioning, and replacement are provided for their use. The central tool is the ALSO Cloud Marketplace. This is a software system that facilitates all functions for invoicing, monitoring, security, and configuration of services. Marketing is primarily usagebased (consumptional).
The software is also offered to partners outside the countries where ALSO operates. This constitutes the Platform-as-a-Service business. see Fig. 07 ALSO shares in its partners' growth through a dynamic service fee, too.

Other services in the Service business include:
Logistics-as-a-Service: supply chain solutions along the complete value chain for providers and buyers.
Sales and Marketing-as-a-Service: Sales activities for providers and traditional and digital marketing for providers, in order to widen their customer base.
IT-as-a-Service generates recurring sales with higher margins than Supply business, while they are also less capital-intensive and highly scalable. However, Supply benefits from the growing customer base and the hardware-based as-a-Service offers, while Solutions business is strengthened by consultancy for the optimal setup.

Digital platforms
ALSO uses digitalization to optimize existing business models and continuously develop new ones.
Optimization of the transactional business model
One focus area in the past few years was the harmonization and continuous optimization of our ERP and the introduction of business intelligence and CRM programs. On this basis, the company developed additional features for electronic data interchange (EDI) and the e-commerce platform. Around 80 percent of orders are now generated via these platforms.
Expansion of the business models with new platforms
ALSO is constantly looking for digital platforms to expand its traditional business. Their attractiveness is based on the following factors:
scalability (sales efficiency, service costs, etc.) customer loyalty (lifecycle, cross-selling potential, etc.) technological expansion potential

These criteria are also applied to the further development of the platforms.
ALSO now offers products and services via its ecosystem on four different platforms:
cloud (ALSO Cloud Marketplace) IoT cybersecurity streaming
Other digital platforms are currently being developed and their products and services are being tested. Platform-as-a-Service has the potential to generate a significant contribution to earnings in the medium term.
ALSO consequently has a service portfolio that combines the strong net sales of transactional business with the loyalty arising from consultancy expertise and the continuity of usage-based offers. At the same time, this gives rise to an important strategic differentiating criterion in competition and enables ALSO to reach markets where it is not present itself.

Our main focus is on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offer that particularly benefits SMB resellers through platforms that are optimally tailored to their needs.

The company uses a wide range of sources and suggestions to develop this business, from discussions with customers to start-up events to market studies by renowned IT research institutes. A step-by-step procedure has been defined for evaluation and introduction. After the possible use of ALSO's ecosystem and monetization options have been analyzed, the technical requirements for the platform are examined. These include:

size-based advantages (economies of scale, further development across different platforms, etc.)
variety of offers (broad portfolio of vendors and product categories, state-of-the-art cybersecurity)
competitive advantages (barriers to entry, compatibility, etc.)

COMPANY MANAGEMENT

From an economic perspective, ALSO aims to maintain a balanced relationship between growth, profitability, and the capital structure, with the aim of generating income for the company's shareholders as sustainably as possible and increasing enterprise value. The harmonized systems introduced in the past few years (ERP (SAP), business intelligence (BI), CRM) allow for continuous online monitoring of all parameters. Data collection is not an end in itself­it is about actively using the data to increase net sales and income. Gathering and analyzing data enables us to:
manage business develop better offers for our customers acquire new customers
The basis for the use of such comprehensive business intelligence tools is the harmonization of the ERP systems. Their introduction is very complex and lengthy, meaning that ALSO has gained a competitive advantage here.
Using ALSO's IT systems, the management can retrieve data on customer satisfaction (NPS) and key financial figures independently at any time. Access rights to BI and NPS are managed on a need-to know basis in line with roles and areas of responsibility.
Customer satisfaction
Scientific studies show that there is a strong correlation between corporate success and the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS measures customer loyalty and helps identify areas where action is needed to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. ALSO uses this key figure because the financial targets set can be achieved only with a loyal and satisfied customer base. The NPS for customers has been measured online continuously since mid2016. If a customer reports a problem, he or she is immediately contacted by a team. The Managing Director of the relevant country manages this process.
Key financial figures
Net sales: Net sales generated is an important figure for measuring the success of activities in a certain market or segment; the development compared to the market and the past is analyzed.

EBITDA: EBITDA is a good indicator of the liquidity generated. Unlike free cash flow, EBITDA is not influenced by changes in net working capital relating to the reporting date. The liquidity generated is an important performance indicator for ALSO, as it is a decisive factor for paying out dividends and financing acquisitions and organic growth.
Net working capital (NWC): The development of receivables, liabilities, and inventories shows the success of measures to improve the capital structure. In addition to absolute figures in euros, the respective cash days (DIO, DPO and DSO) are also measured.
Digital Platform businesses
On top of the financial KPIs additional figures like number of seats, average revenue per account, retention rates or lifetime value have to be tracked for the management of digital platforms. If necessary, these measurements can be adapted to changes in the framework, so topics such as different types of licences, number of employees of end customers, differences in segments (corporate, education, government, non-profit), add-on licences and company/department licences can be taken into account.
Five key drivers
The key figures above are analyzed and optimized for the composition of the following parameters:
buyers providers product categories business models operational excellence (OPEX)
In line with the MORE strategy, we are expanding the existing transactional business while simultaneously developing the Solutions and Service business models. The monthly reporting covers the performance of all three business models and monitoring of their proportional development.

Gross profit: Absolute gross profit is an important indicator of the success of measures to increase profitability.

Sustainable growth (SGR)
ALSO aims to generate sustainable growth. This is monitored and managed on the basis of the sustainable growth rate (SGR). The SGR represents the maximum possible growth in net sales that can be achieved without a deterioration in the financial structure.
When developing new business areas or acquisitions, the impact on this Group key figure is considered. For investors, this means that while the dividend yield remains constant there is no capital dilution, and they can additionally benefit from the increase in value from the targeted growth.
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
The Group aims to ensure that it does not generate profit or growth at the expense of changes in the capital structure. Using the ROCE, the company measures the success of the management of net working capital in relation to generated earnings.
Several of these key figures are continuously made available online and/or in reports.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP

With growth of 16.5percent in net sales to 10.7billioneuros, ALSO significantly outperformed the ICT market (+3.8percent) in the countries where it operates. 52percent of the increase in net sales, or 787millioneuros, was achieved by means of organic growth.
In the Supply area, net sales were up 16.4percent at 8.4billioneuros. The Solutions area grew by 16.0percent to 1.9billioneuros. In the Service area, there was above-average growth of 21.0percent to 0.4billioneuros. Within this business model, business with the cloud platform saw the strongest development. Here, net sales increased by 58percent to 217millioneuros. The total number of seats increased from 2.3 million to 3.8 million, with 1,9 million seats provided by ALSO directly, 1.9 million through Platform-as-a-Service partners. Cloud business thus accounts for almost half of net sales in the Service area. The Logisticsas-a-Service area also recorded an encouraging improvement of 15.0percent. The Sales Service area marked a decline. This was due to steadily declining net sales from the mediation of mobile phone contracts. In Marketing-as-a-Service, the result was increased by 1.7percent.

It is noteworthy that these results were achieved at the same time as structural optimization, optimization of capital employed, investments and acquisitions.
Structural optimization
Up until 2017, we laid the foundations for optimizing our structure with a wide range of measures. Investments to harmonize platforms such as the ERP system (SAP), the customer relationship management software (CRM), the business intelligence platform (BI) and the ALSO web shop allowed the transformation team to implement extensive efficiency measures. In this way, administrative functions such as product management and order entry were optimized and tailored to customer requirements. At the same time, national sales organizations were strengthened and expertise in new product categories, such as 3D printing, security and the Internet of Things (IoT), and the consumptional business was enhanced at centers of competence. The company used these measures to streamline its processes, strengthen its customer focus and simultaneously reduce costs.

Including the effects from IFRS16, EBITDA of around 197millioneuros was generated. On a like-for-like basis, EBITDA climbed by around 20millioneuros or 13percent year-on-year to around 173millioneuros in fiscal year 2019. Encouragingly, the acquisitions in Eastern Europe have already started to contribute to earnings thanks to their rapid integration.
Consolidated net profit improved by 23.6percent to around 100millioneuros (previous year: around 81millioneuros). ALSO exceeded the targets set for 2019. The analysts' consensus expectation of 96.5millioneuros was therefore also exceeded.
As a result of the good cash flow development, ALSO increased its cash holdings by 45.4percent to 349millioneuros (previous year: 240millioneuros). This led to an improvement in net financial debt on a like-for-like basis, i.e. before the effects of IFRS16. It was reduced by 79 percent from 163 million euros to 34 million euros.

With a one-off investment of 12 to 15millioneuros, it was planned to achieve savings of 25 to 30millioneuros per full year starting from the second half of 2019. The one-off investment up to the end of 2019 was within the anticipated range, amounting to 15millioneuros. This will result in a positive financial effect of 45millioneuros on a full-year basis in 2020 as compared to 2017. As of the end of 2019, ALSO had 4 594 employees.
One goal of any structural optimization is to improve overall productivity. This has to be measured using annual average full-time equivalents rather than the number of employees as at the yearend reporting date. In 2019, ALSO employed an annual average of 3 952 full-time equivalents. The ALSO Group's productivity developed as follows:

before the effects of IFRS16 in the amount of 163millioneuros, which was reduced by 79percent to 34millioneuros.

Optimization of capital employed (CE)

Investments and acquisitions
Investments

One focus of activities in 2019 was the optimization of CE. ALSO's business model only requires limited use of fixed assets. Capital employed is therefore dominated by current net working capital (NWC) and this is what optimization measures focus on. NWC is driven firstly by the efficiency of capital employed with regard to receivables, liabilities, and inventories, and secondly by growth in net sales. Growth in the Supply and Solutions business models generally leads to an increased need for NWC.
To measure capital employed from NWC, ALSO uses the key figures of days inventory outstanding (DIO), days sales outstanding (DSO) and days payables outstanding (DPO) or cash days to be financed by ALSO, which is the net amount of DIO+DSO-DPO. To manage NWC, key figures for each provider, buyer, and product category can be called up online at any time (BI). Capital employed is analyzed in relation to the EBITDA generated. This provides a good indicator of the ROCE and reveals any need for action here.
ALSO's potential to optimize NWC varies depending on the key figure. The payment terms agreed with providers and buyers are an important factor. These are generally fixed on a longer-term basis. Improvements have to be achieved by negotiating the framework conditions, or on a short-term basis for individual projects. The mix of providers and buyers and the optimization of scheduling are key drivers in this process.
Measures to optimize NWC should always be evaluated in the context of the value proposition that ALSO makes for providers and buyers. For providers, full availability of their products in the regional markets must always be ensured. Buyers need support with financing their NWC. In the B2B segment in particular, resellers must grant payment terms. We provide support here with appropriate payment terms for the resellers.
Based on the optimization achieved in 2019, DIO in particular was significantly improved year-on-year, specifically by 5 days to 25 days. The ratio of inventories to net sales thus improved from 10.0percent to 8.6percent. Combined with the cash flow generated in 2019 and the effects of the acquisitions, this resulted in an improvement in net financial debt on a like-for-like basis, i.e.

Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to around 11.5millioneuros in 2019 (previous year: 14.2millioneuros), all of which had an impact on the Group's cash flow.
The additions to property, plant and equipment mainly relate to office and operating equipment. In Denmark and Norway, investments were made in new offices, while in Switzerland and the Netherlands warehouses were optimized. Funds were also used for IT leased to customers in the context of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, e.g. for managed print solutions, and for the company's own IT infrastructure.
The additions to intangible assets chiefly relate to investments in digital platforms, including further development of the ALSO Cloud Market Place and the streaming and virtualization platform Ludium. The company also invested in expanding the functions of the web shop and in harmonizing and further developing the ERP systems (SAP and Navision).
In the reporting year 2019, ALSO made investments of around 8.6millioneuros with lease financing. The majority of the investments were for buildings in Denmark, France, and Switzerland.
Acquisitions
The funds used for acquisitions amounted to around 57.4millioneuros in 2019 (previous year 14.6millioneuros) and relate primarily to the purchase price payments for four acquisitions. With the acquisition of ABC Data, ALSO can establish the strongest Eastern European operation for buyers and providers. The company is the IT distributor with the highest coverage of countries in Eastern Europe, operating in six countries there. Together with this acquisition and the additional acquisitions of RECRO in Croatia and Solytron in Bulgaria implemented in 2019, the ALSO subsidiaries in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia form a strong network for addressing the Eastern European market. ALSO is thus represented in 13 Eastern European countries at present.

 Status Report

The aim of this development is to develop a dominant position for ALSO in Eastern Europe. To this end, the companies acquired will first be migrated to the ALSO ERP system before then installing business intelligence, CRM, and web shops. This will form the basis for profitability increases in transactional business (Supply and Solutions). Expansion of the company's market share, the introduction of Solutions business in some countries, the introduction of usage-based business (as-a-Service, Cloud) and the rollout of additional digital platforms for ALSO will form an important basis for the company's future development.

ALSO is still striving to support the ambitious growth targets with value-adding acquisitions. The focus is on acquisitions that enable ALSO to strengthen its Solution and Service activities in addition to its traditional business and that can be scaled up based on the ALSO Group, as well as on acquisitions on European growth markets to expand the ALSO platform. Options on developed European markets where ALSO is not represented are being considered to expand its regional coverage, too.

With the acquisition of the IoT platform specialist AllThingsTalk, ALSO gained an important presence in a dynamic growth market. This company's platform enables machine and sensor data to be recorded, aggregated, visualized, and analyzed. Using these data, manufacturers, network providers, ISVs, system integrators, and resellers can offer companies from a range of industrial sectors customized solutions for their IoT projects.

EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY

Employees
Ultimately it is the employees, with their knowledge, commitment, efficiency and adaptability, who make the company successful. As a result of digital change, new possibilities are emerging for our employees to contribute to shaping their work. We offer our employees continuous further training to meet the company's requirements. We also achieve this by means of continuous monitoring and indirect training for our managers. In turn, they motivate talented employees so that we can create a flexible, dynamic organization that reacts in a rapid and agile way to the requirements of the constantly changing market.
At the start of 2019, the activities of the HR departments, previously organized on an entirely local basis, were harmonized by creating an HR center of competence with Group-wide responsibility. Local HR business partners in the two regions of Central Europe and Northern and Eastern Europe report to regional HR managers, who also have specialist responsibility for the areas of Compensation & Benefits and HR Central Services respectively and in turn report to an HR manager with Group-wide responsibility.

The age structure of our employees is balanced and displays a good mixture between highly qualified employees, internationally experienced managers, and young talents.

The international alignment of the center of competence allows for key HR processes to be harmonized. The challenges of increasing work in international teams can be met with regard to a more comparable compensation system and performance evaluation. In Professional Development, continuous further training of employees is ensured by the ALSO Academy, which includes internal and external training components. International dialog, high-potential programs, and partnerships with universities in various companies round off the training program.

In addition to the interesting sector in which we work, our employees value in particular the innovative strength of the company. The personal work environment and the tasks assigned to them are also seen in a positive light by employees. With the web-based Performance Appraisal Tool, the performance of around 200 managers is systematically evaluated twice a year. It also reveals any necessary training measures.

Environmental commitment

Improved efficiency in the use of energy

The responsible use of resources is an element that is firmly integrated in our business processes. This involves making it possible to quantify, and thus also to control and manage our environmental efforts. We are currently focusing on three main points throughout the company: Increasing efficiency in the areas of electricity, heating and reducing waste. We also examine our future investments from this perspective.
The following countries currently form the basis for collecting our sustainability figures: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and, for the first time in 2019, Croatia, Slovenia and Poland. The objective for 2020 is to include the companies added this year in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Hungary when collecting the figures.

We understand improved efficiency to involve reducing the consumption of electricity and fossil fuels by optimizing the heating and lighting concepts of all buildings as well as installing building insulation, which we are also undertaking in some properties that are not actually owned by the company.
On a like-for-like basis, consumption in absolute terms in kWh p.a. and CO2/kg was reduced again in comparison to the previous year. As a result of adding Croatia, Slovenia, and Poland when collecting the figures, consumption in absolute terms in kWh p.a. and CO2/kg increased year-on-year.

By separating waste consistently and efficiently, we keep the proportion of recyclable packaging components at the warehouse facilities at a high level and thus minimize non-recyclable waste throughout the Group. In addition, more detailed separation of the materials is implemented.

In addition, campaigns dedicated to promoting environmental protection and sustainability have been initiated by employees in Germany and Switzerland, for example. All employees are thus given the opportunity to suggest improvements and thereby make a personal contribution to environmental issues.

Sustainability in the supply chain
The ALSO Group has set itself the target of continually improving its CO2 footprint, and in this process the entire supply chain from manufacturer to customer is investigated to see whether there are any possibilities for improvements.
In 2019, various projects were implemented that contributed to reduce CO2 emissions in the Group. The following individual initiatives are presented by way of example here:
As part of the ALSO Group's transformation, electronic signature technology and digital transaction management services were increasingly used for the electronic exchange of signed documents. This saved around 19 metric tons of wood, 428 388 liters of water, and 43 metric tons of CO2.

Other projects are planned for 2020 which will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions in the Group. To take one example, a complete switch to green electricity is planned at various warehouse facilities in Germany.
Social commitment
In countries such as Belgium and Serbia, ALSO is working on a number of projects relating to local communities and data exchange. For example, we support "Smart Citizen" organizations and schools, helping them set up their own networks for monitoring air quality. ALSO provides them with low-cost measuring stations and the necessary hardware and software for data exchange.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Organization and process
The Board of Directors appoints an Audit Committee that is generally made up of three non-executive members of the Board of Directors. It manages and reviews internal and external auditing and assesses the risks identified and the measures taken for risk management purposes.
At ALSO, the organization of the risk management is the responsibility of Internal Audit. The principles of the risk management system are defined in the risk management manual of the ALSO Group. Risks are identified on the basis of analytical studies or by way of reports.
A defined group of risk officers (e.g. Group Management, Senior Vice Presidents, Chief Customer Officers, Center of Competence Heads, employees with functional responsibility) identify and assess risks and report them to Internal Audit. Employees can also report identified risks to Internal Audit.
To identify risks, Internal Audit uses modern technology-based tools for analytical studies, which increase objectivity, effectiveness, and efficiency:
Data analytics: Data analytics in individual internal audits and also in the context of continuous auditing activity.

The data analyses are programmed by the Internal Audit department itself, specifically in relation to high-risk issues. Here, Internal Audit greatly benefits from a harmonized ERP system with which Group-wide analyses and examinations are implemented.
Process mining: Identification and analysis of actual processes on the basis of digital data. A standard tool is used for this.
Robotic process automation: Automation of audit activities and support with repetitive tasks.
Internal Audit prepares an annual report for the Audit Committee that contains a summary of the individual risks, and also provides information at short notice when necessary. The Board of Directors is also informed about the risk structure on an annual basis. The individual risks are assessed in terms of their possible effect on profits or liquidity (low to destructive) and their probability of occurrence (low to very high). The classification of the possible effect is determined as a function of the consolidated net profit of the ALSO Group, and an annual review is carried out to assess whether it is necessary to revise the classification. Based on the possible effect as well as the probability of occurrence, the risks are broken down into the categories orange, beige, petrol, and green. see Fig. 09

External risks

Risk related to deposits

Trade wars
Political developments in recent years have resulted in potential risks in relationships with providers. Increased protectionist and nationalist tendencies could lead to tensions in business relationships with them. In recent years, ALSO has selectively expanded its portfolio of providers in order to reduce such risks. The tariff disputes between the USA and China resulting from nationalist developments could also be an opportunity for European IT companies.
Now that the United Kingdom has left the EU as of January 31, 2020, the risk of a "hard Brexit" seems lower than before. However, the consequences both for the capital market and the future development of London as a stock exchange center and also for the strength of the euro and the euro area are difficult to predict. In any event, the United Kingdom will remain an important market.
Cyberattacks
Cyberattacks are malicious attacks on computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data. Targeted attacks (espionage, sabotage, phishing) or attacks on critical infrastructure could have serious consequences for ALSO. The Cybersecurity department therefore conducts regular information security risks assessments and penetration tests of the business-critical IT systems and processes and also reports on these to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. The risks are systematically mitigated using controls and code of practices defined in ISO 27001/ ISO 27002 standards. New technologies deployed to increase protection level. Business critical IT systems have backup and recovery plan in place with recovery time and recovery point objectives.

ALSO is exposed to a default risk arising from its financing activities. In the financial area, ALSO manages the resulting risk position by the diversification of financial institutions and by verification of the financial strength of each counterparty based on publicly available ratings, as well as on publicly available ad-hoc information from the financial institutions. As a result, ALSO is generally able to keep the credit risks to a minimum. Some larger receivables from financial institutions arise in particular in the factoring area. No losses on receivables have occurred during the long-standing business relationships with the factoring companies. The risk of loss on receivables from factoring partners is not insured with credit insurances. The default risk of loss is minimized by ALSO through regular evaluation of the factoring partners.
Interest rate risks
ALSO's interest rate risks relate mainly to current financial liabilities with variable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations cause changes in the interest income and expense of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities. ALSO is particularly exposed to interest rate risks in euros, Swiss francs, Danish kroner and Polish zloty. The interest rate management is handled centrally. Short-term interest rate risks are partially hedged, a material part of interest bearing-liabilities hence remaining exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Taking into account the existing and planned debt structure, interest derivatives are used if necessary to meet the bandwidths recommended by central Group treasury and prescribed by management. Since ALSO uses fixed as well as variable interest-bearing instruments, interest risks may result from an increase as well as a decrease in market interest rates.

Exchange rate risks

Buyers

A material part of the cash flows of the operational companies occurs in currencies which are not the functional currencies of those subsidiaries. ALSO is therefore exposed to foreign currency risks. ALSO aims to keep the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its earnings neutral through the process of buying and selling items. Foreign currency risks are only hedged if they affect the cash flow of the Group. Exchange rate risks that arise in the consolidated financial statements through the translation of income statement and statements of financial position of subsidiaries are not hedged. In the purchasing area at foreign subsidiaries, a certain amount is conducted in foreign currencies, especially euros (where it is not the functional currency) and in US dollars. To hedge this exchange rate risk, Central Treasury hedges the purchasing volumes of the operating companies outside their functional currency. Group-internal loans between subsidiaries with different functional currencies give rise to foreign currency risks. ALSO hedges most of these risks. Speculative borrowing or lending in foreign currencies is not permitted. Transaction-related foreign currency risks are also monitored and the corresponding net exposures in the various currencies are calculated. By regular use of forward contracts, ALSO constantly reduces the exchange rate risk.

On the buyer side, risks can arise from the dependence on several large customers. In 2019, net sales with the largest individual customer totaled 1 312millioneuros. By carrying out measures continuously in the area of SMB customers, diversification increases the number of customers and thus reduces the risks.
In its operating business, ALSO is exposed to default risks in customer receivables. A credit check is performed on the customer as early as the quotation phase in order to limit the risk of losses on receivables. Default risks are additionally limited by active receivables management. Active customer monitoring, balance sheet analyses, disclosures, insurance rating, and factoring programs are some of the important measures carried out here. A considerable proportion of the receivables are hedged by commercial credit insurance.
Information technology
Information security, IT availability and performance are key prerequisites for successful entrepreneurial activity. IT systems are constantly being monitored and optimized. Hybrid Cloud IT architecture enables fast provisioning of IT capacity to meet new demands.

Internal risks

Logistics and storage

Providers
ALSO works with the major vendors of hardware and software especially in the Supply business field. This results in concentration risks and dependencies. The company counters these with active market share management as part of the provider mix key driver. On the ICT market, product innovations are constantly monitored so that the company can get involved in fields with high potential at an early stage.
Large receivables from providers regularly arise as a result of various programs designed to support sales promotion activities (including marketing programs, bonuses, sales discounts, price protection, for example). Complete documentation of the basis of claim is required at all times in order to enforce these claims. ALSO counters the risk with a permanent and efficient process organization for the relevant business transactions.

The business model of ALSO depends to a high degree on the availability of efficient, discrete logistics structures, the security of the stock on hand, and high-performance and cost-effective external logistics partners. The logistics structures are vulnerable to traditional risks of failure, such as fire, flood and theft, as well as risks that prices for transport and the rent for warehouse facilities will change. There are also risks associated with the competitiveness of our logistics structures. There is currently a risk here in a warehouse in the Northern/Eastern Europe market segment. This is to be address with a new concept.
The inventory held by ALSO is subject to depreciation risks as a result of the relatively short product lifecycles of IT products. ALSO counters this risk through dedicated, demand-based scheduling of the inventory with the aim of generating higher availability and corresponding inventory turnover times as well as through appropriate rights contained in the agreements with providers (price protection, stock protection, or stock rotation).

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Status Report

With monthly reports and BI reports available online at all times, those involved have transparent and detailed information on the age structure and value of inventories for each product category, manufacturer, and SKU (stock-keeping unit).
Personnel
The further development of ALSO depends materially on the knowledge and dedication of its employees. ALSO concerns itself with personnel risks and works with systematic staff planning and qualification in order to deploy, promote and retain employees in line with their abilities. Furthermore, active monitoring of employee satisfaction is carried out. The development of our personnel and managers is an important condition for proactively and reliably ensuring our human resources capacities. Despite all our efforts, a shortage of specialists remains a challenge. The in-house possibilities for professional development will therefore continue to be strengthened in order to train our own personnel optimally in the medium and long term and thus counteract the skills shortage. Bottlenecks in the recruitment of appropriately certified employees exist in particular in the Group companies focusing on the Solutions business field. To reach a wide range of new potential employees, specialized recruiters seek out suitable talented candidates for ALSO's growth areas on the international job market based on uniform sets of requirements. Social media instruments are also used for recruitment purposes.
Legal
As a Group with international operations, ALSO has to comply with numerous legal and fiscal regulations as well as regulations under antitrust and patent law. The large number of relevant provisions at the local and international levels and their increasing complexity increase the risk that ALSO may incur significant legal and economic risks, such as fines and claims for compensation, in the event that it fails to comply with them. Identified legal risks are reported in the context of risk management.
Current and impending legal disputes are continuously identified, analyzed, and evaluated in terms of their legal and financial effects and taken into appropriate consideration in the ongoing risk management process.

Compliance
Legal and ethical conduct of the employees in day-to-day business is ensured by way of a compliance management system. This establishes binding compliance regulations for the entire ALSO Group, helps prevent violations, monitors compliance, and sanctions violations.
The central document is the Code of Conduct, which is binding for all employees and managers at all levels of the Group. For the highest-risk compliance issues, there are Group guidelines based on the Code of Conduct that specifically regulate the issue in detail and in relation to typical matters in the ALSO Group's business as a technology provider. This particularly includes topics such as antitrust and competition law, dealing with gifts and invitations, and avoiding conflicts of interest.
The Compliance organization is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CEO and the Audit Committee. The Chief Compliance Officer is assisted by four Regional Compliance Officers, who in turn coordinate the work of the Local Compliance Officers in each national organization. A Compliance Ombudsman is also available as an independent external contact for employees and third parties to report violations of the ALSO Code of Conduct, particularly criminal offenses or anticompetitive agreements. The Ombudsman also carries out spot checks of compliance at ALSO's national companies. As a lawyer, the Ombudsman has a professional duty of confidentiality and follows up tip-offs anonymously if desired. Before an acquisition, the Ombudsman checks that the respective company's conduct is compliant.
The compliance management program includes comprehensive training for all employees. It starts with uniform basic training throughout the Group for all new employees who join ALSO. This training is based on ALSO's typical business requirements and is held in the local languages of all ALSO companies. It is mandatory for all employees except logistics and temporary employees and must be successfully completed within four weeks of joining the company. This basic training is supplemented by another two mandatory training courses to refresh and build on the first one; these must both be completed within another four weeks. The information learned is tested using an e-learning platform.

The Group's managers are required to submit a declaration of commitment once a quarter that reminds them of the existing compliance obligations and includes a statement on potential compliance-related issues from the past quarter.

Data protection

Tax risks

To ensure compliance with the applicable data protection regulations, particularly the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the related national data protection laws, ALSO has created a data protection organization consisting of a Chief Data Protection Officer at Group level and Local Data Protection Officers at all national companies. Based on a Group data protection guideline, ALSO's business processes in all business areas are geared toward principles such as fairness, lawfulness, purpose limitation, transparency, and data economy, and are reviewed in regular internal data protection audits. Mandatory data protection training followed by a test is provided to all employees once a year.

ALSO's operations are heavily networked and carried out across different locations. The accompanying service relationships contain the risk that the underlying transfer prices will not be recognized for tax purposes. In order to limit this risk, ALSO has worked with specialist tax consultants to design the transfer pricing concept and has the underlying transfer pricing documentation audited at regular intervals. ALSO has some tax loss carry-forwards. There is a risk that these loss carry-forwards will not be used and will lapse as a result of time or other restrictions.

Liquidity risks

One of the central tasks of ALSO is to guarantee the Group's solvency at all times by providing sufficient funds when necessary as well as by ensuring the profitability through management of the financial risks. The central liquidity risk management system ensures that the Group is always in a position to fulfill its payment obligations promptly. ALSO continuously monitors its liquidity with a detailed cash flow plan on a daily basis. Extensive planning ensures furthermore that sufficient liquidity is available in the medium and long term. In the area of financing, ALSO uses a wide variety of financial institutions in order to reduce any dependency on individual banks. ALSO was always able to fulfill all financial obligations also in fiscal year 2019.

OUTLOOK

 Status Report

General conditions

Outlook for ALSO

Constant innovation of hardware, software, and services is the DNA of the IT industry. From a technological perspective, the 2020s will be the decade in which a number of digital technologies that started to be developed in the 2010s will experience a breakthrough. Artificial intelligence will play an increasingly important role, radically changing almost all aspects of our lives. Efficient networks and streaming platforms are key to the further rollout of Industry 4.0 and smart factories. This is inextricably linked with the issue of cybersecurity; secure data exchange is a prerequisite for these and other technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The degree of automation will increase significantly, with cobots (collaborative robots) and humans working together on projects. Blockchain could be relevant, if all elements are used extensively. Like AI in the past decade, quantum computing may not yet experience a complete breakthrough due to the high degree of complexity, but its importance will increase. Virtual and augmented reality will increasingly be used. Their potential applications and the associated monetization opportunities for technology providers are almost limitless.
As we already predicted a few years ago, the number of nationalist forces has increased further, entailing a risk of trade wars. This risk has currently eased somewhat, at least in the short term. For example, the USA and China are negotiating a partial solution to the trade conflict that has lasted more than a year now. At the same time, the provisional agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom has reduced the probability of a no-deal Brexit. However, a renewed escalation cannot be ruled out either in international trade policy or in the relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom. For companies that have recognized these developments at an early stage and balanced their structures and business accordingly, this uncertainty may give rise to opportunities.

In this environment, ALSO will press ahead with the development of the business models with the ALSO ecosystem in line with the MORE strategy and continuously optimize these using the five key drivers. Based on its demonstrated ability to adapt and implement, the company will focus on the following five topics.
1. Market share: We will expand our market share of traditional business, primarily in countries where we do not have a dominant position. This particularly relates to Sweden, France, Austria, the Netherlands and some Eastern European countries.
2. Business models: Maintenance and strengthening of Supply business with a broad vendor portfolio based on continuous technological innovation and further expansion of our customer base. Further growth of Solutions and Service. We expect the main route to market to be a hybrid solution combining transactional and consumptional (usage-based) business.
3. New platforms: IoT, cybersecurity, and streaming will make an important contribution to profitability. Particularly through the scalability of these business sectors, the company is opening doors to new areas and thus also driving the growth of ALSO's business models.
4. Integration: The integration of the acquisitions implemented will make a significant contribution to the company's profitability in the medium term. A key factor here is their integration in the harmonized Group-wide platforms for ERP, BI, CRM, web shop, and cloud.
5. Acquisitions: Expansion of our market share in regions where we are not yet represented and strengthening of our technological expertise. The aim is to finance acquisitions with our own funds as far as possible. In addition to continuous NWC optimization, the revolving credit facility gives us additional leeway for opportunities that arise.

New technologies constantly offer new opportunities for our business. In combination with the velocity of response and strength of implementation of the employees we see excellent potential for growth. Hence, ALSO Group has increased its midterm target for EBITDA to a range of 250 to 310 million euros. Expectations for the ROCE are 13 to 14 percent.

3.6 Information and control instruments vis-à-vis Group Management
The Board of Directors and its committees periodically receive information in the form of Group reports relevant to their needs. These reports are also discussed in depth at regular meetings that take place with the committees involved.
The Board of Directors supervises Group Management and uses reporting and controlling processes to monitor its operating methods. The ALSO Group has available a comprehensive electronic management information system (MIS).
As part of the MIS, the Board of Directors receives a monthly report discussing net sales, net profit, the consolidated statement of cash flows, net working capital, the financing structure, and exchange rate risks, among other things. This information is broken down by segment and compared with the approved budget and the prior-year figures.
At each of its meetings, the Board of Directors is informed by the CEO, or by another member of Group Management, of the current business and significant events. At these meetings, members of the Board of Directors may ask other members of the Board of Directors or the CEO to provide information about the ALSO Group that they require in order to carry out their duties. All members of the Board of Directors are notified immediately of any exceptional occurrences.
The Internal Audit, compliance officers, and auditing bodies assist the Board of Directors in carrying out its controlling and supervisory duties. In addition, the BC and the Audit Committee monitor the performance of Group Management within the scope of their duties pursuant to section 3.4.2.1 and 3.4.2.2 of this report. The scope of this remit is agreed with the Board of Directors of ALSO Holding AG.
ALSO pursues a coordinated and systematic approach to risk management and controlling in order to identify and evaluate risks affecting the Group as a whole and individual Group companies. Operational risks, market risks, financial risks, tax risks, and other risks are recorded separately and classified in terms of their probability of occurrence and potential impact. Based on the resulting risk matrix, Group Management develops a catalog of suitable measures for preventing and/or mitigating potential losses. The risk matrix is regularly presented to the Audit Committee and subsequently to the Board of Directors for assessment and approval, and the implementation of the measures is monitored.

In addition, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is supported by the ALSO Group Internal Audit. The Internal Audit has an unrestricted right to demand information and examine the records of all Group companies and departments. In addition, after consultation with the Audit Committee, Group Management may ask the Internal Audit to carry out special investigations above and beyond its usual remit. The annual plan for internal audit is approved by the Audit Committee. The Head of Internal Audit submits a report to the Audit Committee at half-yearly intervals. The Audit Committee discusses this with the Head of Internal Audit and takes any necessary measures or proposes them to the Board of Directors for approval. The head of Internal Audit attended two Audit Committee meetings in the year under review.
3.7 Measures in accordance with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance
At ALSO, the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO are held conjointly. The balance of influence between the Board of Directors and Group Management is safeguarded by three committees that have been established, of which the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not a member, and the membership of representatives of the main shareholder. In 2015, the Lead Director concept was introduced as part of an amendment of the Organizational Regulations. In particular, the Lead Director is responsible for heading the meetings of the Board of Directors ­ possibly only for single items of the agenda ­ in the event that the Chairman experiences a conflict of interests. He can convene meetings independently. The Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, Walter P.J. Droege, serves as the Lead Director.
Currently all members of the Board of Directors are men. Should vacancies occur, the Board of Directors will consider filling them with female members.
The Board of Directors conducts regularly a self-evaluation of its working methods and efficiency.

 Compensation Report

COMPENSATION REPORT

This Compensation Report contains information on the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and Group Management. The report was prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance Against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies (VegüV). It satisfies the requirements of SIX Swiss Exchange for information on corporate governance and the standards stipulated in the "Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance" of economiesuisse.

3.2 Group Management
The members of Group Management receive compensation consisting of fixed and performance-related (variable) components. Statutory rules regarding the principles of the performance-related (variable) components can be found in Art. 23 Paragraph 3 of the Articles of Association www.also.com/goto/ articlesofassociation.

This Compensation Report will be presented to the next Annual General Meeting of ALSO Holding AG, which will be held on March24, 2020, for a consultative vote.
1. Principles
The success of the ALSO Group depends largely on the qualifications and commitment of its employees. The purpose of the Group's compensation policy is to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. It is also intended to bring management interests in line with those of ALSO and its shareholders.
The compensation system is designed so that the compensation is performance-based and market-driven, and so that entrepreneurial thinking and action are encouraged. Compensation decisions should be fair, transparent and therefore understandable for the persons concerned.
2. Changes in the reporting year
Karl Hofstetter, a former member of the Board of Directors, did not stand for re-election and left the Board of Directors as of the date of the Annual General Meeting, March29, 2019.
3. Compensation system
3.1 Board of Directors
The members of the Board of Directors receive a fixed fee for their activities and no performance-related payment.
The chairmen and members of committees of the Board of Directors receive an additional fixed fee for these functions.

The fixed components consist of a monthly salary and, from caseby-case, a flat-rate vehicle allowance, a company car, or flat-rate representation expenses. Certain fringe benefits may also be paid. The variable compensation depends on the business success and is paid in the form of a cash bonus. Variable compensation includes a short-term and a long-term component and breaks down as follows:
 S hort-term variable compensation: For the CEO and CFO, short-term variable compensation depends entirely on the combined target values of EBT and EBITDA that are defined by the Board of Directors. If the targets are attained, the bonus is calculated according to a progressively increasing percentage of the attained EBT, which is defined in advance by the Board of Directors. For the other members of Group Management, the bonus was calculated as a fixed percentage of the attained EBT, which was defined in advance by the Board of Directors.
 L ong-term variable compensation: A long-term incentive applies to members of Group Management whose contribution has a material influence on the long-term development of the Group. The long-term incentive was agreed with the members of Group Management at the time in 2011. It is designed so that a one-time special premium is paid if long-term financial targets that are defined by the Board of Directors are attained in two successive years. The payment is only made on condition that the recipient is actually employed by the ALSO Group on the date when the payment is made.
In the case of exceptional non-recurring events (e.g. acquisitions) that are not the responsibility of Group Management, the Board of Directors may, at its own discretion, adjust the parameters on which the calculation of variable compensation is based.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

4.1 Compensation and Nomination Committee

The Annual General Meeting can subsequently increase the compensation already approved at any time.
If the Annual General Meeting refuses its approval, the Board of Directors can submit new proposals at the same general meeting or a new general meeting yet to be convened.
The additional amount for the hiring of new members of Group Management after approval by the Annual General Meeting is 30percent of the total compensation approved for the respective period per new member. Approval of this additional compensation by the Annual General Meeting is not required.

The Compensation and Nomination Committee prepares all relevant decisions of the Board of Directors relating to the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and Group Management, and submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the type and amount of the annual compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and Group Management, as well as their fringe benefits and the stipulations of their employment contracts.
The Compensation and Nomination Committee can also make proposals to the Board of Directors for amendments to the compensation system.
4.2 Board of Directors
Under and subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting, the definitive compensation is determined by the Board of Directors. As a rule, the effective bonus is determined at the proposal of the Compensation and Nomination Committee in the first quarter of the following year.

Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting on the compensation report 2019

We have audited the compensation report of ALSO Holding AG (paragraphs 5. to 9. on pages 50 to 55) for the year ended 31 December 2019.

Board of Directors' responsibility

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and overall fair presentation of the compensation report in accordance with Swiss law and the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Stock Exchange Listed Companies (Ordinance). The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the accompanying compensation report. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the compensation report complies with Swiss law and articles 14­16 of the Ordinance.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence on the disclosures made in the compensation report with regard to compensation, loans and credits in accordance with articles 14­16 of the Ordinance. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements in the compensation report, whether due to fraud or error. This audit also includes evaluating the reasonableness of the methods applied to value components of compensation, as well as assessing the overall presentation of the compensation report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the compensation report of ALSO Holding AG for the year ended 31 December 2019 complies with Swiss law and articles 14­16 of the Ordinance.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Corporate information
The basis of ALSO's business models are the two customer categories "providers" and "buyers". The ALSO Group has a portfolio of more than 660 providers in the ICT product categories of hardware, software, and IT services, including all global market leaders. We offer the providers access to a broad spectrum of buyers, who can call up further customized services in the logistics, finance, IT, and digital services sectors, as well as traditional distribution services. ALSO offers services along the entire value chain from a single source.
On the basis of a European B2B marketplace, the customers are enabled to sustainably shape and develop their businesses.
2. Accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
The ALSO Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as well as the accounting and measurement principles described below. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the assumption of a going concern. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value. The financial statements are available in German and English, of which the German version is binding.
These consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2019 of ALSO Holding AG, Meierhofstrasse 5, CH-6032 Emmen inclusive all of its directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries are presented in EUR (reporting currency), since the majority of revenues are generated in the euro area. For clarity, all values are presented in thousands of euros (TEUR).

2.2 Significant changes in the accounting and measurement principles
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous fiscal year except for those new and amended standards and interpretations effective from January1, 2019, which are listed below. A description of the changes and their impact on the consolidated financial statements is provided below if they materially affect the financial position, performance, or cash flow situation of ALSO:
IFRS16 Leases IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amend-
ments to IFRS9) Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amend-
ments to IAS28) Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments
to IAS19) Remeasurement of Previously Held Interest (Amendments to
IFRS3 and IFRS11) Income Tax Consequences of Dividends (Amendments to
IAS12) Borrowing Costs Eligible for Capitalization (Amendments to
IAS23)
Adoption of IFRS16 Leases
Since January1, 2019, ALSO applied IFRS16 for the first time. This standard supersedes IAS17 and the corresponding interpretations and clarifications. The main effect on ALSO is that IFRS16 introduces a single lessee accounting model to recognize assets and liabilities for almost all leases. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. Therefore, the transition did not have an impact for leases where ALSO is the lessor.
The initial application is carried out by the modified retrospective approach, which means, the comparative amounts will not be restated. Right-of-use assets are measured at their historical carrying amount less depreciation as if the new rules had always been applied. Lease liabilities reflect the net present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of January1, 2019, which weighted average was 1.71%.

64

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

ALSO has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:
The exclusion of initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application
The use of hindsight in determining the lease term if the contact contains options to extend or terminate the lease
ALSO uses the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value.
The following table shows the initial recognition of leases as of January1, 2019 according to the new standard.

The capitalized right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities in short-/long-term financial liabilities.

The future payments for operating leases disclosed as at December31, 2018 were recognized in the balance sheet as at January1, 2019 as follows:

EUR1000
Operating lease commitments disclosed as at December 31, 2018 Discounting lease liabilities using ALSO's incremental borrowing rate Finance lease liabilities recognised as at 31 December 2018 Low-value and short-term leases which are not recognised In previous year disclosed lease commitments with a commencement date in 2019 Adjustments as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options Lease liability recognised as at January 1, 2019 OF WHICH ARE: Due in 1st year Due in 2nd to 5th year Due from the 6th year onwards

5 919 ­123 ­2 227 10 729 126 555
23 767 74 284 28 504

The application of IFRS16 did not have a material effect on the net profit, as operating lease expenses are replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest payments. However, this results in a reduction in other operating expenses with an increase in depreciation/amortization and financial expenses. As a result, EBITDA increased by TEUR23951 and EBIT by TEUR1899. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flow from operating activities increased by TEUR23140 and cash flow from financing activities was lower by this amount, because the repayment component from leases is reported as cash flow from financing activities. The cash flow allocated to the interest on the lease liability continues to be presented under cash flow from operating activities. Overall, these changes exclusively represent shifts within the cash flow.

The new and the old accounting policy is described in Note 2.19.

65

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

Adoption of other changes

Vendor bonuses

None of the other changes have any material effect on the financial position, performance, or cash flow situation of ALSO.
2.3 Published standards, interpretations, and amendments not yet applied
The following standards, interpretations, and amendments which have been issued but not yet applied by ALSO are being constantly analyzed by ALSO for their impact on the consolidated financial statements:
Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRSStandards ­ effective January1, 2020
Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS3) ­ effective January1, 2020
Definition of Materiality (Amendments to IAS1 and IAS8) ­ effective January1, 2020
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS9, IAS39 and IFRS7) ­ effective January1, 2020
From today's perspective, the application of these changes will not have any material effects on the financial position, per formance, or cash flow situation of ALSO. ALSO applies the changes for the first time as from the fiscal year following the date stated in the standard.

The accruals of vendor receivables for bonuses contain estimates which are based on various factors such as sales volumes, quantities, stock levels, and other qualitative and quantitative targets. The amount recognized for the bonuses depends mainly on the attainment of the agreed targets. The bonus models vary between the vendors.
Impairment of goodwill
ALSO tests the capitalized goodwill at least once per year for impairment. This requires an assessment of the value in use of an underlying cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. The estimates of factors such as volumes, sales prices, sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses and investments, market conditions, balance sheet structure, and other economic factors, as well as parameters (e.g. discount rates) derived from external data, are based on assumptions that management considers reasonable see Note 5.7.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are determined on the basis of estimates. The forecasts that are made for this purpose cover a timeframe of several years and include interpretations of existing tax laws and ordinances as well as changes in tax rates see Note 4.6.

2.4 Key assumptions and estimates

Sale of trade receivables

Preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRSrequires management to make certain assumptions and estimates which influence the figures presented in this report. The necessary analyses and assessments are continuously reviewed and modified if necessary. However, the actual results may differ from these estimates. The main items whose amount and presentation materially depend on assumptions and estimates are as follows:

In various countries, ALSO sells trade receivables to independent factoring companies. The assessment of whether the contractual arrangements of the factoring programs result in a significant transfer of risk, and the associated derecognition of the receivables, has a significant influence on the balance sheet of ALSO see Note 6.8.
Employee benefits

In various countries there are defined benefit plans. The defined benefit liability is based partly on long-term actuarial assumptions which may differ from actual future developments. Determination of the discount rate, the future development of salaries and pensions, and life expectancy are important components of the actuarial measurement.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

2.5 Scope of consolidation

Changes in 2019

These consolidated financial statements include the annual financial statements as of December 31 of ALSO Holding AG and of the companies over which ALSO has control. ALSO controls a subsidiary when ALSO is exposed to the risks of the entity, has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity, and can affect these returns through exercise of its power over the entity. By this definition, ALSO controls SINAS Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. Vermietungs-KG, even though less than half of its voting shares are owned by ALSO. With the opening of insolvency proceedings under self-administration, ALSO lost control of ALSO Logistics Services GmbH in 2015. Nevertheless, as a member of the Creditor Committee, ALSO exercises significant influence on ALSO Logistics Services GmbH. Furthermore, ALSO owns 9.9% of the voting rights of ALSO Financial Services GmbH. ALSO exercises significant influence on the entity and accounts for ALSO Financial Services GmbH using the equity method.
With the opening of insolvency proceedings under self-administration, ALSO lost control of ALSO Digital Holding B.V. in liquidation on Mai 15, 2018. ALSO Digital Holding B.V. in liquidation is under the management of the insolvency administrator. ALSO is not authorized to issue instructions to the insolvency administrator. Despite holding 51% of the voting rights in ALSO Digital Holding B.V. in liquidation, ALSO therefore has no control over this company. Its 100% subsidiary ALSO Digital B.V. was sold in 2019 in course of liquidation. A gain of TEUR176 resulted in 2018 from the deconsolidation of ALSO Digital Holding B.V. in liquidation. It is composed of impairment on loans, effects of deconsolidation and accruals for expected costs.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to ALSO and deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Group companies are listed in Note 6.5.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

2.6 Consolidation method
The consolidated financial statements are based on the financial statements of the individual Group companies, which are prepared using consistent accounting and measurement policies throughout the Group.
Assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses, are included at their full amounts, and non-controlling interests in equity and net profit are shown separately.
All intragroup transactions (expenses, income, assets, and liabilities), as well as material unrealized gains from intragroup sales of assets which have not yet been sold to third parties, are eliminated.
2.7 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. If the consideration transferred for the acquisition of an entity exceeds the underlying fair value of the identifiable net assets that are acquired, the excess represents goodwill. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit, or generate future cash flows, from the combination. The goodwill is recognized in the cash-generating unit's functional currency.
Acquisition costs are recognized as expense and reported as other operating expenses.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interests in the acquired entity either at fair value or in proportion to the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. Contingent liabilities that are acquired through the acquisition, and whose fair value can be reliably determined, are recognized in the acquisition balance sheet as liabilities at their fair value.
The results of the acquired companies are recognized from the date on which the Group obtains control. When an entity leaves the scope of the consolidation, the difference between the consideration received and the net assets plus accumulated foreign exchange differences at the date on which the Group loses control of the entity is recognized in the financial result.
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at each acquisition date and a resulting gain or loss relating to the previously held equity interest is recognized through profit or loss.

If the Group undertakes a business combination with put options that are held by shareholders of non-controlling interests and does not thereby obtain ownership, the non-controlling interests continue to be allocated a share in the profits. At the end of each reporting period, the allocation is recognized as a financial liability as if the acquisition had taken place at this date. Any excess over the reclassified amount, and all changes in the present value of the financial liability, are recognized in retained earnings.
A change in the ownership interest in a subsidiary without loss of control is recognized as an equity transaction.
2.8 Investments in associates
Entities over which ALSO has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. ALSO is generally considered to have significant influence if it holds an interest of between 20% and 50% in an entity. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost. In subsequent measurements, the carrying amount is increased by the share in profits of the entity and reduced by its share in losses and by dividend payments received from the entity. If the share in losses of the entity equal or exceed its carrying amount, ALSO ceases to recognize its share in losses. Provisions are recognized for any further share in losses if ALSO has a legal or constructive obligation.
The book value of investments in associates consists of the share in net assets and goodwill.
At each reporting date, ALSO tests for objective indications of impairment. Any impairment loss is recognized through profit or loss.
2.9 Translation of foreign currency
Each entity of the Group determines its own functional currency. The functional currency of the Group companies is the normal currency of their local economic environment. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at the spot rate that applies at the date of the transaction. All exchange gains and losses arising on transactions in foreign currencies, or on translation of monetary assets, are recognized in profit or loss.
Exchange gains on certain loans with equity-like nature are recognized in other comprehensive income provided that repayment of the loan is not planned or intended in the near future. Such exchange gains are recognized in other comprehensive income and only reclassified to the financial result upon loss of control of the entity or repayment of the loan.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

The annual financial statements of the foreign operations that have a functional currency different from the Group reporting currency are translated into the Group reporting currency (EUR) as follows:

statement of financial position at year-end rates; income statement and statement of comprehensive income at
average annual rates; statement of cash flows at average annual rates.

Exchange differences arising on the translation of financial statements of entities whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized in other comprehensive income and on eventual loss of control of the subsidiary are reclassified to the financial result.

Both for the traditional transactional business models and for trading business with products that form part of comprehensive solutions, there is only a short interval between concluding the contract and performing the service/recognizing net sales. Services performed for customers on the basis of service contracts are of a transactional nature or are provided over short periods that form the basis for billing to customers. Thus, net sales are recognized at a specific date and not over a period.
Accruals for discounts and allowances granted to customers are recognized as a reduction in revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized. They are calculated on the basis of the specific terms of the individual agreements and the underlying revenues. ALSO does not have any material, unsatisfied performance obligations.
2.11 Personnel expenses/employee benefit plans
In addition to the actual remuneration for services rendered (wages, salaries, and bonuses), personnel expenses also include ancillary personnel costs and social security contributions. Awards for years of service are also recognized as personnel expenses over the underlying period of service and accrued accordingly.
The companies of the ALSO Group operate various employee benefit plans according to the local conditions and practices in the respective countries.

2.10 Total net sales
Total net sales comprise invoiced deliveries of goods and services and other sales-related revenue.
Sales are recognized at a point of time when the control of the products or services has transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is fulfilled. The probability that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to ALSO is taken into account. A customer has taken over control if he has the ability to direct the use of the product or service and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits. An important indication of this is the transfer of risk and reward to the customer.

Defined contribution plans are post-employment plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and is neither legally nor de facto obliged to pay further contributions.
For defined benefit pension plans, the costs of providing benefits as well as the required provisions are defined actuarily using the projected unit credit method. In the case of plans that provide higher benefit growth in later years (backloading), the benefits that can be acquired are assigned on the basis of the net liability excluding future employee-funded benefit components. The liabilities are backed with assets which are managed by autonomous separately funded benefit plans or with provisions for employee benefits which are recognized in the financial statements of the relevant entities.

69

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

A surplus in a defined benefit plan is only recognized to the amount of the future economic benefits that are available in the form of reductions in contributions or repayments, taking into account the upper limit for the asset (asset ceiling). A defined benefit obligation is fully recognized as a provision.

2.13 Financial assets
Financial assets mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, accrued income, and other receivables as well as financial assets.

Pension costs are composed of three elements:

Financial assets are categorized as follows:

Service costs, which are part of personnel expenses, and consist of current service costs, past service costs, and gains/ losses from plan settlements;
Net interest, which is recorded in the financial result, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, or net defined benefit asset, that exists at the beginning of the year;
Gains and losses resulting from actuarial remeasurement, which are immediately recognized in other comprehensive income as remeasurements of employee benefits. Remeasurements of employee benefits are not recycled through the income statement at any later point in time.
2.12 Capital participation plans
Until February8, 2011, the ALSO Group granted shares and options of ALSO Holding AG to then members of Group Management. The exercise period for the options ends in 2020.
Under the terms of the share plan, the shares that were granted passed into the ownership of the beneficiaries with all associated rights, but subject to a vesting period of three years during which they may not be sold.
Under the terms of the option plan, the beneficiaries received on an annual basis option rights for the purchase of shares of ALSO Holding AG at a predetermined price. The options could only be exercised after a vesting period of three years. Payment in cash is not permitted.
The fair value of the option premiums from the capital participation plan see Note 6.6 as determined according to the HullWhite model was charged to personnel expenses over the vesting period of three years.

"Amortized costs": Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
"At fair value through other comprehensive income": Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
All other financial assets are recorded "at fair value through profit or loss". In addition, certain financial instruments may also be voluntarily allocated to this category if the relevant conditions are met.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the respective financial assets were acquired and on the contractual cash flows. Management determines the classification of financial assets at their initial recognition and reassesses the classification at each reporting date. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets in the category "fair value through profit or loss" are recognized exclusively at fair value. Trade receivables are recognized at transaction price. All purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date.
After their initial recognition, financial assets are measured depending on their category as follows:
"Amortized costs": At amortized cost using the effective interest method (equal distribution of cashflows during the term resulting in a zero difference of net present value).
"At fair value through other comprehensive income": At fair value. Any unrealized changes in value are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for interest that was calculated using the effective interest method, impairments and exchange rate fluctuations on borrowing instruments. In the case of sale, or other disposal, the cumulative gains and losses that are recognized in equity are reclassified into the net financial result (financial income, financial expense) of the current reporting period see Note 2.14.

70

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

"At fair value through profit or loss": At fair value. If the fair value is not readily available, it must be calculated using a recognized valuation model. Any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement under net financial result (financial income or financial expense) or cost of goods sold for the respective reporting period.
In accordance with IFRS9, ALSO recognizes impairment losses on financial assets based on expected losses. The application to "trade receivables" is described in Note 2.16.
Default risks on Prepaid expenses, accrued income and other receivables as well as on financial assets are estimated at a low level. In this case, IFRS9 requires the recognition of those losses that are expected to occur within the next 12 months.

Hedge accounting is especially not used for forward contracts, which represent effective hedges both economically and within the Group strategy. Depending on the economic background, changes in the market values of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement either in the gross margin (currency hedging) or the financial result (interest rate hedging).
2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
In addition to cash on hand and current account balances, cash equivalents also include time deposits with an original term of up to three months.
2.16 Trade receivables

2.14 Hedge accounting
To hedge its interest and currency risks that result from its operating activities, financial transactions and investments, ALSO uses derivative financial instruments. The method used to recognize the resulting gain or loss on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the instrument is designed to hedge a specific risk and whether the hedge qualifies for hedge accounting.

Trade receivables are recognized at face value less provision for impairment. The Expected Credit Loss model is used for this purpose. Default rates based on historical experience are offset against the contractually foreseen payment streams.
ALSO applies the simplified Expected Credit Loss model for its trade receivables, which provides for expected losses over all the remaining lifetime from the recognition date of the receivables.

ALSO uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreseen transactions or fixed obligations. If the derivative financial instrument that is used qualifies as a cash flow hedge when the contract is entered into, changes in value of the effective component of this derivative are recognized in income statement. The ineffective component is recognized in profit or loss. At the date of initial recognition of the hedged asset or liability, or expense or income, the changes in value that were recognized in other comprehensive income are included in the respective hedged item.

The impairment of trade receivables takes place indirectly through a separate impairment account. The impairment charged to the income statement in the reporting period is reported under other operating expenses. Should a trade receivable no longer be collectable, the receivable, along with any impairment that has already been charged, is derecognized. Should a payment subsequently be received, it is credited to other operating income.

The purpose of hedge accounting is to offset the changes in the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the statement of comprehensive income. To qualify as hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet the requirements regarding eligibility of the hedged item and hedging instrument, formal designation and documentation and effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Both at hedge inception and throughout the lifetime of the hedge, ALSO therefore documents its assessment of whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting the risks of changes in fair values or cash flows resulting from changes in fair value of the hedging instrument.

2.17 Inventories
Inventories are recognized at the lower of purchase cost and net realizable value. The purchase costs contain all purchase and overhead costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. The inventories are valued using the weighted-average purchase price method. Value adjustments are made for slow-moving inventories or inventories with purchase cost higher than market value. Unsaleable inventories are written off in full.
2.18 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is valued at acquisition cost minus economically necessary depreciation. Borrowing costs of qualified assets (which means project duration greater than 12 months) are additionally capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs with no added value are not capitalized. Significant investments are broken down into their constituent parts if the estimated useful lives of the separate components differ.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, ALSO's incremental borrowing rate. The lease term includes the non-cancellable period for which the asset is used, and extension/termination options are considered if ALSO is reasonably certain to exercise it. Lease liabilities are presented in short-/long-term financial liabilities.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful live is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.
ALSO uses the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value.
Accounting policy until December31, 2018

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairments are recognized under depreciation and shown separately in the assets analysis. The depreciation method as well as the estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.

 Land   Buildings   Equipment  Other property, plant and
equipment 

Not depreciated Useful life 25 years Useful life 2­15 years
Useful life 4­10 years

In the comparative period, leasing agreements that transferred substantially all of the risks and benefits to ALSO that were associated with ownership of the leased item were classified as finance leases. Equipment that was financed by leasing agreements was capitalized in the statement of financial position at the lower of market value or the net present value of the future lease payments. Non-current assets arising from finance leases were depreciated over their estimated useful life or the period of the agreement if shorter. Outstanding liabilities arising from finance leases were recognized as current and non-current financial liabilities.

2.19 Leases
As explained in Note 2.2, ALSO has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Group is the lessee.

Leases that did not transfer essentially all of the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the leased asset were classified as operating leases and the payments were recognized in the income statement.

Accounting policy from January1, 2019

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment.

2.20 Intangible assets

2.22 Factoring

Intangible assets comprise goodwill and internally created software, as well as licenses, patents and similar rights, customer lists, brand names, and software, that are acquired from third parties. The amortization of all intangible assets with finite useful lives is calculated by the straight-line method over the expected useful life. Impairment losses are recognized under amortization and disclosed separately in the assets analysis.

Goodwill is not normally amortized but tests for impairment are performed annually as well as whenever there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired. Material borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets (project duration greater than 12 months) are additionally capitalized.

With the exception of goodwill, no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are capitalized.

2.21 Impairment

The ALSO Group has sold or assigned some of its trade receivables to finance companies (factors). The receivables are only derecognized when substantially all of the risks contained in the receivables have been transferred to the purchaser of the receivables. Based on current legal agreements relating to factoring, all or significant portions of the customer default risk are transferred to the receivables purchaser. The interest risk remains with the ALSO Group until the date at which the receivables are received by the purchaser of the receivables or until the contractually agreed latest date. Securitization reserves are reported under other receivables.
The credit risk of factoring partners is assessed using ratings from Standard & Poor's see Note 6.7. As the risks are considered to be low, those losses are recorded that are expected to occur in the next 12 months. Receivables from factoring partners and dilution reserves are reported in the category "amortized costs".
Remaining bad debt, interest, and currency risks are recognized as continuing involvement in trade accounts receivable. This continuing involvement is offset by a corresponding liability, which also takes into account the risk of its utilization.

Goodwill is tested for impairment each year see Note 5.7. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. To determine the value in use, the cash flows for the next three years are estimated based on detailed budgets; beyond that period, a long-term growth rate is determined to forecast the future cash flows. The cash flows are then discounted at an appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss that is recognized against goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent reporting periods.

Payment of the purchase price by the factoring company takes place either when the payment is received by the factoring company or with interest at the request of ALSO. The still outstanding part of the purchase price receivable is reported under other receivables.
Interest expense and administration fees resulting from the sale of receivables are recognized in the financial result.

Other non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate a potential impairment. If there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated. The recoverable amount of the non-current asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is written down to that amount. This special write-down (impairment) is reported separately in the assets analysis. An impairment reversal is possible if, at a later date, an impairment test shows that the loss in value no longer exists.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

2.23 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities particularly include trade payables, liabilities to banks, other liabilities, liabilities from leases, and derivative financial liabilities. No lease liabilities from operating leases were recognized in the previous year. As described under Note 2.2, this changed this year with the introduction of the new leasing standard IFRS16.

Restructuring provisions are only recognized when a detailed restructuring plan is available and its main features have been announced to all those affected by it.
If the effect of the time-value of money is material, non-current provisions are discounted.
2.25 Taxes

Financial liabilities are separated into two categories. They are classified either as "at fair value through profit or loss", or as "amortized costs":
"At fair value through profit or loss": At their initial recognition and subsequently, these financial liabilities are measured at fair value. The transaction costs directly identifiable to the purchase of these liabilities are expensed. Derivatives with a negative replacement value are by definition assigned to this category.
"Amortized costs": This category serves as the residual category and mainly comprises financial debt. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. In addition to actual interest payments, interest expense also includes annual compound interest and pro rata transaction costs.

Taxes on income are accrued in the same periods as the revenue and expenses to which they relate, and are reported as tax liabilities. Deferred taxes include the income tax effects of temporary differences between the Group's internal measurement criteria and the local tax measurement guidelines for assets and liabilities (comprehensive liability method). With this method, deferred taxes are created for temporary taxable differences. Deferred taxes are adjusted annually for any changes in local tax legislation. Tax-loss carry-forwards and deductible temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets if it is sufficiently probable that future taxable profits will be adequate to utilize the respective deferred tax assets see Note 4.6.
Taxes that would have to be paid in the event of a payout of retained earnings in the subsidiaries are not accrued unless this type of payout is expected to be made in the near future.

2.24 Provisions

2.26 Equity

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognized if the ALSO Group has a legal or de facto present obligation from a past event, which will lead to a probable outflow of resources, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Warranties in respect of products supplied or services rendered by ALSO give rise to legal or de facto obligations. Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognized at the date when the respective product is sold or service rendered. The amount of the necessary provision is based on historical experience and expected probabilities of future occurrence. The resulting expenses are normally limited to logistical processes for returning the defective products to the vendor. The cost of repair or replacement is borne by the vendor.

Equity is composed of share capital, capital reserves, treasury shares, cash flow hedge reserves, exchange differences, remeasurement of defined benefit plans, retained earnings, and non-controlling interests.
The share capital represents the nominal capital of ALSO Holding AG. The capital reserves consist of all contributions to shareholders' equity received from outside the company other than share capital. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of treasury shares are also recognized in the capital reserves. The cash flow hedge reserve contains changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges. Under remeasurement of defined benefit plans, all actuarial gains and losses on the measurement of defined benefit plans are recognized. Under exchange differences, all exchange differences are recognized that result from translation of the financial statements of those Group companies whose functional currency is not the same as the reporting currency. Retained earnings comprise the gains/losses resulting from the decisions of the consolidated entities regarding the application of earnings that are carried forward to the new account and also includes the effects of the firsttime adoption of new IFRSstandards.

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

The segment reporting is based on the management approach. The results of the operating segments are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), Gustavo MöllerHergt, CEO, in order to allocate the resources to the segments.

The reconciliation (Adjustments) of the segment results to the consolidated results contains centralized activities of the holding companies in Switzerland, Finland, and Germany (headquarter activities) which are not allocated to the segments. The allocation of the net sales is determined by the place where invoicing occurs. Furthermore, revenues are recognized at a point in time. Revenues, as well as assets and liabilities (mainly trade receivables and payables), between the segments are eliminated in the "Adjustments" column. The assets and liabilities contain all balance sheet items that are directly attributable to the segments.

Profit before tax (EBT) contains all income and expenses that are directly attributable to the respective operating segments. It also includes direct allocations of centrally occurring expenses. EBT is the main performance indicator in the ALSO Group.

A reconciliation of the management reporting to the segment reporting is not required, since internal and external reporting are based on the same accounting principles.

Defined benefit plan Switzerland
Post-employment benefit plans in Switzerland are governed by the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors' and Disability Pension Plans (BVG), which stipulates that post-employment benefit plans must be managed by independent, legally autonomous bodies. Post-employment benefit plans are overseen by a regulator as well as by a state supervisory body. The ultimate governing body of a post-employment benefit plan (Board of Trustees) is composed of equal numbers of employee and employer representatives.

Plan participants are insured against the financial consequences of old age, disability, and death. The various benefits are defined in regulations, with the BVG specifying the minimum benefits that are to be provided. The employer and the employee pay contributions to the post-employment benefit plan. In case of an underfunding, various measures can be taken, such as adjusting the pension commitment by altering the conversion rates or increasing current contributions. Under certain conditions the employer is obliged to make additional restructuring contributions. The BVG prescribes how the employees and the employer jointly fund any restructuring measures.

81

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

The Swiss post-employment benefit plan, the ALSO Pension Fund, has the legal form of a foundation. All actuarial risks are borne by the foundation. These risks consist of demographic risks (primarily life expectancy) and financial risks (primarily the discount rate and the return on the plan assets), which are regularly assessed by the Board of Trustees. In addition, a report is prepared annually in accordance with IFRSrequirements as well as an actuarial report prepared in accordance with the requirements of the BVG.
The Board of Trustees is responsible for the investment of the assets. It defines the investment strategy as often as necessary ­ especially in the case of significant market developments

or changes to the structure of the plan participants ­ and at least once annually. When defining the investment strategy, the Board of Trustees takes account of the foundation's objectives, benefit obligations, and risk capacity. The investment strategy is defined in the form of a long-term target asset structure (investment policy).
The Board of Trustees delegates implementation of the investment strategy and management of the plan assets to an external asset manager. The Board of Trustees monitors compliance with the investment strategy and development of the plan assets several times a year.

Sensitivities of the main actuarial assumptions
The main actuarial assumptions were identified to be the discount rate and the future development of salaries and wages. The following effects on the DBO can be expected:
An increase/decrease of 0.25percentage points in the discount rate would result in a decrease/increase in the DBO of 5% respectively.
An increase/decrease of 0.25percentage points in the expected development of salaries and wages would result in an increase/ decrease in the DBO of 1% respectively.

The weighted tax rate is calculated from the income tax rates that are expected to apply for the Group companies in the respective tax jurisdictions. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 30.8% in 2018 to 25.6% in 2019 is mainly due to the utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses, the decrease in non-deductible expenses and the result of tax audits in previous year.

In 2019, in the tax jurisdictions that are relevant for ALSO, there were no material changes in the applicable income tax rates.

For tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of TEUR63338 (previous year: TEUR63778), no deferred tax assets are recognized since they cannot be offset against other Group profits and it is unlikely that the entities carrying the tax losses forward will have future taxable profits against which to offset the related tax benefit.
As of December31, 2019, there were no deferred tax liabilities for retained earnings amounting to TEUR11211 (previous year: TEUR10540) in subsidiaries which are liable to tax in the event of a dividend payment. There are no plans for dividend payment in the foreseeable future from those retained earnings.

Receivables from factors see Note 6.8 consist of dilution reserves of TEUR153849 (previous year: TEUR147029) from ongoing sales of receivables and within the scope of credit lines callable claims of TEUR151023 (previous year: TEUR104909).
Provisions on receivables from factors amount to TEUR198 (previous year: TEUR161).
Other receivables consist mainly of receivables from vendors.

For most inventories, there are limited-duration price-protection guarantees from the vendors/manufacturers. The ALSO companies usually purchase goods in local currency. A recognizable loss of value due to low inventory turnover, ageing, etc. is taken into account through inventory provisions.
In the reporting period, inventory for the amount of TEUR10018724 (previous year: TEUR8567346) was recognized as cost of goods sold in the consolidated income statement. This includes changes in inventory provisions totaling TEUR1622 recognized as income. In the previous year, TEUR686 was recognized as income.

Goodwill is monitored and tested for impairment by means of value-in-use calculations of two groups of cash-generating units. The value in use is the present value of the discounted cash flows. It is based on planning assumptions over a three-year period, plus residual values which have been approved by Management. The discount rates applied, and the average growth rate in net sales, are set out in the above table.
The value-in-use calculation for the group of cash-generating units is sensitive to assumptions relating to the balance sheet structure, gross margin, and cost structure. The balance sheet structure and gross margin are derived from historical values as well as from strategic and economic changes. The cost structure is adapted to the expected gross margin.
The value in use is substantially higher than the reported net assets. Even a material change in the base data, e.g. a sustained deterioration in the gross margin, or a change in the balance sheet and cost structure, would not cause an impairment of the goodwill.

There is an existing guarantee provision for the amount of TEUR4640 for the risk of expenses that have not yet occurred but which are expected to occur before the end of the guarantee period that was granted. It is expected that the greater part of the provision will be utilized in the next fiscal year, or at the latest within two years.

Other provisions contain long-service benefits, other employee allowances, and provisions for various risks. Utilization normally takes place within five years.
The creation of other provisions in 2018 and their utilization in 2019 is mainly attributable to the result of tax audits.

The provisions for litigation contain claims for damages as well as legal costs for various pending court cases. For significant parts of the litigation, a settlement is expected in the next fiscal year.

6. Further information on the consolidated financial statements
6.1 Contingent liabilities
ALSO Deutschland GmbH has received a written demand for information and payment of copyright fees on external hard disks in connection with a tariff that was published in Germany on November3, 2011. This was the first time that a tariff was published for this category of device. The tariff related to various products and vendors. The tariff has been applied retrospectively as of January1, 2008, and related to various different types of products. The amount of the fees ranged from EUR5.00 for simple external hard disks to EUR34.00 for multimedia hard disks.
The demand was decided upon by the responsible arbitration body. The settlement proposal provided for considerably lower tariffs for the period from 2008 to 2010. The settlement proposal has not been accepted by any of the parties to the dispute. An appeal has been lodged and the proceedings has been continued at the Munich Higher Regional Court.

According to the majority opinion of the vendors, distributors, Bitkom (industry association), and their legal advisors, it was unlikely that the tariff can be applied retrospectively. It is highly probable that the legal conditions for a retrospective publication to be effective are not fulfilled. A liability of ALSO Deutschland GmbH for the period from January1, 2008, to November3, 2011, has therefore not been recognized in the statement of financial position.

101

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

The amount of the tariffs after publication starting from 2011 was also disputed. ALSO Deutschland GmbH has recognized the published tariffs in the statement of financial position for this period.

In June 2018, the Bitkom industry association agreed on tariffs with the collecting societies responsible for the retroactive period and the period after publication. ALSO Deutschland GmbH is entered into this contract. This made it possible to precisely allocate the tariffs to the hard disk types. In view of this, ALSO Deutschland GmbH therefore reassessed the amount of its obligations in the statement of financial position in 2018. This results in income in 2018 of TEUR4200, which is recognized in the costs of goods sold and services provided.

Various cash flow hedges (interest rate swaps) became ineffective or had to be restructured in 2016 and in 2015 due to negative interest rates. As a result of this ineffectiveness or restructuring, measurement changes have therefore been recognized directly in financial result since these cash flow hedges became ineffective or were restructured. In 2019 this resulted in financial income of TEUR423 (previous year: TEUR1051). Furthermore, these hedging transactions were reclassified from equity to financial expenses in the amount of TEUR408 (previous year: TEUR1030).

Fair value hierarchy
ALSO applies the following measurement hierarchy to determine the fair value of financial instruments:
Level 1: Listed, unchanged market price in active markets. Level 2: Measurement methods in which all assumptions that
have a material impact on the fair value are indirectly or directly available. Level 3: Measurement methods with assumptions that have a material impact on the fair value which are not publicly available.

Measurement techniques of financial instruments within Level 2
Forward exchange contracts are measured based on observable forward rates and spot rates and are recognized at their positive or negative replacement value. Interest rate swaps and interest rate options are measured based on the net present value of observable forward rates and recognized in the statement of financial position at their positive or negative replacement value respectively.
Measurement techniques of financial instruments within Level 3
The fair value of contingent considerations from the acquisition of subsidiaries, put options on shares of non-controlling interests and call options is calculated based on contractually agreed measurement methods. These calculations are based on the expected future operating profits of subsidiaries and, therefore, depend on assumptions that are neither directly nor indirectly observable in the market. The expected future operating profits are based on medium-term plans which cover a period of three years. Those plans are reviewed by the management of ALSO.

The property, plant, and equipment shown above has been pledged as collateral against existing mortgages in Switzerland and Austria. The inventories have been pledged as collateral against trade payables in Finland and newly in 2019 in Bulgaria.

In the reporting year, 651 options were exercised. At December31, 2019, 355 options were exercisable. The options are valued according to the Hull-White model, which explicitly takes account of the effects of the restriction period and of an early exercise of the options. The fair value of the options was recognized in profit or loss, and one third (vesting period) was charged to personnel expenses, lastly in 2013.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of economic loss resulting from a counterparty being unable or unwilling to fulfil its contractual payment obligations. Credit risk thus includes not only the immediate default risk, but also the risk of a worse credit rating along with the risk of concentration of individual risks.

6.7 Financial risk management
Principles of risk management
In relation to its financial assets and liabilities, ALSO is exposed to special risks arising from changes in exchange rates and interest rates. In addition to these market risks, there are also liquidity and credit risks. The objective of financial risk management is to control and limit these market risks by ongoing operational and financial activities. For this purpose, and depending on the estimated risk, selected hedging instruments are used. Derivative financial instruments are used exclusively as hedging instruments, i.e. they are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the default risk, the material hedging transactions are only entered into with leading financial institutions.

In its operational business, as well as in some of its financing activities, ALSO is exposed to a default risk. In the financial area, ALSO manages the resulting risk position by the diversification of financial institutions and by verification of the financial strength of each counterparty based on publicly available ratings, as well as on publicly available ad-hoc information about the financial institutions.

At regular intervals, the appropriateness of the risk management and the internal control system is reviewed by the Board of Directors and modified if necessary. This ensures that the Board of Directors and the Group Management are completely and promptly informed of material risks. In addition, monthly internal reports on the financial position of the company allow any risks arising from the ongoing business to be recognized as early as possible, and corresponding countermeasures to be initiated. For this purpose, Accounting and Controlling constantly adapt their reporting systems to changing conditions.

For optimal cash management, the management of liquidity not required for ongoing operations and the long-term financing of the Group is centralized. The treasury function also records, monitors, and controls financial risks based on information provided by the Board of Directors and Group Management.

The credit quality of financial institutions is displayed based on public ratings by Standard & Poor's or Moody's. The rating code is a letter code that indicates the default risk of a debtor (country, company) and hence allows easy assessment of its creditworthiness. An independent, statistically determinable and validatable probability of default can be assigned to each rating code.
AAA/Aaa Risk of default is virtually zero. AA/Aa Safe investment, with slight risk of default. A The investment is safe provided that no unfore-
seen eventualities impair the overall economy or the industry. BBB/BaaThe investment is sufficient save but more dependent on economic developments than the above categories <BBB/BaaMainly investments for which no public rating exists.
Ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (­) sign or by the number 1 to 3 to move the rating up or down within the rating group.

In the operational area, ALSO limits the default risk by constantly monitoring customers' credit ratings and setting credit limits based thereon. The operational companies of the Group have largely insured their open trade receivables by means of credit insurances. The credit insurances generally cover defaults for 85 to 95% of the insured amounts. The residual credit default risk on trade receivables is therefore considered by ALSO to be limited, particularly since it is further minimized by the large number of customers and their wide geographical distribution. In addition, to further reduce default risks, certain receivables were completely sold.
Resulting from this sale are receivables from factors amounting to TEUR304872 (previous year: TEUR251938) see Note 5.4, which are spread over several factoring partners. The largest receivable from a single factoring partner is for TEUR87939 (previous year: TEUR62397). During the long-standing business relationships with the factoring companies, no losses on receivables have occurred. The risk of loss on receivables from factoring partners is not insured with credit insurances. The default risk of loss is minimized by ALSO through regular evaluation of the factoring partners.

111

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

Receivables which have not been sold, are impaired in general and if necessary by individual amounts. Experience from the past indicates that this risk can be considered to be low see also Note 5.2. The maximum credit risk (including derivative financial instruments with a positive market value) is represented by the carrying amounts of the financial assets. ALSO has not issued any financial guarantees in favor of third parties.
Liquidity risks
The central liquidity risk management system ensures that the Group is always in a position to fulfil its payment obligations promptly. ALSO continuously monitors its liquidity with a detailed cash flow plan on a daily basis. Extensive planning ensures furthermore that sufficient liquidity is available in the medium and long term.
ALSO's objective is to obtain liquidity corresponding to the necessary timing. Since the main requirement for finance is to cover the operational business activities, which are subject to

large seasonal fluctuations, over the year as a whole most of the sources of funds are short-term. The necessary funds are mainly obtained by selling existing receivables to factoring companies and supplemented by bank lines of credit that are available at short notice. At the reporting date, the unutilized available credit lines with banks amounted to EUR763million (previous year: EUR355million). The increase is mainly due to the new revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR300million, which provides ALSO with flexible financing with a term of five years. The credit line was not drawn in 2019. The remaining increase is due to acquisitions.
The following table shows the financial liabilities of the Group by expiration date. The information is based on contractually agreed undiscounted interest and amortization payments. Forward purchases and sales of foreign currencies are not included in the financial derivatives. Since the forward transactions do not cause any net negative cash flow, they do not present a liquidity risk to ALSO.

The table includes all instruments held on December31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, for which payments had already been contractually agreed. Plan figures for future new liabilities are not included. Foreign currency amounts were translated at the yearend exchange rate. The variable interest payments from the financial instruments were calculated using the interest rates fixed at December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Financial liabilities that can be repaid at any time are always assigned to the earliest maturity date, irrespective of the fact that the greater part of these financial liabilities is revolving.
Interest rate risks
ALSO's interest rate risks relate mainly to current financial liabilities with variable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations cause changes in the interest income and expense of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities. ALSO is particularly exposed to interest rate risks in EUR, CHF, PLN and DKK.

The interest rate management is handled centrally. Short-term interest rate risks are only partially hedged, a material part of interest bearing-liabilities hence remaining exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Also see Note 6.2
Taking into account the existing and planned debt structure, interest derivatives are used if necessary to meet the bandwidths recommended by central Group treasury and prescribed by management. Since ALSO uses fixed as well as variable interest-bearing instruments, interest risks may result from an increase as well as a decrease in market interest rates.
Sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risks are evaluated by means of sensitivity analyses. These sensitivity analyses demonstrate the effects of changes in market interest rates on unsecured variable interest expense and income, as well as on equity, when all other variables remain constant.

113

ALSO Annual Report 2019

 Financial Report

The change in the market interest rates affects the value and the effectiveness of the hedging instruments and therefore affects equity and the financial result. If the market interest rate on December31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, had been 100 base points higher/lower, the effect would have been as follows:

This analysis is based on the assumption that the amount at the respective reporting date corresponds closely to the average amount utilized during the year.

A material part of the cash flows of the operational companies occurs in currencies which are not the functional currencies of those subsidiaries. ALSO is therefore exposed to foreign currency risks. Foreign currency risks are only hedged if they affect the cash flow of the Group. Exchange rate risks that arise in the consolidated financial statements through the translation of income statement and statements of financial position of subsidiaries are not hedged.

Market interest rates were slightly negative in 2019 and 2018. Because some financing partners do not pass on negative interest rates to ALSO, the financing costs would not be affected to the same extent by a 100 bps decrease as they would be by a 100 bps increase. ALSO concluded new hedging instruments in 2017 and in 2019 that take account of the negative interest rate environment so as to rule out additional negative effects on the financial result. Amongst others, ALSO uses interest rate options to protect itself against increasing interest rates in the mid-term. However, those instruments do not have an impact on the financial result in the above disclosed sensitivity of interest rates. The measurement of hedging instruments is purely a valuation effect that does not result in any outflow of cash for ALSO.

In the purchasing area, a certain amount is conducted in foreign currencies, especially EUR (where it is not the functional currency) and in USD. To hedge this exchange rate risk, Central Treasury hedges the purchasing volumes of the operating companies outside their functional currency.
Group-internal loans between subsidiaries with different functional currencies give rise to foreign currency risks. ALSO hedges most of these risks. Speculative borrowing or lending in foreign currencies is not permitted. Transaction-related foreign currency risks are also monitored and the corresponding net exposures in the various currencies are calculated.
By regular use of forward contracts, ALSO constantly reduces the exchange rate risk so that there is no material exchange rate risk to the Group. The table below shows the main unsecured net exposures of the Group at the end of 2019 and 2018 respectively. These usually reflect the open risks over the year.

Sensitivity analysis

Capital management

If, on December31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, the EUR had been 10% stronger/weaker relative to the reporting date balances in those currencies, and all other variables had remained unchanged, the income statement and shareholders' equity (net, after tax) would have been TEUR11039 higher/lower (previous year: TEUR7178). The disclosed net exposures are mainly offset by inventories which are held in foreign currencies. Those inventories will be sold within a short period of time and would therefore largely compensate the effects explained above on the income statement.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of entities whose functional currency is not the Euro are not included in the sensitivity analysis.

The overriding objective of capital management at ALSO is to maintain an appropriate equity base in order to preserve the trust of investors, customers, and the market, and to support future developments in the core business. The internal target value for the ratio of equity to total assets has been defined as 25 to 35%.
The capital management serves to maintain an optimal Groupwide capital structure which not only gives ALSO sufficient financial flexibility, but also maintains a high credit rating.
The equity structure can be maintained or modified by means of the dividend policy, capital repayments, and, if necessary, capital increases.
The capital structure is monitored on the basis of the net financial debt and reported equity. Net financial debt comprises interest-bearing financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.

6.8 Factoring
ALSO has sold or assigned trade receivables to independent factoring companies. To the extent that a significant transfer of risk takes place, these transactions reduce the total receivables of the Group.
Receivables fully derecognized in the statement of financial position

are fully derecognized and a corresponding receivable from the factoring company is recognized see Note 5.4.
Due to the contractual terms of the factoring program, ALSO is exposed to certain residual risks even after the trade receivables are sold. For the time period between maturity and payment of the sold receivables, ALSO is obliged to pay interest to the factoring company (interest risk for late payments).

If the sale of trade receivables transfers all material rewards and risks to the factoring company, under IFRS9 these receivables

The trade receivables of TEUR747183 (previous year: TEUR622223, see Note 5.2) therefore contain a continuing involvement for the amount of TEUR55126 (previous year: TEUR60698).This is composed of the residual interest risk for late payments of TEUR1546 (previous year: TEUR1499), the residual credit risk of TEUR48432 (previous year: TEUR52973), and the residual exchange rate risk of TEUR5148 (previous year: TEUR6226).

Taking into account ongoing creditworthiness checks, the large number of customers, and their historical payment behavior, as well as the known time period between maturity and payment of the sold receivables, ALSO expects that interest of TEUR131 (previous year: TEUR119) for late payments will be due on sold receivables at December31, 2019. Corresponding accruals for these amounts were therefore made at December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Should the theoretical case occur of default on payment of all receivables that have been sold, ALSO would have to pay interest to the factors for the time period between maturity of the sold receivables and a contractually agreed latest date. As of at December31, 2019, the theoretical maximum value at risk from this loss was estimated at TEUR2046 (previous year: TEUR2069).
Receivables not fully derecognized in the statement of financial position
In some agreements, neither complete transfer nor complete retention of the rewards and risks of the receivables can be assumed. Under these agreements, the trade receivables are not fully derecognized, and a residual amount remains recognized in the statement of financial position. Under IFRS9, this residual amount represents a so-called "continuing involvement".

Due to the continuing involvement, there is a corresponding obligation for the amount of TEUR55126 (previous year: TEUR60698), which is recognized in accrued expenses, deferred income and other payables. In addition, there is an accrual for the amount of TEUR165 (previous year: TEUR156) for the fair value of the residual risk of the continuing involvement. Only the change in the true uncollectibility and interest risk is recognized through profit or loss.

Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting on the consolidated financial statements 2019
Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of ALSO Holding AG and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements pages 58 to 117 give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019 and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit matters

Overall Group materiality: EUR 6 700 000
We concluded full scope audit work and audit work of one and more account balances at 10 reporting units in 7 countries. Our audit scope addressed over 83% of the Group's net sales, 81% of the assets and 74% of the profit of the Group.
In addition, we concluded reviews at a further 3 reporting units in 3 countries, which addressed an additional 7% of the Group's net sales, 4% of the assets and 12% of the profit of the Group.
As key audit matters the following areas of focus have been identified:
· Impairment testing of goodwill · Acquisition ABC Data

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Overall Group materiality
How we determined it Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied

EUR 6 700 000
5% of profit before tax We chose profit before tax as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured, and it is a generally accepted benchmark.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements above EUR 670 000 identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The audit strategy for the audit of the consolidated financial statements was determined taking into account the work performed by the Group auditor and the work performed at Group components by auditors in the PwC network and by third parties. 9 of 10 significant subsidiaries of the Group were audited by PwC. Where audits were performed by component auditors, we ensured that, as Group auditor, we were adequately involved in the audit in order to assess whether adequate sufficient appropriate audit evidence was obtained from the work of the component auditors to provide a basis for our opinion. The involvement of the Group auditor included telephone conferences with the component auditors, an investigation of the risk assessment and working paper reviews at the third party auditor.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment testing of goodwill Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Impairment testing of goodwill was deemed a key audit matter for the following two reasons:
Goodwill represents a significant amount on the balance sheet. It amounts to a total of EUR 178.0 million (6.3% of total assets), of which EUR 149.0 million relates to the Central Europe cash- generating unit and EUR 29.0 million relates to the North/Eastern Europe cash-generating unit.
In addition, there is significant scope for judgement in determining the assumptions relating to future business results and the discount rate applied to forecasted cash flows.
Please refer to page 66 (key assumptions and estimates), page 73 (accounting standards for intangible assets and impairment) and page 93 (notes to the consolidated financial statements).

We assessed the impairment tests carried out by the Group by performing the following audit procedures: ·For the forecasted cash flows, we assessed the budget process,
especially whether Group Management and the Board of Directors monitored this process and challenged the assumptions made. ·We tested whether the values used for the impairment tests were in line with the budget approved by the Board of Directors. ·We discussed with Group Management how the country-specific assumptions concerning revenue growth and long-term growth rates have been established. ·We compared the assumptions relating to the prior year's revenues and results with those for the year under review in order to identify, in retrospect, any assumptions that were too optimistic regarding the budgeted revenues and results. ·We assessed the reasonableness of the forecasts relating to investments and to the change in net working capital. ·For each cash-generating unit (CGU), we compared the discount rate used with its cost of capital. ·In addition, using sensitivity analyses, we tested whether a significant change in each of the key assumptions (the discount rate, the EBITDA margin and the long-term growth rate) resulted in the impairment of the goodwill. ·We discussed the results of these tests with Group Management in terms of both the headroom available before the goodwill would be impaired and the probability of such a change in the assumptions occurring.

In performing the audit procedures listed above, we addressed the risk of the impairment of the goodwill. We have no findings to report.

Acquisition ABC Data Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

On 1 July 2019, the Group, through its subsidiary Roseville Investments Sp. z o.o., took over the assets and liabilities of ABC Data with consideration of EUR 45.9 million, that operates in six Eastern European countries. In the purchase price allocation, a fair value of the net assets of EUR 36.1 million was identified and a Goodwill of EUR 9.8 million was recognized.
The acquisition has a material impact on the Group's assets and liabilities and its income statement items.
The identification and valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities can include judgement and requires estimates by the Group Management.
Please refer to page 68 (accounting standards for acquisitions) and pages 75 to 77 (notes to the consolidated financial statements).

We performed the following audit procedures: ·We considered the appropriate accounting of the acquisition
as a business combination based on a memorandum prepared by Group Management. We compared the content with the contractual terms and conditions included in the purchase agreements. ·The third party auditor performed audit procedures on material items in the opening balances of significant entities of ABC Data regarding existence, completeness and valuation. We assessed independence, objectivity and competence of the third party auditor and provided relevant audit instructions. We evaluated their audit approach and results and reviewed their working papers. ·We assessed the valuation of customer lists being part of the acquired intangible assets by focusing on the assumptions concerning revenue and discount rate. ·We assessed the completeness of the identifiable net assets. Our assessment was based on discussions with Group Management, the examination of the due diligence reports and our knowledge of the industry. ·We verified the mathematical correctness of the goodwill calculation and tested the payment of the purchase prices. ·Lastly, we checked the correctness and completeness of the disclosures relating to this acquisition in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Based on the procedures performed, we have no findings to report.

Other information in the annual report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and the compensation report of ALSO Holding AG and our auditor's reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located at the website of EXPERTsuisse: http://expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-public-companies. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ALSO HOLDING AG

General
The financial statements of ALSO Holding AG, with registered office in Emmen, Switzerland, comply with the requirements of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).

Basis of preparation

Assets are valued at no higher than acquisition cost. All changes in value are recognized in the profit or loss statement. Due to their similarity investments are usually grouped together and tested for impairment once a year. Intangible assets are amortized over five years. Gains and losses from disposals of treasury shares, including transaction costs, are recognized directly in legal reserves. Liabilities are valued at nominal value.

All current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated according to the exchange rates applicable on the balance sheet date. For non-current assets and liabilities the imparity principle is applied. Income and expenses denominated in foreign currencies and all foreign exchange transactions are translated using the exchange rates as of the transaction dates. Resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized in the profit or loss statement.

Derivatives with positive replacement values are recognized at their acquisition cost. Derivatives with negative replacement values are recognized at their fair values.

Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting on the financial statements 2019

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of ALSO Holding AG, which comprise the profit or loss statement for the year ended 31 December 2019, the balance sheet as at 31 December 2019 and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the financial statements ( pages 125 to 131) as at 31 December 2019 comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.

We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our audit approach Overview

Materiality

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the entity, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the entity operates.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

Overall materiality
How we determined it Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied

CHF 3 400 000
0.5% of equity We chose equity as the benchmark because it is a relevant and generally accepted benchmark for materiality considerations relating to a holding company.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 340'000 identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Audit scope
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where subjective judgements were made; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment of equity investments Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Impairment testing of equity investments was deemed a key audit matter for the following two reasons:
Equity investments of CHF 537.0 million represent the largest single asset category. A valuation adjustment on this item would have a significant impact on the equity of the company. Testing for impairment depends on the future results of the each company concerned.
In addition, there is significant scope for judgement in determining the assumptions with regard to future results.
Please refer to page 127 (Accounting policies).

We assessed the impairment test performed by the company on equity investments by performing the following audit procedures: ·For the forecasted cash flows, we assessed the budget process,
especially whether Management and the Board of Directors monitored this process and challenged the assumptions made. ·We tested whether the values used for the im-pairment test were in line with the budget approved by the Board of Directors. ·We discussed with Management how the country-specific assumptions concerning revenue growth and long-term growth rates have been established. ·We compared the assumptions relating to the prior year's revenues and results with those for the year under review in order to identify, in retrospect, any assumptions that were too optimistic regarding the budgeted revenues and results. ·We assessed the adequacy of the forecasts relating to investments and to the change in net working capital. ·We compared the applied discount rate with the respective cost of capital. ·In addition, using sensitivity analyses, we tested whether a significant change in each of the key assumptions (the discount rate, the EBITDA margin and the long-term growth rate) resulted in the impairment of the equity investments. ·We discussed the results of these tests with Management in terms of both the headroom available before the carrying amount of the equity investments would be impaired and the probability of such a change in the assumptions occurring.

In performing the audit procedures listed above, we addressed the risk of impairment of the equity investments. We have no findings to report.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the website of EXPERTsuisse: http://expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-public-companies. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.

We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

This report contains certain Alternative Performance Measures which are not accounting measures as defined by IFRS. These measures should not be used instead of the IFRS-based consolidated financial statements, but as a supplement.
Organic growth
The organic growth results from the change in the total net sales of all Group companies that were part of the ALSO Group at the beginning of the comparative period. The change in total net sales of companies acquired in the fiscal year or in the previous year is added to the inorganic growth.

Foreign currency effect
The foreign currency effect results from the following circumstances:
The foreign currency effect on total net sales: The sales price is calculated on the basis of the moving average of the inventories valued in a foreign currency calculated at the spot price. The difference between the moving average translated at the spot price on the reporting date and the moving average in the local currency is assessed as foreign currency impact in total net sales.
The foreign currency effect on cost of goods sold and services provided: The currency effects relate to currency valuations from open foreign currency liabilities, realized foreign currency effects with supplier payments, valuation of open forward exchange contracts and realized foreign currency effects from forward exchange contracts.

EBITDA without effect due to IFRS 16 leases
EBITDA 2019 is impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16. Since January 1, 2019, ALSO recognizes assets and liabilities for virtually all leases. As a result, leasing expenses are no longer reported as part of operating expenses, but as depreciation and financial expense below EBITDA. For that purpose, the newly recorded depreciation of right-of-use assets and the newly recorded interest expenses on lease liabilities were deducted from the reported EBITDA.
