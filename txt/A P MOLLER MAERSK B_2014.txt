ANNUAL REPORT 2014
The Annual Report for 2014 of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (further referred to as the "Group") has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies.
The Annual Report has over time grown significantly in size due to increasing legal requirements. A significant number of pages with very detailed information have made it increasingly challenging to convey an easily understandable overview of key developments during the year.
Therefore, the Board of Directors of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S has decided to tailor the external financial reporting specifically towards the needs of our different stakeholders.

The Annual Report has been tailored to our stakeholders with a focus on the very detailed legally required information, whereas a new report named "Group Annual Magazine" has been tailored to the stakeholders with a focus on providing an overview of key developments during the year. Additionally, we have expanded the information on our Investor Relations website: http://investor.maersk.com/. The reports can be read individually or combined depending on our stakeholders' interests. The Board of Directors iterates that the purpose has not been to reduce the information level compared to previously, but on the contrary to improve our communication and the accessibility of same by focusing our information in the best possible way to accommodate the interests and needs of our different stakeholders.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

GROUP HIGHLIGHTS
The Group delivered a strong financial performance with a profit of USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) positively impacted by the USD 2.8bn gain from the sale of the majority share of Dansk Supermarked Group and other divestment gains of USD 600m (USD 145m) partly offset by the net impairments of USD 3.0bn (USD 220m), including USD 1.7bn on the Brazilian oil assets. In line with expectations, the underlying profit increased by 33% to USD 4.5bn compared to 2013 (USD 3.4bn) and the return on invested capital (ROIC) was 11.0% (8.2%).

Maersk Line maintained its lead on the rest of the industry and delivered a higher than expected profit of USD 2.3bn (USD 1.5bn) due to stronger than expected volumes as well as lower unit costs from continued optimisation and lower bunker prices partly countered by lower freight rates. The underlying profit was also higher than expected and came at USD 2.2bn (USD 1.5bn). ROIC was 11.6% (7.4%).
Maersk Oil delivered a loss of USD 861m (profit of USD 1.0bn) but with an underlying profit of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.1bn) that was in line with expectations despite the sharp decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter. Maersk Oil's entitlement production increased by 7% over 2013 to 251,000 barrels per day as a result of improved operational performance, production from new projects as well as a higher share of production from Qatar due to the lower oil price. The result was furthermore improved by lower exploration costs. Maersk Oil reduced its valuation of Brazilian assets by USD 1.7bn due to disappointing exploration and appraisal results and rising project costs. Updated oil price

assumptions lead to impairments on some of Maersk Oil's UK assets. ROIC was negative 15.2% (positive 16.2%).
APM Terminals delivered a profit of USD 900m (USD 770m), positively impacted by volume and margin growth as well as divestment gains, mainly relating to the port in Virginia, USA. The result was negatively impacted by impairments related to activities in joint ventures. The underlying profit of USD 849m (USD 709m) was a significant improvement and in line with expectations. ROIC was 14.7% (13.5%).
Maersk Drilling delivered a profit of USD 478m (USD 528m), positively impacted by high operational uptimes as well as gain relating to the divestment of the Venezuelan activities, negatively impacted by impairments of USD 85m. The high number of planned rig yard stay days and start-up costs contributed negatively to the result. The underlying profit of USD 471m (USD 524m) was in line with expectations. ROIC was 7.1% (10.8%).

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

APM Shipping Services delivered a loss of USD 230m (loss of USD 85m) negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment of USD 357m related to the Adsteam acquisition in Australia. Svitzer's Australian operations are negatively impacted by industry overcapacity, a high industry cost structure and a general slowdown of bulk activities. Furthermore, the result was impacted by significant non-trading costs in Damco related to impairments, restructuring and other adjustments. The underlying result in APM Shipping Services came in lower than expected, however, higher than last year with an underlying profit of USD 185m (USD 37m) mainly due to Maersk Tankers being impacted by positive USD 87m (negative USD 144m) relating to provision for onerous contracts.
The Group's cash flow from operating activities continued at a high level of USD 8.8bn (USD 8.9bn) and net cash flow used for capital expenditure increased to USD 6.2bn (USD 4.9bn) mainly due to deliveries of newbuildings in Maersk Drilling and Maersk Line as well as increased oil field developments in Maersk Oil.

of the ordinary dividend payment is equivalent to USD 1,077m at the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014.
The extraordinary dividend will be determined based on the Volume Weighted Average Price of Danske Bank A/S' shares traded during a pricing period of five trading days, expected to commence Friday 20 March and expire Thursday 26 March 2015. Based on the value of the shares on 31 December 2014, the value of the extraordinary dividend is estimated to DKK 33,850m equivalent to USD 5,530m using the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014 (around DKK 1,569 per share of DKK 1,000 excluding treasury shares). Due to the Group's strong financial position, the Board of Directors decided in 2014 to buy back shares of up to DKK 5.6bn to be executed during a 12-month period beginning September 2014.The Board of Directors will on an ongoing basis decide on the reoccurrence and size of buy-back programmes based on the Group's financial position and the potential of identifying attractive investment opportunities. A.P. Møller Holding A/S is participating in the buy-back with their pro rata share.

SUSTAINABILITY AND GENDER COMPOSITION OF MANAGEMENT An independently assured Sustainability Report for 2014 is published and provides detailed information on the Group's sustainability performance and new sustainability strategy. The report serves as the Group's Communication on Progress as required by the UN Global Compact, and ensures compliance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act on corporate social responsibility and reporting on the gender composition of management. The report is available on: www.maersk.com

MAJOR PORTFOLIO DECISIONS During 2014, the Group divested its majority shareholding in Dansk Supermarked Group resulting in a gain of USD 2.8bn. Furthermore, the Group announces its intention to offer its shares in Danske Bank to its shareholders, and once completed the sale of shares in the Dansk Supermarked Group and Danske Bank will have significantly contributed to focusing the Group's portfolio.

With an equity ratio of 61.3% (57.1%) and a liquidity reserve of USD 11.6bn (USD 13.6bn), the Group is well prepared and determined to execute on its long term growth aspirations and seize market opportunities within its businesses.
QUARTERLY FIGURES Quarterly figures for the Group for 2010-2014 are available on: http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm

SHAREHOLDER RETURN The Maersk B-share price increased by 5.1% to DKK 12,370 during 2014. The ordinary dividend pay-out proposed by the Board of Directors is DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 equal to a total of DKK 6,593m, representing an ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% based on the B-share closing price at year end.

GUIDANCE FOR 2015
The Group expects an underlying result slightly below USD 4bn (USD 4.1bn) excluding Danske Bank. Gross cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be around USD 9bn in 2015 (USD 8.7bn), while cash flow from operating activities is expected to develop in line with the result.

Maersk Line expects a higher underlying result than for 2014 (USD 2.2bn). Maersk Line aims to improve its competitiveness through unit cost reductions and implementation of the new 2M alliance. Global demand for seaborne container transportation is expected to increase by 3-5% and Maersk Line aims to grow with the market.
Maersk Oil expects a significantly lower underlying result for 2015 than for 2014 (USD 1.0bn) as break even is reached with oil prices in the range 55-60 USD per barrel.

SENSITIVITY GUIDANCE The Group's guidance for 2015 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global economy, the container freight rates and the oil price.
The Group's expected underlying result depends on a number of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other things being equal, the sensitivities on calendar 2015 for four key value drivers are listed in the table below:

Maersk Oil's entitlement production is expected to be around 265,000 boepd (251,000 boepd). Exploration expenses are expected to be around USD 0.7bn (USD 765m) for the year.
APM Terminals expects an underlying result around 2014 (USD 849m) and to grow in line with the market.
Maersk Drilling expects a higher underlying result than in 2014 (USD 471m) due to more rigs in operation, good forward contract coverage as well as the cost reduction and efficiency enhancement programme.

THE GROUP STRATEGY
The Group is executing on the strategy to become a premium conglomerate with five of our eight businesses now world-class performers in their industries.

We use our global network, skilled people and financial flexibility to enable customers and countries to create wealth and fulfil their economic potential.
The existing strong position in growth markets will remain a focus area going forward, as the Group is in a good position to support and capitalise on the growth.

THE GROUP STRATEGY PROCESS The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to ensure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed according to market developments, including developments in the oil price.
The Group's annual strategy review and the allocation of capital is a fully integrated process.

THE GROUP'S PRIORITIES FOR 2015 We have set out the following Group Priorities for 2015:
Position our company for a new oil environment The recent steep decline in the oil price means we must adapt our business to fit this new reality. Cost reductions will be critical to maintaining and improving competitiveness across the Group.

Strategies, including detailed plans and opportunities for the coming years are developed for each business unit.
The total capital requirements across businesses are prioritised with a view to optimise the portfolio of the Group and in line with financial policies. Evaluation parameters include industry attractiveness, financial return forecasts, business performance and overall strategic aspirations. The resulting plan provides the framework for each business unit. Portfolio adjustments are integrated into the plan.
The integrated Group strategy review, portfolio actions and capital prioritisation process starts at the beginning of the year. The Board of Directors have their annual strategy conference at which the Board discusses proposals put forward by the Executive Board and decides on the strategy.

Differentiate through technology and innovation Better use of technology and innovation is critical to maintaining our competitive edge in the digital age. This will be an important driver for reducing cost as well as enhancing our customer experience.
Define growth platforms for the future While we must not lose focus on our core capabilities we also need to identify the areas where we see our future growth stemming from. These could be related to our current businesses or in entirely new areas.

The outcome of the Board of Directors' annual strategy conference will, as in previous years, be communicated in connection with the Group's interim report for the second quarter of 2015. The outcome will be available for download from: http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm

EXECUTION ON GROUP STRATEGY 2014
The Group will create value through profitable growth and by creating winning businesses. The Group seeks to improve the return on invested capital (ROIC) by focused and disciplined capital allocation, portfolio optimisation and performance management. The Group intends to share the value creation by growing ordinary dividends in nominal terms and through initiation of our first share-buy-back programme in 2014.
Contents

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT The Group is focused on performance management, both towards the specific long term goals established for each business unit, as well as on the current operational performance across a range of key performance indicators. Financial targets are set both in absolute terms, as well as relative to the industry.

Maersk Oil has spent more than USD 1bn per year on exploration in 2012 and 2013; less in 2014. Due to the disappointing exploration results over the last couple of years Maersk Oil has decided to reduce its exploration activities, but also consider other means to grow reserves and future production for example by buying shares of existing discoveries or fields.

Target/policy ·To develop world class businesses that achieve above
10% ROIC over the cycle. ·Be top quartile performers in their industry.
Developments in 2014 ·Maersk Line, APM Terminals and Maersk Supply Service
achieved a ROIC above 10%. ·Maersk Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals, Maersk Supply
Service and Svitzer are top quartile performers in their industries. ·Below top quartile performance are Maersk Drilling, Maersk Tankers and Damco. For Maersk Drilling this is due to the high number of drilling rigs on yard stays, however, the operational performance for Maersk Drilling was top quartile. ·Performance in APM Shipping Services was diverse with two business units (Maersk Supply Service and Svitzer) delivering top quartile performance, while two performed below (Maersk Tankers and Damco), albeit with Maersk Tankers performing considerably above the industry average.
CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND GROWTH The Group has an ambition to grow its invested capital, mainly by executing the investment pipeline.
Maersk Drilling and APM Terminals have seen the largest relative increase in their invested capital since Q2 2012, driven by acquisitions and investments in terminals and rigs.

Following a number of years with poor market conditions for Maersk Tankers, it was decided to divest the VLCC segment, thereby significantly decreasing their invested capital.
Target/policy ·75% of the Group's invested capital is to be invested in Maersk
Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling. ·The total invested capital is to grow towards USD 55-60bn
by 2017.

Developments in 2014 ·78% of the Group's invested capital is invested in Maersk
Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling (68% in Q2 2012). ·The invested capital dropped by 5.3% since Q2 2012, adversely impacted by the sale of Dansk Supermarked Group and the USD 3.0bn impairments, including USD 2.2bn in Maersk Oil, of which USD 1.7bn related to the Brazilian assets recognised in 2014. ·71% of all outstanding capital commitments are dedicated to growth in Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT The Group is focused on developing the Group's strong positions in growth markets, and exit businesses that do not support the future strategy.
No acquisitions of companies or activities with significant impact to the Group were undertaken in 2014.

Target/policy ·To actively manage the portfolio of businesses to ensure
focus on the most profitable and least volatile business areas. ·Building a balanced portfolio across several businesses. ·Execute a focused capital allocation.
Developments in 2014 · Cash flow from divestments of USD 4.4bn. Primarily:
­ T he majority share in Dansk Supermarked Group. ­ APM Terminals Virginia, Portsmouth, USA. ·A revised strategy for Maersk Oil, Brazil as resource estimates was significantly reduced. ·Following the decline in oil price, we revised our strategy in Maersk Oil to focus on less expensive resources as well as cost savings. Based on our extensive experiences from shipping, the Group is well-prepared for a sharper cost focus, and both Maersk Oil and Maersk Drilling have embarked on initiatives to drive down costs. ·Exit the Very Large Crude Carriers segment. ·Divestment of drilling activities in Venezuela.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group's profit for the year was USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) and the equity totalled USD 42.2bn (USD 42.5bn).
The review of the financial statement is carried out through the presentation of the Group's businesses.
Contents

INCOME STATEMENT Revenue increased to USD 47.6bn (USD 47.4bn), primarily due to higher container volumes at lower freight rates as well as higher oil entitlement production at a lower average oil price.
Profit increased by USD 1.4bn to USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) impacted by the USD 2.8bn gain from the sale of the majority share of Dansk Supermarked Group and other divestment gains of USD 600m (USD 145m) partly offset by the net impairments after tax of USD 2.2bn primarily related to the Brazilian oil assets of USD 1.7bn, UK oil assets USD 188m, and goodwill in Svitzer USD 357m. Last year was negatively impacted by net impairments of USD 220m mainly related to Maersk Tankers.
Due to improved performance in Danske Bank, the Group's 2008 impairment of USD 202m was reversed in Q4 2014.
Further comments to the profit development are provided per segment below.
MAERSK LINE PERFORMANCE Maersk Line made a profit of USD 2.3bn (USD 1.5bn) and a ROIC of 11.6% (7.4%). The underlying profit was USD 2.2bn or 50% higher than last year (USD 1.5bn).
The EBIT margin gap to peers was estimated at around 9%, which was significantly above the 5% ambition level. The achievement came from 5.4% lower unit costs mainly due to improved network efficiencies and lower bunker price. Efficiencies were achieved through increased volumes in line with market as well as continued vessel network optimisation and active capacity management. Average freight rates decreased by 1.6% to 2,630 USD/FFE (2,674 USD/FFE) and volumes increased by 6.8% to 9,442k FFE (8,839k FFE). Bunker consumption in kg/FFE was reduced by 7.9% and bunker prices decreased by 5.7%.

Recognised freight revenue was USD 25.0bn (USD 23.7bn) and other revenue was USD 2.4bn (USD 2.5bn).
To minimise the impact of the low and volatile freight rate environment, Maersk Line continued to absorb capacity by active capacity management in the form of idling, slow steaming and blanked sailings.
Maersk Line increased the fleet capacity to 2.9m TEU (2.6m TEU) by end of 2014 mainly due to delivery of 11 Triple-E vessels. Five Triple-E vessels suited for the Asia-Europe trade are on order for delivery during first half of 2015. No newbuilding orders were placed during 2014.
Cash flow from operating activities increased by USD 387m to USD 4.1bn compared to 2013. Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased by USD 367m to a total of USD 2.0bn primarily related to the Triple-E newbuildings and containers, leaving a free cash flow of USD 2.1bn on par with 2013.
MAERSK OIL PERFORMANCE Maersk Oil reported a loss of USD 861m (profit of USD 1.0bn) and a ROIC of negative 15.2% (positive 16.2%) with an underlying profit of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.1bn).
The result was negatively affected by net impairments after tax of USD 1.9bn of which USD 1.7bn related to Brazilian assets while the rest primarily related to the UK. The income for 2013 included insurance compensation of USD 205m primarily related to Gryphon.
The underlying result for 2014 was 4% lower than last year mainly due to 9% lower average prices of USD 99 per barrel versus USD 109 per barrel in 2013. This was partly offset by 7% higher entitlement production 251,000 boepd (235,000 boepd) and 33% lower exploration costs USD 765m (USD 1.1bn). The increased entitlement production came primarily

12/110

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

from the UK (34%) and Algeria (31%) partly offset by a decline in Denmark (8%). Operating expenses (excluding exploration costs) increased by 14% to USD 2.8bn (USD 2.5bn) compared to 2013; however the majority of the increase was related to directly recoverable costs and hence with limited impact on the underlying result.
Both Golden Eagle in the UK and Jack in the US Gulf of Mexico came on stream in Q4 2014. Maersk Oil completed 14 exploration and appraisal wells of which 11 were dry. The successful wells were Marconi in the UK, Buckskin in the US Gulf of Mexico and one Johan Sverdrup appraisal well in Norway. Due to disappointing exploration results in the past couple of years coupled with a prolonged depressed oil price scenario, Maersk Oil decided to reduce its exploration activities.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 2.6bn (USD 3.2bn), negatively affected by lower oil prices and increase in operating costs, however, partly offset by higher entitlement production and lower exploration costs. Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased to USD 2.2bn (USD 1.8bn) mainly as a result of overall increased development activities.
The development project at the Al Shaheen field offshore Qatar is progressing as planned and was with 22 wells completed by the end of 2014 almost half way through the drilling programme. Preparation for the further development is being discussed with Qatar Petroleum.
In Angola, tender bids for the Chissonga project have been received. With the low oil price, the project is challenged and negotiations with authorities, partners and contractors are ongoing.
The high pressure ­ high temperature gas field Culzean off shore UK is progressing towards expected sanctioning mid2015 and production start-up in 2019.

A development plan for Phase 1 of the Johan Sverdrup project off shore Norway was submitted to the authorities on 13 February 2015 and sanctioning is expected mid-2015. Maersk Oil's share of the resources is 8.12%; however, the final resource allocation is subject to approval by the Norwegian authorities. For Phase 1, Maersk Oil's share of the costs are expected to be approximately USD 1.8 bn and the production share is expected at a level of 28,000 boepd.
The yearly update of Maersk Oil's reserves and resources as per end of 2013 showed entitlement reserves and resources (2P+2C) of 1.47bn barrels of oil equivalent (1.36bn boe) including proved and probable (2P) reserves of 0.60bn barrels of oil equivalent (0.62bn boe). 2014 reserves and resources numbers will be released in connection with the interim report for the first quarter 2015.
APM TERMINALS PERFORMANCE APM Terminals made a profit of USD 900m (USD 770m) and a ROIC of 14.7% (13.5%) with an underlying profit of USD 849m (USD 709m).
The result was positively impacted by net divestment gains after tax of USD 232m (USD 62m) and negatively affected by USD 181m (USD 0m) impairments related to European activities of which USD 154m was related to joint venture companies.

Volume growth was partially impacted by the sale of APM Terminals Virginia, Portsmouth, USA and Terminal Porte Océane, Le Havre, France. In addition, the sale of 29% voting right in APM Terminals Callao SA, Peru, was completed, as well as the sale of a 24% share of APM Terminals Zeebrugge, Belgium.
Construction of Maasvlakte II, The Netherlands has been completed and operations have commenced, with expected volume ramp up during 2015. A new terminal project was secured in Namibe, Angola through APM Terminals' interest in Sociedade Gestora de Terminais S.A. (Sogester), Angola.
Despite inflationary pressure in growth markets, the EBITDAmargin improved by 2.1% supported by commercial and operational efficiencies resulting in revenue improvements and cost savings generating more than USD 100m primarily through the retendering of several supplier contracts and continuous improvement initiatives across the portfolio.
Cash flow from operating activities of USD 925m (USD 923m) was impacted negatively by tax payments of USD 142m related to divestment gains as well as slightly deteriorating working capital. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was more than offset by cash flow generated from divestments leading to a net positive cash flow from capital expenditure of USD 2m (negative USD 841m).

The increased underlying profit came as a result of the number of containers handled by APM Terminals (weighted with APM Terminals' ownership interest) growing in line with the market by 5.3% to 38.3m TEU (36.3m TEU) supported by terminals becoming fully operational and broad growth across the portfolio. The volumes from customers outside the Group grew by 3.5%. Total revenue increased by 2.8%, port revenue exceeded the volume growth and revenue from inland services decreased due to divestment of activities in the Americas and Asia as part of continued efforts to optimise the portfolio.

APM Terminals continued a high level of investment in the development of its port interests both in the form of new projects and expansions to existing ports. Invested capital came in at USD 5.9bn (USD 6.2bn) a decrease of 4% compared to the previous year due to divestments.
MAERSK DRILLING PERFORMANCE Maersk Drilling reported a profit of USD 478m (USD 528m) and a ROIC of 7.1% (10.8%). The underlying profit was USD 471m (USD 524m).

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

The result was positively impacted by a gain of USD 73m from the divestment of all activities in Venezuela and high operational uptime across the fleet, while planned maintenance of the fleet, start-up of new rigs and impairments negatively impacted the result. As a result of the weakened market for offshore rigs Maersk Drilling made an impairment of USD 85m (USD 74m after tax) of which USD 50m (USD 38m after tax) relates to the joint venture Egyptian Drilling Company in Egypt.
All of Maersk Drillings 21 jack-up and floater rigs have been on contract throughout 2014. The overall higher revenue was supported by 100% contract coverage and by a high operational performance across the rig fleet with average uptime 97% (97%) for the jack-up rigs and 96% (96%) for the floating rigs.
By the end of 2014, Maersk Drillings' forward contract coverage was 80% for 2015, 52% for 2016 and 30% for 2017. The total revenue backlog by the end of 2014 amounted to USD 6.0bn (USD 7.9bn).
Operating costs increased due to additional start-up costs for the five newbuildings with contract commencement during 2014 and the remaining three newbuildings to be delivered during 2015 and 2016. The cost level on the existing fleet excluding newbuildings was on par with cost in 2013.
Five yard stays for planned surveys and upgrades were completed in 2014. Further, two offshore class surveys and upgrade programmes were completed in 2014.
Maersk Drilling took delivery of five newbuilds, including three ultra deepwater drillships and two ultra-harsh environment jack-up rigs during 2014. Maersk Drilling has three rigs under construction with two to be delivered in first quarter of 2015 and one in 2016.
The lower cash flow from operating activities of USD 701m (USD 775m) was mainly related to the higher operating costs combined with an increase in net working capital due to the

higher activity level from five more rigs operating end of 2014 compared to 2013. Cash flow used for capital expenditures of USD 2.2bn was USD 643m higher than last year mainly due to instalments paid for the newbuildings.
APM SHIPPING SERVICES PERFORMANCE APM Shipping Services made a loss of USD 230m (loss of USD 85m) and a negative ROIC of 4.2% (negative 1.3%). The underlying profit was USD 185m (USD 37m).
Maersk Supply Service reported an improved profit of USD 201m (USD 187m) and a ROIC of 11.9% (10.7%). The underlying profit was USD 189m (USD 182m).
The 2014 result was positively impacted by a strong second half of the year after a challenging first half. In the third quarter the market improved significantly, especially for large Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessels (AHTS), and in combination with sales gains Maersk Supply Service reached a 2014 result slightly above the previous year.
Maersk Supply Service entered the year with good contract coverage and during the year concluded a number of new long term contracts as well as extensions in key markets covering Africa, Australia, Brazil, Canada as well as the North Sea where the majority of the fleet is employed. Contract coverage going into 2015 is 50% and 29% for 2016 excluding options.
Operating costs were USD 430m (USD 423m) with the increase mainly driven by modification projects, higher repair and maintenance costs as well as increased stores cost. This was partly offset by lower commissions.
During the year Maersk Supply Service sold four vessels resulting in sales gains of USD 12m (USD 5m).
As part of the extensive investment plans Maersk Supply Service has been active ordering vessels to support the growth strategy

focusing on high-end AHTS and Subsea Support Vessels (SSVs). A total of 11 newbuildings were ordered during the year (one Cable Layer, four SSVs and six AHTS). Consequently cash flow used for capital expenditure increased to USD 188m (USD 81m). Cash flow from operations remained nearly unchanged at USD 356m (USD 360m).
Maersk Tankers made a profit of USD 132m (loss of USD 317m) and a positive ROIC of 6.8% (negative 10.4%). The underlying profit was USD 139m (loss of USD 172m).
The result was positively affected by improved earnings for the LR2 and VLCC segments, cost saving initiatives and reversal of provision for onerous contracts of USD 87m (provision of USD 144m), offset by lower activity following the divestment of the Gas segment in 2013.
Time charter equivalent (TCE) earnings in the VLCC segment improved, particular in the first half of the year and kept stable throughout 2014. Average TCE earnings in the Product segments increased with 4% compared to 2013 driven by LR2. Total TCE earnings were negatively impacted by the divestment of the Gas segment in 2013 and the gradual delivery of the VLCC vessels to its new owners.
Operating cost decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 as a result of cost saving initiatives contributing positively with USD 22m, the divestment of the Gas and VLCC segments and reversal of the provision for onerous contracts.
Depreciation and amortisation decreased by USD 63m compared with 2013, driven by the divestment of the Gas and VLCC segments. Net impairments in 2014 were USD 4m (USD 153m).
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 232m (USD 223m), positively impacted by improved operating margin and reduction in net working capital, offset by the lower activity from the

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

reduced fleet. Net cash flow from capital expenditures was positive USD 650m (positive USD 748m), primarily driven by the divestments of the VLCC segment.
Damco made a loss of USD 293m (loss of USD 111m) and a ROIC of negative 63.2% (negative 22.0%). The result was impacted by significant impairment losses of USD 68m (USD 6m), mainly related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets as well as reduced profitability in the ocean and airfreight activities despite an improving but still unsatisfactory overhead cost level.
Revenue was USD 3.2bn (USD 3.2bn) with volumes growing by 11% for Supply Chain Management whereas the ocean freight volumes declined by 6% and airfreight volumes fell by 16%. Margins in all three segments were under pressure and declined through 2014.
The additional visibility achieved through standard system roll-outs and the strengthening of the control framework revealed further exposures in certain geographies and product categories. This resulted in several adjustments which impacted the result negatively.
The restructuring initiatives and roll-out of the new operating platform have proven more complex than originally anticipated, generating delays in getting the planned productivity improvements to materialise. Consequently, overhead cost has remained above the desired level and additional organisational rightsizing was initiated during 2014, adding more restructuring cost with benefits expected for 2015 and onwards. The restructuring initiatives are expected to strengthen commercial competitiveness and get Damco back to profitable growth in 2015.
Cash flow from operating activities was negative USD 201m (negative USD 14m) due to the result development and increased working capital following the roll-out of a new operating system.

Svitzer made a loss of USD 270m (profit of USD 156m) and a ROIC of negative 19.2% (positive 10.8%). The underlying profit was USD 82m (USD 134m).
The result development was affected by net impairment of USD 354m (USD 6m) primarily goodwill related to the 2007 Adsteam acquisition in Australia. Svitzer's Australian operations are negatively impacted by industry overcapacity, a high industrial cost structure and a general slowdown of bulk activities.
The underlying result was impacted by writedown of long outstanding salvage receivables and a provision for redundancies in the harbor towage segment.
Revenue was USD 812m (USD 831m) with growth seen in new activities in Europe countered by a negative impact from competition in Australia together with a general slowdown in Australian bulk ports and the divestment of Svitzer's spot fleet in Asia.
Terminal towage developed satisfactory, however overall profits were negatively impacted by the sale of two joint ventures in 2013.
Low levels of emergency response activity in the salvage market continued throughout 2014.
Cost increased by USD 28m primarily due to start-up of new operations and terminal towage projects, and due to a general cost increase in Australia. In 2014, Svitzer launched programmes to improve crew and onshore productivity with further savings to materialise in 2015.
Cash flow from operating activities increased to USD 203m (USD 180m) driven by improved collection of receivables partly offset by lower operating result and higher tax. Cash flow from investing activities increased to USD 235m (USD 2m) mainly due to investments in vessels for new terminal towage contracts as

well as replacement vessels. Investments in 2013 were offset by the sale of joint ventures.
OTHER BUSINESSES Other businesses made a profit of USD 408m (USD 400m). The primary contributor was the Group's share of the result in Danske Bank of USD 330m compared to USD 254m in 2013. The Group's share of underlying result in Danske Bank was USD 449m, excluding the bank's impairment of USD 321m and reversal of the Group's 2008 goodwill impairment of USD 202m. The remaining activities were primarily affected by divestment activities in 2013.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Dansk Supermarked Group contributed with a profit of USD 2.9bn (USD 394m). Excluding divestment gain, the profit was USD 81m (USD 394m).
UNALLOCATED ACTIVITIES Unallocated activities comprise revenue and cost, etc. which is not attributed to reportable segments, including purchase of bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of companies in the Group as well as financial items. The financial items were negative by USD 606m (negative by USD 716m); the decrease in net financial expenses was primarily driven by lower net interest expenses due to lower net debt, lower interest rates and higher capitalised borrowing costs.
TAX Companies in the Group are taxed under different tax regimes, depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to some of the Group's activities.
As a general rule, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage based or similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the fleet's tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the normal corporate tax rate.
The total tax charge for the Group in 2014 was USD 3.0bn (USD 3.2bn) of which taxes payable to Denmark were USD 0.8bn (USD 1.1bn). The amounts related to the special hydrocarbon tax were USD 0.5bn (USD 0.6bn) and USD 0.3bn (USD 0.5bn) represented corporate tax on oil activities. The decrease in the special hydrocarbon tax was largely due to the drop in oil prices. The shipping activities' tax payment to Denmark was USD 13m (USD 20 m).
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income for the year was USD 3.6bn (USD 4.3bn) and includes the profit for the year of USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) and other comprehensive income which was negative by USD 1.6bn (positive by USD 0.5bn). Other comprehensive income mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow hedges and actuarial gains and losses.
BALANCE SHEET At 31 December 2014, total assets amounted to USD 68.8bn (USD 74.5bn).
Intangible assets decreased to USD 2.8bn (USD 4.8bn), mainly due to the impairment of USD 1.7bn on the Brazilian oil rights.
Property, plant and equipment of USD 44.7bn (USD 41.3bn) increased by USD 3.4bn with investments in the year of USD 8.9bn (USD 6.9bn). Depreciation for the year was USD 4.2bn (USD 4.3bn) and net impairment losses of USD 421m (USD 165m) were recognised. Sale of tangible assets amounted to USD 512m (USD 4.9bn) including the transfer to held for sale in 2013 of the Dansk Supermarked Group. Currency adjustments resulted in a decrease of USD 399m (decrease of USD 91m).

Shares in associated companies decreased to USD 839m (USD 6.4bn) primarily due to the reclassification of the Danske Bank shares to held for sale.
Derivatives were as of 31 December 2014 a net liability of USD 500m (net asset of USD 125m). The movement was primarily related to the USD appreciating against main hedging currencies.
Cash and cash equivalents totalled USD 3.5bn (USD 3.3bn) at 31 December 2014, including offsetting bank overdrafts of USD 102m (USD 102m).
Assets held for sale of net USD 5.3bn (USD 6.9bn) comprised assets expected to be sold during 2015 including the shares in Danske Bank.
Equity totalled USD 42.2bn (USD 42.5bn). The decrease was related to the sale of the Dansk Supermarked Group of USD 2.1bn, the share buy-back of USD 653m, exchange rate adjustments of USD 1.2bn, cash flow hedges of USD 288m and dividend paid USD 1.3bn (USD 1.1bn). The reduction was partly offset by the profit for the year of USD 5.2bn.
The actuarial net liability for pensions, etc. in relation to defined benefit plans recognised totalled USD 217m (USD 261m) at 31 December 2014. Developments in the actuarial assumptions as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements resulted in actuarial losses of USD 9m (gains of USD 50m), which are included in other comprehensive income. In 2014, the Group paid USD 81m (USD 68m) to defined benefit plans.
Deferred tax liabilities totalled USD 701m (USD 1.1bn) at 31 December 2014, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled USD 536m (USD 478m). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of USD 1.5bn (USD 812m) have not been recognised, cf. note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities USD 8.8bn (USD 8.9bn) was negatively impacted by increased tax payments of USD 466m which was partly offset by improved working capital as well as less interest paid.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 6.2bn (USD 4.9bn). The increase was mainly due to higher investments in Maersk Drilling, Maersk Line and Maersk Oil. Cash flow from financing activities was negative by USD 4.7bn (negative by USD 2.6bn) impacted by larger repayments of loans following the sale of Dansk Supermarked Group.
OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS The present value of the operating lease commitments totalled USD 7.7bn at 31 December 2014 (USD 8.7bn at 31 December 2013) using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into the following main items: ·Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of USD 3.8bn (USD 4.6bn)
primarily relating to vessels on time charter ·APM Terminals of USD 3.1bn (USD 3.2bn) primarily related
to future concession fees for port facilities ·Other commitments of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.9bn).
About one-third of the time charter payments in Maersk Line and in Maersk Tankers are estimated to relate to operational costs for the assets. Please refer to note 17 in the consolidated financial statements for an overview of maturity.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Framework In 2014 a revised Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework was rolled out, enabling and supporting a consistent, robust and focused approach to assessing the three main categories comprising the Group's risk universe, namely the Known Risks, Emerging Risks and Portfolio Risks. The three pillars are explored through a combination of risk reporting, internal reviews, external expert input and analysis. The main findings are presented to the Executive Board as well as the Board of Directors, and serve as input to the annual strategic review and capital allocation processes.
Contents

The Audit Committee annually reviews the process for potential improvements and further development of the Group risk management approach. In conjunction with the further development of ERM processes and deepening integration of the framework, the Committee continues to emphasise its focus on progressing ERM within the Group.
KNOWN RISKS Known risks are considered actual risks to business objectives within the planning period, 2015-2020. While some risks are integral in the industries we operate in and are therefore accepted as part of our operations and managed accordingly, several such risks continue to have the potential of adversely impacting our business in the short to medium term, such as:
A sharp and prolonged drop in oil prices constitutes a risk as we are increasingly targeting technologically demanding and costly industry segments. The recent substantial decline in the oil price during the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015, has led to reduced cash flows primarily from our oil and drilling operations. Depending on market developments, it may jeopardise the longer term strategy of securing commercially viable contacts for Maersk Drilling and delivering on our 2020 target of 400 thousand barrels of daily entitlement production in Maersk Oil. Ultimately this could impact our ability to meet our financial targets.
The Board of Directors perform an annual strategy review to ensure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed according to market developments including developments in the oil price.
A major accident or oil spill remains an inherent risk in the Group's operations, particularly in the oil and gas, offshore and tanker businesses. A high severity incident would first and foremost present a risk to our employees as well as potentially the marine environment, wildlife and local community. Additionally it could result in large scale impact on assets, cash position, and reputation and put our licence to operate at risk. The Group is supporting incident free operations to mitigate this risk.

A major cyber-attack could prove crucial to our ability to operate and deliver on our commitments, as the Group is involved in complex and wide ranging global services, making it highly dependent on well-functioning IT-systems. Business disruptions could be as severe as lasting several months, impacting our fleet's and off-shore equipment's ability to safely continue operations. The Group is monitoring the cyber threat closely and proactively addresses it through enhancements of our cyber resilience and focus on business continuity.
A potential widening of the container liner business supplydemand imbalance is a perpetuated threat in an environment with increasing tonnage and moderate global demand growth. A structural gap and overcapacity, coupled with the significant exposure Maersk Line has on the Asia-Europe trade where the larger vessels are increasingly deployed, leaves the Group vulnerable to significant fluctuations in freight rates and the risk of sustaining commercial losses. The risk is mitigated by designing a competitive network, building up customer loyalty, simplifying the organisation and optimising the network through alliances and vessel sharing agreements, such as the 2M.
EMERGING RISKS Emerging risks are potential future risks, looking over a time horison beyond that of the planning period. It is a strong underlying modus operandi, that the Group pursues a sustainable long term business and growth strategy. This means we need to proactively consider future uncertainties that may affect and potentially put such an aspiration at risk, which is done through a comprehensive process aimed at identifying emerging long term threats. Some of the emerging risks identified, were addressed through deep dive studies which were completed through 2013 and 2014.
An oil study examined the potential of global oil demand to peak between 2020 and 2030 as consumers may switch away from oil towards other sources of energy. In such an event, oil prices would buoy within a delimited oil price corridor, with

18/110

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014

costs of new incremental sources of oil supply constituting a price floor, while accelerated shifts away from oil as an energy source, and hence easing demand, would serve as a ceiling. Such an outcome may leave the profit pool for the global oil industry challenged due to lower profit margins and volumes. Similarly it would pose a downside risk to the demand for offshore drilling rigs and other related oil service industries.
A separate deep dive investigated plausible ways of meeting a global sulphur emission cap of maximum 0.5%, which is expected to be introduced in the shipping industry in 2020 or 2025. The study found several possible compliance options to be considered. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of implementation, choosing the right future fuel solution at

the right time is not straight forward, but it has the potential of providing relative competitive advantages, conversely acting prematurely may result in unnecessary costs. Ensuring proper enforcement post potential implementation was identified as a key uncertainty and will remain a focus, while we prepare to take a well-informed compliance decision.
An industry analysis had the objective of depicting potential scenarios for future developments in the Exploration & Production (E&P) landscape faced by Maersk Oil and its peers. The analysis revolved around the challenges and opportunities among groups of E&P companies in the different scenarios, and included an assessment of various strategies and the potential implications of such for Maersk Oil and its selected long term portfolio growth strategy.

a well-diversified portfolio of businesses able to absorb shocks inflicting volatility within single businesses.
This is also evidenced when considering the Group's combined NOPAT volatility, which is 33% lower than the volatility of each of the individual businesses. From a geographic risk point of view, the portfolio on average remains in the moderate category.
The Group's approved investments may modestly increase the average exposure for each USD invested, but will remain well-balanced by substantial investments in a number of low risk countries, see the graph "Country risk and asset value".

Overall the emerging risks studies aim at increasing our understanding of the uncertainty elements facing us in the future and enable us in improving the Groups readiness for same.
Looking at trends ahead, one risk has emerged and strengthened, namely the ongoing significant increase in vessel size, solidified by the arrival of the Triple-E vessels. On this backdrop, the topic for a 2014/2015 deep dive study is the potential impact and general risk picture surrounding Large Vessel Disasters.
PORTFOLIO RISKS Being a global conglomerate, while spanning across multiple geographies and industries, the Group also considers risks associated with its composition of businesses and countries of operation. This means that when managing our portfolio, both dimensions need to be assessed and considered, i.e. the balance in our industry exposure and our geographic presence.
Looking at the correlation between the main businesses, see the graph "Impact of diversification", suggests that managing them as a portfolio in a conglomerate as opposed to four standalone businesses, reduces the associated risks. It also implies

OWN SHARES The Board of Directors decided to initiate a share buy-back programme of up to DKK 5.6bn (approximately USD 1bn) to be executed during a 12 months period beginning September 2014. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to adjust the capital structure of the company and to meet the obligations arising from employee share option programmes. The Groups holding of own shares comprised 1.8% of the share capital end of 2014, cf. note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
DIVIDEND The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 280 per share of DKK 1,000). The proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% (2.4%), based on the Maersk B shares closing price as of 30 December 2014. Payment is expected to take place on 7th April 2015. The Group intends to continue the historical trend of increasing dividends nominally per share supported by underlying earnings strength.

In addition to the ordinary dividend the Board of Directors will declare, subject to authorisation from the shareholders, an extraordinary cash dividend equal to the prevailing market value of the Group's 20.05% ownership interest in Danske Bank A/S. The extraordinary dividend will be determined based on the Volume Weighted Average Price of Danske Bank A/S' shares traded during a pricing period of five trading days, expected to commence Friday 20 March and expire Thursday 26 March 2015. No extraordinary dividend will be paid to treasury shares. Based on the value of the shares on 31 December 2014, the value of the extraordinary dividend is estimated to DKK 33,850m equivalent to USD 5,530m using the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014 (around DKK 1,569 per share of DKK 1,000 excluding treasury shares).

In 2014, we have seen continued progress and actions towards our diversity goals. More information on diversity can be obtained from the Group's Sustainability Report.

started to pay off with local nationals emerging in the Maersk Oil talent pools and a doubling of Qataris in leadership positions within a year.

The businesses units each have their key priorities and focus areas to support their respective strategies; below are examples from the Group's business units.
For Maersk Line, teamwork, focus and simplicity are consistently emphasised as behaviours that are critical driving performance and making Maersk Line a sustainable top quartile performer. The Maersk Line Operating system was introduced in 2014 to drive business goals through a standard operating model. This system will help to drive focus, teamwork and simplicity whilst allowing our employees to maximise their potential and grow the business.
The talent review process has also been simplified and standardised across Maersk Line in 2014. A standard Talent Management toolbox is now available across the company to ensure that employees are able to develop to their full potential A new leadership development programme will be introduced that will help develop and drive value creation from talent whilst keeping employees motivated and inspired by world class leaders.
Maersk Oil benefits from its good demographic profile compared to industry peers. The early career employee group was strengthened by the annual inflow from the successful MITAS programme (Maersk International Technology and Science Programme), with a 2014 batch of 19 nationalities and 36% females. The share of mid-career professionals and overall group of technical experts is high compared with the industry, and provide Maersk Oil with a strong base to address the operational performance and project execution focus in 2014.

APM Terminals unfortunately suffered 10 fatal accidents in 2014. These fatalities primarily involved sub-contractors on the APM Terminals' premises. APM Terminals continuously drives towards safe operations across the business in a pursuit to eliminate unsafe behaviour.
During 2014 APM Terminals introduced several new initiatives and safety drives to further improve conditions across the portfolio. These include the campaign "Care for Contractors" increasing awareness and focus towards the safety of sub-contractors working on terminals and inland service sites and Project Stack, an initiative to improve safer container handling at the cost of productivity.
Since 2011 Maersk Drilling has invested USD 5.3bn in eight new rigs with delivery in 2014-16 requiring a total of 1,450 new employees of which around 550 were hired during 2014. Maersk Drilling has the aim to remain at the forefront of innovation to ensure safe operation for people and environment, and to ensure a safe and efficient operation of the new rigs all new employees have been enrolled in on-boarding and training programmes.

The focus on local workforce development, strategically important in countries like Qatar, Kazakhstan and Angola, has

INNOVATION
The Group invests to ensure cuttingedge technology solutions across its businesses. Innovation is focused on: · Delivering better services · Protecting employees · Minimising environmental impact · Creating new business opportunities · Ensuring cost-effectiveness.
Technological innovation is carried out by technology divisions within the Group's business units, in close cooperation with manufacturers, shipyards, suppliers, universities and research institutes. Here are examples from the Group's business units.

DIFFERENTIATE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION Better use of technology and innovation is critical to maintaining the Group's competitive edge in the digital age and this will be an important driver for reducing cost as well as enhancing our customer experience.
Maersk Line Maersk Line has begun a journey to modernise its customer interaction in line with the digital age, and the other business units will also leverage from this.
The Group must take inspiration from leading global players to reassess how we drive innovation in our own business.
Maersk Line actively works to achieve a combination of emissions reduction and cost savings through innovation to mutual benefit of the environment and the business. We do this in close collaboration with key suppliers and third parties. For instance Maersk Line is a key partner in the `BlueINNOship' innovation platform with the goal to jointly develop technologies to improve environmental performance over the coming four years.
Maersk Line tests and evaluates technologies to prepare for upcoming regulations such as abatement technologies to reduce air emissions including the upcoming limits in sulfur emissions.
Maersk Line continues the retrofit programmes to update the existing fleet with the most energy and cost efficient technologies, examples include: ·Redesign propeller to improve efficiency at the actual
sailing speeds ·Improve fuel efficiency by de-rating and tune the engine
for actual sailing speeds ·Elevate the navigation bridge to increase capacity.

In addition, Maersk Line collects an increased level of operational Vessel data to improve performance and support planning of most fuel efficient voyages.
Maersk Line uses Information Technology in most of its innovation projects and strives to increase the pace in which we evaluate and employ current and future technology trends.
An objective for Maersk Line is to improve the way information is exchanged and processed in container shipping. Maersk Line is working closely with universities, governments, business partners to identify technology and concepts that can help reduce administrative barriers by standardising the exchange of shipping information between all parties: Customers, authorities, terminals/ports and carriers.
Information Technology plays a key role in the way Maersk Line interacts with customers. From CRM and to web-based e-commerce and sales support solutions. In the end of 2014, we launched a smartphone/tablet app, which gives our key customers full access to updated information and metrics about the customers' transport activities with Maersk Line; from carbon footprint to whether shipments were delivered on time. The app is unique in the industry and the high level of transparency enables a fact-based dialogue and faster resolution of issues.
Maersk Oil Maersk Oil is seeking to establish a business advantage by being good at extracting hydrocarbons from challenging reservoirs such as tight chalk reservoirs in the North Sea. The company strives constantly to push the technology to new boundaries and has held several records in the field of horisontal drilling. Innovation is an important priority inside the company as well as when interacting with partners. A good example is the Danish Hydrocarbon Research & Technology Centre, which was launched in September 2014

based on funding of DKK 1bn from the Danish Underground Consortium where Maersk Oil holds 31.2% interest. Close to 100 researchers will be focusing on development of technical solutions which can increase the recovery of oil and gas from the Danish North Sea. In Qatar, new technology development also is in focus at the Maersk Oil Research and Technology Centre where 15 researchers investigate new methods for increasing hydrocarbon recovery from the complex carbonate reservoirs of the Maersk Oil operated, giant Al Shaheen field. One key research programme investigates how the reservoir injection of water with varying chemical and ionic compositions can liberate a larger volume of the oil adhering to the tight and irregular rock surfaces.

Maersk Drilling BP and Maersk Drilling announced in February 2013 a joint study agreement to develop conceptual engineering designs for a new breed of advanced technology drilling rigs that will be critical to unlocking the next frontier of deepwater oil and gas resources. Called 20KTM rigs, the BP-Maersk Drilling agreement will result in developing deepwater drilling rigs that can safely and efficiently operate in high-pressure and high-temperature reservoirs up to 20,000 pounds per square inch and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Implementing new technology in Maersk Drilling's fleet is critical in order to maintain our competitive advantage in the offshore drilling market, as customers prefer modern, safe and more efficient rigs.

Maersk Oil is pursuing a strategy of protecting own developed technology by filing patent applications for new inventions. 28 new inventions were made in 2014 and are currently being evaluated in a number of countries. 8 new patents were granted in 2014. The Company currently holds 93 patents.

APM Terminals APM Terminals has completed the construction of Maasvlakte II in Rotterdam, The Netherlands and has commenced operations with an expected volume ramp up to occur during 2015. With this, Maasvlakte II has become the world's most technologically advanced automated terminal. Many of the systems and technologies being implemented in this terminal will also be utilised at APM Terminals' new project at Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico. The terminal is expected open in mid-2015, and will be the first automated container terminal in Latin America. Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico will feature fully automated electric yard stacking cranes and shuttle carriers will be used for transport between the yard cranes and ship to shore cranes. APM Terminals continues to seek out new opportunities in growth markets where value can be added through the implementation of automated terminals that provide safe and sustainable terminal services to clients.

APM Terminals and Maersk Line have entered into a commercial agreement whereby Maersk Line is secured dedicated capacity in certain strategically important terminals. Under the terms of the agreement, substantially all of the risks and benefits associated with ownership of these terminals are transferred to Maersk Line.
Management has chosen not to apply finance lease accounting for the internal reporting and accordingly these terminals are still reported as part of APM Terminals in the segment information. The effect for APM Terminals is an increase of USD 97m (USD 70m) in revenue and USD 66m (USD 42m) in EBIT excluding the gains or losses in connection with the de-recognition of non-current assets. Maersk Line is affected by the same amount on cost and EBIT.
The agreement has no effect on the Group as the transactions are eliminated in the consolidation.

Geographical information Revenue for the shipping activities is based on the destination for ships operated by the Group and on customer location for ships on time charter. For non-current assets, which cannot be easily moved (e.g. drilling rigs, oil producing facilities, etc.), geographical location is where the assets are located. For all other assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership. These assets consist mainly of ships and containers registered in China, Denmark, Singapore, United Kingdom and the USA.

1 The number of shares are restated to include the issue of bonus shares.
Additions of own shares related to the buy-back programme initiated in September 2014. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to adjust the capital structure of the Company and to meet the obligations arising from employee share option programmes or other allocations of shares to employees of the Company. At the Company's annual general meetings in 2015 and 2016, a resolution will be proposed that shares acquired, which are not used for hedging purposes of the ongoing incentives programmes, will be cancelled.
Disposals of own shares are primarily related to the share option programme.
Based on the parent company's profit of USD 7,984m (USD 1,300m), the Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 ­ a total of DKK 6,593m, equivalent to USD 1,077m at the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014 (DKK 280 per share of DKK 1,000 ­ a total of DKK 6,154m equivalent to USD 1,137m).
In addition to the ordinary dividend the Board of Directors will declare, subject to authorisation from the shareholders, an extraordinary cash dividend equal to the prevailing market value of the Group's 20.05% ownership interest in Danske Bank A/S. The extraordinary dividend will be determined based on the Volume Weighted Average Price of Danske Bank A/S' shares traded during a pricing period of five trading days, expected to commence Friday 20 March and expire Thursday 26 March 2015. Based on the value of the shares on 31 December 2014, the value of the extraordinary dividend is estimated to DKK 33,850m equivalent to USD 5,530m using the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014 (around DKK 1,569 per share of DKK 1,000 excluding treasury shares).
Payment of all dividends is expected to take place on 7 April 2015.
Payment of dividends to shareholders does not trigger taxes to the Group.

NOTE 14 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

As employer, the Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which the Group operates. As a main rule, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprises' share of the obligation is not available.
In 2015, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 68m to funded defined benefit plans (USD 79m in 2014).

NOTE 14 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

The majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are in the UK (76%) and the USA (14%). All of the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the USA are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.
Overall the plans have an average duration of 15 years and approximately 49% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.
As well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher than expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation (although some minimum and maximum limits apply).

Rates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections (1.25% in 2014 and 2013) for all UK plans.

The liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19. The sensitivity of the liabilities and pension cost to the key assumptions are as follows:

The Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis and if the plan is in deficit the Trustees agree with the Group on a plan for recovering that deficit.
The expected contributions to the UK plans for 2015 are USD 45m (USD 55m in 2014) of which USD 5m (USD 15m in 2014) is deficit recovery contributions. In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Officer's Pension Fund contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2014, an adjustment of USD 0m (USD 18m) was applied in this respect.

1 Of which USD 1m was included under Discontinued operations.

Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, some entities in the Group participate together with other employers in defined benefit pension and health insurance schemes for current and retired employees (multi-employer plans).The Group has joint and several liability to fund total obligations. In 2014, the Group's contributions are estimated at USD 135m (USD 121m). The Group's share of total contributions paid to the pension schemes over the past 5 years is in the range of 7% to 13%. The contributions to be paid in 2015 are expected to be USD 140m (USD 128m).

No reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. The Group's share might be significant and deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Based on the most recent available financial data from the plans' trustees, according to US GAAP, the plan assets totalled USD 8.1bn (USD 7.3bn) and the actuarial value of obligations approximately USD 9.8bn (USD 9.7bn). Net obligations in the plans with deficits totalled USD 2.2bn (USD 2.8bn). Financial data for the three major plans that constitute 70% of total obligations and 68% of total plan assets is less than 1.5 years old. In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

Hedges comprise primarily of currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and option contracts are used to hedge the currency risk related to recognised and unrecognised transactions. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate exposure on borrowings. Price hedge derivatives are entered into to hedge crude oil prices and bunker prices.

Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment respectively.
Interest rate derivatives swap floating to fixed rates on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement concurrently with the hedged interest expenses. They are also used to swap fixed rates to floating rates, of which some are fair value hedges.
Furthermore, the Group enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.

The main part of the closing balance and the addition during 2014 comprises the 19% share in Dansk Supermarked Group. The estimated fair value in DKK in December is equal to the initial valuation of the 19%. The decrease in the carrying amount of the investment in 2014 can be attributed to the development in the DKK/USD exchange rate.
The valuation is based primarily on a discounted cash flow model with reference to selected listed peers. The model relies on a discount rate of 7.4% reflecting a weighted average of an assumed discount rate for the retail business and an assumed yield for the real estate business as well as a long term terminal growth rate of 2%. All other things being equal, a 0.25% change in the discount rate will affect other comprehensive income and equity by USD 35-50m.

Notes/Financials

NOTE 18 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC.
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: · Market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk · Credit risk · Liquidity risk.
The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's business units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2014.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2014. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.
Currency risk The Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from shipping and oil-related activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including APM Terminals, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
· Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated
cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed, is estimated to have a negative impact on the Group's profit before tax by USD 0.1bn (USD 0.2bn) and the Group's equity, excluding tax, negatively by USD 0.3bn (USD 0.4bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 16 and 17, and are thus not an expression of the Group's total currency risk.

NOTE 18 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC. -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

Interest rate risk The Group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP and SEK.
The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.6 years (2.0 years). A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by approximately USD 22m (USD 34m). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be positive by approximately USD 59m (USD 53m).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Credit risk The Group has exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.

Liquidity risk The equity share of total equity and liabilities was 61.3% at the end of 2014 (57.1%). The Group's long term objective is to maintain a conservative financial solvency profile. Capital is managed for the Group as a whole.

1 Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, securities and cash and bank balances, excluding balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions.

In addition to the liquidity reserve, the Group had committed loans of USD 1.1bn which are dedicated to financing of specific assets and therefore will only become available at certain times in the future. USD 0.5bn of this amount was cancelled in January 2015 due to the Group's strong liquidity position and the relatively high cost of the loans.

Based on the liquidity reserve, the size of the committed loan facilities, including loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.

The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about five years at 31 December 2013).

It is of great importance for the Group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Group's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Group's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014
NOTE 24 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements for 2014 for the A.P. Moller ­ Maersk Group have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2013 except for the below areas:
·The Group has changed its presentation currency from DKK to USD. As a consequence, the translation reserve in equity has been changed. The effect as of 1 January 2013 is presented in the statement of changes in equity.

CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.
Joint arrangements are entities in which the Group, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.
Entities in which the Group exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered to be associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, part-owned vessels and pool arrangements, which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to the Group's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.

Notes/Financials

Non-controlling interests' share of profit or loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned is included as part of the Group's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES Upon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Any subsequent changes to contingent acquisition costs are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
When the Group ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as gain (or loss) on sale of non-current assets. The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.
The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For the Group's principal shipping and drilling activities and oil and gas activities, the functional currency is USD. This means that, among other things, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency in the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The allocation of business activities into segments reflects the Groups character as a conglomerate and is in line with the internal management reporting. Some activities are related, but are managed individually. The reportable segments are as follows:

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014
NOTE 24 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- CONTINUED

Maersk Line Maersk Oil APM Terminals
Maersk Drilling
Maersk Supply Service Maersk Tankers Damco Svitzer

Global container services Oil and gas production and exploration activities C ontainer terminal activities, inland transportation, container depots and repair of containers, etc. Offshore drilling activities and operation of land-rigs through 50% ownership of Egyptian Drilling Company Supply vessel activities with anchor handling and platform supply vessels, etc. Tanker shipping of crude oil, oil products and gas Logistic and forwarding activities Towing and salvage activities, etc.

In addition, the Group comprises other businesses, which neither individually nor in aggregate constitute reportable segments. These include, inter alia, Maersk Container Industry, Maersk Aviation, Maersk Training and various service entities within the energy industry, as well as investments in the associated companies Danske Bank, Höegh Autoliners and DFDS (sold in 2013).
The reportable segments do not comprise costs in group functions. Also, oil hedging activities in Maersk Oil Trading and the results of Maersk Oil Trading's activity in the form of purchasing bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of entities in the Group are not allocated to business segments.
Revenue between segments is limited except for Terminal activities and Damco, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Group's container shipping activities. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Segment profit or loss (NOPAT), assets and liabilities comprise items directly related to or which can be allocated to segments. Financial assets and liabilities and financial income and expenses are not attributed to business segments. With no effect on the Group`s results or financial position, long term agreements between segments on reserved capacity in container terminals are treated as operating leases, where under IFRS they are classified as finance leases.
INCOME STATEMENT Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of risk to the buyer.
Revenue from shipping activities is recognised as the service is provided, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Any detention and demurrage fees are recognised at the time of

Notes/Financials

customers' late return or pick-up of containers. Revenue is recognised net of discounts and rebates, some of which are estimated based on volume incentives and other factors.
Oil and gas sales are recognised as revenue upon discharge from the production site. In agreements where tax is settled in oil, this tax is recognised both as revenue and tax.
Revenue from terminal operations, logistics, forwarding activities and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is also included.
For drilling activities, which are typically carried out under long term agreements with fixed day rates, revenue is recognised for the production time related to the financial year.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term.
Exploration costs in the oil and gas activities are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
Share in profits of associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments, including goodwill, and their reversal.
Tax comprises an estimate of current and deferred tax as well as adjustments to previous years of those. Income tax is tax on taxable profits and consists of corporation tax, hydrocarbon tax in Denmark and other countries, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax and oil tax based on gross measures. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Oil tax on gross measures is a special tax on the production of hydrocarbons, and is separately disclosed within tax to provide clarity over the Group's overall tax expense.
Tax is recognised in income statement to the extent it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax of gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.
STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, adjustment of other equity investments and cash flow hedges to fair value as well as actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit plans, etc. The Group's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.
In the event of disposal or discontinuation of an entity, the Group's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a non-USD functional currency is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of securities are transferred to the income statement in the event of sale or when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Other comprehensive income includes current and deferred tax to the extent the income and costs recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2014
NOTE 24 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- CONTINUED

BALANCE SHEET Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets in connection with acquired oil resources (concession rights, etc.) are amortised from the commencement of production until the fields' expected production periods ends ­ a period of up to 20 years. Acquired exploration rights are amortised from the date of acquisition for a period of up to five years. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but impairment tests are prepared at least annually, starting in the year of acquisition. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units.
For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. For oil production facilities, including facilities under construction, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation generally takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil.
The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:

Ships, rigs, etc. Containers etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc. Oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields

20-25 years 12 years
10-50 years over lease or concession period
5-20 years 3-7 years
up to 20 years

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
The cost of an asset is divided into separate components which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships, rigs, etc. when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.

Contents

Notes/Financials

The cost of assets constructed by the Group includes direct and indirect expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment, removal and restoration.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is fully impaired before other assets in a cash-generating unit.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment, if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use, except oil concession rights in scope of IFRS 6.
Lease contracts are classified as operating or finance leases at the inception of the lease. Once determined, the classification is not subsequently reassessed unless there are changes to the contract conditions. Contracts which transfer all significant risks and benefits associated with the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are treated as property, plant and equipment.
Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised at the Group's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.
Securities, including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for other securities. Securities that form part of the liquidity resources (Held for trading) are classified as current assets and value adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items. Other equity investments are classified as non-current assets (Available-for-sale) where unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Inventories mainly consist of bunkers, containers (manufacturing), spare parts not qualifying as property, plant and equipment and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit or loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity, including proceeds on the disposal of own shares in connection with the exercise of share options.
The translation reserve comprises the Group's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of securities in the category Available-for-sale. The reserve for hedges includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of hedging transactions qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting.

NOTE 24 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- CONTINUED

Performance shares, restricted shares and share options allocated to the executive employees of the Group as part of the Group's long term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of share options is calculated on the basis of the Black & Scholes formula.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation and include among other provisions for abandonment of oil fields, legal disputes, onerous contracts, as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the USA. Provisions are recognised on the basis of best estimates and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonable determinable.
Pension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Pension plans where the Group, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises ­ so called multiemployer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.
Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not provided on goodwill which is not deductible or depreciable for tax purposes, or temporary differences which have no effect on the accounting results or taxable income at the time of the transaction. In addition, deferred tax is not calculated for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures to the extent that taxable dividends are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised within a foreseeable future.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans under fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost adding or deducting the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet as borrowings.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the cumulated

Contents

Notes/Financials

gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities which can be attributed to the hedging relationship. The ineffective portion of hedge transactions, including time value for oil price hedges, and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT Cash flow for the year is divided into cash flow from operating activities, cash flow used for investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of the Group's cash management. Changes in marketable securities are included in cash flow used for investing activities.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and comparative figures are restated. Assets and related liabilities from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement.
Individual assets or groups of assets that are to be disposed of collectively are classified as assets held for sale, when the activities to carry out such a sale have been initiated and the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities of a disposal group that are directly related to assets held for sale are presented correspondingly.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets, etc., are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.
KEY FIGURES Return on equity is calculated as the profit or loss for the year divided by the average equity.
Equity ratio is calculated as the equity divided by total assets.
Return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is the profit or loss for the year before interest but after calculated tax, divided by the quarterly average invested capital (equity plus net interest-bearing debt).
The segments' return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is net operating profit or loss after tax (NOPAT) divided by the quarterly average invested capital, net (segment assets less liabilities).
Earnings per share and cash flow from operating activities per share comprise A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' share of the profit or loss for the year respectively the cash flow from operating activities divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding the Group's holding of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of issued share options.
Total market capitalisation is the total number of shares ­ excluding the Group's holding of own shares ­ multiplied by the end-of-year price quoted by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen.

NOTE 25 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management, on an on-going basis, to make judgements and estimates as well as form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience, independent advisors and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significant areas subject to estimates and judgements are mentioned below.
GENERAL Decline in oil or gas prices A substantial or prolonged decline in oil or gas prices can have a material adverse effect on the Group's oil and gas related businesses, particularly impacting the measurement of exploration and development assets, oil and gas production facilities, drilling rigs and abandonment provisions. Management does not have control over the risk factors impacting oil and gas prices. These factors include among others:
·Economic and political developments in resource-producing regions ·The ability of OPEC and other producing nations to influence global production and prices ·Government regulations and actions ·Global economic and political conditions or conflicts ·Changes in population growth and consumer preferences ·The price and availability of new technology ·Severe weather conditions
Rapid substantial and/or sustained reductions in oil or gas prices can have an impact on the validity of the assumptions on which strategic decisions are based and can have an impact on the economic viability of projects being planned or in development. A prolonged period of low oil or gas prices could also require earlier cessation or mothballing of production, if and when oil or gas fields become uneconomic.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Management assesses impairment indicators across the Group's portfolio of assets. Judgement is applied in the definition of cash generating units and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions for impairment tests. Projected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use. External data is used to the extent possible and centralised processes, involving corporate functions, shall ensure that indexes or data sources are selected consistently observing differences in risks and other circumstances. Current market values for vessels, rigs, etc. are estimated using acknowledged brokers.
The determination of cash generating units differs for the various business areas. For integrated network businesses, such as Maersk Line and Safmarine, the container shipping activities are considered to be a single cash generating unit. For the oil and gas activities, connected oil or gas fields are considered to be cash generating units. APM Terminals considers each individual terminal as a cash generating unit. Maersk Drilling considers rigs with the similar functionality and operation environment as cash generating units due to largely interdependent cash flows. Maersk Tankers, Svitzer and Maersk Supply Service group vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing the management's ongoing follow-up.

Impairment considerations In 2014, the declining oil price has led to impairment tests for oil production facilities, including exploration and development assets, and drilling rigs. As the current oil price has not stabilised, the future cash flow projections are particularly difficult to predict. Consistent with prior years, management has chosen to apply the Brent oil price assumptions. Based on long term forward curves from end of 2014 the oil price is expected to slowly recover in the medium term to a level of USD 80 in 2020. From this time an inflation adjusted oil price is used. An adjustment of the forward oil prices on short and medium term has been the main cause for impairment of oil related assets in the UK.
Other critical factors in impairment tests of assets employed in Maersk Oil are: Future development and operating costs, reservoir evaluation, unitisation options, taxation and discount factors. The expenses are based on the scope of work agreed between parties in the joint arrangements.
An estimate of the recoverable amount of oil concession rights in Brazil is based on the latest available resource reports from June 2014. The carrying amount of the oil concession rights post impairment reflects management's expectations that there are sufficient potential resources to recover the cost from the remaining fields and that the operating partners will at a later state be able to present commercially viable development plans for these fields. First oil in Brazil is forecasted for 2018/19 and the project is therefore not impacted by short to medium term oil price fluctuation.
Maersk Drilling is impacted by the lower oil price from lower day rates and a drop in market values of rigs. Due to the contract coverage, no impairment losses were recognised as a result of the declining oil price. One rig was impaired due to age.
Maersk Line reversed impairments related to two container vessels held for sale in 2013 that were redeployed in the network. The carrying amount of container vessels and associated assets in the cash generating unit is higher than fair value, for which reason a value in use calculation has been performed. The cash flow projection is based on the latest forecast for 2015-19 including estimated effects from the Vessel Sharing Agreement with Mediterranean Shipping Company (referred to as 2M). The key sensitivities are development in freight rate, container volumes, bunker costs and cost reduction initiatives as well as the discount rate. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes and overall declining freight rates. The decline in the bunker price is assumed to have no significant impact in the long term since it will be reflected in the freight rates. The impairment test showed substantial headroom from value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable and that the gap to fair value can be explained mainly by Maersk Line performing at margins above the industry.
The annual impairment tests of goodwill in Svitzer are based on value in use calculations of the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated. For the activities in Australia management has lowered the EBITDA margins in the forecast due to industry overcapacity, a high industrial cost structure and a general slowdown of bulk activities. This adjustment has led to full impairment of goodwill related to the Australian activities.
Refer to notes 6 and 7 for information about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and discount rates.

NOTE 25 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

Amortisation, depreciation and residual values Useful lives are estimated based on past experience and the management's estimates of the period over which the assets will provide economic benefits. Management decides from time to time to revise the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. For oil production facilities the production period is based on management's judgement of when it will no longer be commercially viable to extract more oil or gas, which is highly dependent of the future oil price, production costs and the technical feasibility for extraction. Refer to note 24 for the useful lives typically used for new assets.
Residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of vessels and rigs, the uncertainty as to future economic conditions and the future price of steel, which is considered as the main determinant of the residual price. As a main rule the residual values of vessels and rigs are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price exclusive dry-docking costs. The long term view is prioritised in order to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.
ABANDONMENT OBLIGATIONS When establishing and operating oil or gas production facilities, provisions are made for the cost of removing the production facilities and re-establishment of the environment (sea bed etc.) according to the legislation which applies to the individual concession areas. The recognised obligation is based on contractual agreements and current regulatory requirements.
Provisions for abandonment are a judgemental area as they include assumptions around estimated decommissioning costs, discount rates and the economic lives of fields, which in turn will depend on factors such as oil price, operating costs and fiscal policy in the jurisdiction of operation. The variables in estimating decommissioning costs are, inter alia: Rig rates, time spent closing down facilities and costs for plugging wells. Evaluation reports from external engineer consulting firms on the scope of work and costs have formed basis for the internal estimates. The cost assumptions are based on longer term forecasts (inflated and discounted) rather than current market rates and management reassesses such assumptions on an annual basis.
PROVISIONS FOR PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Management is required to make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided, contractually or by law, in order to determine the accounting policy for each scheme.
For defined benefit schemes management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and discount rates. In making judgements on classification of schemes and assumptions, management considers advice by the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country by country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a plan by plan basis. Refer to note 14 for information about key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in those.
Plan assets used only to meet the obligations are set off against the gross liability. Such assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.

PROVISIONS FOR LEGAL DISPUTES, ETC. The management's estimate of the provisions in connection with legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. The resolution of legal disputes, either through negotiations or litigation, can take several years to complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The Group is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of various scope. Appropriate provision has been made where the probability of payment of additional taxes in individual cases is considered more likely than not. In addition, disputed items are evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area and country risk provisions are established where the aggregated risk of additional payments is more likely than not. Demands for which the probability of payment is assessed by management to be less than 50% are not provided for.
DEFERRED TAX ASSET Judgement has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to the Group's ability to utilise the assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets arisen in entities having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 237m (USD 184m), excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated in the development of oil and gas fields, during construction of terminals or in mobilisation of drilling rigs, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or is expected within a foreseeable future.
ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL, JOINT CONTROL OR SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE The Group's control, joint control or significant influence over an entity or activity is subject to an assessment of power and exposure to variability in returns.
The assessment of control in oil and gas activities entails analysis of the status of operators in joint arrangements. Operators are responsible for the daily management of the activities carried out within the jointly established framework. Since operators are not exposed to, and have no right to, returns beyond the participating share, and since they can be replaced by agreement, the operators are regarded as agents as defined in IFRS 10. Operators of pool arrangements in shipping are assessed similarly.
When assessing joint control, an analysis is carried out to determine which decisions require unanimity and whether these concern the activities that significantly affect the returns. Joint control is deemed to exist when business plans, work programmes and budgets are unanimously adopted. Within oil and gas activities, an assessment of joint control is carried out for each phase. These are typically exploration and development, production and decommissioning. Unanimity is often not required during the production phase. Given that the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the arrangements' assets or liabilities regardless of voting rights the arrangements are accounted for as joint operations during all phases.
For pool arrangements in shipping, unanimity is not required in decisions on relevant activities. However, the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the unit's assets or liabilities, and as the pool arrangements are not structured into separate legal entities, they are treated as joint operations.

In 2014, management has applied judgement in the classification of Dansk Supermarked Group after the sale of the majority share. On the basis that the Group holds less than 20% ownership and the remaining shares are concentrated with one majority shareholder, the investment has been classified as available-for-sale (other equity investments). Refer to note 17 for information about the assumptions and method applied in the management's estimation of fair value at the balance sheet date.
LEASING Judgement is applied in the classification of lease as operating or finance lease. The Group enters into a substantial amount of lease contracts, some of which are combined lease and service contracts like time-charter agreements. Management applies a formalised process for classification and estimation of present values for finance leases with use of specialised staff in corporate functions.

NOTE 26 NEW FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
The following new accounting standards are relevant to the Group for the years commencing from 1 January 2017 or later. The standards are expected to be endorsed by the EU before the effective dates.
REVENUE IFRS 15 `Revenue from Contracts with Customers' replaces IAS 18 `Revenue', IAS 11 `Construction Contracts' and a number of interpretations (IFRIC 13, 15, 18 and SIC-31).
The new standard provides a comprehensive framework and application guidance for recognising revenue. The core principle is that revenue is recognised at the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services. Revenue is recognised on transfer of control, either at a point in time or over time as the entity progresses towards meeting its obligations.
The Group expects to implement IFRS 15 when it becomes mandatory 1 January 2017, subject to endorsement by the EU. The Group is currently in the process of determining the impact of adopting the new standard. No significant impact has been identified at the reporting date.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 `Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement' and IASB has set the effective date to 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted. The new standard amends the principles for classification and measurement of financial assets, hedge accounting and impairment methodology. The principles for recognition and derecognition, as well as classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward almost unchanged.
Under IFRS 9, all recognised financial assets will be measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the objective for holding the assets and the instruments' characteristics. The options for classification and reclassification have been limited and fair value adjustments of equity investments recognised in other comprehensive income shall no longer be transferred to the income statement on disposal. The Group shall on an investment-by-investment basis make an irrevocable election whether to classify equity investments as fair value through other comprehensive income. Other than this limitation, the changed model has no material impact on the Group financial statements.
As for hedge accounting the new standard aligns the requirements more closely with financial risk management and establishes a more principle-based approach to hedge accounting. IFRS 9 increases the scope of items eligible for hedge accounting. For example, a group of items or a net position may be designated hedged items. The new standard does not fundamentally change the types of hedging relationships.
The existing impairment model for loans and receivables in IAS 39 (an `incurred loss' model) is replaced by an `expected credit loss' model in IFRS 9. The effect is an earlier recognition of impairment losses based on historical, current and forecast information of shortfalls. The Group's exposure to credit losses is limited and the changed model is not expected to materially impact the financial position or performance.

Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment respectively.
Interest rate derivatives primarily swap floating to fixed rates on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement concurrently with the hedged interest expenses. They are also used to swap fixed rates to floating rates of which some are fair value hedges.
Furthermore, the Company enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.
For information about currencies, maturities, etc. reference is made to note 16.

The main part of the closing balance and the addition during 2014 comprises the 19% share in Dansk Supermarked Group. The estimated fair value in DKK in December is equal to the initial valuation of the 19%. The decrease in the carrying amount of the investment in 2014 can be attributed to the development in the DKK/USD exchange rate.
The valuation is based primarily on a discounted cash flow model with reference to selected listed peers. The model relies on a discount rate of 7.4% reflecting a weighted average of an assumed discount rate for the retail business and an assumed yield for the real estate business as well as a long term terminal growth rate of 2%. All other things being equal, a 0.25% change in the discount rate will affect other comprehensive income and equity by USD 35-50m.

NOTE 16 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC.
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: Market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company's Business Units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2014.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2014. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rate.
Currency risk The Company's currency risk arises due to income from shipping and oil-related activities are denominated mainly in USD, while the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. Overall the Company has net income in USD and net expenses in most other currencies. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. The majority of the Company's borrowings are thus in USD.
The main purpose of hedging the Company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Company's profit. The Company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
· Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horison; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; · Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Company is exposed, is estimated to have a positive impact on the Company's profit before tax by USD 0.3bn (negatively by USD 0.1bn) and the Company's equity, excluding tax, positively by USD 0.1bn (negatively by USD 0.3bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 14 and 15, and are thus not an expression of the Company's total currency risk.
92/110

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S -- Annual Report 2014

NOTE 16 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC. -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

Interest rate risk The Company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as DKK, EUR and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The Company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps.
A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by approximately USD 22m (negatively by USD 55m). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be positive by approximately USD 56m (positive by USD 28m).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Credit risk The Company has exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.

Liquidity risk It is of great importance for the Company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
To the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2014, which comprise income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the parent company. The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
The Board of Directors' and the Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements The Board of Directors and the Management are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for such internal control that management determines is necessary to enable the

preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The audit has not resulted in any qualification.

Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the parent company's financial position at 31 December 2014 and of the results of the Group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2014 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
STATEMENT ON THE DIRECTORS' REPORT Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Directors' report. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the Directors' report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.
