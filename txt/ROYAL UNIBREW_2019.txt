Strategy delivers progress once again

Strategy delivers progress once again MANAGEMENT REPORT

Since 2009, Royal Unibrew has delivered strong results every year. Our goal remains to deliver solid results and cash flow generation to secure continued return to our shareholders.
The solid result in 2019 is generated from a strong mix of organic growth and acquisitions together with continued focus on efficiency improvements, innovation, a high level of consumer and customer engagement and excellent partnerships.
The strategy since 2009 is for Royal Unibrew to be a focused and strong multi beverage provider with leading positions in the markets in which the company operates. This strategy continues to further evolve and adjust as consumers' behavior and demands change. Acquisitions remain an important part of the strategy and we will continue to consider opportunities that can create value to the benefit of our shareholders.
"Royal Unibrew is always committed to do business in an ethical, responsible and sustainable way ..."

CSR is of high priority Royal Unibrew is always committed to do business in an ethical, responsible and sustainable way and has signed up to the UN Global Compact in 2019 to intensify and improve the efforts and ambitions even further. Royal Unibrew has identified a number of short-term and long-term CSR priorities that will be integrated further in the strategy going forward.
Strengthening of the Executive Board In order to secure continued delivery on the strategy, the Board of Directors decided to expand the Executive Management Team by appointing the current CFO, Lars Jensen to COO and hiring Lars Vestergaard as new CFO, effective 1 April 2020. In addition, Royal Unibrew has a broad, highly experienced and high performing Senior Management Team that works together as a team across business units and countries.
On behalf of the Board of Directors I wish to thank the Executive Team, the Senior Leadership Team and all Royal Unibrew employees for their excellent contribution and passionate commitment to deliver a strong result once again. Finally, I wish to thank consumers, customers, business partners and shareholders for their continued support of Royal Unibrew.

Our strategy and consistent execution, building sustainable growth, delivered continued momentum of our business and solid financial results during 2019

During 2019, Royal Unibrew delivered solid growth in both revenue and earnings ­ while at the same time preparing our business for a future that demands new solutions from existing trusted brands, products as well as our teams and partners.
Simultaneously with the adaptation of our operations to new market demands and expectations, the sustainability of both our way of operating and of our commitment to create value for all in our value chain delivers solid and continued advances. Our EBIT margin increased from 18.4% to 19.1% and based on the strengthening of our earnings potential as well as considerations of our opportunities going forward, we increase our EBIT margin target from a range of 18-19% to a range of 19-20%. In addition, for the first time, we recommend
a distribution of more than DKK 1 billion to our shareholders
"In 2019, Royal Unibrew joined the UN Global Compact which principles govern our actions every day"

via an increase of the ordinary dividend to DKK 12.20 per share (2018: DKK 10.80 per share) in combination with a share buyback program of up to DKK 400 million.
In 2019, our net revenue increased by 5% to DKK 7,692 million, our EBITDA grew by 8% to DKK 1,814 million, whereas our EBIT increased by 10% to DKK 1,469 million. And for the first time in our history we sold and delivered more than 11 million HL to consumers and customers around the globe.
As consumers and customers continue to change their habits and expectations, we adjust our strategies and portfolios to respond with agility and determination. The key factors driving our strong 2019 results have been:
· Strong advances for many of our local brand positions driven by great marketing connecting directly to the consumers and the communities we serve
· O ur innovative initiatives across many of our alcoholic and non-alcoholic portfolios
· Ever increasing efforts to create products with a more sustainable environmental footprint
· Serving our valued customers with best in class In/Outlet support and service
· Increased efficiency in all parts of our supply chain · A determined focus on leveraging our recent acquisi-
tions in a broader arena

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Sustainability and responsibility vis a vis the world we serve In the communities in which we live and work as well as in the wider markets in which we operate become more concerned about sustainability, and we have increased our efforts on several fronts to create a more sustainable future. All our teams are working dedicated with very high ambitions and advanced tools to secure that our quality, the food safety and our environmental footprint meet the highest standards ­ and we constantly develop our measures.
We are committed to the principles of UN Global Compact and apply the Sustainable Development Goals in our initiatives.
To support our continuous efforts, we have ongoing dialogues with the local communities in which we operate ­ aiming to ensure an active and transparent participation in and contribution to the people and the environment in which we live and work.
Among our other efforts during 2019 were a new wastewater plant at Lorina in France, the introduction of 100% recycled labels, cardboard and shrink foil to our Organic Royal Pils-
"We have managed to reduce our CO2 footprint with 10% per HL since 2015"
ner product range and 100% recycled PET for Egekilde (still) in Denmark as well as the employment of a number of inclusion refugees in our local businesses.

Leveraging existing brands responding to trends and changing concerns and habits Our industry in general and Royal Unibrew tend to be regarded as traditional and relatively stable. However, we observe some major changes and distinct market trends:
There is a change away from refreshing indulgence towards a more health driven behavior. Hence, we have leveraged some of our strong local and international brands, allowing us to capture new taste experiences with 0.0% beer concepts as well as non-sugar soft drink products. We expect this core consumer behavior is here to stay, and we prepare to further extend the lead that we have taken in some of these segments.
Secondly, we note that the modern global communication platforms drive the need for authenticity and increased connection to the local communities. Local heroes such as Faxe Kondi, Hartwall Original Long Drink and Cido offer national identity combined with the greatest taste and the unique local connections of these longstanding products. Local icons such as Lorina Artisanal French Lemonade and Fonti di Crodo LemonSoda are other great examples of products/portfolios with wider authentic appeal that combine the greatest taste with rich local heritage.
Finally, concerns about the long-term impact from economic development are increasing in the more economically developed Western hemisphere ­ driving the demand for "good for us and our world" products.
The success of our organic products is illustrative for the changes in consumer behavior.
Also, our role in providing guidance and contributions to the recycling efforts of waste and containers in e.g. the recycling systems in Denmark and Finland is demanding more and more focus and efforts.

"In some of our core markets the opportunity for e.g. organic products is gaining momentum"
Creating value for and with our customers In most of our markets, consumers are served via customers and outlets with whom we aim to create more value. For our customers we develop products, merchandise and other support that improve their yield on the time and money invested in their businesses. Furthermore, our teams focus on helping our customers to sell more effectively, increase rotation in the outlet and strengthen the relationship with the final consumer of our products. Our highly effective Royal Unibrew Tapwall concept that prolongs the freshness of our products is an excellent example of a sustainable, new technology driven development that renders the whole value chain more valuable. And the fact that we offer distribution to smaller craft beer suppliers through this concept underlines the open and flexible character we support with this concept.
Continued quality and efficiency improvements in all parts of our value chain As illustrated by the above changes and examples of successful initiatives, the general beverage landscape and our portfolios become more complex. As we are fully committed to create and return value to our stakeholders and the communities we live in, we constantly invest in more knowledgeable employees, new technologies and better systems. Only a determined and focused operation that combines unique market and consumer insight with innovation can contribute to economic growth in a sustainable way ­ more efficiency means less waste, less

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

CEO letter MANAGEMENT REPORT 11

energy, more sustainability and better financial and community returns. And this goes for all and everything we touch in relation to our processes, our employees, our partners and our suppliers supported by clear guidance and legal frameworks.
Continued strengthening of and through the recent acquisitions Our strategy for sustainable growth derives from a healthy combination of value creation and improvement of our existing business, regularly enhanced by bigger and smaller acquisitions. Our mantra is to only add assets and brands that fit our core strategy of enhancing our local multi-beverage business, making sure we can run the assets better than its previous owner ­ and identify and capture synergies.
As our newly acquired brands and businesses have been integrated into the Royal Unibrew family, they have not been stripped from their unique connection to their original consumers and customers, and they have not been dismantled and replaced. In general, they have been streamlined and simplified, and they
"All acquisitions from 2018 have contributed to our 2019 growth in revenue and earnings"
have been reenergized benefitting from some of our broader overall industrial experience and our market insights. And in most cases the focus has been on increasing the rotation and scale of the current business, occasionally in combination with a distribution extension.

Above all though stands our focus to continuously improve and strengthen our existing businesses with the constant care and intensity that has created our current momentum.
Change in the Executive Board from two to three From April 2020, Lars Vestergaard (member of the board since April 2018) will join the Executive Board as CFO, and Lars Jensen will move to a new position as COO with operational responsibilities for Southern Europe, the Global Overseas Export and Sales Operations, Nordic Supply Chain and M&A activities.
COVID-19 and its implications As the COVID-19 virus has its first impacts on parts of our business, we have moved our focus towards the channels and occasions where our products support consumers and customers best. It is key for Royal Unibrew, that we keep our agility to adapt the daily market reality and preserve our "close to market" philosophy. Mid-term, we feel confident that our ability to adjust to new market realities continues to secure solid returns.
I want to thank everyone in the Royal Unibrew team for their great contribution to another solid result in 2019. It is our willingness to work together and go the extra mile developing great ideas into great experiences and products that pave the way for sustainable growth and even better results.
A special thank you to the consumers of our products, our business partners and customers and last but not least to our shareholders and members of our Board for your trust, support and involvement.

Strategy and targets

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019
Strategy
Royal Unibrew's overall strategy remains to be a strong regional multi-beverage provider in selected core markets and outside the core regions to establish and cement strong niche positions. The implementation of the strategy has led to continuous improvement of our earnings capacity, margins and free cash flow.
Overall strategy Royal Unibrew strives to grow through two supplementary strategies:
1)Being a strong multi beverage provider in core markets offering a diverse portfolio, which is relevant for consumers and customers (e.g. beer, cider, long drinks (RTD), ready-made cocktails, soft drinks, energy drinks, waters and fruit juices).
2)Establishing leading and scalable niche positions through a combination of locally and anchored brands and unique export propositions (e.g. Ceres, Tempt, Faxe, Vitamalt and the recently added Fonti di Crodo, Lorina and Nohrlund products).
With own brands as well as strong international license brands our objective is to achieve leading positions in the markets or the segments in which we operate. In the coming years, we will scale up our sales and marketing efforts as well as leverage our product portfolio across markets with a view to reinforcing our market positions in the individual markets and increasing the total business of the Group ­ thus ensuring the long-term value of our many brands. Our strategy has been "designed" taking into account that Royal Unibrew operates in diverse markets that are characterized by different dynamics.

Key market positions
Focus on markets and segments in which Royal Unibrew holds or may achieve a considerable position
Royal Unibrew focuses on further developing established market and segment positions where we hold either a leading position, such as in Denmark, Finland and the Baltic countries, or considerable and scalable niche positions, such as in Italy or France and in selected international markets. For mainstream market positions in consolidated markets, it should be possible to achieve a role as a leading player to create attractive profitability.
Royal Unibrew's core market area is characterized by considerable industry concentration. To the extent that structural growth opportunities arise, e.g. through acquisitions or by entering into partnerships, which might reinforce existing market positions or create new market positions, will be assessed, and it will be considered whether there is a strategic match and if long-term shareholder value can be created.
We will reinforce our market positions through focus on a broader beverage portfolio, with a view to enhance our customers' benefits from the partnership with Royal Unibrew.

Talent and people
Developing alert and diverse talent
Insight and strong competences are required to reach our ambitious strategic targets and to navigate in markets characterized by rapid change. Therefore, we strive to create a culture that encourages talent, develops skills and competences, recognizes achievements and values each individual.
We give high priority to retaining experienced employees and recruiting new employees who bring new momentum and knowledge.
We have an intensive focus on cross-border knowledge sharing, which in particular plays an important role when integrating new businesses and when rolling out SAP or other digital solutions.
A succession process ensures identification of talents and ensures acceleration of carreers within Royal Unibrew.

Innovation, development
Focus on innovation and development of Royal Unibrew's product portfolios
To build and maintain our strong position as a regional beverage provider of both well-known local brands and unique export propositions we need continuously to develop our product portfolio and provide opportunities to excite and enjoy our consumers ­ by addressing consumer trends of e.g. health and wellness, authenticity and care for the environment.
The product portfolio development includes our own development of new line extensions, products and brands within existing and new beverage categories as well as the conclusion of license agreements both as a licensee and a licensor.
A Growth Leadership Team facilitates the development and implementation of the Royal Unibrew Best Practice and knowledge sharing across the entire Group.

Local roots
Focus on local engagement and responsibility
We actively strive to be close to consumers as well as to be part of and take care of the local societies in all our markets.
The closeness to our consumers is a natural element of the local rooting of a large range of our products ­ and of our persistent efforts to meet consumer demands by building a solid platform for our ongoing innovation and product launches.
As a regional based beverage company founded on strong local presence in the societies of typically rural areas, Royal Unibrew aims to be a responsible member of the community not only from an environmental perspective but very importantly from a social perspective as well ­ this goes for both our employees, local business partners and suppliers.

Operational efficiency and sustainability
Focus on operational efficiency
We consider it a never-ending process to pursue opportunities to continuously enhancing the efficiency across the company and of all links in our value chain ­ and at the same time consider how to reduce our environmental impact. Operational efficiency and circular thinking have always been a part of the Royal Unibrew DNA.
A broader beverage portfolio and increased complexity continuously challenge our way of operating, and it is therefore crucial to focus on efficiency in all parts of our organization.
Through investments, applying new technology, innovation and other initiatives we aim to enhance efficiency and create value for Royal Unibrew and our stakeholders ­ by way of ensuring a sustainable and flexible business model.

Financial flexibility
Maintaining Royal Unibrew's financial flexibility, competitive power and scope for strategic maneuverability through an appropriate capital structure
Royal Unibrew is continuously considering its capital structure with a view to adjust it as to support the realization of the strategic and financial targets in the best possible way.
As we see M&A as an integrated part of the strategy, the management of our capital structure must be seen in the context of balance sheet readiness to onboard new businesses, as has been the case during recent years. The capital structure will be evaluated based on the financial leverage, solvency and intangibles asset compared to the equity.

Low- or non-sugar The low/non-sugar category is benefiting from consumer trends towards health consciousness. We offer a growing portfolio in the category such as Hartwall Jaffa Sokeriton, Faxe Kondi 0 calories, LemonSoda Zero and Pepsi Max. Over recent years, the share of low- and non-sugar products in our soft drink portfolio has increased markedly.

Demand for larger variety Consumers constantly expect something new ­ preferably something authentic, sustainable and of high quality. Craft and specialty products fit this trend very well and over the past years we have built an attractive and innovative portfolio in these categories. Across our markets, we offer a range of well-known craft and specialty brands ­ both beers, cocktails, lemonade and soft drinks.

%

During 2018 and 2019, we have acquired a number of new businesses and brands ­ which bring new attractive and iconic brands to our consumers and customers and strengthen our future growth and earnings potential. The integration of the acquired activities is progressing well with focus on streamlining, vitalizing of new brands and obtaining commercial synergies.
Fonti di Crodo ­ acceleration of value creation Prime focus during 2019 has been a continuation of the 2018 agenda: Driving brand value for the consumers and value for our customers. Fonti di Crodo delivered solid results in the Italian market and was the brand with the largest value gain during the year. In 2019, the Crodo LemonSoda products were also launched in a number of new markets ­ with promising feed-back.
Lorina ­ preparing for controlled growth 2019 was in many ways a transition year for Lorina ­ a large investment program initiated by the previous owner was completed, the number of variants was reduced, and innovation was organized to support the 2020 plans and ambitions. In France, the sale and market share of the core artisanal clear

lemonade increased in a year with tough competition and the US lemonade business continued its expansion, moving the portfolio towards the Lorina brand.
Nohrlund ­ launching new product lines The past year has been very hectic for the Nohrlund start-up company. The introduction of premade cocktails at Royal Unibrew events in Denmark has been a great success delivering superb consumer experience and creating value for our customers. Towards the end of 2019, "Served By Nohrlund" was launched in the Off-Trade with great success. The "Served By Nohrlund" range focuses on well-known cocktails, making home serving easier and with the same great taste every time.
BAG ­ preparing for accelerated growth After acquiring the Canadian Bruce Ashley Group (BAG) in August 2019, our view of the opportunities in the Canadian market has been confirmed and both partners and customers have appreciated our ownership of the Bruce Ashley Group. The business has outperformed market growth in our core category, which has already led to a new partnership with a local craft brewer. Building capacity and capability will be core focus areas in 2020 including both new channels and categories.

Digital transformation is pivotal for business development

We consider digital technology an important driving force behind continuous improvement. And it is not only about technology, but rather about creating new opportunities for our customers and Royal Unibrew ­ by strengthening customer relations and engagement, creating better customer experiences, fueling innovation and optimizing our supply chain management. In addition, new digital solutions reduce operational costs by increasing efficiency.
In recent years, we have intensified our digitalization efforts and we have implemented a range of new modern systems providing us with better tools to partner up with our customers and to develop business activities, including roll-out of the ERP system, SAP across our markets, a new CRM and e-contract system, a new e-commerce platform and a new web shop for craft products.
Craft Makers Collective well received Digitalization is a vital component of our endeavors to establish closeness to consumers. In the Autumn of 2018, we launched the web shop Craft Makers Collective ­ a cooperation of passionate craft makers in Denmark and abroad offering interesting, high-quality products ­ which was well received by consumers. In the web shop we aim to guide, inform and inspire consumers, and

through the direct contact to consumers, we get fast response and useful insight into consumers' preferences ­ and we improve our ability to continue providing relevant high-end products to both buyers in the web shop and our consumers in general. The next step for Craft Makers Collective is to develop and optimize the web platform and to expand the inspiration universe. We also plan to introduce the platform to other markets.
E-commerce adds value to customers During 2019, our Finnish B2B e-commerce platform was further improved and rebranded. We have taken important steps to provide an excellent e-commerce experience for both our current and potential customers ­ and to provide customers a smooth and fast way to order products, manage their inventory and get inspirational insights. As part of the web store ­ and with the aim to increase customer value ­ customers are informed about product launches, promotions, campaigns, seasonal recommendations and other trends related to the beverage industry. The feedback from our customers has been very positive and after the launch in June 2019 and during the following high season, the number of visitors and buyers increased markedly as well as the average order size increased. In early 2020, a new e-commerce platform will go live in Denmark and after that other markets will follow.

Financial targets, capital structure and distribution policy MANAGEMENT REPORT 20

DDK Financial targets, capital structure and distribution policy

Royal Unibrew currently publishes financial targets for EBIT margin, indebtedness and distribution policy. The capability of achieving the financial targets is conditional on continuous business development through focus on growth opportunities, partnerships, innovation, sales and marketing, and on continuous efficiency measures.
The positive development in recent years has enabled us to increase our EBIT margin target and to make considerable distributions to our shareholders. Our EBIT margin target is increased from a range of 18-19% to a range of 19-20%, whereas the capital structure and dividend targets are maintained.
EBIT margin Because of continued strong momentum in our business and following the acquisition of a number of businesses with growth and earnings potential, we increase our EBIT margin target from a range of 18-19% to a range of 19-20% for the coming years. Among others, the target increase should be seen in the light of the planned development of our product portfolio and our expectation to generate synergies and obtain additional operational efficiency in connection with the acquisitions. The EBIT margin target of 19-20% is considered ambitious when comparing to the margins of international and regional beverage providers in Europe.
Indebtedness It is Royal Unibrew's objective to maintain its indebtedness at a level which reflects our aim for flexibility with respect to acting on business opportunities and maintaining solid relationships with the Group's bankers, while also ensuring that Royal Unibrew is not heavily overcapitalized.

It remains the target that net interest-bearing debt should not exceed 2.5 times EBITDA and that an equity ratio of at least 30% should be maintained at year-end. Given the current composition of the balance sheet, the equity ratio is the ratio that determines the pay-out capabilities. Royal Unibrew may depart from the targeted ratios for a certain period if structural business opportunities arise.
Royal Unibrew's annual investments including operational leasing (IFRS 16 implemented in 2018) are expected to be just below 5% of net revenue.
Distribution policy Royal Unibrew is expected to be able to generate a rather significant liquidity surplus going forward. Currently, it therefore remains the intention to make distributions to shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buy-backs taking into account the targets for the equity ratio and indebtedness, annual earnings and cash flows as well as Royal Unibrew's strategic position in general.
It remains Royal Unibrew's intention to distribute an ordinary dividend of 40-60% of the consolidated profit for the year and to launch share buy-back programs when it is considered appropriate in order to optimize the Company's capital structure. It is generally the intention that shares bought back will be cancelled.

Outlook for 2020

We feel confident that Royal Unibrew's 2020 business priorities and plans respond to the prevailing consumer and customer needs and trends, including how the Company's markets are expected to be affected by general economic activity, fiscal developments and consumer sentiment. Moreover, specific assumptions relating to the development in material expense categories as well as the effect of initiatives completed and initiated are also taken into account.
Although Royal Unibrew's business is resilient and trends have been positive until end of February, we cannot, at this time, fully assess how the COVID-19 virus will affect our Italian business and On-Trade elsewhere for the near future. We monitor the situation in our local operations with high urgency and adjust promptly where needed. In spite of the current circumstances, we expect to deliver an EBIT around 2019.
The Board of Directors has decided to initiate a share buyback program of up to DKK 400 million as soon as possible covering the period until end October 2020. The Board of

Directors will recommend to the AGM in 2020 a distribution of ordinary dividend of DKK 12.20 per share. Hence, DKK 1,010 million is expected to be distributed based on the Financial Statements for 2019. With a distribution of a total of DKK 1,010 million we maintain our strategic flexibility.
Assumptions about markets and main priorities for 2020 Demand in the markets in which Royal Unibrew offers a broad beverage portfolio is generally expected to remain at the same level in 2020 as in 2019. The 2019 summer was considered a normal summer. Our efforts to defend and expand Royal Unibrew's market positions and to further strengthen customer partnerships will continue through focus on value management through innovation and price/pack strategies. At the same time, our broad beverage portfolio supports the possibilities of obtaining continued operational efficiency at all organizational levels. Our targeted efforts to create further improvements will be a core priority, including our efforts directed at investment-driven initiatives, which will contribute towards achieving both efficiency and commercial improvements. Generally, Royal Unibrew's market shares within branded products are expected to be maintained or solidified.
We expect three key consumer trends to continue in 2020: Firstly, consumers focus on more healthy or functional products, secondly on more authentic, local and indulgence-oriented products and thirdly adding the concern for the environmental impact and sustainable ingredients. For certain product categories we see the trends melting together creating even stronger propositions. We expect growth in e.g. the low and non-alcoholic beer, waters and non-sugar soft drinks categories, and as for the functional products we expect to see growth in enhanced products, including energy drinks.

For the craft/artisanal, local and indulgence products we see growth opportunities for brands such as e.g. Lorina, Fonti di Crodo, Nohrlund, Kissmeyer, Aura and Lahden Erikois as they all connect to special drinking occasions.
Overall, in the multi beverage markets we will continue our efforts to create value across categories, e.g. through our price/pack strategies that focus on consumers' drinking and shopping occasions. For parts of our product range we see opportunities for improving the distribution in selected channels.
In the niche markets, which cover Italy, France and International, we continue to focus on increasing our presence in already established markets. We highly emphasize to establishing and retaining our relationships and partnerships through consumer- and customer-oriented sales and marketing investments in order to strengthen our brand positions. For our most recently acquired businesses we will focus on increasing the distribution and activation, while optimizing our price/pack strategies to secure value and premiumization of our offerings.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Financial assumptions
· As 2019 was a normal summer, the 2020 outlook has been made under same assumption.
· Net selling prices are assumed to be slightly increasing during 2020 as a result of our overall premiumization efforts and price/pack strategies in each segment and country. These efforts are unchanged and include optimization of the product mix as well as the channel mix.
· T he full year effects of the acquisitions made in 2019 (two months of Cult, seven months of BAG and ten months of Bauskas in 2020) are expected to affect net revenue positively by approx. DKK 100 million and EBIT by approx. DKK 16 million.
· G enerally, costs are expected to follow the inflation in 2020. Commercial costs are expected to increase in connection with growth initiatives and investments in the existing business.
· We will continue our focus on generating continuous improvements and enhancing efficiency across the business and in all entities.

· R oyal Unibrew has entered into hedging agreements for a large part of the expected consumption of key raw and packaging materials for 2020.
· E xchange rates between DKK and other currencies are expected to remain unchanged as compared to the end of February 2020.
· C OVID-19 is assumed to have limited impact on our OffTrade business and we expect it to have less impact on the On-Trade business from June and onwards.
· Net investments, including operating leases (IFRS 16 implemented already in 2018) are expected to stay just below 5% of net revenue.
· C orporate income tax rate is expected to amount to 2223% of profit before tax excluding income after tax from investments in associates.

Financial review

In 2019, Royal Unibrew achieved its best results ever reflecting the good momentum in the business and a dedicated execution of the well-grounded strategy. As well the existing business as the acquisitions contributed to the improvement of the results in 2019. Many innovative initiatives across the business reinforced Royal Unibrew's position and contributed to the good results.
Business development Royal Unibrew generally increased its market shares in 2019. The volumes sold increased by 2%, while the net revenue showed a 5% increase. The highest net revenue growth was achieved in the Western Europe and the International segments, in which net revenue increased by 9% and 19% respectively on 2018. The positive development in the two segments is partly due to the

acquisition of Bev.Con (Cult) and the full-year impact from the acquisition in 2018 of Etablissements Geyer Frères (Lorina). The organic development (excluding impact from acquisitions) in volumes and net revenue were negatively impacted due to a normal summer in 2019 compared to the historically warm summer in 2018 and due to the absence of extraordinary campaigns in Finland in 2019. Organically, the net revenue increased by 1% and the volumes decreased by 1 %.
In 2019, Royal Unibrew improved EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) by 10% compared to last year. Besides the acquisitions, EBIT was positively affected by the outcome of higher and focused investments in sales and marketing to support the commercial agenda across products and sales channels. Furthermore, an improved market and product mix contributed to the higher earnings. Exchange rate developments only affected

earnings to a limited extent as purchases were mainly made in the Group's revenue currencies.
EBIT amounted to DKK 1,469 million, which is DKK 130 million above the 2018 figure. EBIT increased in all segments compared to 2018, and the acquisitions contributed positively. The profit before tax amounting to DKK 1,458 million for 2019 was DKK 130 million above the 2018 figure. Free cash flow for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,159 million compared to DKK 942 million in 2018. In 2019, dividend distribution and share buy-backs totaling DKK 971 million (2018: DKK 935 million) were made, while net interest-bearing debt increased by DKK 183 million to DKK 2,705 million primarily due to the completed acquisitions. The NIBD/ EBITDA debt multiple was unchanged 1.5 as in 2018.

Acquisitions The acquisition of Bev.Con ApS (CULT) was completed on 28 February after approval from the Danish competition authorities, and as a part of the integration CULT merged with Royal Unibrew A/S.
On 12 August 2019, Royal Unibrew acquired 100% of the share capital of the Bruce Ashley Group Inc. (BAG) in Canada. BAG is an agency business and has during the last 25 years built a strong portfolio of Japanese sake and European beer brands, including the Faxe Brand. BAG has an organization of 25 people within sales and marketing. The acquisition price was DKK 5 million based on an enterprise value of DKK 9 million. Following the acquisition an DKK 5 million capital injection to BAG was made.

For further information on the acquisitions we refer to page 29-38 re the performance in the business segments and to the Consolidated Financial Statements, note 25, page 119-120.
Status on share buy-back program On 6 March 2019, Royal Unibrew launched a share buy-back program with a view to adjusting the capital structure of Royal Unibrew A/S. The share buy-back program was carried out in accordance with the "Safe Harbour" method and was completed on 31 October 2019 after buy-back of 790,000 shares at a market value of DKK 400 million.
Under this program as well as the program launched in 2018, Royal Unibrew has bought back 860,112 shares at a market value of DKK 433 million in 2019.

In Q4, EBITDA increased by DKK 31 million compared to the same period in 2018. EBIT for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,469 million, which is DKK 130 million above the 2018 figure. The positive developments in both EBITDA and the EBIT are primarily attributable to the Western Europe and the Baltic Sea segments, whereas the EBIT result was negatively impacted by DKK 7 million from impairment in the International segment.
The EBIT margin for 2019 showed an increase of 0.7 percentage points to 19.1% (2018: 18,4%). Product and market mix was the primary reason for the higher EBIT margin.
Net financials for 2019 were DKK 5 million higher than in 2018 aggregating an expense of DKK 36 million. Financial expenses were DKK 41 million on a net basis compared to DKK 36 million in 2018, due to higher interest expenses from the higher interest-bearing debt as a consequence of the acquisitions.

Financial review MANAGEMENT REPORT 28

The Parent Company's profit for the year amounted to DKK 1,074 million compared to DKK 899 million in 2018. Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates amounted to DKK 559 million compared to DKK 379 million in 2018.
Balance Sheet Royal Unibrew's balance sheet at 31 December 2019 amounted to DKK 8,493 million, which is DKK 431 million above the 31 December 2018 figure. DKK 500 million of the increase is attributable to acquisitions, whereas the organic development decreased by DKK 69 million, of which DKK 65 million was due to amortisation and depreciation of non-current assets exceeding investments. The development in current assets, a decrease of DKK 4 million was due to DKK 73 million reduced cash, while receivables increased by DKK 69 million.
Invested capital increased by DKK 376 million in 2019, of which DKK 372 million are related to acquisitions. ROIC excluding goodwill calculated on a running 12 months basis decreased by 3 percentage points to 30% in 2019, and ROIC including goodwill decreased by 2 percentage points to 19%. The primary reason for the decrease in ROIC is EBIT relating to the acquisitions not being recognized for the full period. Further, the acquisitions have not yet delivered the same return as the base business.
Compared to 31 December 2018, the equity ratio increased by 1 percentage points in 2019 amounting to 37% at 31 December 2019 compared to 36% at the end of 2018.
At the end of December 2019, equity amounted to DKK 3,106 million compared to DKK 2,908 million at the end of 2018. The DKK 198 million increase comprised the positive comprehensive income of DKK 1,157 million (2018: DKK 1,037 million), added DKK 2 million related to a capital injection from minority shareholders in Nohrlund and DKK 10 million (2018: DKK 8 million) the value of the share-based payments to the Executive Board and tax on these, whereas, as planned, it was reduced by distribution to shareholders of DKK 971 million (2018: DKK 935 million) by

way of dividend and share buy-back. The comprehensive income comprises the profit of DKK 1,140 million added a DKK 7 million positive exchange rate adjustments and a positive development in the value net of tax of hedging instruments of DKK 10 million.
Net interest-bearing debt in 2019 showed a DKK 183 million increase and amounted to DKK 2,705 million at 31 December 2019 compared to DKK 2,522 million at the end of 2018. The increase in net interest-bearing debt was as expected and comprised the positive free cash flow of DKK 1,159 million less distribution to shareholders of DKK 971 million, the acquisition price of DKK 365 million paid for the acquired activities and DKK 6 million related to fixed asset investments less proceeds from minority shareholders. The net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio (running 12 months basis) was 1.5x (2018: 1.5x).
Funds tied up in working capital showed a negative DKK 671 million at the end of December 2019 compared to a negative DKK 748 million at the end of 2018. The increase in working capital is primarily related to receivables, as we have entered into markets with a tradition for longer payment terms compared to the existing markets. Funds tied up in working capital thus increased by DKK 77 million in 2019 (2018: increase of DKK 209 million) of which DKK 15 million related to acquisitions.
Funds tied up in inventories, trade receivables and trade payables showed an increase of DKK 55 million (2018: increase of DKK 225 million primarily due to ending campaign activities) of which DKK 20 million related to acquisitions, whereas funds tied up in the other elements of working capital decreased by DKK 23 million (2018: decrease of DKK 16 million).
Cash Flow Statement Cash flows from operating activities for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,403 million (2018: DKK 1,214 million) comprising DKK 1,820 million (2018: DKK 1,681 million) of profit for the period adjusted for non-cash operating items, negative working capital cash flow of DKK 43 million (2018: a negative DKK 185 million), net

interest paid of DKK 36 million (2018: DKK 31 million) and taxes paid of DKK 338 million (2018: DKK 251 million). The increase in receivables was partly compensated for only by the decrease in inventories and payables, which caused the negative impact of DKK 43 million from working capital.
The free cash flow for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,159 million, which was an increase of DKK 217 million compared to 2018. Cash flows from operating activities and dividend from associates showed a DKK 192 million increase compared to the 2018 figures, and net investments in property, plant and equipment showed a DKK 25 million decrease, comprising DKK 23 million higher gross investments and DKK 48 million higher revenues from asset divestments. The free cash flow has, above normal, been impacted positively by e.g. asset sales, hence the normalized level in 2019 is just above DKK 1,100 million.

Denmark and Germany

Development in 2019
For Denmark and Germany, it is estimated that the underlying Danish consumption of branded beer and soft drinks remained unchanged in 2019 in spite of a great summer in 2018.
Royal Unibrew's volumes showed a 3% increase in 2019. It is estimated that Royal Unibrew increased its market shares across categories, due to, e.g. focus on value creation by matching consumer demands for more specialized, organic and low/non-alcohol products. Together with PepsiCo we advanced the snack portfolio to a number two position in Denmark with a net revenue increase of 10%.
In 2019, Royal Unibrew continued to invest in marketing and new commercial activities in Denmark. The integration of CULT is progressing as planed and CULT was merged with Royal Unibrew in May 2019 and will be fully implemented in

the Danish commercial plans from 2020. The positive development of the organic and low/non-alcoholic and sugar portfolio continues. During the year, the Royal beer 0.0% with a new updated taste, was awarded best in test. Growth in the non-sugar soft drink category was driven by Faxe Kondi 0 calories and Pepsi Max. As in previous years, Royal Unibrew took part in a large number of events and celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Skanderborg festival.
Market outlook We foresee the beverage market in Denmark to remain relatively stable with a continued shift in the demand for beer and soft drinks into the `better for you" territory. Thus, we expect low/non-alcohol beers will continue to gain ground and in the soft drink categories, we expect that the low/non-sugar segments will continue to grow, as will the indulgence, enhanced and organic categories.

Southern Europe
Development in 2019
Southern Europe comprises Italy, the Lorina business in France and the Fonti di Crodo business in the Balkan countries.
During 2019, the market environment in Southern Europe has developed positivly for our business in both Italy and France compared to last year.
Royal Unibrew's volumes for 2019 showed a 19% increase on 2018, whereas net revenue showed a 15% increase and was positively affected by the Lorina acquisition. The organic growth was 5% in volumes and 6% in net revenue. The selling price per volume unit was lower than in 2018 driven by the full-year effect from the Lorina business and higher share of soft drinks.
ITALY In Italy, Royal Unibrew is estimated to have maintained its market shares in the beer segment, where we have seen the Ceres Strong Ale growing with the market through the successful introduction of Ceres products in cans. We esti-

mate to have increased our market shares in the soft drink category with our Crodo portfolio and in particular measured in value, where LemonSoda and OranSoda were top performers in their categories. During the year, we introduced new packaging formats and designs and increased our in-store activation and digital communication.
Market outlook With the lowest beer per capita in Europe, we expect the market to advance during the coming years. The soft drink consumption is expected to stay relatively stable, however with migration towards less sugar, indulgence and locally manufactured products.
With an outspoken `Restaurant and Bar` culture, we expect some moderation and shifts towards `in home' consumption, yet we are confident that our innovation minded Fonti di Crodo portfolio will connect positively with consumers and customer across the entire peninsula. Focus on top quality and locally anchored propositions, satisfying prevailing needs for local pride and a strong match of the famed local culinary traditions, seem to complement our strong beer foundation well.

Profile
ITALY
Ceres Strong Ale is among the market leaders in the super-premium beer segment, and Royal Unibrew holds a considerable market share in this segment. We also offer a range of Ceres endorsed sub brands such as Red Erik in the super-premium segment as well as lager type, Ceres Top Pilsner and Faxe in the premium segment.
LemonSoda from Fonti di Crodo is sold in a niche category of the soft drinks segment. Moreover, we offer e.g. products such as OranSoda, PelmoSoda and TonicSoda in other niche soft drink categories.
The Italian beer market is supplied through exports from our Danish breweries, whereas the soft drinks market is supplied from Fonti di Crodo's production facilities in Italy.

FRANCE Lorina artisanal French lemonade is market leading in the growing lemonade category, supported by the growing interest in authenticity, not only in France. The Lorina lemonades are produced at the production facilities in Munster in the North-Eastern part of France. Beer and malt beverages (primarily produced in Denmark) are offered to the French market and are mainly sold through bars.

FRANCE In France, the integration of the Lorina business into Royal Unibrew goes according to plan while at the same time preserving its strong and proud local artisanal edge with focus on simplifying the business, strengthen the relationship to our customers and harvesting synergies from the SAP implementation completed in April 2019. We have made additional investments in marketing through an increase in store activation and the first TV commercial for Lorina ever. In 2020, Lorina will celebrate its 125th anniversary.

Market outlook In France, we note a shift towards more artisanal, local brands and more speciality products. In addition, we note a trend towards "better for you" concepts driving a rapid growth of organic and functional segments. All in all, this in combination with a life-long tradition of culinary and gastronomic indulgence brings a shift out of mainstream products towards "less is more", premium consumption.

Finland
Development in 2019
For Finland, it is estimated that our market shares have increased during 2019 ­ in continuation of an exceptional 2018. Hartwall has maintained a high level of innovation in all categories in order to continuously being able to offer the strongest beverage portfolio in the market. We have delivered on our strategic priorities with introduction of an Original Long Drink with orange flavor, focus on the non-sugar soft drink category with strong performance of both Pepsi Max and Jaffa Sokeriton, and premiumization of the beer and cider portfolio. In the beer category, new variants have been launched during the year such as the organic beer, Lapin Kulta Pure and a new variant of the iconic brand, Lahden Erikois, including the low alcohol beer Lahden Erikois IPA 0.5%. During the year, Hartwall carried out a wide range of commercial activities and communication with consumers such as after-ski events, and the event "Greyest Day of the Year"

was even bigger than last year and confirmed the connection between the Original Long Drink and the Finnish consumers.
Other key focus areas have been projects aimed at increasing the supply chain efficiency in order to drive performance despite increasing complexity.
Market outlook The Finnish beverage market is influenced by a range of factors such as the macroeconomic development, the regulatory framework, fiscal tightening, health concerns and a culture where intimate moments are often celebrated with some form of alcohol consumption.
The more global trend of mainstream beer category gradually loosing territory to craft and specialty beers persists also in Finland, as well as the growth of low/ non-alcoholic beer and cider is expected to accelerate.
Within the soft drink category, we expect the current migration towards low/non-sugar products to continue.

Profile
Hartwall is a strong multi-beverage provider with a broad product range holding a clear runner-up position in Finland, and with several category market leader positions. In the Finnish beer and soft drinks market, we offer a combination of our own strong local and national brands and international brands as well as a number of international spirits and wine brands.
In the beer segment, we offer our own brands such as Karjala, Lapin Kulta, Aura, Lahden Erikois and Mattson as well as the international portfolio from Heineken.

The Baltic countries

Development in 2019
The beer sale in the Baltic market started to recover in 2019, supported by radlers and beer with low or non-alcohol. Royal Unibrew is estimated to have maintained its market shares in the beer segment, whereas it is estimated that we have gained market shares in the broad soft drink and water segments.
Royal Unibrew's activities in the Baltic countries contributed positively to the segment result and the net selling prices increased in all countries due to an improved product mix.
With a strong marketing agenda, Royal Unibrew has succeeded to grow the business in a challenging market through new innovative products in the premium segment and in the low/non-alcohol category and strong execution in the soft drink market with Pepsi and our local brands such as Enjoy. In the Energy category CULT Energy was introduced to the Baltic market.

Further, Royal Unibrew supported the Riga Marathon, the largest running event in the Baltics, and we conducted a range of campaign activities related to the Mangali water product.
The acquisition of the Latvian craft brewery Bauskas was completed in the beginning of November 2019 and the onboarding into Royal Unibrew is progressing as planned.
Market outlook In the Baltic countries, the demographic flow of the workforce towards other EU countries is expected to moderate.
Pressure from salary increases continue to be demanding for businesses and it is combined with ever increasing excise taxes and sales restrictions. Consumer pricing for beer and ciders is already at relatively high levels and further tax hikes may drive consumption towards `tax-free' and `grey imports'.
The non-alcoholic beverage segment is expected to have further growth potential.

Profile
Royal Unibrew is a significant beverage provider in the Baltic countries, and we offer a combination of our own strong national brands as well as international Heineken and PepsiCo brands.

Development in 2019
Volumes in 2019 showed a 14% increase and net revenue increased by 19%. The positive development is partly due to the acquisition of Lorina. Furthermore, the revenue increase was supported by introduction of the Fonti di Crodo portfolio in core markets, growth in the Faxe brand across regions and increased sales to Asia. The Malt business has been chal-

lenged by the macro economic development in a couple of core markets, however, the Vitamalt brand continues to expand.
Net revenue per volume unit increased in the segment and was positively affected by the development in Americas supported by the US dollar. Africa also contributed positively, whereas the European market was negatively affected by the product mix.

Sales in the segment are characterized by large volumes being exported to distributors simulanously, meaning that inventory changes should be taken into account when comparing periods. It is estimated that distributors' organic sales to customers increased by a high single-digit percentage in 2019. Distributors' sales to consumers were higher than Royal Unibrew's deliveries for the year as a whole, however, with differences across markets. All in all, there was a slight market de-stocking at distributor level. The shortage of "hard currency" continues to represent a challenge, especially in the African continent. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for 2019 amounted to DKK 132 million, which is DKK 5 million above the 2018 figure. EBIT is negatively impacted by an impairment of DKK 7 million. Thus, the EBIT result is up by DKK 12 million exclusive of impairment.

The integration of the Bruce Ashley Group Inc., acquired in August 2019, is progressing as planned, focusing on professionalization of the organization as well as strengthening of the existing partnerships. In addition, we entered into a new partnership with a local craft brewer.
Market outlook In the International market segment, which comprises many countries and market dynamics, we see good opportunities to grow our franchise. Our focus remains on the core countries where we currently do business as well as a few selected markets are expected to be added. Our core focus is to perform even better with the current portfolios that exist in markets, but also selectively to broaden the portfolio.

Profile
The business area International comprises the export and license business to international markets outside Denmark, Finland, Italy, France and the Baltic countries. From 2018, sales outside Italy, the Balkan countries and France from the recently acquired businesses Fonti di Crodo and Lorina have been included in the segment. The business is relating to non-alcoholic malt beverages, beer predominately under the Faxe brand as well as the new soft drink products from Lorina and Fonti di Crodo.
The key market areas for our beverages are countries in the Americas and Africa as well as, in the case of malt beverages, among ethnic groups from these areas living in and around major cities in Europe and the US. In Asia, focus is on few selected markets. We have several internationally strong dark malt beverage brands, which are sold in the premium segment. Vitamalt is assessed to be the malt brand with the broadest global distribution, whereas Supermalt and Powermalt hold strong regional positions.
The key market areas for the soft drinks from Fonti de Crodo and the Lorina craft lemonade are Central Europe and the Americas.
The International markets are primarily supplied by exports from our Danish breweries, but also in certain cases on the basis of license agreements with local breweries, whereas, Fonti di Crodo and Lorina products are delivered from the production sites in Italy and France.
The sales organization is primarily located in the individual markets and cooperates closely with our distribution partners on commercial priorities and marketing initiatives.

Corporate governance MANAGEMENT REPORT 44

Corporate governance

Royal Unibrew has focus on running its business and designing its management systems in accordance with good corporate governance practices. The objective is to ensure that Royal Unibrew meets its obligations to shareholders, customers, employees, authorities and other stakeholders in the best possible way and that long-term value creation is pursued.
The recommendations of the Committee on Corporate Governance, current legislation and regulation within the area, best practices and internal rules provide the framework for Royal Unibrew's corporate governance.
For the financial year 2019, Royal Unibrew has prepared a remuneration report in accordance with section 139b of the Danish Companies Act and the draft European Commission Guidelines on the standardized presentation of the remuneration report. The report concludes that the remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board has been provided in accordance with the remuneration policy and incentive guidelines of Royal Unibrew adopted by the AGM on 25 April 2019.
In 2019, Royal Unibrew established a whistleblower scheme for expedient and confidential notification of possible or suspected wrong doings. One whistleblower case was reported in 2019, investigations were initiated, and appropriate actions were taken.
Royal Unibrew complies with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations with one exception. For the long-

term incentive plan related to the financial years 2017-2019 and based on restricted (conditional) shares, the vesting period for the residual part of the incentive plan related to the financial year 2020 is less than minimum three years as recommended.
Royal Unibrew's website http://investor.royalunibrew.com/ corporate-governance provides a detailed description of the Board of Directors' approach to the Corporate Governance Recommendations issued by the Committee on Corporate Governance and designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen.
Diversity The statement below is made in accordance with section 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Royal Unibrew aims to promote diversity based on a conviction that diversity leads to a higher level of cohesion and supports long term value creation. This includes a more equal representation of both genders, both within the Board of Directors as well as in our respective management teams and our workforce in general. We believe that a diversified organization increases the versatility and total competences of the Company and improves decision-making processes.
The international management team of Royal Unibrew ­ a total of 142 leaders ­ comprises 68% (2018: 69%) men and 32% (2018: 31%) women. Our target is a more balanced gender representation of at least 40% of each gender. When recruiting new executives, we prioritize identifying candidates of both genders without discrimination and aim to encourage female candidates' interest in taking on managerial tasks.

Currently, the Board of Directors consists of eight Board members elected by the AGM and three Board members elected by the Danish based employees (all males). Four of the members elected by the AGM are Danish and four are non-Danish. Two of the AGM elected board members are females and both were elected at the AGM in April 2019.
We aim for the Board of Directors to consist of expert members who should, to the widest extent possible, complement each other in terms of age, background, nationality, gender, etc., with a view to ensuring a competent and versatile contribution to the board duties at Royal Unibrew. These matters are taking into consideration when the Nomination and Remuneration Committee identifies new candidates for the Board of Directors, and it is an objective of the committee to identify both male and female candidates. However, recommendation of candidates will always be based on an assessment of the individual candidate's competences and how he/ she will match Royal Unibrew's needs and contribute to the overall efficiency of the Board.
Shareholder and stakeholder relations Royal Unibrew's Management strives and works actively to maintain a good and transparent communication and dialogue with its shareholders and other stakeholders. We believe that a high level of transparency in the communication of information on the Company's development supports our work and a fair valuation of the Company's shares. Our openness is limited only by the duties of disclosure of Nasdaq Copenhagen and by competitive considerations.
The dialogue with and communication to shareholders and other stakeholders take place in connection with the publish-

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Corporate governance MANAGEMENT REPORT 45

ing of Annual and Interim Reports and other announcements communicated via audio casts, meetings with investors, analysts and the media. Annual and Interim Reports and other announcements are available at Royal Unibrew's website immediately after being published. Our website also includes material used in connection with investor presentations and audio casts.
According to the Articles of Association of the Royal Unibrew, general meetings shall be convened not more than five weeks and not less than three weeks prior to the general meeting. It is an objective to formulate the notice convening the meeting and the agenda in a way that gives shareholders an adequate presentation of the business to be transacted at the general meeting. Proxies are limited to a specific general meeting and are formulated also to allow absent shareholders to give specific proxies for individual items of the agenda ­ either to the Board of Directors or to a person attending the general meeting. All documents relating to general meetings are published at Royal Unibrew's website.
Each share of a nominal value of DKK 2 entitles the holder to one vote. Royal Unibrew's shares are not subject to any restrictions of voting rights, and the Company has only one class of shares.
All shareholders may submit proposals for resolutions to the Board of Directors to be considered at the AGM; such proposals for resolutions are to be received by the Board of Directors no later than six weeks prior to the date of the AGM.
Board of Directors The Board of Directors oversees the company's overall strategy and supervises the organizational, financial and performance management of the Company as well as continuously evaluates the work performed by the Executive Board on behalf of the shareholders.

The Board of Directors performs its tasks in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Company governing the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. These Rules of Procedure are reviewed and updated annually by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors usually meets for six annual ordinary board meetings, of which at least one focuses on the Company's strategy and prospects and one takes place in a market in which the Company operates. In addition, the Board members meet when required. In 2019, 9 board meetings were held, and the following absentees were noted:
Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter 1 time absent Lars Vestergaard 1 time absent
The Board of Directors has established the following committees:
Nomination and Remuneration Committee The committee consists of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors. In 2019, the primary activities of the committee were the preparation of the annual evaluation of the Board of Directors, the selection and nomination of potential new candidates for the Board of Directors, the overall succession planning of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board as well as the assessment and recommendation of remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. Furthermore, the committee considered the implications of the implementation of the revised Shareholder Rights Directive and prepared the remuneration report to be presented at the AGM in 2020. The committees had 20 meetings in 2019.

Audit Committee The committee consists of two members; the Chairman (Lars Vestergaard) and one member (Christian Sagild). The low level of complexicity of the business and wide usage of standard and automated IT tools are the prime reasons for the size of the committee. It is the Audit Committee's objective to secure quality and integrity in the Company's presentation of Financial Statements, audit and financial reporting. Further, the Audit Committee monitors accounting and reporting processes, the audit of the Company's financial reporting, risk issues and the external auditor's performance and independence.
Moreover, the Audit Committee assesses and recommends to the Board of Directors re-election of external auditors. The external auditor has participated in all meetings of the Audit Committee. The committee had four meetings in 2019.
Evaluation of the work of the Board of Directors Evaluation of the work of the Board of Directors takes place annually. The evaluation focuses on ensuring that the Board of Directors (as a body) has expertise and experience within Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), production, sales and marketing of brands globally and in business-to-business markets, strategic and general management and within economic, financial and capital market issues, including those relating to listed companies. The evaluation is facilitated by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. For this purpose, the Chairman receives written replies to a questionnaire distributed to all members of the Board. The findings of the evaluation were presented and discussed at a Board meeting and it was concluded that the Board of Directors possesses the necessary competencies taken Royal Unibrew's business model and strategy into consideration.
An external consultant is involved in the evaluation at least every third year which will take place in 2020.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019
Both the performance of the Executive Board and the cooperation between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board are evaluated annually as a minimum.
Composition of the Board of Directors When composing the Board of Directors, we emphasize that the members have the competences required. The Board of Directors assesses its composition annually, ensuring that the combined competences and diversity of the members match the Group's activities.
Candidates for the Board of Directors are recommended for election by the general meeting supported by motivation in writing by the Board of Directors as well as a description of the recruiting criteria. The individual members' competences and credentials are described in the below section on the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. Upon their election, the new Board members are introduced to the company through a focused program.
Election of members by the employees takes place in compliance with the company law rules described at the Company's website. When joining the Board of Directors, the members elected by the employees are offered relevant training in serving on a board.

and commodity risk)

Risk management MANAGEMENT REPORT 48

Key risk factors in 2020 In addition to financial risks, the following risk factors are considered key risks in 2020:

Area

Description

Risk mitigation

Commodity prices

The prices of a large number of key commodities fluctuate in line with world market prices. To the extent that higher unit costs cannot be compensated for by higher selling prices per unit or in other ways of increasing the average selling price per unit correspondingly, Royal Unibrew's earnings will decrease.

Royal Unibrew monitors the trend in commodity prices. Hedging against short-term price increases takes place through agreements with suppliers and through commodity hedges with financial institutions. The Group's policy for hedging commodity risks involves a smooth and time-differentiated effect of commodity price increases.

Industry

In most markets, the product categories beer and soft drinks are characterized by tough price competition and intensive marketing from a number of suppliers. At the same time, continuous consolidation is seen among our customers who handle the distribution of products to consumers, which is to an increasing extent also centralizing internal distribution and product range decisions. Furthermore, the growth of local e-commerce and entry of global e-commerce providers open new routes to customers.

Royal Unibrew's earnings and competitiveness are ensured through constant focus on markets and segments in which Royal Unibrew holds or may achieve a significant position. Our investment in digital solutions and the continuous improvements across the business will contribute towards limiting the negative effect from the changes in the industry. Moreover, Royal Unibrew focuses on value management through the development of products, containers and packaging, cooperation with customers and communication with consumers.

IT risks

Royal Unibrew's activities are to a large extent dependent on the use of the established IT systems and the quality of the applied IT security solutions. A prolonged breakdown, unintended maloperation or an unauthorized break-in into the systems supporting sales and supply processes as well as internal information systems may involve a significant risk of interruption of Royal Unibrew's activities.

Royal Unibrew works consistently to improve its IT security and has established procedures to ensure: · day-to-day operation of the IT systems supporting the key business processes, · protection against data loss, · p rotection against unauthorized access to and distribution of confidential data, and · general protection against cybercrime.
When acquiring companies, it is our risk philosophy to adopt the companies into our existing IT system landscape as we for example integrated Lorina into SAP 2019.

Macroeconomic uncertainty

Royal Unibrew's product portfolio is sold in markets and market areas where market developments are usually determined by long-cycle trends. Macroeconomic uncertainty, including changes of free trade agreements or low growth of long duration or outbreaks causing a threat to the public health, may affect earnings negatively. As a consequence to this we might experience declining consumption or shifts in product mix towards products with lower earnings.

By focusing on flexibility in its action plans, Royal Unibrew is striving to get some leeway for reducing the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty and changes to consumption patterns.
The efforts directed at continuous improvements across the business will contribute towards limiting the negative effect of macroeconomic changes.

Partnership

Royal Unibrew cooperate with different partners across markets and product categories. Changes to these relationships may affect the Group's sales and net revenue, and thus earnings.

Royal Unibrew has in general a long history with our partners and mitigate the partnership risk by entering into long term agreements and by providing adequate business results.

Statutory restrictions

Royal Unibrew's activities are subject to national legislation in the markets in which Royal Unibrew operates. Any legislative changes may impact the ability to operate, e.g. by way of restrictions in respect of the sale, marketing, packing material and production of Royal Unibrew's products or due to increasing consumption taxes. Such restrictions may affect the Group's sales and earnings significantly.

Royal Unibrew participates in local and international cooperation fora within the brewery industry with a view to influencing legislative decision makers to ensure that conditions for producing and marketing beer and soft drinks do not deteriorate, and that consumption taxes are applied in a balanced manner. Royal Unibrew has increased its effort within the sustainability area and more details can be found in the CSR section on page 58.

Weather

The sale of Royal Unibrew's products is dependent on weather conditions. Usually, the consumption of Royal Unibrew's products is highest in the summer months. However, this presupposes dry and fair weather. The weather in the summer of 2019 is regarded as normal.

Through focus on flexibility of action plans and production capacity, Royal Unibrew aims at getting some leeway to respond to lower earnings caused by unfavorable weather conditions in the summer months, and at the same time ensuring the agility to support the customers in years with favorable weather.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Risk management MANAGEMENT REPORT 49

Risk management and management structure At least once a year, the Board of Directors assesses the overall risk factors relating to Royal Unibrew's activities. Risks are assessed under a two-dimensional "heat map" assessment system which estimates the significance of the risk in relation to EBITDA, damage to Royal Unibrew's reputation, violation of legislation or environmental implications as well as the probability of the risk resulting in an incident. Based on this assessment, the existing "heat map" is updated so as to reflect changes in the understanding of business risks. Following this registration of risks relating to Royal Unibrew's activities, the risks which may materially impact the realization of strategic objectives in the short and long term are identified.
Royal Unibrew's Treasury and Group Accounting department is responsible for facilitating and for continuously following up according to the annual wheel and reporting on risk-mitigating activities/action plans relating to the key risks in accordance with the decisions made by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee and the Executive Board.
Risk assessment in 2019 In 2019, Royal Unibrew's Executive Board closely monitored the development in market-related risks and made the necessary changes to risk-mitigating activities to realize budgeted earnings. In 2019, Royal Unibrew joined the UN Global Compact and has strengthened the governance structure and procedures for non-financial data reporting across the Group. The CSR and Risk Management organizations are working closely together to strengthen the overall risk assessment.
Centrally, the identified risks and proposed action plans were reviewed and assessed by the Company's Executive Board, whereas, the Audit Committee reviewed the adequacy and the

effectiveness of the risk management system. Based on this, the Executive Board presented the key risks to the Board of Directors and recommended the necessary risk-mitigating activities/action plans for approval. The Board of Directors then resolved to implement the necessary risk-mitigating measures with a view to ensuring optimum realization of Royal Unibrew's strategic objectives.
Control and risk management activities relating to the financial reporting process Royal Unibrew's internal control and risk management systems relating to the financial reporting process are described below.
Control activities Royal Unibrew has established a formalized group reporting process comprising monthly reporting, including budget follow-up, assessment of performance and achievement of established targets.
Moreover, a central corporate function is responsible for controlling the financial reporting from the subsidiaries, which also includes a statement from each reporting group entity in relation to compliance with adopted group policies and internal control measures. In 2019, controlling visits were paid to key subsidiaries.
In 2019, the Board of Directors has again assessed that establishment of a separate internal audit department is not required at this time considering the moderate complexity of the Group and the transparency of its reporting.
Information and communication The Board of Directors emphasizes the importance of the Group communicating openly, with due regard to the confi-

dentiality required for listed companies, and of the individual knowing his/her role with respect to internal control. In 2019, Royal Unibrew established a whistleblower scheme and encouraged employees and partners to use the system. The reporting method is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. One report was submitted and processed in 2019.
Royal Unibrew's accounting manual as well as other reporting instructions are continuously updated and are available at Royal Unibrew's intranet, where they can be accessed by all relevant employees. The instructions include account coding instructions and procedures for financial reconciliation and analyses, verifying the existence of assets as well as policy for credit granting and approval of fixed asset investments. The responsible finance officers of the group enterprises are informed in writing of changes. Moreover, internal update courses are organized for accounting staff.
Monitoring Monitoring is affected by continuous assessments and controls at all group levels. The scope and frequency of the periodic assessments depend primarily on a risk assessment and the efficiency of the continuous controls.
The auditors appointed by the general meeting report in the Auditor's Long-form Report to the Board of Directors material weaknesses in the Group's internal control systems in connection with the financial reporting process. Less material issues are reported in management letters to the Executive Board, after which the Executive Board informs the Board of Directors of the issues reported.
The Board of Directors meets three times annually with the auditors without the Executive Board attending.

Managing Corporate Social Responsibility

At Royal Unibrew, we are committed to conducting our business in an ethical, responsible and sustainable way ­ and we aim to make a positive contribution to the environment, the local communities and the wider society.
In 2019, we intensified our efforts, improved our transparency and defined new ambitious short-term corporate social responsibility targets. We also continued to build the platform for our longer-term sustainability strategy ­ and as part of this process we plan to present more specific long-term targets during 2020.
Royal Unibrew is a strong regional beverage company, founded on local anchored facilities, employees and sourcing of materials and services. We aim to provide successful brands that people trust and therefore, we have always been committed to contributing positively to the development in the areas in which we operate, to limiting our environmental impact, to establishing safe and good working conditions for our employees and to delivering high quality products to consumers.
We also realize that being regional but with global markets, we continuously need to improve our efforts and expand our sustainability scope to encompass the entire value chain across our markets.
We seek to drive improvements through innovation, operational excellence, and by partnering with our end-to-end supply chain.

UN Global Compact and SDGs commitments During 2019, we continued our endeavors towards establishing a well-defined and transparent corporate social responsibility framework.
In 2019, we defined which of the 17 UN SDGs (Sustainability Development Goals) to focus on, based on the materiality assessment conducted in 2018 and also taking into account the composition and nature of our business.
As planned, we also decided to sign up to UN Global Compact to further emphasize that we take responsibility and are committed to CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) ­ and continuously strive to improve our efforts in accordance with the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact regarding: Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment and Anti-corruption.
The 10 principles of UN Global Compact are incorporated in our objectives and actions and in order to ensure ongoing progress we have defined a range of short-term objectives for 2022, which only mark the start of our more systematic, documented and data driven journey. The objectives are categorized within four main areas: Consumers, Environment, People and Business integrity. By working systematically within this framework, and reporting publicly about our efforts, we aim to improve our performance.

UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
We apply the 17 SDGs as a framework for defining our targets and measuring on our progress with a special focus on the following goals:

SDG 3: Good health and well-being SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth

SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production SDG 13: Climate action SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions

Sustainable strategy ready in 2020 With the materiality assessment in 2018 and the 2019 initiatives we have established a platform for our future sustainability efforts and in 2020, we will integrate sustainability more explicitly in our business strategy.
Although Royal Unibrew needs to consider global developments and potential impacts and risks in a long-term perspective (2030), we believe that it is very important for our continuous progress and performance to define shorter-term objectives and measure on our actions and results on an ongoing basis. Our inherent values and culture, our policies and procedures as well as our competencies and business set-up are also fundamental enablers for our sustainability journey.
We have established short term objectives (2020 to 2022) within selected areas such as alcohol and sugar content in new products, CO2 emission for activities "inside our fence", packaging material and packaging waste as well as lost time incident frequency.
Improved accountability and transparency Signing up to the UN Global Compact was the starting point for further formalization of our CSR efforts, including further improvement of transparency in our CSR policies, systems and due diligence processes.
Establishing clear accounting policies for CSR and sustainability indicators and thus establishing the basis for transpar-

ency and external assurance has been an integral part of this process. When measuring the development of the indicators, we have selected 2015 as the baseline year ­ in line with the time frame of the international and national agreements on climate as well as common industry practice. The choice of specific indicators and the way we measure our results are still work in progress, and the indicators and our reporting will be further fine-tuned in the coming years.
We strive to work with a balanced approach towards our stakeholders, both by disclosing potential risks to our business and how we control these, as well as by showing the opportunities for Royal Unibrew; commercially, as a trusted partner in the local community and not least as a great place to work.
We have implemented policies and procedures to minimize risks from our activities and to ensure our freedom to operate. Compliance with legal and other requirements, including our ethical policy, is fundamental. Potential risks may include food safety incidents, workplace incidents, human rights violations in the value chain or failure to attract and retain the right employees preventing our business from expanding. Market availability of recycled packaging material, lack of well-functioning waste collection and recycling systems, unintentional emissions or inefficient processes are the main risks for our environmental footprint.

GOVERNANCE
Our CSR activities, including our CSR objectives and targets, are anchored at the Board of Directors, which sets the direction for our strategy, targets and Group policies together with the Executive Management. The targets are aligned by and implemented through the Growth Leadership Team.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019
Consumers
Being a responsible company, Royal Unibrew is aware of the global challenges formulated by WHO regarding obesity and the associated risks of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes as well as risk of alcohol abuse, linked to excess consumption of food and beverages.
Royal Unibrew supports national and international trade associations, such as Brewers' of Europe's views and guidelines on responsible drinking. We also participate actively in innovation partnerships looking at ways to reduce calorie content in soft drinks. In addition, we support a large variety of sports and health initiatives through sponsorships regionally and locally. In Finland, for example, all beer sponsorships will be converted into 0.0% alcohol beer.
Royal Unibrew strives to offer consumers and customers sustainable enjoyment through a broad variety of beverages, complementing the setting/situation whether the individuals find themselves at a music venue, dining with family and friends, exercising, travelling or at other occasions. The purpose is to provide energy, refreshment, quenching thirst or simply a good time. Consequently, we develop, launch and supply products with great taste and with regular, low/ non-alcohol and calorie content, all clearly declared.

Consumers

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT REPORT 66

Increasing the "low or non" varieties During recent years, Royal Unibrew has across the group introduced more low-sugar or non-sugar alternatives compared to regular products in the soft drink, water and energy categories. The volume of low/non sugar products increased by 37% from 2016 to 2019, while regular products increased by only 9% in the same period.
We apply state-of-the-art process technology for low or non-alcohol beverages through e.g. the 2019 implementation of a new de-alcoholizing process in Denmark. The production of 0.0% and low alcohol products increased across the Group in 2019 accommodating the general consumer trend. The increase in volume of non-alcoholic beer resulting in at least double-digit growth from 2018 to 2019 in Denmark, Finland and the Baltic, and the low alcohol/non-alcohol volume increase outperformed the growth for alcohol containing beers by at least 5 percentage points in Finland and 65 percentage points in the Baltic.

Over the coming years, we will continue with a balanced development and launch of regular and reduced ­ both low and no ­ content of alcohol and sugar in our beverages.
In 2020, we plan to expand our tap wall concept (an innovative draught beer system with many taps) to include a choice of water and other products with reduced or no sugar/alcohol. In Off-Trade we will support a better overview of beverage choices for the consumers through co-development of new category-based sales displays.
We will continue to support and participate in relevant programs and partnerships regarding responsible beverages regionally and strive to identify relevant partnerships at Group level.

Operational efficiency and circular thinking have always been a part of the Royal Unibrew's DNA. Optimizing resource consumption by reducing, reusing and recycling is relevant for all materials, including energy, water and waste (residuals from brewing) both at our production sites but also very importantly in other parts of our value chain such as raw materials, malting, packaging and distribution.
Several projects were implemented in 2019 and many will follow in 2020 and beyond. More information is available in "Future proofing Royal Unibrew".
Royal Unibrew's efficiency on energy per produced volume has improved by 12% compared to 2015 irrespective of the acquisitions in 2018 and 2019. The performance on water consumption has also improved, however, the effect of the recent acquisitions was more significant on our water efficiency than on our energy efficiency. Between 2018 and 2019, the energy and water consumption per hl increased slightly.

Well-functioning deposit return systems (DRS) are in place in Denmark, Finland and Lithuania. Similar systems are currently being discussed in France, Latvia and Italy. In the Danish deposit return system, at least 9 out of 10 glass bottles, PET bottles and cans are collected and in Finland, the return system rate is even higher. The deposit return systems are continuosly improved to increase the recyckling rates further. Thus, to ensure availability of recycled packaging material, the Danish DRS is working towards establishing a closed loop food grade recycling system where the materials may be either reused or recycled for food packaging material.
Furthermore, in many of our markets, infrastructure for recycling of material is provided by the local governments, supporting additional collection of material for recycling. The EU waste directive and the extended producer responsibility will enhance this as well. In fact, access to recycled food grade PET will be highly dependent on governments' ability to deliver on the infrastructure, where deposit return systems are not yet available.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT REPORT 69

Carbon footprint and renewables We are well-aware, that the brewing industry's main CO2 footprint is outside the facilities. When we look at industry averages, the brewing/filling, production and recycling of packaging material as well as distribution account for approximately 75% of the total carbon footprint of our products, where raw material and sales refrigeration contributes the rest.
With reference to the Green House Gas Protocol (GHG), we are confident that the calculated production footprint corre-

sponding to the GHG protocol's scope 1 and 2 (direct emissions from our activities and indirect emissions from electricity purchased) as it is directly calculated from our energy consumption. Regarding Scope 3 emissions (all other indirect emissions) from sources we do not own or control ­ in this case packaging material and distribution ­ we have used industry standards for our initial calculation of the CO2 impact. Other significant Scope 3 contributors such as raw material, including malting and sales refrigeration will be established in the coming years.

For 2019, the initial calculation of the CO2 impact from production, packaging material and distribution was 40, 143, 30 million kg CO2, respectively.
The carbon footprint for our production was reduced by 10%, measured as kg CO2 per produced volume, from the base year 2015 to 2019. Between 2018 and 2019, the kg CO2 per produced volume increased slightly.

Royal Unibrew is working on investing in renewable energy as a mean to reduce our carbon footprint. In 2020, we will continue the journey of becoming carbon neutral by reducing our Danish, Baltic, Finnish and Italian footprint of electricity consumption via purchase of "green" electricity, corresponding to more than 99% of our consumption. In parallel, we will continue to explore and decide on our investment approach as to renewable energy.
At the same time, Royal Unibrew is working on reducing the impact from packaging material by reducing weight (down weighing) and changing from virgin material to recycled material on e.g. PET and cardboard. In 2019, we introduced recycled: paper labels, corrugated trays and shrink film for several brands.
Our target in the Danish production is a recycled PET fraction of at least 50% on average of our PET bottles in 2021. We have increased the fraction of recycled material steadily in 2019 and our Egekilde Still is now in a 100% recycled PET bottle. Thus, we expect the overall Danish target to be met already in 2020.
Royal Unibrew has been carbon neutral on the Egekilde products for several years based on externally verified CO2 cal-

culations and CO2 credits. We are now applying the environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology for selected materials and categories, among others plastic cups used for events, to meet consumer demands and provide our customers with environmental data for making an informed choice.
Replacement of older distribution vehicles is ongoing in Denmark where we own the distribution vehicles, and likewise, we are looking into electrification of transportation equipment and vehicles at all sites. Increasing the use of renewable energy beyond the national grid mixes is also in the pipeline for 2020. Furthermore, we plan to install charging stations at our headquarter in 2020.

Employee well-being A good working environment is a safe and healthy working environment, and that is a top priority for Royal Unibrew. We focus on minimizing risks and raising awareness about health and safety for all our employees and take preventive measures to avoid employees being worn out and incurring work-related injuries ­ and we recognize that one accident is one to many. Ensuring well-being and promoting job satisfaction is a priority as well.
At most production sites near-misses are registered and followed up daily in order to establishing preventive measures as quickly as possible to avoid accidents. When accidents with or without lost time unfortunately occur, we conduct thorough root cause assessments and implement the necessary improvements.
At all production sites, occupational health and safety (OHS) activities are adapted to the local production site and work area. In Denmark, for example, joint OHS discussions, an OHS day as well as courses with focus on stress were carried out in 2019. At group level, project execution in operations includes an OHS assessment. In 2019 and 2020, expansion and capacity driven projects will reduce heavy lifting and improve access for safe operations, maintenance and cleaning further.

Local focus and initiatives have resulted in a continued reduction in Lost Time Incidents per 1 million working hours (LTI frequency) by 30% from 2015 to 2018 and has leveled out between 2018 and 2019. Root cause assessments indicate that behavior is the main reason for incidents. Therefore, we have planned to enhance our behavioral-based safety training and awareness across the Group to reduce the LTI frequency by 40% in 2022 compared to 2018.
Employee satisfaction In 2019, Royal Unibrew conducted an Employee Satisfaction Survey, as we do every second year. Our overall engagement score was 4.0 (scale 1-5) or 80%. Generally, 72% is considered a market average. Employees see more opportunities to develop compared to previous surveys and they emphasize that their tasks are meaningful. They also rate their managers better than before, indicating that our focus on leadership and employee development has an effect.
Employee and organizational development It is Royal Unibrew's ambition to attract and retain competent and talented people who are result-oriented, adaptable, innovative, creative and having the right mindset. This is a prerequisite for realizing our ambitious business objectives. It is achieved by supporting and promoting diversity and inclusion and investing in our employees ­ both by way of learning and by upgrading of skills, and by empowering them to have influence on their jobs and by listening to their ideas and wishes for the future.
We believe that we need to foster an agile and flexible organization to adapt to the changing needs of our consumers and customers. We change, re-organize and fine-tune our

internal structures and processes on an ongoing basis and expect our employees to adapt to new methods and tasks quickly. It puts demands on the individual employee and on our ability to collaborate across the organization while at the same time it offers opportunities for new assignments and/or responsibilities within or outside the business area. We believe that trust and responsibility foster great results.
In 2019, we continued a range of activities focusing on developing our talent pool and succession management. Various leadership competence development activities have been put in place focusing on developing the basic leadership skills, cross-organizational collaboration as well as building high performing leadership teams. Mentoring of young/inexperienced managers and key employees continued.
In Denmark, our production workers (blue collar) are being upgraded continuously. Since 2013, more than 10% have been through a train-the-trainer program for "Industrial instructors", where they learn how to teach new colleagues in safety, quality and machine operations in a standardized way to ensure the right focus. In 2018, we added a training course for "Technical Operators" aiming at developing selected employees from filling and warehouse to master safe failure investigations and minor maintenance on filling lines and conveyors. In addition, appointed Line Coordinators have been trained in handover of status and challenges at white board meetings between shifts.
In addition, all our employees were offered a number of courses that give the individual concrete tools to handle a more complex and changeable workday, as well as on-thejob training.

Diversity and inclusion We want our organization to reflect the diversity of today's society and we believe that diversity creates the best and most dynamic workplace climate ­ and supports long term value creation for all our stakeholders.

Continuous efforts are made to ensure workplace diversity and inclusion. Traditionally, the beverage industry is relatively male-dominated, but Royal Unibrew strives on an ongoing basis to ensure a more equal gender representation. We measure gender diversity in international management teams and at the Board of Directors. In 2019, the number of women of the Board of Directors increased from 0 to having 2 out of 8 general assembly elected members. In our international management teams, we improve gender diversity year after year. We also work on promoting other diversity aspects such as initiatives to include people that for various reasons, struggle to maintain or get a foothold on the job market. For more information see "Promoting diversity and inclusion".

Our target is a more balanced gender representation of at least 40% of each gender. When recruting new executives, we prioritize identifying without discrimination and aim to encourage female candidates' interest in taking on managerial tasks.

Business integrity
Ethics At Royal Unibrew business ethics are an integral and important part of the corporate culture. By respecting a set of ethical principles and guidelines, we believe we create stronger relationships with all our stakeholders.
Royal Unibrew's ethics policy and our Code of Conduct provide guidance for our employees, third parties acting on behalf of the Company and suppliers regarding anti-corruption, environment, human rights and labor standards but also GDPR, competition and marketing law. The basic requirement for all Royal Unibrew's actions and interactions is being in legal compliance, i.e. having the right mechanisms to ensure that we have no violations.
Internal controls and the whistle-blower scheme are important means for controlling and reporting potential irregularities also by external stakeholders. Regular training is among the tools to ensure compliance internally, thus employees are trained in relevant aspects depending on their function inside and outside of the Company. All employees were GDPR trained by e-learning and had to pass an exam in 2019.

Business integrity

In 2020, we plan to expand our e-learning capacity by encompassing competition law and anti-corruption in the platform.
One whistle-blower case was managed in 2019.
Responsible sourcing We aim to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards. A Code of Conduct targeting suppliers was developed in 2019, whereas the ethical policy has been integrated in our contractual agreements for a long time. Our suppliers' product safety performance has been evaluated systematically during 2019 and in 2020, we will through a risk-based approach enhance our supplier management to explicitly include further relevant CSR aspects, including carbon footprint, employee well-being and safety and human rights, in our evaluation as well.
Tax Royal Unibrew operates in a number of predominately European countries and is therefore subject to both national and international tax rules. At the same time, the nature of Royal Unibrew's business implies that both direct and excise duties are paid in the individual markets. Through its tax payments, Royal Unibrew contributes positively to the societies in which it operates ­ as well as by creating jobs and using predominately local suppliers and thereby supporting the UN's Sustainability Development Goals.

The following general principles apply to Royal Unibrew's management of tax issues:
· R oyal Unibrew pays taxes on its activities in the countries in which the activities are carried out, and no special tax structures for the purpose of tax optimization are applied.
· Royal Unibrew always aim to comply with national and international tax legislation and sets out to enter into an open and constructive dialogue with the tax authorities.
· R oyal Unibrew has an internal organization which monitors and controls procedures designed to ensure compliance with tax legislation.
· R oyal Unibrew wants to communicate openly and fairly about its tax policy and tax payments.
· Royal Unibrew was not involved in any cases of non-compliance with tax legislation in 2019.
In 2019, the effective tax rate was 22% of profit for the year (2018: 22%). Royal Unibrew paid corporation tax of DKK 338 million on its operating activities (2018: DKK 251 million). In addition, Royal Unibrew's activities generate other considerable tax payments, including excise duties on beer, mineral water and other items, VAT, personal taxes and social security contributions. The total contribution through taxes in 2019 amounted to DKK 4.8 billion (2018: 5.0 billion). The decrease in tax contribution relates to changes in excise duty rates, lower campaign activity in Finland and a shift in product mix from alcoholic beverages to non-alcoholic beverages.

Descriptive notes for the non-financial highlights and ratios

Note 1: Basis for preparation
Royal Unibrew A/S has developed a CSR data reporting manual encompassing roles and responsibilities, data scope, reporting, controls and documentation requirements as well as a detailed description of each key performance indicator.

Note 2: Environment & Climate data
Royal Unibrew has reported on environmental performance for a number of years. Therefore, data are available from 2015 to 2019. The data has been corrected to the new reporting requirements mentioned in Note 1.
The increase in consumption of energy and water and generation of waste including wastewater is due to the increased production volume and to acquisitions in 2018 (Terme di Crodo and Lorina) and 2019 (Bauskas Alus). Whereas consumption of energy per hectoliters has improved as has the associated CO2 emission due to a keen focus on energy reduction projects, the water consumption per hectoliter has from a steady reduction, increased in 2018 and 2019, mainly due to lower efficiency at the acquired sites. If corrected for the acquired sites, a 9% reduction would have been obtained within the same time period.
For the first time, we have calculated the CO2 emission for transportation (downstream), including GHG Scope 1 and Scope 3, i.e. owned and leased vehicles as well as third party forwarders measured as kg CO2 equivalent. The calculation is based on industry standards and direct input from our forwarders. It is estimated that at least 80% of the footprint is accounted for, but further data development is needed. The same applies to our CO2 emission from packaging material.

Note 3: People wellbeing & development data
Royal Unibrew A/S has for 2015 to 2019 collected data for lost time incidents (LTI) and disclosed information in our annual report. The data has been corrected to the new reporting requirements mentioned in Note 1. The acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 have a negative impact on our LTI performance (by 6% and 8%, respectively), but the performance would have declined anyway between 2018 and 2019.
There may be underreporting of LTIs as the focus traditionally has been on registering incidents for production/ware housing and to a lesser degree distribution, sales and administration. We will enhance the awareness in this area in 2020 and beyond.
As it may be noted other relevant data for occupational health and safety performance has only been collected for 2018 and 2019, as the recording has been lacking at some entities before that time. The same applies to employee engagement and diversity. We are working on improving recording and reporting.

Independent auditor's report

To the shareholders of Royal Unibrew A/S
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the Group's and Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2019 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to the Board or Directors and the Audit Committee.
Audited financial statements Royal Unibrew A/S' consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements for the financial year 1 January ­ 31 December 2019 comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the Parent Company (the financial statements). The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements.
We declare, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services, as referred to in Article 5(1) of the Regulation (EU) 537/2014 and that we remained independent in conducting the audit.
Appointment as auditors We were appointed auditors of Royal Unibrew A/S for the first time on 24 April 2018 for the financial year 2018. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of two years including the financial year 2019.
Statement on the Management's review Management is responsible for the Management's review.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statement Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the Management's review.
Management's responsibility for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control that Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Independent auditor's report SIGNATURES 84

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the 2019 financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matters
Valuation of intangible assets Goodwill and trademarks represent 50% of the Group's assets. Management conducts annual impairment test to determine whether the carrying values of recognised goodwill and trademarks are considered to be impaired and, hence, should be written down to the recoverable amount. Management determines the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) using a discounted cash flow model (value in use). Management uses key assumptions in respect of market and country risks, revenue and margin development and discount rate for the CGUs. The audit of the recoverable amount has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries in the parent company's separate financial statements and the values of intangible assets contained therein is also tested to identify any impairment. This is the same test as described above. Reference is made to note 12 in the consolidated financial statement and note 10 in the Parent Company financial statements.
Revenue recognition There are a significant number of transactions and contracts with customers. Sales contracts with customers are relatively complex with discounts and agreements with marketing contributions etc. Furthermore locally imposed duties and fees are complex. Overall this introduce an inherent risk to revenue recognition process. Therefore we have considered this as a Key Audit Matter. Reference is made to note 5 in the consolidated financial statements.
Purchase price allocation In 2019, the Group has acquired Bev.Con ApS including Cult A/S and finalised the purchase price allocations for the acquistions made in 2018 for Etablissements Geyer Fréres, France and 51% of Nohrlund ApS, Denmark.
Acquisitions including the required purchase price allocation have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2019. The purchase price allocations are based on a number of management assumptions and estimates related to measurement of all acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. Due to the significant impact on the consolidated financial statement and allocation based on management assumptions, we have considered this as a Key Audit Matter. Reference is made to note 25 in the consolidated financial statements.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:
· W e have discussed with Management and evaluated the internal controls and procedures for preparing impairment tests and the budget and forecasts.
· We have focused our audit on the models and the appropriateness of key assumptions used by Management to calculate the values in use, as well as defined CGUs and assessed the consistency of the assumptions applied.
· We have assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates applied and underlying assumptions, as well as benchmarking to market data and external information.
· O ur internal valuation specialists have supported the audit where relevant. · In addition, we have assessed whether the disclosures; Note 12 Intangible Assets in the consolidat-
ed financial statements meet the requirements of IFRS.
For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:
· W e have considered the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition policy and assessed the compliance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
· W e have evaluated the systems and key controls, designed and implemented by Management, related to revenue recognition.
· We have discussed with Management the key assumptions related to recognition, measurement and classification of revenue
· In addition, we have performed substantive procedures. We have discussed significant and complex customer contracts, locally imposed duties and fees and the development in discounts and the treatment of marketing contribution to ensure that accounting policies are applied correctly.
· W e have performed journalentries testing and verification of proper cut-off at year-end.
For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:
· W e have assessed the purchase price allocations made including assessing whether the assumptions and estimates made by Management are reasonable and documented.
· W e have reconciled the purchase price allocation to supporting documentation including share purchase agreements, calculations of fair value of brands and other intangibles, and opening balances from the acquired entities.
· In assessing the assumptions and estimates as well as the fair value calculations, we have involved our internal valuation specialists.
· In addition, we have assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures; Note 25 Acquisition of subsidiaries.

Independent auditor's report SIGNATURES 85

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.

· e valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
· c onclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· e valuate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
· o btain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with government with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determined that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 93

Descriptive notes to Consolidated Annual Report

Note 1 Basis of preparation of Consolidated Annual Report

Basis of preparation Royal Unibrew A/S is a limited liability company registered in Denmark. The Financial Statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2019 presented in the Annual Report comprise both Consolidated Financial Statements of Royal Unibrew A/S and its subsidiaries (Group) and separate Parent Company Financial Statements.
The Financial Statements of Royal Unibrew for 2019 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for financial statements, cf the Danish Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The Board of Directors and the Executive Board considered and adopted the Annual Report of Royal Unibrew A/S for 2019 on 10 March 2020. The Annual Report will be submitted for adoption by the shareholders of Royal Unibrew A/S at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2020.
The Financial Statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK).
Accounting policies are unchanged from last year except from implementation of IFRIC 23.
Significant accounting policies
This section describes the general accounting policies applied by Royal Unibrew. A detailed description of the accounting policies applied and critical estimates made with respect to specific reported amounts is presented in the relevant notes. The purpose of this is to create full transparency of the disclosed amounts by providing a total description of the relevant accounting policy, the critical estimates and the numerical information for each note.

The description of accounting policies in the notes constitutes part of the overall description of Royal Unibrew's accounting policies.
New and amended standards and interpretations that have not yet taken effect At the time of publication of this Annual Report, the IASB has issued new and amended financial reporting standards and interpretations which are potentially relevant, but not mandatory, for Royal Unibrew A/S at the time of preparation of the Annual Report for 2019.
The adopted, not yet effective standards and interpretations will be implemented as they become mandatory for Royal Unibrew A/S. None of the new standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on recognition and measurement for Royal Unibrew A/S.
IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment IFRIC 23 has been implemented as of 1 January 2019. The Group follows the guidelines in IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions.
IFRIC 23 specifically addresses whether an entity considers each uncertain tax position separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax positions. The approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty is followed, and uncertain tax positions are measured at the most likely outcome. No material changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions is expected from the implementation of IFRIC 23.
Consolidated Financial Statements The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise Royal Unibrew A/S (the Parent Company) and enterprises in which the Parent Company exercises control (subsidiaries).

Enterprises in which the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the votes and exercises significant influence but not control are classified as associates.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of Financial Statements of all group enterprises prepared under the Group's accounting policies by combining accounting items of a uniform nature. Elimination is made of intercompany income and expenses, unrealised intercompany profits and losses, balances and shareholdings. Comparative figures are not adjusted for newly acquired, sold or wound-up enterprises.
Acquired enterprises are recognised as of the date of acquisition. Enterprises disposed of are recognised in the consolidated income statement up until the date of disposal.
Non-controlling interests's share of profit/loss for the year and of the equity in subsidiaries is included as part of Royal Unibrew's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.
Translation policies For each of the reporting entities of the Group, a functional currency is determined. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the reporting entity operates. Transactions in other currencies than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currencies.
Transactions in other currencies than the functional currency are initially translated into Danish kroner at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, inventories and other non-monetary assets purchased in foreign currencies and measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date rates.
On recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements of enterprises with another functional currency than Danish kroner (DKK), income statements are translated at average annual exchange rates. Balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the opening balance sheet items of foreign enterprises at exchange rates at the balance sheet date and on the translation of income statements from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income. Similarly, exchange adjustments arising due to changes made directly in equity of foreign enterprises are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements of associates with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency of the Parent Company, the share of results for the year is translated at average exchange rates, and the share of equity including goodwill is translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the share of the opening equity of foreign associates at exchange rates at the balance sheet date and on the translation of the share of results for the year from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income and classified in equity under a separate translation reserve.

In connection with the preparation of the Parent Company and Consolidated Financial Statements, Management makes estimates and judgements as to how recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities should take place based on the accounting policies applied.
Judgements as an element in significant accounting policies
The calculation of carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities requires judgement as to how assets and liabilities should be classified in the Financial Statements and how future events will affect the value of these assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. In connection with the financial reporting for 2019, the following judgments have been made materially affecting the related items as described in relevant notes, see list below.
Critical accounting estimates
Management's estimates are based on assumptions which Management considers reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In connection with the financial reporting for 2019, the following critical estimates have been made as desribed in the notes, see list below.

Accounting policies , judgements as an element in significant accounting policies as well as critical accounting estimates are described in the notes:

Note 3 Financial risk management
The Group's financial risks are managed centrally according to the Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors, which includes guidelines for the handling of currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. Commodity risks are also managed under a commodity risk policy approved by the Board of Directors.
Currency risk Royal Unibrew is exposed to currency risks through the geographic spread of the Group's activities. This currency exposure is reflected through the activities in the subsidiaries and the Parent Company's export activities where cash flows are earned in foreign currencies, and in connection with the purchase of raw materials primarily in EUR and USD, including purchases which involve an indirect USD risk on the part of the purchase price related to the raw material element. Purchases are in all materiality made in the currencies in which the Group has income, which results in a total reduction of the currency risk. Furthermore, the translation of loans to/from subsidiaries as well as the Group's net debt is subject to currency risk where these are not established in DKK.
The above describes Royal Unibrew's transaction risks, which are hedged actively according to the Treasury Policy. EUR is not hedged as the risk is immaterial provided that the existing 0.5% band of DKK to EUR under Denmark's monetary policy is maintained. The objective is to reduce negative effects on the Group's profit and cash flows. The risk is therefore monitored and hedged continually. The Group's cash flows are primarily in EUR, USD, CAD and GBP.
The total gross currency risk (before hedging) on the balance sheet items was calculated at 31 December 2019. The following table shows the sensitivity to a positive change in the cross rates at 31 December 2019 with all other variables remaining unchanged. A negative change has a corresponding effect merely with the sign reversed.

Royal Unibrews translation risk relates primarily to France, Italy, Finland, Latvia as well as Lithuania (EUR). The translation risk related to Royal Unibrew's investments in foreign subsidiaries is, as a general rule, not hedged.
Financial risks such as the loss of competitive strength due to longterm exchange rate changes are not hedged by financial instruments but are included in Royal Unibrew's strategic considerations and risk management.
Interest rate risk Royal Unibrew's interest rate risk is substantially related to the Group's loan portfolio which is primarily denominated in DKK and EUR. Interest rate changes will affect the market value of fixed-interest loans as well as interest payments on floating-rate liabilities. Debt is established only in currencies in which the Group has commercial activities.
In Royal Unibrew's assessment, the key interest rate risk is related to the immediate effect of interest rate changes on the Group's interest payment flows and Royal Unibrew focuses only secondarily on changes in the market value of the debt. It is group policy to limit the effect of interest rate changes on profit and cash flows while, within this framework, also achieving the lowest possible financing cost. At the end of 2019, mortgage debt amounted to DKK 855 million (2018: DKK 859 million) with an average term to maturity of 9,8 years (2018: 10,8 years). Bank debt comprises committed bank credit facilities and long term loan with an agreed term to maturity between 3 to 6 years (2018: 3 to 7 years). 46% (2018: 47%) of the mortgage and bank debt is fixed-interest through the Group's hedging of interest rate risk and fixed rate loans with a fixed-interest period between 1-6 years (2018: 2-7 years). A one percentage point interest rate change will affect the

Group's interest expenses by approx +/- DKK 10,5 million (2018: approx +/- DKK 10 million), and the interest expenses of the Parent Company by approx +/- DKK 3 million (2018: approx +/- DKK 6 million).
Credit risks The Group's credit risks relate primarily to trade receivables and counterparty risks.
The Group's counterparty risks comprise both commercial and financial counterparty risk. The commercial counterparty risk relates primarily to business agreements with a built-in element of firm rate/price. The financial counterparty risk relates to hedging agreements as well as net bank deposits. The financial counterparty risk is actively reduced by distributing net bank deposits on banks in accordance with the credit rating criteria determined in the Treasury Policy.
Royal Unibrew seeks to limit risks relating to credit granting to customers in export markets through extensive use of insurance cover and other types of hedging of payments. Where effective hedges cannot be established, Royal Unibrew has established procedures for approval of such risks. There are no material credit risks on individual customers. The credit risk is generally higher relating to customers in the on-trade sales channel than relating to off-trade customers. This difference in credit risk is addressed through various approval procedures and credit granting conditions for customers in the two sales channels. In Finland, risks on major single receivables from customers are reduced through sale of the receivables DKK 347 mill. (2018: DKK 361 mill) Credit risks relating to trade receivables are reduced by setting off accrued bonus. At 31 December 2019, accrued bonus amounts to DKK 236 million (2018: DKK 239 million) set off against trade receivables.
The maximum credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Liquidity risks It is group policy that its cash resources should be adequate to meet the expected liquidity requirements in the current and next financial year. The cash resources may be bank deposits, short-term bonds and unutilised credit facilities.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019
Note 3 Financial risk management (continued)
Capital management Royal Unibrew wants to ensure structural and financial flexibility as well as competitive power. To ensure this, continuous assessment is made to determine the appropriate capital structure of Royal Unibrew. It is the target that the Group's net interest-bearing debt should not exceed 2.5 x EBITDA and that an equity ratio of at least 30% should be maintained at year end.
At the operational level, continuous efforts are directed at optimising working capital investments. Subject to adequate capacity and capability, investments in production facilities will be limited to replacement of individual components, related to specific products or to optimisation of selected processes as well as maintenance.
Commodity risks The commodity risk relates primarily to the purchasing of cans (aluminium), malt (barley), hops and packaging materials (cardboard) as well as energy. The commodity risk is actively hedged commercially and financially in accordance with the Group's Treasury Policy.
The objective of managing Royal Unibrew's commodity risk is to achieve a smooth and time-differentiated effect of commodity price increases, which is primarily achieved by entering into fixed-price agreements with the relevant suppliers. As regards to the Group's purchase of cans, financial contracts have been made to hedge the risk of aluminium price increases. Exchange rate changes with respect to the settlement currency of aluminium (USD) are an element of the overall currency risk management.
The most significant part of purchases for the next 12 months has, in accordance with Royal Unibrew's policy, been hedged by entering into supplier agreements and financial contracts. A +/-10% change in the price of aluminium would have a P/L effect at Group level of approx +/- DKK 4,2 million (2018: DKK 2 million).

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. Positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are included as other receivables and other payables, respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of a recognised asset or a recognised liability are recognised in the income statement as are any changes in the value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income. Income and expenses relating to such hedging transactions are transferred from other comprehensive income on realisation of the hedged item and are recognised in the same entry as the hedged item.
For derivative financial instruments which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values are recognised on a current basis in financial income and expenses in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
When entering into derivative financial instruments, Management exercises judgement to determine whether the instrument qualifies as effective hedging of recognised assets or liabilities or expected future cash flows. Derivative financial instruments recognised are tested for effectiveness at least quarterly, and any ineffectiveness identified is recognised in the income statement.

Segment reporting
The Group's business segment is beverage sales. Reporting on the business segment is by geographical markets. Segment reporting is based on the Group's returns and risks and its internal financial reporting system.
Items included in net profit for the year, including income from investments in associates and financial income and expenses, are allocated to the extent that the items are directly or indirectly attributable to the markets.
Items allocated both by direct and indirect computation comprise "production costs" and "administrative expenses", which are allocated by indirect computation based on allocation keys determined on the basis of the market's drain on key resources. Administrative expenses incurred in the group functions of the Parent Company are partly allocated.
Non-current assets comprise the non-current assets that are directly or indirectly used in connection with activities in the markets.
Segment liabilities comprise liabilities derived from activities in the market, including provisions, trade payables, VAT, excise duties and other payables.

Net revenue
Net revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement at the point in time when the control of goods and products is transferred to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, and if revenues can be measured reliably and are expected to be received.
Net revenue from contracts with customers is measured at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. Net revenue is measured exclusive of VAT and net of discounts as well as excise duties collected on behalf of third parties.
The Group gives various discounts and fees depending on the nature of the customer and business. Discounts comprise unit price reductions as well as contributions to promotional activities and product promotion based on volumes or value of purchases. The discounts are either granted as deductions from the invoice amount or are earned as a bonus paid at the end of the bonus period. All types of discounts granted are recognised in net revenue.
The Group considers whether contracts include other promises that constitute separate performance obligations and to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated.

Comment
The share-based payments to the Executive Board comprise a programme of 69.806 restricted (conditional) shares allotted for no consideration vesting in the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. These shares are excercisable at 31 December 2019. Further 17,921 restricted (conditional) shares related to the vesting period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 are outstanding at 31 December 2019.
Share-based payments
The Group only has schemes classified as equity-settled schemes. Restricted shares are measured at fair value at the time of granting and are recognised in staff expenses in the income statement over the vesting period. The counter item is recognised directly in equity.
At the initial recognition of the restricted shares, the number of shares expected to vest is estimated. Subsequently, the estimate of the number of restricted shares is revised so that the total recognition is based on the actual number of shares allotted.

Note 6 Staff expenses (continued)
Share-based payments
The fair value of the expected allotment of restricted shares is estimated under the Black-Scholes model. In determining fair value, conditions and terms related to the restricted shares are taken into account.
The market value of program applying to 2017-2019 has been calculated under the Black-Scholes model partly at DKK 264 per share of DKK 2 and partly at DKK 370 per share of DKK 2, which is equal to the Royal Unibrew A/S market price at the time of allotments respectively 17 January 2017 and 6 March 2018. The market price was DKK 20 million for the estimated maximum number of shares. The market value has been charged to the income statement on an estimated straight-line basis over the vesting period, corresponding to the rate at which the conditions for the allotment of the shares was expected to be met. The conditions has been fully (100%) met at 31 December 2019. Due to the change in the plan in march 2018, the income in 2019 is charged less than one third of the total value and less than the value charged in 2018

· fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and · the arrangement had conveyed a right to use the asset. An arrangement had conveyed the right to use
the asset if one of the following was met: · the purchaser had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an
insignificant amount of the output; · the purchaser had the ability or right to control physical access to the asset while obtaining or con-
trolling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or · facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insig-
nificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the current market price per unit of output.

Comment
Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives relating to Hartwall (Finland) represents more than 10% of the total value of goodwill and trademarks.
Development costs incurred are immaterial and have been recognised in production costs.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost. Subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units at the time of acquisition. The determination of cash-generating units is based on management structure and internal financial management.
Trademarks, distribution rights and customer relations
Trademarks, distribution rights and customer relations are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost. Subsequently, they are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and less any accumulated impairment losses. Distribution rights and customer relations are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Trademarks are not amortised as they are all well-established, old and profitable trademarks which customers are expected to continue demanding unabatedly, other things being equal, and which Management is not planning to stop selling and marketing.
Distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, maximum 20 years. Customer relations are amortised on a straigt-line basis over their estimated useful lives, maximum 5 years.
Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment. It is the Group's strategy to maintain trademarks and their value.

Impairment test of goodwill and trademarks

2019
The impairment test in 2019 did give rise to recognising impairment loss of DKK 7 million. .

The carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives at 31 December is related to the cash-generating operational units and breaks down as follows:

The recoverable amount is based on value in use, which is calculated by means of expected net cash flows on the basis of budgets and forecasts for 2020-2022 approved by Management as well as estimated market driven discount rates and growth rates.
The consumption in the markets in which Royal Unibrew operates is generally expected to remain at the same level in 2020 as in 2019. In Western Europe, the Danish consumption of Royal Unibrews beverage categories is expected to be stagnant in the coming years. In the Baltic Sea segment, Royal Unibrew expects unchanged Finnish consumption for 2020 while the consumption in the Baltic countries will still be negatively affected by legislative changes and the demographic development. Through further developing the businesses acquired in 2018 and 2019 and with continued focus on exploring commercial opportunities and innovation following the consumer trends, Royal Unibrew expects to be able to maintain or increase the revenue and earnings from the core brands and business areas mainly through volume increases. Gross margins are expected to remain stable at the present level through continuous focus on value management and continuous efficiency improvements. The key assumptions for the calculation of recoverable amount are shown below.

The forecasted results approved by Management are based on previously achieved results and expected market developments, see above. The average growth rates applied are in accordance with Management's expectations taking into account industry conditions in the individual markets. The discount rates applied are before tax and reflect current specific risks in the individual market. External consultants have advised how to determine the discount rates. In Western Europe, the highest point of the range indicated for the discount rate relates to Italy. In Baltic Sea, the lowest point of the range indicated for the growth rates of terminal value and discount rate relates to Finland. The assumptions applied by Management are inherently subject to uncertainty and unpredictability. Reasonably probable changes will not lead to recognition of impairment losses, why no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.

Only limited revenue growth is expected in the medium term as consumption in the total beverage market in several of Royal Unibrew's markets are not expected to increase significantly. In Western Europe the Danish consumption of Royal Unibrews beverage categories is expected to be stagnant in the coming years. In the Baltic Sea segment, Royal Unibrew expects unchanged Finnish consumption for 2019 not taking the weather impact into consideration, while the consumption in the Baltic countries will still be negatively affected by legislative changes and the demographic development. Through continued focus on exploiting commercial opportunities and innovation following the consumer trends, Royal Unibrew expects to be able to maintain or increase the revenue and earnings from the core brands and business areas.

Reasonably probable changes will not lead to recognition of impairment losses, why no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether impairment has incurred other than that expressed by normal amortisation and depreciation. If so, the asset is written down to the higher of net selling price and value in use. Goodwill and other assets for which a value in use cannot be determined as the asset does not on an individual basis generate future cash flows are reviewed for impairment together with the group of assets (cash-generating units) to which they are attributable.
The carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, and is written down to recoverable amount in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of financial assets measured at cost or amortised cost is written down for impairment if, due to changed expected net payments, the net present value is lower than the carrying amount.
Intangible assets
In relation to trademarks, Management makes an annual judgement to determine whether the current market situation has reduced the value or affected the useful life of the trademarks, including whether past estimates of indefinite useful lives may be maintained.
An annual impairment test is made of the values recognised in the Financial Statements of goodwill and trademarks assessed to have indefinite lives which are therefore not amortised. For a description of the discount rates and growth rates applied in connection with the impairment test of goodwill and trademarks as well as other assumptions of the impairment test, reference is made to the above note.

Note 13 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Land and buildings, plant and machinery and other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated impairment losses. Borrowing costs relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the sales sum less the expenses necessary to make the sale and the carrying amount at the time of sale. Profits or losses were immaterial in both 2019 and 2018 and have been recognised in the income statement as an adjustment to depreciation in production costs, sales or distribution expenses or administrative expenses, respectively.

Property, plant and equipment The expected useful lives of the assets remain unchanged from 2019 and are as follows:

Buildings and installations, Leasing of property, plant and equipment Plant and machinery Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment Vehicles IT hardware and software Returnable packaging

25-40 years over the term of the lease
10-15 years 5-8 years 4-5 years 3 years
3-10 years

Management updates its estimate of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment annually.

Leases
IFRS 16 was adopted with a date of initial application of 1 January 2018. As a result, the Group in 2018 changed its accounting policy for lease contracts.
Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases ­ i.e. these leases are on-balance sheet.
The Group decided to apply the recognition exemptions to short-term and low value leases.

Investments in associates in the Consolidated Financial Statements
Investments in associates are measured in the balance sheet at the proportionate share of the net asset value of the enterprises calculated under the accounting policies of the Group with deduction or addition of the proportionate share of unrealised intercompany profits and losses and with addition of the carrying amount of goodwill.
Associates with a negative net asset value are measured at DKK 0. If the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the negative balance of the associate, this obligation is recognised in liabilities.
The proportionate share of the results of associates is recognised in the income statement of the Group after adjusting for impairment losses on goodwill and eliminating the proportionate share of unrealised intercompany gains and losses.

 Other investments
Other investments classified as fair value trough profit and loss are recognised in non-current assets at fair value at the trading date and at estimated fair value calculated on the basis of market data and recognised valuation methods as regards to unlisted securities. Unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income except for impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses which are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement. Upon realisation, the accumulated value adjustment recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to financial income and expenses in the income statement. Other investments may be classified as level-3 instruments.
Other receivables
Other receivables under fixed asset investments held to maturity are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost or an estimated lower value at the balance sheet date.
Other investments
In connection with the presentation of the Financial Statements for 2011, Management estimated the fair value of its investments (48% of the share capital) in the Polish brewery company Perla Browary Lubelskie at DKK 0 due to governance issues. Since 2011, Management has maintained its fair value estimate of DKK 0 as these issues have not subsequently been resolved. The consolidated financial statements of Perla Browary Lubelskie S.A. for 2018 (2019 not yet available) have been prepared on the basis of Polish accounting law and show a profit after tax of PLN 53 million (DKK 93 million) and equity of PLN 340 million (DKK 595 million). The fair value measurement of the investments in Perla Browary Lubelskie is classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Note 19 Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities except for temporary differences arising at the time of acquisition that do not affect the profit for the year or the taxable income and temporary differences concerning goodwill. In cases where the computation of the tax base may be made according to alternative tax rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the intended use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively.
Deferred tax assets are recognised at the value at which they are expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates expected under the legislation at the balance sheet date to be effective when the deferred tax crystallises as current tax.
In the balance sheet, set-off is made between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction.

Debts
Mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions are recognised initially at fair values. Subsequently, the financial obligations are measured at amortised cost equal to the capitalised value using the effective interest method; the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement over the loan period.
Other debts, comprising trade payables, payables to subsidiaries and associates, VAT, excise duties, etc as well as other payables, are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to the nominal debt.

Debts
In connection with the acquisition of Hartwall in 2013, defined benefit liabilities were acquired relating to a pension scheme which has not been offered to new employees for a number of years. At 31 December 2019, the net liability amounted to approx DKK 6.3 million (2018: approx DKK 8.6 million). Taking into account the amount of the liability, that it has been at the same level in recent years and that it is being phased out, Management does not consider it material to provide the disclosures on the composition of the liability required by IAS 19.

Royal Unibrew expects the acquisition to increase revenue in Italy significantly, corresponding to a net revenue of DKK 245 million, whereas volumes will more than double. The acquisition is moreover expected to reinforce the existing commercial platform in all sales channels, and as the route-to-market is the same as for Royal Unibrew's existing beer business in Italy, operational synergies are expected to be reaped for the benefit of existing product portfolios as well as that acquired.
The acquisition price of DKK 607 million, which has been paid in cash, is based on an enterprise value of DKK 598 million. The valuation of Terme di Crodo has been based on the multiples applicable to leading, national beverage positions.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019
Note 25 Acquisition of subsidiaries (continued)
Business combinations
On acquisition of new enterprises the purchase method is applied, under which the identifiable assets and liabilities of newly acquired enterprises are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition.
Upon business combinations, positive differences between cost and fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are recognised as goodwill in intangible assets. At the time of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units that subsequently form the basis of impairment tests. Goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign enterprise with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency of the Group are treated as assets and liabilities belonging to the foreign entity and are translated to the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction.
Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries and associates are calculated as the difference between the sales sum and the carrying amount of net assets at the time of sale (including the carrying amount of goodwill) net of expected expenses and adjusted for exchange adjustments previously recognised in equity.
Recognition of acquisition of subsidiary
Royal Unibrew acquired in 2019 three businesses, Bev.Con ApS (Cult), Bruce Ashley Group Inc. and SIA Bauskas Alus by purchasing shares in the companies wherein the businesses were established. The businesses assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been recognised under the purchase method in the Financial Statements of Royal Unibrew. The key assets of the businesses are goodwill, trademarks, customer relations, property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, deferred tax and payables. Especially with regard to the intangible assets acquired, there are no efficient markets to be used to determine fair value. Management has therefore made an estimate in connection with the calculation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition and has allocated the purchase price on that basis. The fair value calculation is subject to uncertainty and will subsequently be adjusted within a 12 month period from the acquisition date if a need to do so is identified. The unallocated part of the purchase price has been recognised as goodwill related to synergies and the development potential of the activities acquired.
