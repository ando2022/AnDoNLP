NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE.1

KEY EVENTS DURING THE FINANCIAL PERIOD

 Following their successful launches on 01 March 2015, 20 August 2015, 24 December 2015, 29 January 2016 and 09 March 2016 respectively, the EUTELSAT 115WB, EUTELSAT 8WB, EUTELSAT 36C, EUTELSAT 9B and EUTELSAT 65WA satellites entered operational service.

 The EUTELSAT 117WB satellite was successfully launched on 15 June 2016 by a Falcon 9 rocket. It is due to enter service during the financial year 2016-2017.

 Alterna'TV was sold by the Group in April 2016.

 In June 2016, the Group raised 500 million euros through the issuance of a new 5-year bond (see Note 16 - Financial debt).

NOTE.2

GENERAL OVERVIEW

2.1 BUSINESS

 The Eutelsat Communications Group (Eutelsat S.A. and its subsidiaries) is a private telecommunications satellite operator involved in the design, establishment, operation and maintenance of satellite telecommunications systems
 As of 30 June 2016, the Group operates via Eutelsat S.A. and its subsidiaries 39 satellites in geostationary orbit (including five satellites belonging to third parties or to related parties on which the Group uses additional capacity) to provide capacity (assignment and availability) to major international telecommunications operators and international broadcasting companies for television and radio broadcasting services (analogue and digital), for business telecommunications services, multimedia applications and messaging and positioning services.

2.2 APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2016 have been prepared under the responsibility of the Board of Directors, which adopted them at its meeting of 28 July 2016. They will be submitted for approval to the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on 04 November 2016.

NOTE.3

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

3.1 COMPLIANCE WITH IFRSs

The financial statements at 30 June 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and effective as of that date.The relevant texts are available for consultation on the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_fr.htm
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain items for which the standards require measurement at fair value.

3.2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Since 01 July 2015, the Group has applied the following standards and interpretations which have been adopted by the European Union.



2010 amendments to IAS 27 "Separate Financial Statements" and IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint-Ventures";

 IFRS annual improvements:

 (2010-2012 cycle): IFRS 2 "Definition of Vesting Conditions", IFRS 13 "Short-term Receivables and Payables", IAS 24 "Key Management Personnel";

 (2011-2013 cycle): IFRS 13 "Scope of paragraph 52 (portfolio exception)".

Applying these standards, amendments and interpretations had no significant impact on the Group's financial statements.

Furthermore, no standard, interpretation or amendment has been applied in advance by the Group. The Group is currently analysing the practical impact of these new texts and the effects of applying them in the financial statements. This concerns:



IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments";



IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers";



IFRS 16 "Leases";



Improvements to IFRSs (2012-2014 cycle).

Eutelsat Communications 9

3.3 ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES APPLIED BY THE GROUP IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The "Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises" or CVAE (Business contribution on the added value) was considered by the Group as an operating expense that does not meet the criteria laid down in IAS 12 "Income taxes" and therefore does not give rise to deferred taxes.
3.4 PRESENTATION OF THE INCOME STATEMENT
Operating costs essentially comprise staff costs and other costs associated with controlling and operating the satellites in addition to satellite in-orbit insurance premiums. Selling, general and administrative expenses are mainly made up of costs for administrative and commercial staff, all marketing and advertising expenses and related overheads.
3.5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
In preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, Management is required to make estimates and judgements that are likely to affect the amounts of certain assets, liabilities, income and expenses appearing in these financial statements and their accompanying Notes. Eutelsat Communications constantly updates its estimates and assessments using past experience in addition to other relevant factors in relation to the economic environment. The close down of the transactions underpinning these estimates and assumptions could result in significant adjustments to the amounts that are recognised in a subsequent financial period because of the uncertainty that surrounds them.
Judgements
In preparing the financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016, Management has exercised judgement, particularly with regard to the recoverable amounts of assets, contingent liabilities, provisions, customer risk assessment and the functional currency used by the consolidated entities.
3.6 PERIODS PRESENTED AND COMPARATIVES
The financial year of Eutelsat Communications runs for 12 months and ends on 30 June. The reference currency and the presentation currency used to issue financial statements is the euro.
3.7 CHANGE IN GROUP STRUCTURE
Alterna TV
On 7 April 2016, the Group announced the sale of Alterna'TV, a Eutelsat Americas subsidiary based in Miami-and specialised in content distribution. The terms of the transaction are confidential.

NOTE.4

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

4.1 CONSOLIDATION METHOD

As required under IFRS 10, companies in which the Group holds directly or indirectly more than 50% of voting rights at general meetings of shareholders, at meetings of boards of directors or in any equivalent governing bodies, giving it the power to direct their operational and financial policies, are generally deemed to be controlled and consolidated under the full consolidation method. To determine control, Eutelsat Communications carries out an in-depth analysis of the established governance arrangements and of the rights held by other shareholders. Where necessary, an analysis is performed in relation to instruments held by the Group or by third parties that, if exercised, could alter the type of influence exerted by each party.

An analysis is performed if a specific event takes place that may affect the level of control exerted by the Group, (e.g. change in an entity's ownership structure or governance, exercise of a dilutive financial instrument, etc.).

A subsidiary's income and expenses are included in the Group s consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. The portion of equity ownership that is directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recorded as noncontrolling interests.

Changes in the proportion of equity held in subsidiaries that do not result in change of control are accounted for as equity transactions, or transactions entered into with shareholders in their capacity as such. Gains or losses arising from these transactions are recognised, net of tax, within equity. Consequently, they have no impact on the Group's consolidated income statement.

In accordance with IFRS 11, the Group's joint arrangements fall into two categories:

- joint ventures: these are joint arrangements whereby the parties (called "joint venturers") that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Each joint venturer is required to recognise its right to the net asset of the arrangement using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28;

- joint operations: these are joint arrangements in which the parties (called "joint operators") that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations to the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Each joint operator records 100% of the assets/liabilities, expenses/revenues relating to its interest in the joint operation, as well as the portion of assets held jointly.

Eutelsat Communications 10

Associates are defined as entities over which the Group exerts significant influence. They are consolidated using the equity method, in accordance with IAS 28. Significant influence is presumed where more than 20% of the shares are held by the Group.
The equity method is a method of accounting by which an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recorded at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted to reflect the Group's share of income and other items of comprehensive income of the associate or the joint venturer. Net income from equity investments is included in the Group's consolidated income statement.
4.2 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Business combinations are recognised using the purchase accounting method, in accordance with the revised IFRS 3. Under this method, the various components of an acquisition are recognised at their fair values with some exceptions, Accordingly,  The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. This includes contingent consideration that is also measured at fair value at the acquisition
date, which takes into account probabilities of occurrence. Once classified as liabilities or as equity on the basis of their definition, obligations are entered as debts and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with their changes recorded under income.  - Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed in the year during which they are incurred.  - In the event of partial disposal, minority interests (known henceforth as "non-controlling interests") are measured on the option determined for each combination, either at fair value, or as their proportionate share of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  - In a business combination achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously held ownership interest is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value. The difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the ownership interest is recognised directly in income for the reporting period.  The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, with the exception of non-current assets classified as assets held for sale, which are measured at fair value less costs to sell, tax items and employee benefits which are recognised under IAS 12 and IAS 19 respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred and the value of non-controlling interests, if any, over the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets and liabilities Depending on the option retained for the valuation of equity interest in an acquisition, the recognised goodwill represents either the only portion acquired by the Group (partial goodwill) or the aggregate of the Group's portion and the non-controlling interests' portion (full goodwill). Provisional fair values assigned at the date of acquisition to identifiable assets and liabilities may require adjustment as additional evidence becomes available to assist with the estimation (expert assessments still in progress at the acquisition date or additional analyses). When such adjustments are made prior to the end of a twelve-month period commencing on the date of acquisition, goodwill or negative goodwill is adjusted to the amount that would have been determined if the adjusted fair values had been available at the date of acquisition. When the carrying amounts are adjusted after the end of the twelve-month period, income or expense is recognised rather than an adjustment to goodwill or negative goodwill, except where these adjustments correspond to corrections of errors.
4.3 ACQUISITION/DISPOSAL OF NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions and recognised directly within equity.
4.4 OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES
 Transactions in foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities (including payables and receivables) in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at end of period using the balance sheet rate. Resulting foreign-exchange gains and losses are recorded in the income statement for the period. Conversely, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of capitalisable advances made to foreign subsidiaries and forming part of the net investment in the consolidated subsidiary are recognised directly as "Translation adjustment" within shareholders' equity. The main foreign currency used is the U.S. dollar. The closing exchange rate used is 1.109 U.S. dollar for 1 euro and the average exchange rate for the period is 1.108 U.S. dollar for 1 euro.
 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' financial statements
Each subsidiary outside the euro zone maintains its accounting records in the currency that is most representative of its economic environment. Their financial statements are translated into euros using the closing-rate method. All assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are translated into euros using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated using an-average exchange rate for the period, unless the use of such rate becomes inappropriate due to major erratic changes over the period. The resulting translation difference is recorded as a separate item of shareholders' equity under "Translation adjustments".
4.5 INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
 Intangible assets purchased separately or acquired in the context of a business combination
Intangible assets purchased separately are recorded at their acquisition cost and those purchased in a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date when allocating the acquisition cost of the entity. The fair value is set by referring to the generally accepted methods such as those based on revenues or market value. Intangible assets consist of certain licences, the "Eutelsat" brand and the "Customer Contracts and Relationships" assets. Because their lifetimes are indefinite, the "Eutelsat" brand and the licences are not amortised but are systematically tested for impairment on a yearly basis.
Eutelsat Communications 11

The "Customer Contracts and Relationships" assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their economic life. This useful life was estimated on the basis of the average length of the contractual relationships existing at the date of acquisition of Eutelsat and taking into account anticipated contract renewal rates (see Note 4.8 "Impairment of non-current assets").
 Research and development costs
Development costs are recorded as intangible assets if the capitalisation criteria defined under IAS 38 "Intangible Assets" are met. Otherwise, they are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Research costs are recorded as an item of expenditure. The Group spent 13.3 million euros on research and development during the financial period ended 30 June 2016, including development costs amounting to 7.4 million euros recorded as intangible assets. Research expenses were mainly incurred for multimedia activities. They are recorded in the income statement under "Selling, general and administrative expenses".
4.6 GOODWILL
Goodwill is valued in the functional currency of the acquired entity at the date of the business combination as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests, and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary is separately identified in the consolidated balance sheet, under "Goodwill." Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associated company is included within the book value of the investment within the line item "Investments in associates." After initial recognition at cost, goodwill is measured at cost, less any cumulative impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances arise when there are significant adverse developments that call into question the recoverable amount of goodwill.
4.7 SATELLITE AND OTHER PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Satellites and other property and equipment acquired separately ("Tangible fixed assets") are recognised at their acquisition cost, which includes all costs directly attributable to making the asset ready for use, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Borrowing costs incurred for the financing of tangible assets are capitalised with respect to the portion incurred during the period of construction. In the absence of a loan specifically related to the asset under construction, the capitalised interest is calculated on the basis of a capitalisation rate, which is equal to the weighted average of the borrowing costs of the Company during the period after taking into account the financing structure of the Group.
Satellites ­ Satellite costs include all expenses incurred for commissioning individual satellites and comprise manufacturing, launch and attributable
launch insurance costs, capitalised interest, performance incentives and costs directly attributable to monitoring the satellite programme (studies, staff and consultancy costs). Satellite performance incentives ­ The Group has a number of contracts with its satellite manufacturers that require the Group to make certain performance incentive payments upon the initial entry into operational service of the satellites and with respect to future periods of successful satellite operation in orbit. These expenses are directly attributable to the satellite as the Group assesses the likelihood of their payment. Satellite performance incentives are settled at the same time as the price of the satellite, i.e. prior to its entry into operational service. However, for payments made after the satellite's entry into service, future outflows of resources are recognised as an asset offsetting a liability equal to the net present value of the expected payments. Accordingly, the future expenditure is included in the cost of the satellite. Any subsequent change in the amount of such an incentive payment with respect to one or more periods is recognised as an adjustment to the cost of a satellite. The new value of the satellite is amortised on a prospective basis over the remaining useful life. Ground equipment ­ This item comprises the monitoring and control equipment at various European locations and equipment at Group headquarters, including technical installations, office furniture and computer equipment. Depreciation and amortisation ­ Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, which are determined on the basis of the expected use of the assets. Depreciation includes, where appropriate, the residual value of each asset or group of assets, starting from the date when the asset enters into operational use. The useful lives of the main categories of fixed assets are as follows:

Satellites Traffic monitoring equipment Computer equipment Leasehold arrangements and improvements

10 ­ 22 years 5 ­ 10 years 2 ­ 5 years 3 ­ 10 years

The Group conducts an annual review of the remaining useful lives of its in-orbit satellites on the basis of both their forecast utilisation and the technical assessment of their useful lives. When a significant change occurs, a depreciation test is performed and depreciation is charged for the remaining years by taking into account the asset's new remaining useful life.
Construction in progress ­ The "Construction in progress" primarily consist of percentage completion payments for the construction of future satellites
Eutelsat Communications 12

and advances paid in respect of launch vehicles and related launch-insurance costs. Studies, staff and consultancy costs, interest and other costs incurred directly in connection with satellite acquisition are also capitalised. Assets under finance leases ­ Agreements whereby the Group uses capacity on all or part of a satellite's transponders are recognised as an asset with its corresponding liability in accordance with IAS 17 "Leases" when the terms and conditions of the contracts are such that they are considered as finance leases in that they transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group. Assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the corresponding lease terms.
4.8 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as the brand, are systematically tested annually for impairment in December, or more frequently when an event or circumstance occurs indicating a potential loss in value. For tangible fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as the "Customer Contracts & Relationships" asset, an impairment test is performed when there is an external or internal indication that their recoverable values may be lower than their carrying amounts (for example, the loss of a major customer or a technical incident affecting a satellite). An impairment test consists of appraising the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of its fair value net of disposal costs and its value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of a particular asset, the Group determines the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) with which it is associated. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. In order to define its CGUs, the Group takes into account the conditions of use of its fleet, and in particular the capacity of certain satellites to be used as back-up for other satellites.
It is not always necessary to estimate both the fair value of an asset net of disposal costs and its value in use. If either of these amounts is higher than the book value of the asset, its value has not been impaired and there is no need to estimate the other amount. The Group estimates value in use on the basis of the estimated future cash flows (discounted using the Group's WACC if no market price is available), to be generated by an asset or a CGU during its useful life, based upon the medium-term plan approved by Management and reviewed by the Board of Directors. Using a WACC per segment would have no impact on the results of this test. Revenues in the medium-term plan are based upon the order backlog for each satellite, market studies, and the deployment plan for existing and future satellites. Costs given in the plan that are used for the impairment test consist mainly of in-orbit insurance costs and also satellite operation and control costs directly attributable to the satellites tested. Beyond a maximum five-year period, cash flows are estimated on the basis of stable rates of growth or decline. The fair value net of selling costs is equal to the amount that could be received from the sale of the asset (or of one CGU) in the course of an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs relating to the transaction. Impairment losses and their reversals are recognised in the income statement under the item "Other operating costs and income". An impairment of goodwill cannot be reversed. As of 30 June 2016, each satellite and "Customer Contracts and Relationships", grouped by orbital position (after taking into account the technical and economic interdependencies of their cash flows), were identified as CGUs. The Group's investment in Hispasat was also considered as an independent CGU.
4.9 INVENTORIES
Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value. The calculation is at cost. The cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs.
4.10 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets in respect of which changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement, including trading financial assets and derivatives, are initially recorded at fair value. Other financial assets and liabilities are recorded at cost, which is their fair value plus costs directly attributable to the transaction. In accordance with IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", IAS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation", and IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures", the Group has adopted the following classification for financial assets and liabilities, which is based on the objectives determined by Management at acquisition date. The designation and classification of these instruments are determined at initial recognition.
4.10.1. Financial Assets
Financial assets are classified, reported and measured as follows:
 Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement
Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement include financial instruments designated as being measured at fair value through the income statement at initial recognition. This category includes derivatives unless they are designated as hedges, and UCITS (managed on the basis of their fair values) measured by applying the fair value option through the income statement. These financial assets are recognised at fair value.Realised or unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these assets are recorded as financial income or expense.
 Assets held for sale
Held-for-sale financial assets are financial assets, other than derivatives, which have been designated as available for sale by Management or which have not been classified in the "Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement", "Assets held to maturity" or "Loans and receivables"
Eutelsat Communications 13

categories. Held-for-sale financial assets include investments other than investments in companies recognised and consolidated as equity investments, which Management intends to hold for an indefinite period of time. These investments are classified as financial assets under "Non-current financial assets."
They are subsequently revalued at fair value, with gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value being recognised under shareholders' equity. When they are sold or when an impairment is recognised, the cumulative gains and losses previously entered under shareholders' equity are recorded in the financial result.
Available-for-sale investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at their acquisition cost.
 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are mainly composed of employee loans, guarantee deposits and accounts receivable, which generally have a maturity of less than 12 months.
Accounts receivable are recorded initially at their nominal value, on account of the insignificant impact of discounting. Accounts receivable are subsequently recognised at cost less provisions for bad debts, as appropriate, booked as a result of the irrecoverable nature of the amounts in question.
Other loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
4.10.2. Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise bank loan and other debt instruments. They are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any differences between initial capital amounts (net of transaction costs) and repayable amounts are recorded as financial expense over the duration of the loans, using the effective interest rate method.
4.10.3. Derivatives
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are recognised at fair value, and any subsequent changes in fair value are posted to the financial result.
Where a derivative instrument can be qualified as a hedging instrument, it is valued and recorded in accordance with the hedge accounting rules in IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" (see Note 4.10.5 - Hedging transactions).
4.10.4. Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group applies impairment tests to all financial assets in order to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. Impairment is recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.. Examples of target impairment indicators include defaulting on contractual payment terms, significant financial hardship of the lender or borrower, a likelihood of bankruptcy or an extended or significant decline in the price of the listed shares.
Impairment losses, other than those related to accounts receivable and other debit operator balances, are recorded as financial expenses.
The Group's customers mainly comprise international telecommunications operators, broadcasters and other users of commercial satellite communications. Management regularly monitors its exposure to credit risk and recognises allowances for bad customer debt and doubtful payments of other receivables, based on expected cash-flows, under the heading "selling, general and administrative expenses". The method of recognising allowances for bad debt is based on experience and is periodically applied to determine a recoverable percentage based on how long the receivables have been on our books.
Impairment of investments in equity securities that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and are valued at cost, and of investments in equity instruments classified as held-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value, cannot be reversed.
4.10.5. Hedging transactions
Hedging transactions are carried out using derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are used to offset the exposure of the hedged item to changes in fair value.
Derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments and recorded according to hedge accounting rules when the following conditions are met by the Group:(a) at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and of Management's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge; (b) Management expects the hedge to be highly effective in offsetting risk; (c) for hedges of forecast transactions, the forecast transaction must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported income; (d) the effectiveness of the hedge should be capable of reliable measurement; and (e) the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to be highly effective throughout the period for which the hedge was designated.
These criteria are applied where the Group uses derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Cash flow hedging involves a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable anticipated future transaction that might affect reported income.
Hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation involves a hedge of the foreign currency risk arising from nets assets held in a foreign operation which might affect Group net position.
For these two types of hedges, changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in shareholders' equity, whereas changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised in the income statement under financial result.
The cumulative changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument previously recognised in shareholders' equity are reclassified in the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Reclassified gains and losses are recorded under profit and loss, at the level of the hedged item.
Where the anticipated transaction leads to the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognised in shareholders' equity are incorporated into the initial measurement of the asset or liability concerned.
Eutelsat Communications 14

4.10.6. Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset could be exchanged, or a liability extinguished, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities traded on active markets (this is the case of certain equity interests and certain marketable securities and certain derivative instruments) is determined on the basis of the listed price or at the market value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of other financial instruments, assets or liabilities that are not listed on an active market is determined by the Group using appropriate valuation methods and assumptions reflecting market conditions at balance sheet date. The fair values of derivative instruments include counterparty risk.
4.10.7 Firm or conditional commitments to purchase non-controlling interests
Under the IFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements", and IAS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation", the Group recognises the fair value of firm or conditional commitments to purchase non-controlling interests as financial debt, offset by a reduction in non-controlling interests. Any change in the fair value of the obligation subsequent to its initial recognition is treated as an adjustment affecting the income statement.
4.11 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of cash on hand and at bank, as well as short term deposits or investment certificates with original maturities of three months or less, and also mutual fund investments that are easily convertible into a known amount of cash, the liquid value of which is determined and published daily and for which the risk of a change in value is insignificant.
4.12 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
o Treasury stock
Treasury stock is recognised by reducing shareholders' equity on the basis of the acquisition cost. When the shares are sold, any gains and losses are recognised directly in consolidated reserves net of tax and are not included under income for the year.
o Costs for capital increases
External costs directly related to increases in capital, reduction of capital and treasury stock buy-backs are allocated to additional paid-in capital, net of taxes when an income tax saving is generated.
o Grant of stock options
Rewards granted to employees under stock-option plans are measured on the date the options are granted and represent additional employee compensation. This is recognised under personnel expenses over the vesting period of the rights representing the reward granted to the employee and is offset by increases in equity (equity settled plans) or by recognition of a debt (for plans deemed to be cash-settled plans). Similarly, in accordance with IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment", awards granted to employees in the form of public issues or other capital transactions are measured at grant date. They constitute additional compensation, which is recorded during the financial year as an expense recognised over the vesting period.
4.13 REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Group's revenues are mainly attributable to the allotment of space segment capacity on the basis of terms and conditions set out in the lease contracts. These contracts usually cover periods ranging from one year to the end of life of the satellite. Contracts usually provide for the right to free-of-charge time in cases of service interruptions caused by under-performing transponders. Pursuant to certain contractual termination rights, the agreement can usually be terminated after two years with a one-year notice period and, depending on the type of lease, payment of the difference between the contractual price and the price that would have been paid for a lease with a duration similar to the expired period, plus interest for late payment, or by paying a percentage of the annual price applied to the remaining duration of the lease. The revenues initially recognised are then adjusted to reflect the overall economic outcome of the contract. Revenues are recognised over the contractual period during which services are performed, provided that a contract exists and the price is fixed or determinable, and provided that, as of the date it is reported in the accounts, it is probable that the debt will be recovered. Deferred revenues include unearned balances of amounts received in advance from customers. Such amounts are recorded as revenue on a straight-line basis over the corresponding duration of the relevant transponder contracts or of the services provided.
4.14 OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES
The other operating income and expenses include:  Significant and infrequent factors such as impairment of intangible assets, launch failures and their related insurance reimbursements, as well as
national and international non-commercial litigations, less the legal costs incurred.  The impacts of changes in scope (including business combination costs and sales of tangible assets).
Eutelsat Communications 15

4.15 DEFERRED INCOME TAX
Deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences arising between the tax base of an asset or liability and its book value. Deferred taxes are recognised for each fiscal entity in respect of all temporary differences, with some exceptions, using the balance sheet liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:  where the deferred tax liability arises from goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes or from the initial recognition of an asset
or liability other than in a business combination which, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or the taxable profit, or the tax loss; and  when the deferred tax liability arises from investments in subsidiaries, associated companies or joint ventures unless the Group is able to control the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be charged. However, a deferred tax asset is not recognised if it arises from a deductible temporary difference generated by the initial recognition of an asset or liability other than in a business combination which, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or the taxable profit, or the tax loss. The book value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance sheet date. Deferred taxes are not discounted and are recorded as non-current assets and liabilities.
4.16 EARNINGS PER SHARE
EPS (earnings per share) are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders of the entity by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
4.17 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Group's retirement schemes and other post-employment benefits consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans are plans for which the Group, or any of its entities, has contractually agreed to provide a specific amount or level of benefits following retirement. The cost of this defined benefit obligation, including lump sum retirement indemnities and other post-employment benefits is entered as a liability on the basis of an actuarial valuation of the obligations to employees at year-end, using the projected unit credit method. This method accrues the employee's pension benefit by periods of service according to the formula for entitlement to benefits under the plan. The value of expected future payments is determined on the basis of demographic and financial assumptions such as mortality, staff turnover, salary growth, and age at retirement. The rate used to discount estimated cash flows is determined by reference to an underlying pool of AA-rated corporate bonds with maturities in line with those of the schemes being valued. A complete assessment of the discounted present value of the benefit is outsourced each year and reviewed at interim periods to identify any significant changes. The pension cost for the period, consisting of service cost, is posted to operating income, whereas actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity. Management of the defined contribution plans is performed by an independent entity to which the Group has the obligation to make regular contributions. All payments made by the Group with respect to these plans are recognised in operating costs for the period.
4.18 FINANCIAL GUARANTEE GRANTED TO A PENSION FUND
Following the acquisition of Eutelsat S.A. in April 2005, the Group granted a financial guarantee to the pension fund for the obligations that had been assigned to a trust prior to the contribution transactions that led to the creation of Eutelsat. This defined-benefit pension scheme was closed and the vested pension rights were frozen prior to the transfer. The risk resulting from this financial guarantee has been analysed, assessed and reported in the same way as defined benefit plan obligations described in Note 4.17 "Post-employment benefits", despite the fact that the Group has not assumed the legal commitments entered into by the Intergovernmental Organisation ("IGO") in respect of the pension fund.
4.19 PROVISIONS
A provision is made when, at the balance sheet date, (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount involved can be made. The amount recognised as a provision represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision will be equal to the discounted value of anticipated expenditure needed to settle the obligation. The discounted value is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Increases in provisions recorded to reflect the passage of time and the effect of discounting are recognised as financial expenses in the income statement.

The decline in Eutelsat Communications S.A.'s share price observed during the second half of the financial year 2015-2016 lead Management to review the annual impairment test of goodwill carried out at 31 December 2015 and monitored only at Eutelsat's operating segment level.
As of 30 June 2016, the recoverable value as measured by analysing the implicit market value (fair value) of Eutelsat S.A. based on the stock price of Eutelsat Communications S.A. (and taking into account this company s debt) did not lead to reconsider the amount shown on the balance sheet.
The share price would have to drop by at least 31% for the fair value to fall below the carrying amount. Should such an event occur, a test would be carried out based on the value in use.

The useful life of this intangible asset is considered indefinite, given the high probability of renewal of the administrative authorisations for the use of frequencies (which are given for a period of 75 years) and the specific nature of existing customer contracts. An impairment test is performed by the Company each year.
(2) The useful lives of the other identified intangible assets have been estimated at 15 years.

NOTE.8

NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS

Non-current financial assets are primarily made up of long-term loans, investments and advances.

These mainly consist of loans to social welfare bodies and guarantee deposits paid for renting Eutelsat S.A. premises in Paris.

NOTE.9

INVENTORIES

Gross and net inventories amount to 1.8 million euros and 0.9 million euros as of 30 June 2015, and 3.6 million euros and 2.8 million euros as of 30 June 2016. They mainly comprise receive antennas and modems.

NOTE.10

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Credit risk is the risk that a debtor of the Group will not pay when the debt matures. This is a risk that mainly affects the "accounts receivable" category and is followed up for each entity under the supervision of the financial personnel responsible. In the most important cases, the relevant financial personnel are assisted by a credit manager, acting in accordance with the instructions of the Group's debt recovery service. This followup activity is based mainly on an analysis of the amounts due and can be accompanied by a more detailed study of the creditworthiness of a number of debtors. Depending on the assessment conducted by the financial staff, the entities concerned may, after validation by the Group, be asked to hedge the credit risk by taking out credit insurance or obtaining guarantees compatible with the evaluation of the risk.

Customers are mainly international telecommunications operators, broadcasters and other users of commercial satellite communications.

As of 30 June 2015, the net value of these receivables was 309.3 million euros. The corresponding impairment charge stood at 60.1 million euros.

As of 30 June 2016, the net value of these receivables was 406.4 million euros. The corresponding impairment charge stood at 71.3 million euros.

Accounts receivable as of 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 are for short-term amounts and bear no interest.

The Group considers that it is not subject to concentration risk, owing to the diversity of its customer portfolio at 30 June 2016 and the fact that no legal entity billed by the Group accounts individually for more than 10% of its revenues. Credit risk is managed primarily through bank guarantees with leading financial institutions, by deposits and credit insurance.

During the financial year 2015-2016, the Group further experienced the effects of the current economic crisis in some of the areas in which it operates. Consequently, particular vigilance is called for with regard to clients in geographical areas with the potentially highest exposure to the financial crisis.

The amount of bad debt represents 4.7 million euros and 16.4 million euros as of 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 respectively.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

15.1 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

As of 30 June 2016, the share capital of Eutelsat Communications S.A. comprised 232,774,635 ordinary shares with a par value of 1 euro per share. As of the same date, the Group held 211,560 treasury shares amounting to 3.6 million euros under a liquidity agreement. As of 30 June 2015, the Group was holding 53,000 such shares for an aggregate amount of 1.6 million euros. Furthermore, under the free share allocation plans (see below), the Group holds 108,655 equity shares amounting to 2.3 million euros. The aggregate amount of treasury stock is deducted from shareholders' equity.

15.2 DIVIDENDS
On 05 November 2015, the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders decided to distribute a gross amount of 1.09 euro per share, i.e. a total of 247.2 million euros, partly settled through the issuance of new shares.. The dividend distribution resulted in:  - The issuance of 5,802,297 new shares (increasing the number of shares from 226,972,338 to 232,774,635) with a par value of 1 euro per
share, with the following impact on equity:  - Increase in the share capital from 227.0 million euros to 232.8 million euros;  - Increase in the legal reserve by 0.6 million euros, from 22.7 million euros to 23.3 million euros;  - Increase in the share premium account from 560.7 million euros to 704.8 million euros.  - Cash settlements totalling 96.1 million euros. The amount of the distribution for the financial year ended 30 June 2016, which is being proposed to the General Meeting of 04 November 2016, is 256.2 million euros, i.e. 1.10 euro per share.
15.3 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
There are currently five share-based plans implemented by the Group, in July 2011, November 2012, February 2014, February 2015 and February 2016 respectively. Under the five plans, the expense (excluding employer's contributions) recognised for the financial period ended 30 June 2016 was (1.5) million euros, compared to 6.7 million euros for the financial period ended 30 June 2015 (four plans). Under the two first plans and for a portion of the plan initiated in February 2016, the expense was recognised within equity. However, under the 2014 and 2015 plans and for a portion of the plan initiated in February 2016, the expense was recorded as a liability (as it was settled in cash). The Board of Directors meeting on 13 February 2014 and 11 February 2015 decided to implement a Long-Term Incentive Plan, based on cashsettled awards. These are calculated on the basis of a theoretical number of Eutelsat Communications shares, which are allocated by reference to the levels reached by performance-related objectives, provided the recipient is still working with the Group at the end of the vesting period. These plans concern employees and managers with different performance-related objectives as presented in the table below:

Deferred tax liabilities relate mainly to the taxable temporary difference generated by:  the accounting treatment at fair value of "Customer contracts and relationships" and of the Eutelsat brand, valued at 929.8 million euros
(see Note 5 "Goodwill and other intangibles"), giving rise, on the occasion of the acquisition of Eutelsat S.A., to an initial deferred tax liability of 320.1 million euros. The 44.4 million euro amortisation of customer contracts over 20 years generates a deferred tax income;  the accounting treatment at fair value of "Customer contracts and relationships" and other intangible assets in the context of the acquisition of Satmex.

22.1 FINANCIAL GUARANTEE GRANTED TO A PENSION FUND
As a result of the transfer by the IGO of its operational business as of 2 July 2001, Eutelsat S.A. granted its financial guarantee to the Trust managing the pension plan established by the IGO. Before this date, the pension fund was closed and the accrued rights frozen. This guarantee can be called under certain conditions to compensate for future under-funding of the plan. The actuarial valuation performed on 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 used the following assumptions:

A 50 base point decrease in discount rates would result in an increase in commitments totalling 23.6 million euros. A 50 base point decrease in prospective yield rates would result in a decline in assets and in the expected fund yield by 0.7 million euros.

b) Mandatory schemes
In accordance with French law, the Group meets its obligations to finance pensions for employees in France by paying contributions based on salaries to the relevant entities that manage mandatory pension schemes. There are no other commitments in relation to these contributions. The employer's contributions paid under these schemes were 7.1 million euros and 8.3 million euros at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 respectively.
c) Supplementary schemes
The Group also has a supplementary defined-contribution funded plan for its employees in France (excluding directors and corporate officers who are employees), financed by employees' and employer's contributions of 6% of gross annual salary, limited to eight times the French Social Security threshold. There are no other commitments in relation to these contributions. Employer's contributions paid under the plan stood at 1.9 million euros.

NOTE.23

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Having performed an analysis and with respect to IFRS 8, the Group considers that it only operates in a single industry segment, basing that view on an assessment of services rendered and the nature of the associated risks, rather than on their purpose. This is the provision of satellite-based video, business and broadband networks, and mobile services mainly to international telecommunications operators and broadcasters, corporate network integrators and companies for their own needs.

The information presented below is intended for the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and to the Chief Financial Officer who together make up the Group's main operational decision-making body.

Management data is presented according to IFRS principles applied by the Group for its consolidated financial statements as described in the Notes to the financial statements.

The performance indicators that are monitored by the decision making body include turnover, EBITDA (EBITDA is defined as the operating result before amortisation and depreciation, impairment of assets and other operating income and expense), financial expense, cash flow for investment in tangibles and equity interests and net consolidated Group debt (net debt includes all bank debt and all liabilities from long-term lease agreements, less cash and cash equivalents (net of bank credit balances).

Internal reporting is a presentation of the Group's consolidated income statement according to a different breakdown of items than the one used in the consolidated financial statements in order to highlight performance indicators for which the main aggregates are identical to those included in the Group's consolidated accounts, such as the operating result, net result, the share attributable to non-controlling interests and the share attributable to the Group.

(2) Issuing costs include amortisation of all loan issuing costs and premiums. (3) The amount of capitalised interest mainly depends on the state of progress and number of satellite construction programmes recorded during the financial year concerned. The capitalisation rates used for determining the amount of interest expense eligible for capitalisation were 3.75% as of 30 June 2015 and 3.46 % as of 30 June 2016. (4) Changes in fair value of financial instruments mainly include: - changes in fair value of derivatives not qualified as hedges; - the ineffective portion of qualifying derivatives in a hedging relationship; - the de-qualifications/sales of hedging instruments (see Note 26 - Financial Instruments).

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Group is exposed to market risks, principally in terms of currency and interest-rates. Exposure to such risks are actively managed by Management. and for this purpose the Group employs a certain number of derivatives, the objective of which is to limit, where appropriate, the fluctuation of revenues and cash-flows due to variations in interest rates and foreign-exchange rates. The Group's policy is to use derivatives to hedge such exposure and comply with its financial covenants. The Group does not engage in financial transactions whose associated risk cannot be quantified at maturity, i.e. the Group never sells assets it does not possess, or about which it is uncertain whether it will subsequently possess them.
26.1 FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RISK

Through the sale of its satellite capacity, the Group is a net receiver of currencies, mainly the US dollar. Consequently, the Group is primarily exposed to the US dollar/euro foreign exchange risk.

Eutelsat Communications 43

Due to the geographic diversification of its activities, the Group is exposed to conversion risk, which means that its balance sheet and income statement are impacted by fluctuations in exchange parities upon consolidation of the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone (translation risk). For investments in currencies not included in the euro zone, the Group's translational risk hedging policy consists of creating liabilities denominated in the same currency as the cash flows generated by these assets. Hedging instruments used by the Group include currency derivatives (cross-currency swaps) documented as net foreign investment hedges. Given its exposure to foreign-currency risk, the Group believes that a 15% increase in the US dollar/euro exchange rate would have a nonsignificant impact on Group income and would result in a negative change of 284.9 million euros in the Group translation reserve and a change in the Group translation reserve amounting to 81.8 million euros related to the cross currency swap.
26.2 INTEREST-RATE RISK
Interest rate risk management
During the financial year ended 30 June 2016, the Group executed an anticipatory hedging transaction (forward swap) to hedge the market rate of a bond issuance planned between 14 July 2018 and 14 January 2019 with a view to refinancing the 800 million euro bond maturing on 19 January 2019. The transaction was designated as a future cash flow hedge
Sensitivity to interest-rate risk
Considering the full range of financial instruments available to the Group as of 30 June 2016, an increase of ten base points (+ 0.10%) over the EURIBOR interest rate would have an insignificant effect on the interest expense and the revaluation of financial instruments in the income statement. This would be reflected in a 8.4 million euro positive variation in equity related to the change in the effective fair value of hedging instruments qualified as hedges of future cash flows.
26.3 FINANCIAL INFORMATION AS OF 30 JUNE 2015 AND 2016
The following tables analyse the contractual or notional amounts and fair value of the Group's derivatives by type of contract as of 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016.

Impact on income statement and equity
The impact on the income statement and equity of changes in fair value of derivatives qualified as hedges is as follows: - The coupons on swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are directly recognised under income. Changes recognised in equity with respect to these instruments correspond to changes in fair value excluding coupons ("clean fair value"). - The coupons on the cross currency swap that qualifies as net investment hedge, as well as its fair value excluding coupons ("clean fair value") are recognised directly in equity.
26.4 FINANCIAL COUNTERPART RISK
Counterpart risk includes issuer risk, execution risk in connection with derivatives or monetary instruments, and credit risk related to liquidity and forward investments. The Group minimises its exposure to issuer, execution and credit risk by acquiring financial products from first-rate financial institutions and banks. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored. The Group does not foresee any loss resulting from a failure by its counterparts to respect their commitments under the agreements it has concluded. As of 30 June 2016, counterparty risk associated with these operations is not considered as significant (see Note 10 on credit risk on accounts receivables).
26.5 LIQUIDITY RISK
The Group manages liquidity risk by using a tool that enables it to monitor and manage its recurring requirements and liquidity needs. This tool takes into account the maturity of financial investments, financial assets and estimated future cash flows from operating activities. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of its funding needs and their flexibility through the use of overdraft facilities, term loans, revolver lines of credit from banks, bond loans and satellite lease agreements. The Group's debt maturity is reflected in the table below.

Furthermore, the amendment to IFRS 7 on the offsetting of assets and liabilities has no impact: there was no offsetting agreement which could have an impact for Eutelsat as of 30 June 2016 (neither on the balance sheet under IAS 32, nor on net exposure).

NOTE.27

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS

As of 30 June 2016, Management considers that, to the best of its knowledge, no commitments exist that may have an impact on the Group's present or future financial standing with the exception of the following items:

27.1 PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
As of 30 June 2015, future payments under satellite construction and launch and financing contracts amounted to 777 million euros. As of 30 June 2016, future payments under satellite construction, launch and financing contracts amounted to 802 million euros. These future payments are spread over 4 years. As of 30 June 2016, the Group has also made commitments with other suppliers for service provisions and for the acquisition of fixed assets relating to the monitoring and control of satellites amounting to 278 million euros..
Eutelsat Communications 46

The following table lists the payments for these services and acquisitions as of 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016:

As of 30 June 2016, the above total includes 1.6 million euros for purchase commitments entered into with related parties. The Group may receive penalty payments related to incidents affecting the performance of its operational satellites.
27.2 FLEET INSURANCE
As of 30 June 2015, the Group's existing "Launch + 1 year" and in-orbit insurance policies have been taken out with insurance syndicates. Counterpart risk is therefore limited and, if any of the insurers should default, that entity's share of the insurance cover could be taken on by a new player. The in-orbit insurance plan taken out by the Group was renewed for a 12-month period starting on 1 July 2015. The programme has been designed with a view to minimising, at an acceptable cost, the impact of one or several satellite losses on the balance sheet and the income statement. The Group's fleet insurance policy takes into account not only the net book value of its satellites, but also revenues generated by its most revenue-generating satellites. Under its fleet insurance programmes, satellites are covered for partial and/or total (or constructive total) loss under certain conditions. On 1 July 2016, this policy was renewed for a 12-month period.
27.3 COMMITMENTS RECEIVED
The Group holds a put option by Abertis on its investment in Hispasat, with no limited validity, exercisable twice a year with respect to its equity interest in Hispasat.
27.4 DISPUTES
In the course of its business activities, the Group has been involved in legal actions and commercial disputes. Consequently, the Group has exercised its judgement to assess the risks incurred on a case-by-case basis and a provision was recorded to cover an expected outflow of resources (see Note 22 - Provisions) of which it has a reliable estimate In cases viewed as unsubstantiated or insufficiently argued, no provision was recognised. The following legal actions and business disputes are underway: Viasat Brasil: Following a significant violation by ViaSat Brasil of its legal obligations, the Group cancelled the agreement signed with this company for the use of the Ka-band payload on the EUTELSAT 3B satellite. ViaSat Brasil claimed compensation from Eutelsat before the Rio de Janeiro commercial court. Eutelsat has strongly challenged the claim. As of 30 June 2016, the court has not issued any judgement. Tax dispute in France: Eutelsat S.A. is subject to a tax audit procedure for financial years ended 30 June 2012, 2013 and 2014. In December 2015, Eutelsat S.A. received a tax adjustment notification amounting to 3.4 million euros in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2012. No notification was received in respect of the financial years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014. HorizonSat: During the financial year ended 30 June 2015, Eutelsat SA was summoned by HorizonSat before the Commercial Court of Paris for unilateral termination without compensation of a commercial bid. As of 30 June 2016, the court has not issued any judgement. Frequency right: Discussions are underway between Eutelsat and the Italian Ministry of Telecommunications on the use of landing rights.
