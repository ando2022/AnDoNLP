SHARE AND SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The share listed at 123 on 2 January 2018 and closed the year at 100 (down 18.7%). The number of shares traded during the year was 29,226. The parent company does not have a share buyback programme and there are no employee shareholders.
The capital of the parent company is composed of 1,131,480 shares, and did not change during the year. A double voting right is granted to each fully paid-up share which has been registered for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder.
Our principal shareholder, Ets Charles Nusse, held 910,395 shares with double voting rights, representing 80.46% of the capital, at 31 December 2018. Financière de l'Echiquier, a minority shareholder, crossed the 5% ownership threshold in 2005.

2018 earnings were impacted by a significant fall in operating income, as well as: - a 1,800,000 reduction in net financial expense to virtually zero due to transactions
related to currency gains and losses; - a 4,131,000 reduction in tax expense due to (i) a reduced tax base and (ii) the inclusion
of all French companies in the tax group, leading to a 1,582,000 increase in the tax consolidation gain. No impairment charges were recognised against goodwill or other items.
2018 Group cash flow amounted to 38,706,000 and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation) was 40,240,000, compared to 37,253,000 and 46,849,000 respectively in 2017.

The consolidated financial statements include transactions performed by the Group with Etablissements Charles Nusse, which provides advice and assistance to Group companies. Services provided are paid for in the form of a fee equal to 0.6% of their added value for the previous year.

2.2 BUSINESS SECTORS
Paper
In 2018, European production of uncoated printing and writing papers fell 1.8% (source CEPI). Production by our five paper machines increased 1.1% to 232,000 tonnes of paper reel. Once again, the main factor impacting the department's profitability was the increase in purchased pulp prices. The average price per tonne was 110 higher than in 2017 and 170 higher than in 2016. Capital expenditure totalled 12.3 million in 2018, mainly invested in logistics and specialised manufacturing processes.
Processing
The French stationery market was stable during the first half but was disrupted towards the end of the year by the repeated demonstrations on Saturdays, posting an average decline of 1.7% (source I+C). Notwithstanding these events, sales held up across all product categories and the productivity drive over the last few years allowed us to maintain our profit margins. Our export market is also developing due to greater international awareness of our brands. The processing division incurred capital expenditure of 14.1 million in 2018.
2.3 FINANCIAL POSITION
2.3.1 Debt
The Group posted 2018 revenue of 603,099,000. At 31 December 2018, gross borrowings stood at 118,423,000 and shareholders' equity totalled 402,269,000.
In order to provide for its growth, the Group has negotiated several lines of credit with its banks. At the balance sheet date, no commercial paper had been issued out of a global programme of 125 million.
Gross cash and cash equivalents amounted to 115,345,000 and the Group was able to fund capital expenditure from cash flow. Group net borrowings stood at 3,078,000 at 31 December 2018.
2.3.2 Financial instruments
The Group has used derivative financial instruments to limit its exposure to the interest rate risks resulting from its operating, financing and investing activities. At 31 December 2018, the Group held no interest rate hedging instruments as these had expired. Due to the current low fixed rates, it was not considered appropriate to use new derivative financial instruments.
Under its cash management policy, the Group does not hold or issue financial derivatives for transaction purposes.
2.4 RISK MANAGEMENT
9

The Group has conducted an analysis of the risks that may have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position and earnings. The results of this analysis indicate that there are no significant risks other than those listed below.
2.4.1 Risks related to economic activity
The majority of our assets are located in France (93%). Our sales are generated primarily in France (63.5%) and in Europe (31.9%), largely in Western Europe.
The purchase price of our primary raw material, paper pulp, is influenced by the world market. The price of raw materials can vary by more than 200 per tonne over relatively short periods depending on global production capacity, demand from emerging countries and the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate which is the market's benchmark currency. It is to be noted that the Group uses about 150,000 tonnes of pulp across all its production units.
Consumption of papers for office use and stationery items changes regularly according to the needs of businesses and households. It is relatively unaffected by economic conditions.
However, data transmission, note-taking, information exchange and training are increasingly carried out via digital means. This has resulted in an annual reduction of around 3% in the consumption of printing and writing paper in Europe over the last ten years. For example, ream consumption in France fell by 31% between 2007 and 2017 (source ADEME). This downward trend also impacts our various categories of stationery items to different degrees.
The quality of our products, our sales presence, customer brand recognition and our research and diversification efforts are key advantages in helping us to adapt to this changing environment.
2.4.2 Financial risks
Generally, the Exacompta Clairefontaine Group does not engage in any complex financial transactions. However, it is exposed to certain risks related to the use of financial instruments in the context of its activities.
Risk management is performed by the operating units, in accordance with the policy established by senior management.
Credit risk
Credit risks represent the risk of financial loss for the Group if a third party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
 Trade and other receivables The concentration of credit risk is not significant. It is divided among a large number of clients. The risk of default by business sector and by country in which the clients engage in their activities does not have a significant influence on credit risk.
10

The Group has implemented tools to monitor outstandings that enable it to ensure that its clients have an appropriate credit history. Clients that do not satisfy solvency requirements cannot carry out transactions with the Group without making advance payments. In addition, credit risk is limited by taking out credit insurance policies. The Group determines a level of write-downs that represents its estimate of losses that will be incurred in respect of trade and other receivables. Impairment charges correspond to specific losses related to individual risks.
 Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk from investments, short-term deposits and other cash instruments by investing only in liquid securities. As the counterparties are leading banks, the Group does not expect that any of them will default.
Liquidity risk
The Group's approach to managing this risk is to ensure that it always has sufficient liquid assets to meet its liabilities as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging its reputation. To this effect, short-term financing (maturities of less than one year) is provided by commercial paper on which a fixed rate is paid. The Group also has lines of credit to cover medium-term maturities, which can substitute or supplement commercial paper issuance. The related covenants are respected.
The Group has conducted a specific review of its liquidity risk and deems that it will be able to meet future maturities.
Exchange rate and price risk
The Group operates internationally. Risks related to commercial transactions denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities are related mainly to purchases of raw materials denominated in US dollars. In order to manage this foreign exchange risk, the Group may use options contracts to hedge forecast transactions in this currency.
2.4.3 Risks related to proceedings, tax audits and litigation
To the best of the Group's knowledge, there are no pending or threatened government, judicial or arbitration proceedings that may have, or have had over the past 12 months, a significant impact on the Group's financial position or profitability. 2.4.4 Financial risks relating to the impacts of climate change
No law or regulation defines the components of climate change, the physical criteria of measurement, the timeframe or related values. Therefore, the financial risk related to the impact of climate change cannot be objectively measured.
However, the Group does not expect any major financial risk in the short or medium term directly linked to the rise in global average temperatures, the rise in sea levels or changes in
11

biodiversity. In application of Articles R. 516-1 et seq. of the French Environmental Code, the Group has set up financial guarantees for ensuring plant safety in the event of a shutdown. The Non-financial Performance Declaration sets out the Group's environmental policy. In particular, it provides details of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and measures taken to reduce the carbon footprint of the Group's operations.
2.5 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES
2.5.1 Definition of internal control
Internal control is defined as a process implemented simultaneously by the Board of Directors, senior management and the employees of a group, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that objectives are reached in the following areas:
 effectiveness and efficiency of operations;  reliability of financial and accounting information;  compliance with the laws and regulations in force.
Internal control consists of all methods that management has implemented to provide reasonable assurance that objectives are reached and to prevent the occurrence of damaging events.
2.5.2 Purposes and limits
Internal control ensures control of the company's operations and protects it from various types of risks, including:
 irregularities and fraud, including computer fraud;  a material omission or inaccuracy in the processing of information and, therefore, in
the financial statements;  failure to comply with the company's legal and contractual obligations;  destruction, damage or disappearance of assets, or incorrect valuation of assets.
An internal control system, however efficient the system is, can provide only reasonable assurance and not an absolute guarantee as to the achievement of the company's objectives, both because of the limits inherent in any process implemented by human beings and because of the limits on resources which all companies must take into account.
The Group relies on four types of financial and accounting information to guide its operations:
 the annual and interim parent company and consolidated financial statements;  the quarterly statements (March and September ­ not published);  the projected financial statements (not published).
2.5.3 Procedures for processing financial and accounting information
Systematic identification of risks is the first step in internal control. Mapping the Group's risks presents no specific problems and the main issues are as follows:
 control of raw materials purchases;
12

 environmental risks;  protection of industrial assets and sites;  control of the use of financial instruments and hedging foreign currency risk.
The financial and accounting procedures that are applied in the various Group companies may be summarised as follows:
 preparation of projected financial statements;  budget monitoring;  monitoring of intercompany revenue;  intercompany account reconciliations;  monitoring of monthly and year-to-date interim operating statements;  monthly and year-to-date cash position;  composition and performance of the investment portfolio;  monthly monitoring of the subsidiaries' short- and medium-term financial
commitments, with transmission and control of operating working capital requirements.
The internal control of financial instruments is specifically monitored by senior management, with regard to the types of instruments used as well as the maximum risk levels incurred, which are measured daily. These financial instruments (contracts or options) constitute a transaction that helps to reduce the risk of a variation in the value of an asset or liability, an unrealised future transaction to which they relate, or a future commitment.
The Group has no department dedicated to internal control that is responsible for conducting verifications on its behalf (either in the parent company or in the companies it controls). The transactions contributing to the corporate activities of the Group and their presentation in the financial statements are verified, though not necessarily through the application of formalised procedures, by senior management or by its authorised representatives or agents, with the general goal of complying or ensuring compliance with the laws, regulations and standards in force, and of making every effort to prevent the occurrence of losses that could affect the Group's ability to continue operations.
For processing financial and accounting information, the Group and its subsidiaries use the following systems:
- Yourcegid fiscalité (tax management) - Talentia Consolidation and Intercompany (consolidation) - SAP, Navision (accounting & finance) - Zadig (personnel management) - Excalibur (accounting and financial intranet)
3. OUTLOOK
Rising raw material and energy costs have compelled us to revise our paper and stationery prices. Despite the somewhat reticent demand, 2019 operating income could amount to around the average for the previous two years.
13

4. POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
In order to provide the Group with the geographical expansion and diversification required for its development, we are in the process of conducting two major acquisitions relating to:
 100% interest in the entity formed by the Danish company Eurowrap A/S and Eurowrap Ltd, its UK subsidiary. EUROWRAP, specialised in the manufacture and distribution of wrapping paper, gift bags and accessories, generates revenue of 31 million and employs 100 people. As such, we are continuing the development of our creative arts, decoration and packaging operations.
 Swiss company Biella Neher and its activities in Switzerland and Germany under the BIELLA and FALKEN brands in particular. The entity generates revenue of CHF 142 million in filing articles, with a product range broadly complementary to our own. As of 28 March, this transaction was in progress in the form of a public offer recommended by the Biella Neher board of directors.
5. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
In paper production, we work to develop the uniformity, brightness and coatings of paper used for printing or specialised packaging. Multiple tests are carried out on our five machines. We also target the use of recycled fibres.
For stationary, one of our workshops works on the development of specialised equipment. We also have design studios and are pioneers in the creation of multi-use covers under the KOVERBOOK brand. Finally, the Photoweb laboratory has cutting-edge customised digital applications.
6. EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION
The Exacompta Clairefontaine Group had 3,057 employees at 31 December 2018. The companies apply the collective agreement for the production of papers, cardboard and cellulose, or the collective agreement for cardboard packaging.
The Group Works Council met on 21 June 2018 to comment on the Group's business and the economic and employment outlook for the year. It met again on 24 October 2018 and appointed Emmanuel Renaudin as director representing employees.
7. NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION
The information required under Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code is included in a separate document entitled "Non-financial performance declaration", which is an integral part of this management report.
14

It provides information on the manner in which the Group takes into account the social and environmental consequences of its activity as well as its commitments to society in favour of sustainable development, the circular economy, combating discrimination and promoting diversity.

2. Preparation and organisation of the work of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is comprised of ten directors appointed by shareholders and one director representing employees.
Exacompta Clairefontaine pursues a long-term policy through a primarily family shareholding structure. Its Board of Directors brings together members with direct responsibilities from the various divisions of the Group's businesses and specialists in financial and staff matters. They collectively provide the qualifications and experience required to determine the direction of the Group's businesses and monitor their implementation. The other elements of the diversity policy result not only in an adherence to legal provisions regarding the gender balance among directors, but also in the renewal of the Board of Directors. The average age of directors has fallen by over seven years since 2015 as a consequence.
Terms of office expire at the end of the year stated in brackets:
Christine Nusse (2018) François Nusse (2019) Frédéric Nusse (2021) Guillaume Nusse (2021) Jérôme Nusse (2021) Ets Charles Nusse, represented by Monique Prissard (2021) Dominique Daridan (2022) Céline Nusse (2022) Caroline Valentin (2022)
17

Charles Nusse (2023)
Emmanuel Renaudin, Director representing employees (2023)
The Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is also in charge of the Exacompta department and is supported by two non-director Executive Vice Presidents, assisting him in the following areas:
Jean-Claude Gilles Nusse ­ Executive Vice President: AFA and Photoweb departments. Jean-Marie Nusse ­ Executive Vice President: Papeteries de Clairefontaine and Clairefontaine Rhodia departments. Administration and Finance Department.
The Board has placed no limitations on the powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The Board does not currently hold any delegation of authority granted at the Shareholders' Meeting for the purposes of capital increases.
Notices of Board meetings are given in writing at least eight days in advance. Meetings are held at the registered office or at the offices of a subsidiary in Paris. The statutory auditors are called to the meetings of the Board of Directors called to approve the annual and interim financial statements and to all meetings that review the financial statements.
The Board met four times in 2018.
The 22 March Board meeting approved the financial statements for the previous year and prepared the Shareholders' Meeting. The 13 September Board meeting reviewed the half-yearly position, particularly the economic environment at the beginning of the year, the interim operating statements and other specific items. The 31 May and 29 November Board meetings discussed the economic environment, the business and other issues. The March and September Board meetings were followed by an announcement to all shareholders.
One or more additional Board meetings may be held if circumstances require, particularly if there are significant acquisition or investment opportunities.
Board members are not required to be physically present at Board meetings, as video conferencing is authorised by the Board's internal procedure. Board members' attendance rate is very high. No meetings were called at the initiative of the directors.
To allow Board members to make the necessary preparations for meetings, the Chairman provides them with all necessary information or documents prior to the meeting.
During the Board meetings, each head of department presents an analysis of the following points:
 raw materials and energy  earnings for the period
18

 capital expenditure  outlook and risks
The directors review the consolidated financial statements of the Group and those of the different departments. The consolidated statements contain a number of analyses, including:
 changes in shareholders' equity  contribution to consolidated income by company
The drafts of the parent company and consolidated financial statements are submitted to Board members at least eight days before the Board meeting called to approve the final financial statements. Whenever a member of the Board so requests, the Chairman shall immediately or promptly provide any additional information or documents to said party.
3. Shareholder attendance at Shareholders' Meetings
There are no particular procedures for shareholders to attend Shareholders' Meetings. The main provisions of the Articles of Association governing voting rights and attendance are:
Excerpt from the Articles of Association (Article 8.2): "The shares are indivisible vis-à-vis the company. Joint shareholders must be represented at Shareholders' Meetings by one of those shareholders or a single representative of their choosing. If the shareholders are unable to agree on a representative, the latter shall be appointed pursuant to an order of the Presiding Judge of the Commercial Court ruling in summary proceedings upon the request of the first joint shareholder to seek legal intervention. The voting rights attached to shares that have been pledged are exercised by the owner of the shares. If the ownership of a share is divided, said share belongs to the beneficial owner at Ordinary Shareholders' Meetings and to the legal owner at Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings."

4. Corporate governance
Given the nature of the company, its strong family shareholding, company values upheld by its members etc., the Board of Directors does not deem it necessary to refer to a corporate governance code. The operation of the Board of Directors is governed by a set of internal procedural rules and their amendments are decided at the different meetings.
A Code of conduct governing behaviour for the prevention and detection of corruption or influence-peddling was also approved at the Board of Directors' meeting of May 2017.
Audit Committee:
The Audit Committee is represented by the Board of Directors, on which the senior executives from the Group's five departments sit. The Board has not formally established any other permanent committees tasked with monitoring particular areas. Ad hoc committees may be put in place according to the issues that need to be dealt with.
5. Remuneration of the corporate officers
The remuneration policy for the corporate officers of Exacompta Clairefontaine is based on the same principles as those applied to all the Group's employees. Differences in remuneration reflect the level of responsibility, the specific nature of the position and experience. Increases in remuneration are applied on an individual basis.
The Group applies the principle of fixed remuneration for corporate officers and there is no variable remuneration. Neither does the Group offer any stock options, free share allocations, performance-related shares or supplementary pension schemes. Similarly, corporate officers do not benefit from any retirement commitments or other advantages awarded in connection with the assumption or termination of duties. Nor do they receive any other annuities from Exacompta Clairefontaine.
This remuneration policy shall be submitted to a vote of the shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. It is stipulated, pursuant to the regulatory provisions, that the payment of variable and exceptional remuneration is conditional upon the approval of the remuneration elements of the individual concerned by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting under the conditions established in Article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code.

The Board assesses the appropriateness of the director's fees allocated to each director in view of the tasks and responsibilities incumbent upon them and the time they require to perform their duties. For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, director's fees were allocated equally to each director taking into account their participation in Board meetings. The total amount of director's fees to be shared among the directors amounted to 60,000 and was awarded by a decision of the 27 May 2015 Shareholders' Meeting.

26

2. ACCOUNTING RULES AND METHODS

2.1. Fixed assets

2.1.1 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment

Valuation:

Fixed assets are valued at acquisition cost (purchase price excluding ancillary expenses) or production cost.

Depreciation and amortisation:

Depreciation and amortisation are calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset component, on the following bases:

Software Buildings Fixtures and furnishings Office supplies and computer hardware

1 to 3 years 25 to 40 years 10 to 20 years 3 to 10 years

The difference between tax-related and economic depreciation/amortisation is recognised under accelerated depreciation/amortisation.

Write-downs:

At the end of each year, the company assesses the value of its fixed assets to determine whether there are indications of a loss in value. If so, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated. If the recoverable value is less than the book value, a write-down is taken for the amount of the difference.

2.1.2 Non-current financial assets

The gross value consists of the purchase cost, excluding ancillary expenses.

If fair value is less than gross value, a write-down is taken for the amount of the difference.

The fair value of equity interests is assessed on the basis of the fair value of the shareholders' equity, as measured based on discounted future cash flows and net debt. The outlook of each subsidiary or group of subsidiaries is taken into account, in which case consolidated data may be included in the assessment.

2.2. Inventories

Inventories include the purchase of resinous wood made in 1997.

27

2.3. Receivables and payables
Valuation and impairment:
Receivables and payables are valued at their nominal amount. A write-down is taken against receivables when their fair value is less than their book value.
Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies:
These items are valued using the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Differences resulting from this valuation are recorded as currency translation adjustments, in assets or liabilities. Provisions are recorded for unrealised foreign exchange losses recognised under assets.
2.4. Cash
Short-term cash:
Short-term needs are financed by commercial paper issued by Exacompta Clairefontaine. A fixed rate determined at the moment of issue is paid on the commercial paper, which has a fixed maturity and a maximum term of 365 days. There was no commercial paper outstanding at year-end. The maximum amount issuable was 125 million.
Lines of credit:
Lines of credit are in place with several banks for a total amount of 135 million, with maturities not exceeding five years. The term of drawdowns ranges from ten days to twelve months. As at 31 December 2018, none of these lines of credit had been used.
Marketable securities:
Marketable securities are assets held for trading. The book value of 18,378,000 is their market value at 31 December 2018. The book value is equal to the fair value.
2.5. Financial instruments
Transactions performed to hedge exchange rate risks are non-material. The Group used derivative products mainly to hedge against interest rate risks in the form of interest rate swaps. There were no contracts ongoing at 31/12/2018.
2.6. Accelerated depreciation/amortisation
Accelerated depreciation consists of the difference between the depreciation calculated according to tax practices and that calculated according to the straight line method based on the estimated useful life. Accelerated depreciation totalled 1,959,000 at year-end.
28

2.7. Provisions for contingent liabilities and charges 2.7.1 Provisions for retirement indemnities The method used to calculate the provision is the projected unit credit method. The discount rate is determined using the French average bond market rate, based on blue chip corporate bonds. The calculation is based on the following main assumptions:
· probability of retirement from the company, turnover, death · total amount of benefits outstanding under the cardboard packaging ("Cartonnage")
collective agreement · retirement age: between 60 and 67 years of age depending on the employee's year of birth
and status · social security contributions rate: 45% · discount rate: 0.93% A provision for the full amount of the retirement commitment ­ including social security contributions ­ was taken at year-end and totalled 346,000. 2.7.2 Other provisions Other provisions recorded correspond to foreign exchange losses resulting from currency translation differences for 27,000 and a 17,000 tax provision at 31/12/2018. 2.8. Competitiveness and employment tax credit (Crédit d'impôt pour la compétitivité et
l'emploi ­ CICE) The CICE tax credit amounted to 11,000 for fiscal year 2018. It is recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses. This tax credit is designed to finance capital expenditure and investment in research, training, hiring, environmental or energy transition and the reconstitution of working capital. In accordance with the law, the CICE was not used to finance an increase in dividends distributed or corporate officers' remuneration.

REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS ON THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2018

Dear Shareholders of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE,

Opinion
In accordance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the financial statements of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE for the year ended 31 December 2018, which are appended to this report.
We hereby certify that the parent company financial statements are, with regard to French accounting rules and principles, in order and accurate and fairly present the results of operations for the past year and the financial position, assets and liabilities of the company at the end of that year.
The opinion expressed above is consistent with the content of our report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Basis of the opinion
Audit standards We performed our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the evidence we have gathered provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our responsibilities pursuant to these standards are set forth in the section "Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the parent company financial statements" of this report.
Independence We have performed our audit in compliance with the rules of independence applicable to us, for the period running from 1 January 2018 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular we have not provided services prohibited under Article 5, paragraph 1, of regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors.

Justification of our assessments - Key audit matters
Pursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code on the justification of our assessments, we draw your attention to the key audit matters relating to the risk of material misstatements which, in our professional judgement, have been the most significant for the audit of the parent company financial statements, and how we addressed these risks. The assessments carried out are part of our audit of the parent company financial statements, taken as a whole, and formed our opinion, which is expressed above. We do not express an opinion on individual items of these financial statements.

39

Valuation of equity interests
Risk identified
Equity interests, of a net amount of 316 million on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018, represent one of the most significant items of the balance sheet. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost and depreciated based on their carrying amount.
As stated in Note 2.1.2 to the financial statements, the carrying amount is assessed on the basis of the fair value of the shareholders' equity, as measured based on discounted future cash flows and net debt. The outlook of each subsidiary or group of subsidiaries is taken into account, in which case consolidated data may be included in the assessment.
The estimated carrying amount of these equity interests, based in particular on projected discounted future cash flows, requires the use of assumptions and estimates and the exercise of judgement by management.
Competition and the economic environment facing certain subsidiaries may lead to a decline in their business and a deterioration of the operating income.
Therefore and given the uncertainties inherent to certain elements and in particular the probability of achievement of the forecasts, we are of the opinion that the proper valuation of equity interests, intercompany receivables and related provisions for risks constitute a key audit matter.
Audit procedures implemented to address this risk
To assess the reasonableness of the estimated carrying amount of equity interests, based on information provided to us, our work consisted mainly in verifying that the estimate of these values determined by management is based on an adequate justification of the valuation method and the figures used and in:
- obtaining the cash flow and business forecasts of the concerned entities prepared by their operational departments;
- verifying the consistency of assumptions used for prior periods with the economic environment at the accounts closing and preparation dates;
- comparing the forecasts used for prior periods with the corresponding actual figures in order to assess the achievement of previous targets;
- verifying that the value obtained from the cash flow forecasts has been adjusted for the debt amount of the entity under consideration.
Besides the assessment of the value in use of the equity interests, our work also consisted in assessing the recoverability of intercompany receivables in light of the analyses of equity interests.
Specific verifications
We also performed the specific verifications required by the legal and regulatory texts, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. Information provided in the management report and in other documentation addressed to shareholders on the financial position and the annual financial statements

We have no comments to make about the accuracy and consistency with the parent company financial statements of the information provided in the report of the Board of Directors and in the other documentation addressed to the shareholders concerning the financial position and the parent company financial statements.
We confirm the accuracy and consistency with the annual financial statements of the information relating to payment terms referred to in Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code.
Report on corporate governance
We hereby certify that the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance contains the information required by Article L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. As required by law, we hereby inform you that that the information set out in Article L. 225-37-3 is provided in the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents only. We cannot therefore certify whether this report contains the required information, nor the accuracy and fair presentation of information on remuneration and benefits paid to corporate officers.

Information deriving from other legal and regulatory obligations
Appointment of Statutory Auditors We have been appointed as Statutory Auditors of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE by the Shareholders' Meeting of 31 May 1996 for SEREC AUDIT and of 22 May 2008 for BATT AUDIT.
On 31 December 2018, SEREC AUDIT was in the 23rd continuous year of its engagement and BATT AUDIT in the 11th year since the company's shares were admitted for trading on a regulated market.
Responsibilities of senior management and of those charged with corporate governance relating to the parent company financial statements
It is the management's responsibility to prepare the parent company financial statements representing a true and fair view in accordance with the French accounting rules and principles and to establish the internal control that it deems necessary for the preparation of the parent company financial statements free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
During the preparation of the parent company financial statements, it is the responsibility of management to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, to present in these financial statements, if applicable, the necessary information on the going concern basis and to apply the standard accounting policy for a going concern, unless it is planned to wind up the company or discontinue operations.
It is the responsibility of the Audit committee of the Board of Directors to monitor the process for the preparation of financial information and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, and, where applicable, of the internal audit system, as regards the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.
The parent company financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

Responsibilities of Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the parent company financial statements
Audit objective and approach
It is our responsibility to prepare a report on the parent company financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements, taken as a whole, are free of material misstatements. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance without however guaranteeing that an audit performed in accordance with the professional standards applicable would systematically detect any material misstatement. Misstatements may be due to fraud or errors and are considered as material when it is reasonable to expect that they can, taken separately or together, influence the economic decisions that users of the financial statements take based on them.
As set out in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our engagement relating to the certification of the financial statements does not consist in guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.
As part of an audit performed in accordance with auditing standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises their professional judgement throughout the audit. Furthermore:
- the auditor identifies and assesses the risks that the parent company financial statements contain material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers the evidence that the auditor deems sufficient and appropriate to base their opinion. The risk of non-detection of a material misstatement due to a fraud is higher than that of a material misstatement due to an error, since a fraud may involve collusion, forgery, wilful omissions, misrepresentations or the circumvention of internal control;
- the auditor examines the aspects of the internal control system relevant to the audit in order to define appropriate audit procedures under the circumstances, and not with the objective of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- the auditor assesses the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management, as well as the disclosures on these provided in the financial statements;
- the auditor assesses the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern principle and, depending on the evidence gathered, whether or not there is a significant uncertainty relating to these events or circumstances that might compromise the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the evidence gathered up to the date of the auditor's report, it being noted however that subsequent circumstances or events could compromise the going concern basis. If the auditor concludes that there is a significant uncertainty, they draw the reader's attention within their report to the disclosures provided in the parent company financial statements regarding this uncertainty or, if such disclosures are not provided or are not relevant, issues a qualified opinion or refuse to issue an opinion;
- the auditor assesses the overall presentation of the parent company financial statements and assesses whether the parent company financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events in such a way as to give a true and fair view.
Report to the Audit committee of the Board of Directors
We submit to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors a report defining the scope of the audit work and the audit programme implemented, as well as the findings based on our work. We also draw
42

their attention, where applicable, to significant internal control weaknesses that we have identified, as regards procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.
The report submitted to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also contains information on the risks of material misstatements that we deemed to have been the most significant for the audit of the parent company financial statements and which therefore constitute key audit matters, which we are required to describe in this report.
We also submit to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the declaration set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537-2014 confirming our independence, within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as they are defined in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors. If necessary, we discuss with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the risks to our independence and the safeguards applied.

Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1- General principles ­ statement of compliance
The EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE Group consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), as adopted within the European Union. The Exacompta Clairefontaine Group consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 March 2019. They will not be final until they have been approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.
2- Adoption of international standards
Mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations in 2018:
IFRS 9 ­ Financial instruments The Group does not apply hedge accounting. Given the lack of statistical or forward-looking information, credit risk with regard to trade receivables is calculated and updated in accordance with individual late payment scenarios. The Group applies the simplified method to calculate impairment, given that trade receivables do not include a significant financing arrangement and contract terms are short. Credit risk is adjusted on the basis of expected loss estimates and the historical loss rate has been kept down thanks to the debt monitoring systems applied by the Group. Consequently, the application of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.
IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 entails no changes in the Group's previous policy for recognising revenue. Analysis of the potential impact of IFRS 15, including with regard to advertising costs, shows no impact on operating income and requires no reclassification between revenue and expenses. The terms of contracts entered into by the Group are much shorter than one year and the contracts do not include a significant financing arrangement. There are no changes to the method for recognising variable consideration payable to clients, which mainly consists of volume discounts, back margins and early payment reductions. These are deducted from revenue. The same applies to merchandising services and advertising services rendered by clients, which do not constitute a distinct service received.
Amendments to IFRS 2 ­ Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions IFRIC 22 ­ Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union and mandatory after 2018
52

IFRS 16 ­ Leases Amendments to IFRS 9 ­ Pre-payment features with negative compensation IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over income tax treatments The Group did not apply any optional standard, amendment or interpretation.
Implementation of IFRS 16 The Group will apply IFRS 16 - Leases from 1 January 2019 using the simplified retrospective method. Consequently, the 2018 comparative accounts presented in the 2019 financial statements will not be restated. The commitments to be entered as assets are comprised 95% of real estate leases, including those concluded with Ets Charles Nusse. Simulation resulted in an estimated lease liability of around 35 million, at non-discounted value, and a right-of-use asset for a similar amount. The latest valuations are underway and the final impact on the Group financial statements will depend on the discount rate applied to future payments as well as a final review of the contract portfolio.
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted by the European Union
Amendments to IAS 19 ­ Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement Annual improvements ­ 2015-2017 cycle
The Group is currently analysing the impact of these new standards and amendments.
3- Bases of preparation of the financial statements
The financial statements are presented in euros, rounded to the nearest one thousand euros. They are prepared on the basis of historical cost, with the exception of financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the exercise of judgement by management in making estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of the accounting policies and on the amounts of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The underlying estimates and assumptions are made based on past experience and other factors deemed reasonable in view of the circumstances. They also form the basis for the exercise of judgement required for determining the book values of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Real values may differ from the estimated values. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impact of changes in accounting estimates is recorded during the period in which the change occurs and all subsequent periods affected.
The accounting methods described below have been applied on a consistent basis to all the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, said methods have been applied uniformly to all Exacompta Clairefontaine Group entities.
4- Consolidation of subsidiaries
53

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company, Exacompta Clairefontaine, and those of the entities controlled by the parent company (the "subsidiaries"). Control means the power to direct, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control was obtained until the date on which control is no longer held.
The balances shown in the balance sheet, unrealised losses and gains, and the income and expenses resulting from Group transactions are eliminated in the consolidation. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with affiliates are eliminated in proportion to the Group's equity interest. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only if they do not represent a loss in value.
5- Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each of the Group's entities are presented in the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the profit or loss and the financial position of each entity are stated in euros, which is the functional currency of Exacompta Clairefontaine S.A. and the currency in which the consolidated financial statements are presented.
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the balance sheet date are converted to euros at the closing rate. The currency translation differences resulting from this conversion are recorded in the income statement as financial income or expense, as applicable.
The assets and liabilities of each individual entity that engages in its activity abroad are converted to euros at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are converted at the average exchange rates for the period, which is a sufficient approximation of the rates on the transaction dates. The currency translation differences resulting from the conversion are recorded under currency translation adjustments as a separate shareholders' equity account.
6- Business combinations
As of 1 January 2010, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method in accordance with revised IFRS 3 - Business combinations.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is valued as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net balance, as at the acquisition date, of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured at fair value. Where applicable, the non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is measured either at fair value or at the share of the fair value of assets and liabilities of the subsidiary acquired. This option is available at each business combination and cannot be changed subsequently.
54

In the case of a step acquisition, the share of the interest held prior to the acquisition date is measured at its fair value. The related profit or loss is recorded in income.
The initial valuation of the business combination can be adjusted against goodwill if there is new information on circumstances existing at the acquisition date. The adjustment period in respect of the initial valuation is limited to 12 months from the acquisition date. The Group records acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods over which the costs were incurred and the services rendered.
If a business combination takes place under favourable conditions, the purchaser records the corresponding profit under income as at the acquisition date.
A business combination involving a number of entities under common control is a grouping in which all of the entities or operations that are grouped are ultimately controlled by the same party, both before and after the combination, and where this control is not temporary. In the absence of specific provisions in the accounting standards, the Group applies the book value method to all transactions involving the entities under common control.
7- Property, plant and equipment
Group land and buildings are intended for use in the production or supply of goods and services, or for administrative purposes. The Group does not hold any material real estate that should be classified as an investment. The industrial facilities and other equipment are operating assets for the production or supply of goods and services.
All Group property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical purchase cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Property, plant and equipment under construction comprises assets intended for use in production and is recorded at cost, less any impairment identified. When items of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are recorded as separate assets. All ongoing service and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses at the time they are incurred.
Lease agreements that involve the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and benefits inherent in owning an asset are classified as finance lease agreements.
The respective assets are booked as fixed assets at fair value or, if lower, at the discounted value of the minimum lease payments less accumulated depreciation and impairment, as the offset to a financial liability. The minimum payments under these agreements are divided between interest expense and repayment of the debt. The interest expense is charged to each period covered by the finance lease agreement so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on the balance of the remaining debt shown in liabilities. These assets are depreciated over their expected useful life on the same basis as owned assets.
Depreciation is recognised as expenses using the straight line method, without any residual value. The depreciation is calculated based on the estimated useful life of each component of fixed assets on the following bases and by year:
55

- Land - Buildings - Fixtures and furnishings - Plant and equipment - Other office supplies and computer hardware

not depreciated 25 to 40 years 10 to 20 years 10 to 20 years
3 to 10 years

The useful life of the main assets is reviewed when the accounts are closed. Any change in the useful life is recorded on a prospective basis as a change in an accounting estimate.

8- Intangible assets
Research and development costs
Research costs are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred. Development expenses are recorded as a non-current asset if the costs can be reliably measured and if the Group can demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the product or procedure, the existence of probable future economic benefits and its intention, as well as the availability of sufficient resources, to complete the development of and use or sell the asset. When the requirements for recording development expenses in assets are not met, they are recognised as expenses for the year in which they are incurred. Following a review of development costs incurred, the Group did not capitalise any development expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries. It is the difference between the purchase cost and the fair value of identifiable net assets minus contingent liabilities at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially valued at cost and recorded as an asset in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 6 above. It is thereafter valued at cost, less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) consisting mainly of subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries with synergies and no independent cash flows. These CGUs are largely independent of the consolidated Group and are smaller than the operating segments defined by IFRS 8 Operating segments.
Impairment tests are carried out on all cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated; these tests are performed annually, and at each balance sheet date if there is an indication that the unit may have lost value as specified below in accordance with the method set out in IAS 36:
Discount rate equal to the expected market return for an equivalent investment, regardless of the financing sources. This discount rate is a post-tax rate applied to post-tax cash flows. Its use leads to the determination of recoverable values identical to those obtained by using a pre-tax rate applied to pre-tax cash flows. 3-year Business Plans approved by management. Extrapolation of cash flow from operations beyond 3 years based on a growth rate specific to the industry.

56

If the recoverable value of the cash generating unit is less than that unit's book value, the loss in value is first allocated to reducing the book value of any goodwill allocated to that cash generating unit, and then to other assets of the unit, pro rata to the book value of each asset in the unit. Impairment of goodwill recorded in the income statement is not reversed in a subsequent period.

Trademarks

Trademarks are recorded as intangible assets at fair value as at the purchase date. In the absence of a foreseeable limit on their capacity to generate net cash flows, the useful life of the trademarks used by the Group is considered to be indefinite.

They are not amortised but undergo an impairment test once a year and at each balance sheet date if there is an indication of any loss in value. The recoverable value is determined based on expected discounted cash flows.

Expenses for internally generated trademarks are expensed as incurred.

Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets purchased by the Group are recorded at cost less amortisation and accumulated impairment. Amortisation is recognised as an expense under the straight line method over the estimated useful life, on the following bases and by year:

- Patents, licences and software - Other intangible assets

3 to 8 years 5 to 10 years

9- Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill and trademarks)

At the end of each period, the Group reviews the book values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset has suffered impairment. If it has, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated in order to determine the potential impairment.

The recoverable value of an asset is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The value in use is estimated using the discounted future cash flows method. If the recoverable value is estimated to be less than the book value, impairment is recognised immediately in expenses in the income statement.

Impairment recorded for an asset during a prior period may be reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable value. However, any book values that have been increased following a reversal of impairment may not exceed the book value that would have been determined after depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recorded. Impairment reversals are recorded in the income statement.

10- Financial assets

57

Unconsolidated equity interests are classified as assets available for sale and are measured at fair value; changes in fair value are recorded under shareholders' equity. If the fair value cannot be reliably estimated, equity interests continue to be measured at purchase cost. In the event of a write-down, the loss in value is recorded in the income statement.
Intercompany receivables and other non-current financial assets are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
11- Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Any losses in value are recorded in the income statement when the recoverable value is less than the book value.
12- Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories includes direct raw materials costs and direct labour costs, and directly attributable general expenses incurred to put the inventories in place in their existing condition. In general, the cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method.
Greenhouse gas emission rights
The Group's paper subsidiaries engage in an activity that is regulated by Order no. 2004-330 of 15 April 2004, with the adaptation to French law, in the environmental code, of Directive no. 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, establishing a scheme for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances, adopted on 13 October 2003. An allowance is a unit of account that represents the emission of one tonne of carbon dioxide. The current greenhouse gas emission allowance allocation period runs from 2013 to 2020.
The Group applies the accounting principles set forth in Regulation 2012-03 of 4 October 2012 on the accounting treatment of greenhouse gas emission allowances and similar units, as adopted by the French accounting standards authority ("Autorité des normes comptables" or ANC). Pursuant to the regulation, the Group applies the "production" model, in which the holding of allowances is linked to a production process that generates greenhouse gas emissions. The allowances are used in order to comply with the requirement to surrender them to the State.
The main features of the model applied by the Group are as follows:
The allowances are recorded under inventories - Allowances allocated by the State are recorded at zero value. They are treated purely in
terms of volume. - Purchased allowances are recorded at purchase cost. Balance sheet valuation
58

- An impairment charge is recorded when the present value of inventories is lower than the book value.
- No specific valuation is carried out in the case of allocated allowances, as they are recorded at zero value.
Inventory withdrawal - The allowances are withdrawn from inventories on an ongoing basis in line with actual
CO2 emissions. Allocated allowances have no impact on the financial statements. - Any gains or losses arising from the sale of emission allowances are recorded under
operating income. Requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions - The basic requirement to surrender the CO2 emission allowances in accordance with
emissions produced remains unchanged from the previous allocation periods. - At the end of each reporting period, if the Group lacks a sufficient number of allowances
[allocated + purchased] to meet its obligation to surrender allowances to the State, a liability representing the value of missing allowances to be purchased is recorded.
13- Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank balances and short-term investments in money market instruments. These investments can be converted into a known amount of cash within one week at most and are subject to a negligible risk of a change in value. Financial assets held for trading (marketable securities) are assets valued at fair value through profit or loss. Bank overdrafts repayable on demand and current borrowings, which are an integral part of the Group's cash management, are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
14- Derivative financial instruments
The Group previously used derivative financial instruments to limit its exposure to the interest rate risks resulting from its operating, financing and investing activities. At 31 December 2018, the Group held no interest rate hedging instruments as these had expired.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting (cash flow and fair value hedges). Where applicable, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. The profit or loss resulting from subsequent measurements of the fair value is recorded immediately in income.
15- Interest-bearing debt
All financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. The transaction costs are the marginal costs directly attributable to the purchase or issuance of a financial instrument and do not include internal administration costs. All loan expenses are recorded as expenses for the period in which they are incurred.
59

Put options granted to third-party minority shareholders of controlled subsidiaries constitute a financial liability. The liability is measured on the basis of the contracts and may be remeasured based on the results achieved by the entity. The Group records these put options as financial liabilities at the present value of the exercise price of these options after deduction of the related minority interests with an offsetting entry to shareholders' equity, Group share. Subsequent changes in the liability are treated in the same manner.
16- Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Payments to a defined contribution plan are recorded as expenses at the time they are incurred.
Provisions for retirement indemnities
The Group's net liability for defined benefit plans is estimated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of the future benefits acquired by personnel in exchange for services rendered during the present and prior periods.
This amount is discounted to determine its present value, and is reduced by the fair value of the plan assets. The discount rate is determined using the French average bond market rate on the balance sheet date, based on blue chip corporate bonds. The calculations are performed using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recorded under items of other comprehensive income.
17- Provisions
A provision is recorded in the balance sheet when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation resulting from a prior event and it is probable that that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be necessary to satisfy the obligation. A restructuring provision is recorded when a transaction is approved by the Group and has been the subject of a notification. The amount recorded in provisions is the best estimate of the expense that will be required to satisfy the obligation. The amount is discounted when the impact is material.
18- Income
Revenue from contracts with customers
Sales of products and services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of trade discounts and sales taxes.
60

Sales of goods are recorded in the income statement at the time of delivery of the goods and transfer of ownership to the buyer, who takes on their risks and benefits. Income obtained from the provision of services is recorded in the income statement based on the percentage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date, and is valued based on the work performed.
Public subsidies
The public subsidies that offset some expenses incurred by the Group are recorded systematically as income in the income statement, for the period in which the expenses are incurred.
The subsidies that cover all or part of the costs of an asset are deducted from this asset to determine its cost price. The subsidy is recorded as income over the useful life of the asset and can be amortised through a decrease in the depreciation expense.
Competitiveness and employment tax credit (Crédit d'impôt pour la compétitivité et l'emploi ­ CICE)
The Competitiveness and Employment tax credit (CICE) was introduced under Article 66 of the Amending French Finance Act no. 2012-1510 of 29 December 2012. It is calculated based on the total remuneration paid during the calendar year and the income is accounted for in line with personnel expenses. CICE is recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses. 19- Expenses
Payments under operating leases
Payments under operating leases are recognised as expenses on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The benefits received or receivable by the lessee are recorded as income according to the same rule, spread out over the term of the lease.
Net financial items
Net financial items include interest payable on loans and cash liabilities, interest receivable on investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on financial instruments that are recorded in the income statement.
20- Income tax
Income taxes include current tax expense or income and deferred tax expense or income. The tax is recorded in income unless it is related to items posted directly to shareholders' equity, in which case it is recorded in shareholders' equity.
61

The Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises (CVAE ­ French business value added tax) is not classified as an income tax and does not come within the scope of IAS 12. The contributions are recorded under operating expenses.
Current tax is the estimated tax due on taxable income for a period and any adjustment of the amount of current tax for prior periods.
Deferred tax is determined using the balance sheet liability method for all temporary differences between the book value of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases, based on tax rates that were adopted or substantially adopted at the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is posted in respect of the following items:
- Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; - Initial recording of an asset or liability that affects neither accounting income nor taxable
income (except in the case of a business combination).
A deferred tax asset is not recorded unless it is probable that the Group will have future taxable income against which this asset can be charged. Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets and liabilities due, and when they involve taxes on income withheld by the same tax authority and the Group intends to pay them based on their net amount.
21- Management of financial risk
Generally, the Exacompta Clairefontaine Group does not engage in any complex financial transactions. However, it is exposed to certain risks related to the use of financial instruments in the context of its activities. Risk management is performed by the operating units, in accordance with the policy established by senior management.
Market risks
Exposure to market risks involves mainly exchange rate and interest rate risks.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally. Risks related to commercial transactions denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities are related mainly to purchases of raw materials denominated in US dollars. In order to manage this foreign exchange risk, the Group may use options contracts to hedge forecast transactions in this currency.
Interest rate risk
62

The Group contracted a number of interest rate swaps in respect of loans initially issued at floating rates, which exposed the Group to cash flow fluctuation risk. Due to the current low fixed rates, it was not considered appropriate to use new derivative financial instruments as all the interest rate swaps expired during the fiscal year.
Liquidity risk
The Group's approach to managing this risk is to ensure that it always has sufficient liquid assets to meet its liabilities as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses or damaging its reputation. To this effect, short-term financing (maturities of less than one year) is provided by commercial paper on which a fixed rate is paid. The Group also has lines of credit to cover medium-term maturities.
The Group has conducted a specific review of its liquidity risk and deems that it will be able to meet future maturities. Credit risk
Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss for the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform its contractual obligations.
Trade and other receivables
The concentration of credit risk is not significant. It is divided among a large number of clients. The risk of default by business sector and by country in which the clients engage in their activities does not have a significant influence on credit risk. The Group has implemented tools to monitor outstandings that enable it to ensure that its clients have an appropriate credit history. Clients that do not satisfy solvency requirements cannot carry out transactions with the Group without making advance payments. Credit risk is also limited by taking out credit insurance policies and, consequently, the application of IFRS 9 in this area has no impact on the Group's financial statements.
The Group determines a level of write-downs that represents its estimate of losses that will be incurred in respect of trade and other receivables. Impairment charges correspond to specific losses related to individual risks. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of impairment recorded.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk from investments, short-term deposits and other cash instruments by investing only in liquid securities. As the counterparties are leading banks, the Group does not expect that any of them will default.
22- Segment information
Based on the Group's internal organisation, the operating segments for financial reporting purposes are defined by area of activity.
The Group's operating segments corresponding to its main areas of activity are as follows:
63

- Paper: production, finishing and formatting of paper - Processing: manufacture of stationery, office and filing items and digital photos. Transactions between the different operating segments are carried out on arm's length terms. Segment information by geographic area is also presented and is divided by sales-to-customer area in respect of revenues and by the area in which the consolidated companies are located in respect of other information.

Changes affecting the scope of consolidation

Companies newly consolidated - acquisitions

Companies deconsolidated

· AIRSENS Acquisition of 100% interest by PHOTOWEB on 27 September 2018

· AIRSENS Transfer of all assets on 31 December 2018

The effects of the changes in the scope of consolidation are detailed in the information on the balance sheet and income statement below.

67

2. INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT
2.1 Non-current assets 2.1.1 Intangible assets Trademarks "Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights" includes trademarks totalling 7,367,000. No impairment was recorded in the financial statements for fiscal year 2018. Goodwill The goodwill recorded applied mainly to three subsidiaries at 31 December 2018. The segment information shows the breakdown of goodwill by business and geographic segment. The annual impairment test of CGUs was performed in 2018 based on the cash flow value-in-use method, by discounting the future cash flows generated by the continuous use of the CGU. The methods used for determining the value in use in 2018 are similar to those used in 2017. The key assumptions used for determining the recoverable amounts are the discount rate and the growth rate used to determine the terminal value.
The cash flow discount rate used for CGUs was estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital, giving a pre-tax rate of between 7.40% and 8.01% for processing division CGUs and 10.70% for paper division CGUs. The long term perpetual growth rate of the CGUs is mainly between 0% and 1%. No loss in value was recorded in respect of the CGU impairment testing.
Sensitivity of impairment losses to changes in key assumptions: - A one percentage point increase in the discount rate for all Group CGUs would generate an
impairment loss risk of 1.7 million. - A one percentage point reduction in the perpetual growth rate for all Group CGUs would
generate an impairment loss risk of 1.2 million.
68

2.1.2 Property, plant and equipment
The useful life of the principal assets has been reviewed by the Group. No changes in useful life leading to a material change in the accounting estimates were identified during the year.

All short and medium-term financing transactions are based on Euribor. The average commitment fee charged on credit lines is 0.22%. Drawdowns are charged at a variable rate negotiated on the basis of the amount and the maturity date of each line of credit. Long-term financing is arranged through loans mainly negotiated at fixed rates. The fair value of borrowings is equal to the book value.
2.7 Issuance & financial instruments programmes Commercial paper Short-term needs are financed by commercial paper issued by Exacompta Clairefontaine. A fixed rate determined at the moment of issue is paid on the commercial paper, which has a maximum term of 365 days. There was no commercial paper outstanding at year-end. The maximum amount issuable was 125 million. Lines of credit Lines of credit are in place with several banks for a total amount of 135 million, with maturities not exceeding five years. The term of drawdowns ranges from 10 days to twelve months. As at 31 December 2018, none of these lines of credit had been used. As there have been no drawdowns, the 2018 financial statements have not been affected by the related covenants. Financial instruments The Group previously used derivatives mainly to hedge against interest rate risks in the form of interest rate swaps. There were no contracts outstanding at 31/12/2018 and the change in fair value was recorded as net financial income amounting to 228,000. Transactions performed to hedge exchange rate risks are non-material for the fiscal year. The Group may use options contracts to hedge forecast transactions, for purchases of raw materials in US dollars in particular.

REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2018

Dear Shareholders of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE,
Opinion
In accordance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE for the year ended 31 December 2018, which are appended to this report.
We hereby certify that the consolidated financial statements are, with regard to the IFRS adopted within the European Union, in order and accurate and fairly present the results of operations for the year ended as well as the financial position and the assets and liabilities, at the year-end, of the persons and entities included in the consolidation.
The opinion expressed above is consistent with the content of our report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Basis of the opinion
Audit standards We performed our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the evidence we have gathered provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our responsibilities pursuant to these standards are set forth in the section "Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements" of this report.
Independence We have performed our audit in compliance with the rules of independence applicable to us, for the period running from 1 January 2018 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular we have not provided services prohibited under Article 5, paragraph 1, of regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors.

86

Justification of our assessments - Key audit matters
Pursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code on the justification of our assessments, we draw your attention to the key audit matters relating to the risk of material misstatements which, in our professional judgement, have been the most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements, and how we addressed these risks.
The assessments carried out are part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and formed our opinion, which is expressed above. We do not express an opinion on individual items of these consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of goodwill
Risk identified
For the purposes of its development, the Group has made corporate acquisitions and recognised the related goodwill.
This goodwill is the difference between the price paid and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. It is set forth in Note 8 of the paragraph "Presentation of the consolidated financial statements" to the consolidated financial statements. It has been allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) in which the acquired companies have been integrated.
Management ensures in each fiscal year that the carrying amount of goodwill, totalling a net amount of 27 million on the balance sheet, is not higher than its recoverable amount and does not present a risk of impairment loss. However, any adverse change in the expected future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated, due to internal or external factors such as those linked to the economic and financial environment in which the cash generating units operate, could significantly affect the recoverable amount and require the recognition of an impairment. Such a change would call for the reassessment of the relevance of all the assumptions made for determining this amount as well as the reasonableness and coherence of the calculation parameters.
The methods used for the impairment test is set forth in Note 8 of the paragraph "Presentation of the consolidated financial statements". The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was determined using the value in use calculated from the discounted value of expected future cash flows from the group of assets comprising that CGU.
The determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill, which is a particularly material amount, is largely based on management's judgement, in particular as regards the growth rate used for projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied.
We are therefore of the opinion that the measurement of goodwill is a key audit matter.
Audit procedures implemented to address this risk
We have reviewed the compliance of the method applied by the company with the applicable accounting standards. We also conducted a critical review of how this method was applied and in particular verified:
- the completeness of the items comprising the carrying amount of each cash generating unit and the consistency of the determination of this amount with the way in which the projected future cash flows were determined for the value in use;
87

- the reasonableness of the projected future cash flows with regard to the economic and financial situation in which the CGUs operate and the reliability of the estimation process by looking into the reasons for differences between forecasts and actuals;
- the consistency of these cash flow projections with the latest estimates made by management; - the consistency between the growth rate used for projected cash flows and market analyses and
the consensus among key main market players; - the calculation of the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows by checking that the different
discounting parameters comprising the weighted average cost of capital (gearing, risk free rate, market premium, unlevered beta, and cost of debt) would be aligned on the rate of return that market players currently expect for such an activity; - the sensitivity test of the value in use performed by management to a change in the main assumptions used.
Specific verifications
In accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, we also performed the specific verifications required under statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the information on the Group included in the Board of Directors' management report.
We have no comments to make about the accuracy and conformity thereof with the consolidated financial statements.
We hereby confirm that the consolidated statement of non-financial performance provided for by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code is included in the Group information provided in the management report, on the understanding that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 82310 of the said Code, we have not verified the accuracy of the information contained in this statement, nor its consistency with the consolidated financial statements, which should be subject to a report drawn by an independent third party.
Disclosures pursuant to other statutory and regulatory requirements
Appointment of statutory auditors We were appointed as statutory auditors of EXACOMPTA CLAIREFONTAINE by the Shareholders' Meeting of 31 May 1996, in the case of SEREC AUDIT, and of 22 May 2008 in the case of BATT AUDIT.
On 31 December 2018, SEREC AUDIT was in the 23rd consecutive year of its engagement and BATT AUDIT in the 11th year since the company's shares were admitted for trading on a regulated market.
Responsibilities of senior management and of those charged with corporate governance relating to the consolidated financial statements
88

It is management's responsibility to prepare consolidated financial statements representing a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), as adopted within the European Union, and to establish the internal control that it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
During the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, it is the responsibility of management to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, to present in these financial statements, if applicable, the necessary information on the going concern basis and to apply the standard accounting policy for a going concern, unless it is planned to wind up the company or discontinue operations.
It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to monitor the process for the preparation of financial information and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, and, where applicable, of the internal audit system, as regards the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.
The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors.
Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Audit objective and approach It is our responsibility to prepare a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are free of material misstatements. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance without however guaranteeing that an audit performed in accordance with the professional standards applicable would systematically detect any material misstatement. Misstatements may be due to fraud or errors and are considered as material when it is reasonable to expect that they can, taken separately or together, influence the economic decisions that users of the financial statements take based on them.
As set out in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our engagement relating to the certification of the financial statements does not consist in guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.
As part of an audit performed in accordance with auditing standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises their professional judgement throughout the audit. Furthermore:
- the auditor identifies and assesses the risks that the consolidated financial statements contain material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers the evidence that the auditor deems sufficient and appropriate to base the auditor's opinion. The risk of non-detection of a material misstatement due to a fraud is higher than that of a material misstatement due to an error, since a fraud may involve collusion, forgery, wilful omissions, misrepresentations or the circumvention of internal control;
- the auditor examines the aspects of the internal control system relevant to the audit in order to define appropriate audit procedures under the circumstances, and not with the objective of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;
- the auditor assesses the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management, as well as the disclosures on these provided in the consolidated financial statements;
- the auditor assesses the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern principle and, depending on the evidence gathered, whether or not there is a significant uncertainty relating to these events or circumstances that might compromise the company's
89

ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the evidence gathered up to the date of the auditor's report, it being noted however that subsequent circumstances or events could compromise the going concern basis. If the auditor concludes that there is a significant uncertainty, the auditor draws the reader's attention within the audit report to the disclosures provided in the consolidated financial statements regarding this uncertainty or, if such disclosures are not provided or are not relevant, issues a qualified opinion or refuses to issue an opinion;
- the auditor assesses the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether the consolidated financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events in such a way as to give a true and fair view;
- regarding financial information on persons and entities included in the consolidation, the auditor gathers evidence that the auditor deems sufficient and appropriate to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The auditor is responsible for the management, supervision and conduct of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these financial statements.
Report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
We submit a report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, defining the scope of the audit work and the audit programme implemented, as well as the findings based on our work. We also draw their attention, where applicable, to significant internal control weaknesses that we have identified, as regards procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.
The report submitted to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also contains information on the risks of material misstatements that we deemed to have been the most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which therefore constitute key audit matters. These matters are described in this report.
We also submit to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the declaration set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 confirming our independence, within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as they are defined in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors. If necessary, we discuss with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the risks to our independence and the safeguards applied.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING OF 6 JUNE
2019 Amendment to the Articles of Association
To the Shareholders, The PACTE (Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation) draft law seeks to increase the number of directors representing employees on the boards of directors of companies with over 1,000 employees in France or 5,000 employees in France and abroad. From now on, where at least eight directors are appointed by the shareholders, there must be two directors representing employees on the Board, whereas current law provides for the presence of two directors representing employees only if more than twelve directors are appointed by the shareholders. Companies whose boards of directors comprise between eight and twelve directors appointed by the shareholders must amend their Articles of Association to provide for the election or appointment of an additional director representing employees, as is the case for Exacompta Clairefontaine. The resolution submitted to a vote of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is intended to amend the current thresholds provided in the second paragraph of Article 10.2.1. The Board of Directors recommends that you adopt this resolution.

FIRST RESOLUTION The Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting resolves to amend the second paragraph of Article 10.2.1 of the Articles of Association as follows: The previous wording "There must be two directors representing employees in companies where the number of directors mentioned in Article 10.1 is more than twelve, and one otherwise." Is struck out and replaced with the following wording "The number of directors representing employees shall be determined in accordance with statutory provisions."
95

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING OF 6 JUNE 2019
Capital increase reserved for members of a company savings plan
To the Shareholders,
We have convened this Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting to request that you take a decision on the periodic statutory requirement to vote on a capital increase reserved for employees. Article L. 225-129-6 of the French Commercial Code requires that the shareholders be periodically consulted in order to vote on a draft resolution on a capital increase reserved for employees subscribing to a company savings plan on the terms and conditions provided for in section 4, chapter II, title III, book III of the third part of the French Labour Code. This requirement continues to apply provided that the shares held by employees of the company and of the companies related to it within the meaning of Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code represent less than 3% of the share capital. The report submitted by the Board of Directors to the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting shows that this condition is fulfilled. In order to remain in compliance with the aforementioned condition, we hereby submit to you a resolution proposing that you authorise a capital increase up to a limit of 3% of the share capital. Given that the capital increase is reserved for members of a company savings plan, we also propose that the preferential subscription right be cancelled in favour of the aforementioned class of employees. If the Meeting adopts this resolution, the Board of Directors will be authorised to carry out one or more capital increases as it sees fit. Pursuant to statutory provisions, the subscription price of the shares issued via the aforementioned capital increase shall be set by the Board subject to control by the statutory auditors. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote against this resolution and rule out the reserved capital increase.
