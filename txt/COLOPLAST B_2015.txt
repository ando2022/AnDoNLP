Management's report

Core business activity
Coloplast develops and markets products and services that make life easier for people with very private and personal medical conditions. Coloplast works closely with users to develop solutions that consider their special needs. Coloplast calls this intimate healthcare.

Coloplast markets and sell its products and services globally, and in most markets the products are eligible for reimbursement from local healthcare authorities. Coloplast supplies its products to hospitals, institutions as well as wholesalers and pharmacies. In selected markets, Coloplast is also a direct supplier to users (homecare). Coloplast has wholly owned sales subsidiaries in its principal markets and at the end of the financial year employed more than 9,500 people.

Coloplast operates in these business areas:

Ostomy Care
A stoma is created in an operation made necessary because of intestinal dysfunction resulting from disease, an accident or a congenital disorder. A part of the intestine is surgically redirected through an opening in the abdominal wall, enabling the patient to empty the colon (colostomy), the small intestine (ileostomy) or the urinary bladder (urostomy). Some 50-60% of stoma operations are performed because of cancer. Ostomy bags consist either of an adhesive base plate bonded together with a bag (1piece system) or of two separate parts in which the bag is replaced more often than the base plate (2-piece system).
It is important for users to avoid leakage, so they can live as normal a life as possible. As a result, the adhesive must ensure a constant and secure seal, and it must be easy to remove without causing damage or irritation to the skin. Coloplast markets a number of accessory products for people with a stoma, such as the Brava® range.
In addition to these products, Coloplast supports users through the Coloplast Care services, providing them with the support and knowledge they need about living with a stoma.

The market The global market for ostomy care products is estimated at DKK 14bn and is influenced by the extent to which reimbursement is available for the products.
Market growth is driven by the ageing Western population and the increased access to healthcare services in Russia, China and other growth economies. The annual market growth is estimated at 4-5%, and Coloplast is the global market leader, holding a market share of 35-40%. Our largest market share is in Europe, while the smallest one is in the USA. The definition of the market for ostomy products also includes accessory products for people with a stoma. The ostomy accessories market is estimated at about DKK 2bn with annual market growth of 57%. Coloplast currently holds 20-25% of the accessories market.
Continence Care
This business area addresses two types of control issues: people unable to empty their bladder or bowel, and people suffering from urinary or faecal incontinence. People unable to empty their bladder can use an intermittent catheter, which is inserted through the urinary tract to empty the bladder. The main group of users of intermittent catheters are people with spinal cord injury that very often is the result of an accident. Other user groups are people with multiple scle-

4

Management's report

rosis and people with congenital Spina Bifida. Coloplast's portfolio of intermittent catheters spans the full range from uncoated catheters to discreet, compact, coated catheters ready to use in a saline solution.
Urinary incontinence means that a person has lost the ability to hold urine resulting in uncontrolled and involuntary release, also called stress urinary incontinence. Incontinence affects older people more often than younger people, because the sphincter muscle and the pelvic muscles gradually weaken as people grow older. Coloplast has a wide range of urine bags and urisheaths for collecting urine. People unable to control their bowels or sphincter muscle can use the Peristeen® anal irrigation system for controlled emptying of the bowels. A typical Peristeen® user has a spinal cord injury and has lost the ability to control bowel movements.
The market Coloplast is the global market leader in the continence care market, with a market share of about 40%. The market is growing by 5-6% per year and is estimated at DKK 11bn. In the fastest growing segment of the market, catheters, growth is driven by the increasing use of intermittent catheters as an alternative to permanent catheters and by a change in consumption patterns of users and professional care staff towards more advanced catheter solutions.
The urisheath and urine bag segments are growing at a slower rate than catheters. Growth is supported by increased demand resulting from the growing population of older people and an increase in the use of urisheaths and urine bags as an alternative to adult diapers. This is a market with many suppliers, including low-cost providers.
Urology Care
Urology care involves diseases and symptoms of the urinary system, pelvic floor prolapse and the male reproductive system, such as urinary incontinence, kidney stones, enlarged prostate and impotence. The business area consists of a broad portfolio of products used in connection

with urological and gynaecological surgery procedures and includes implants and disposable articles.
Coloplast manufactures and markets its disposable products for use before, during and after surgery, such as prostate catheters and stents, some of them under the Porgès brand. The implant business manufactures vaginal slings used to restore continence and synthetic mesh products used to treat weak pelvic floor. The business also includes penile implants for men experiencing severe impotence that cannot be treated by using drugs.
The market Market growth in Urology is driven by the ageing population and lifestyle diseases, as well as ongoing innovation leading to more cost-efficient surgical procedures. Other drivers of market growth for implants are a growing awareness of the treatment options available for men with severe impotence and women with urological disorders.
The part of the urology care market in which Coloplast products are represented is estimated at DKK 9-10bn. Market growth is estimated at 35% per year including the adverse impact of the updated Public Health Notification issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the use of transvaginal mesh therapies for pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.
Coloplast currently holds an estimated 10-15% of the overall global market for urology products.
Wound & Skin Care
In Wound Care, patients are treated for exudating or chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, which are typically caused by insufficient or impaired circulation in the veins of the leg, pressure ulcers caused by extended bed rest, or diabetic foot ulcers. A good wound dressing should provide optimum conditions for wound healing, be easy for healthcarers to change, and should ensure that patients are not inconvenienced by infection, exudate or odours. A moist wound environment provides the best conditions for

5

Management's report

wound healing for optimum exudate absorption. The Coloplast product portfolio consists of advanced foam dressings sold under the Biatain® brand and hydrocolloid dressings sold under the Comfeel® brand.
Coloplast's skin care products consist of disinfectant liquids and creams used to protect and treat the skin and to clean wounds. For treatment and prevention of skin fold problems such as fungal infections, damaged skin or odour nuisance, Coloplast produces Interdry®, a textile placed in a skin fold to absorb moisture. Coloplast mostly sells skin care products to hospitals and clinics in the US and Canadian markets.
The market Growth in the part of the global wound care segment in which Coloplast competes is expected to be 3-5%, driven mainly by volume growth due to the increasing life expectancy, the growing diabetics population and a growing number of patients receiving preventive treatment. Intensifying competition between manufacturers and pricing pressure originating from lower public healthcare budgets in Europe has had a negative impact on market growth.
The market is estimated at DKK 16-17bn. Coloplast holds a 5-10% market share, making it the world's fifth-largest manufacturer of advanced wound care products. There are a large number of direct competitors as well as various alternative options, such as negative pressure wound therapy and simple wound dressings. The market is defined as advanced wound care products other than the negative pressure wound therapy segment.
The market for skin care products is estimated at DKK 7-8bn, and market growth is forecasted at 5%. Coloplast currently has around 5% of the market for skin care products.

Strategy
Over the past few years, Coloplast has professionalised the sales and marketing organisation and innovation processes, while also making significant efficiency improvements, especially in production and administrative functions.
Coloplast announced an updated strategic direction at its Capital Markets Day held in Copenhagen on 4 June 2014.
The strategy is focused on organic growth and centres on:
 Sustained growth in the core markets of Europe.
 Engaging more in interacting and building relations with end users.
 Increased growth in the developed markets outside Europe (the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia).
 Further expansion and growth in new markets.
 Market leadership in selected new markets and relevant opportunities in the European Wound Care business.
 Globalising the urology care business.
The strategy is supported by a strong pipeline of new products, sustained cost discipline and execution of the most recent plan for Global Operations.

was 33%, which was in line with last year. At constant exchange rates, the EBIT margin was 32%.  EBIT was affected by an increase in provisions of DKK 3,000m to cover potential settlements and costs in connection with the lawsuits alleging injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products.  EBIT after special items was DKK 1,535m. The EBIT margin after special items of 11%. At constant exchange rates, the EBIT margin was 10%.

The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders attending the general meeting to be held on 9 December 2015 approve a year-end dividend of DKK 8 per share. This brings the dividend paid for the year to DKK 12.5 per share, as compared with DKK 11.5 last year. The Board of Directors also recommends that 4,000,000 shares with a nominal value of DKK 1 be cancelled.

Ostomy Care Sales of ostomy care products amounted to DKK 5,567m, equal to an increase in DKK of 9%. Organic growth, at 6%, remained driven mainly by the portfolio of SenSura® products and the Brava® accessory range.
The portfolio of SenSura® products continued to generate highly satisfactory sales growth, driven in part by good sales growth in the Nordic markets, the UK, Germany, Italy and France. The SenSura® Mio product range continues to contribute strongly to sales growth.
The buying patterns of a major distributor impacted sales to the US market during the year.
The performance of the Charter homecare business in the UK remains unsatisfactory, and in the Dutch market, the lower reimbursement rates had a negative impact on growth. In addition, the German homecare company SIEWA remains challenged in a more competitive market.
Assura® products generated satisfactory sales growth, mainly driven by China, Mexico and Argentina, whereas Algeria was a negative contributor due to a distributor's inventory build-up last year.

The Brava® accessory range generated highly satisfactory growth in the USA and France.
SenSura® Mio is now available in 18 countries. SenSura® Mio Convex is available in 7 countries.
Continence Care Continence Care revenue was DKK 5,019m, a 13% improvement in DKK and 8% organically. Sales of SpeediCath® intermittent catheters, especially the compact catheters, continued to drive growth.
Compact catheters were a key growth driver, particularly in France, the USA and the UK. Saudi Arabia also contributed to the performance due to delivery on a large tender win in the first quarter. The buying patterns of a major distributor impacted the US market during the year. In the UK, the performance of the Charter homecare business remains unsatisfactory.
SpeediCath® Compact Set continued the satisfactory growth following the December 2012 launch, and the SpeediCath® Compact Eve is now available in 13 countries.
Sales growth for standard catheters was unsatisfactory, mainly because last year's comparator was boosted by a large tender win in Algeria in the first half of 2013/14, but also due to the

8

Management's report

negative performance of standard catheter sales in the UK market.
The sales growth for urine bags and urisheaths was not satisfactory, mainly due to the negative performance of urine bag sales in the more competitive Dutch, US and UK markets.
Sales of the Peristeen® anal irrigation system grew at a fair rate, especially in the UK, France and Germany.
Urology Care Sales of urology care products increased by 13% to DKK 1,359m, while the organic growth rate was 5%. Full-year growth was mainly driven by sales of disposable endourological products in France, Germany and Saudi Arabia. The sales performance of implant products remained unsatisfactory due to the weaker sales momentum for penile implants in the USA. The sales momentum in transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse has weakened, because the satisfactory sales of Altis® slings and Restorelle® products have not fully offset the still declining sales of Aris®, an older sling product.

Wound & Skin Care Sales of wound and skin care products amounted to DKK 1,964m, equal to a 16% increase in DKK and 9% organic growth. The Wound Care business alone generated 11% organic growth.
Growth was driven by sales of Biatain® foam dressings, especially by Biatain® Silicone in Europe and notably in the UK, German and French markets. Lower reimbursement rates in the French market taking effect on 1 October 2014 impacted growth. Growth in Emerging markets was driven by China and Greece and by sales on a large tender win in Saudi Arabia. Organic growth in the US Wound Care business improved.
Contract production of Compeed® delivered weak full-year growth.
The Biatain® Silicone launch continued to produce highly satisfactory results, and the product is available in all core markets.

European markets Revenue was up by 8% to DKK 8,843m on 5% organic growth. France, Southern Europe and the Nordic markets all reported highly satisfactory organic growth rates, whereas the Dutch market remains challenged by the abovementioned changes to reimbursement rates in the ostomy care and continence care markets.

Growth in France, Southern Europe and the Nordics was driven mainly the continence care and ostomy care businesses. Lastly, the UK operations remain challenged by the performance of the Charter homecare business, which is affecting the ostomy care and continence care businesses. Having implemented a number of operational initiatives, Charter has now brought

9

Management's report

the quality of its service back to industry peer levels. In addition, the German homecare company SIEWA continued to face a weaker growth momentum in a more competitive market.
Other developed markets Revenue was DKK 2,945m, which translates into reported growth of 19%, while the underlying organic growth rate was 6%. Much of the performance was driven by the US ostomy care and continence care markets, and particularly by SpeediCath® intermittent catheters and the Brava® range of accessories.
An industry-wide investigation of sales and marketing practices by the US Department of Justice has impacted the US market in general including our sales activities. Also, the procurement patterns of a major distributor impacted growth in the US market. The growth performance of Titan® penile implants in the USA was unsatisfactory due to a drop in market activity. Canada reported positive growth performance in Ostomy Care, Wound Care and Continence Care. In Australia, Continence Care was the main growth driver.
Emerging markets Revenue increased by 23% to DKK 2,121m, while organic growth was 21%. The performance was driven especially by China, Saudi Arabia, Greece and Argentina, whereas Algeria and Brazil were negative contributors. In addition, Turkey, Mexico and South Korea all reported very strong growth rates. Performance in the Chinese market was driven by good momentum in Ostomy Care, especially for the Assura® portfolio, and in Wound Care, especially for Biatain®.
In Saudi Arabia, tender wins in Continence Care, Wound Care and Urology Care in the first half of the year continued to support the growth performance. Greece reported decent growth in Continence Care for compact catheters and Wound Care for Biatain®. The performance in Argentina was driven by good momentum in Ostomy Care and Continence Care. The negative growth in Algeria was due to an inventory buy-back coupled with an inventory build-up by

a new distributor second quarter last year. Reduced tender activity impacted the growth performance in Brazil.
Gross profit
Gross profit was up by 12% to DKK 9,533m from DKK 8,538m last year. The gross margin was 69%, which was in line with last year. In the 2014/15 financial year, Coloplast took a DKK 25m writedown on the inventory of NPWT products when discontinuing the partnership with Devon Medical. The performance was supported by the ongoing focus on efficiency improvements and costs, which offset the negative effect of new product launches with their high initial costs and increasing depreciations resulting from increased capital expenditure. Coloplast also incurred costs in connection with expanding the factory at Nyírbátor, Hungary, and relocating production from Denmark to Hungary.
Costs
Distribution costs amounted to DKK 3,962m, against DKK 3,519m last year. Distribution costs amounted to 28% of revenue, which was in line with last year. Included in costs were ongoing investments of about DKK 200m, mainly for sales and marketing initiatives in China, the USA, the UK, Germany and France. Lastly, Coloplast continue to invest in "522 Postmarket Surveillance" studies for products in Urology Care.
Administrative expenses amounted to DKK 600m, against DKK 498m last year. The full-year financial statements contain provisions announced in the 9M interim report for a total of DKK 75m made in relation to the industry-wide investigation of sales and marketing practices in the USA by the US Department of Justice and for the greater risk of losses on trade receivables in southern Europe. Administrative expenses accounted for 4% of revenue, which was in line with last year.
R&D costs were DKK 442m, up from DKK 390m last year due to a general increase in business activity, restructuring costs relating to the organisational changes announced on the release of

10

Management's report

the H1 interim report and an increase in depreciation charges. R&D costs amounted to 3% of revenue, which was in line with last year.
Other operating income and other operating expenses amounted to a net income for the year of DKK 6m, against a net income of DKK 16m last year.
Special items
Coloplast took a further provision of DKK 3,000m to cover potential settlements and costs in connection with the lawsuits in the United States alleging injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more details.
Operating profit (EBIT)
EBIT before special items was DKK 4,535m, a 9% increase from DKK 4,147m last year. The EBIT margin was 33% in DKK and 32% at constant exchange rates, against 33% last year both in DKK and at constant exchange rates.
EBIT after special items was DKK 1,535m against DKK 3,147m last year. The EBIT margin was 11% in DKK and 10% at constant exchange rates, against 25% last year both in DKK and at constant exchange rates.
Financial items and tax
Financial items were a net expense of DKK 289m, compared to a net income of DKK 46m last year. The change was mainly due to net losses on realised forward exchange contracts, especially on USD and GBP, against a net gain last year.
The tax rate was 28% against 25% last year, the change being due to the increased provision of DKK 3,000m taken in respect of the lawsuits in the USA, but partially offset by the lower corporate tax rate in Denmark. The tax expense before special items was DKK 1,006m against DKK 1,025m last year. The tax expense was reduced by DKK 660m due to special items against DKK 224m last year.

Net profit
The net profit before special items was up by 2% to DKK 3,239m from DKK 3,166m last year. Special items after tax amounted to DKK 2,340m against DKK 776m last year. This brought the net profit (after special items) to DKK 899m against DKK 2,390m last year.
The diluted earnings per share (EPS) before special items were DKK 15.19 against DKK 14.80 last year. The diluted earnings per share (EPS) after special items were DKK 4.20 against DKK 11.17 last year.
Cash flows and investments
Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities amounted to DKK 3,337m, against DKK 3,149m last year. The change was due to an improvement in EBITDA before special items offset by payments made for currency hedging transactions.
The cash flows relating to the lawsuits in the United Stated alleging injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence have lifted cash flows from operating activities by about DKK 200m due to DKK 150m received in insurance payments and a currency hedge on the provision, offset by payments made from the escrow account.
Investments Coloplast grew its net capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets by DKK 64m relative to last year, increasing CAPEX investments by 16% over the 2013/14 period to DKK 617m. As a result, CAPEX accounted for 4% of revenue. The financial statements include investment in machinery to be used for new products, including for a new SenSura® Mio platform, added capacity for existing products and the expansion of the factory in Nyírbátor, which was inaugurated in April 2015. Changes in the securities portfolio lifted cash flows from investing activities by DKK 352m.

11

Management's report

Free cash flow The free cash flow amounted to DKK 2,869m, against DKK 2,372m last year.
Capital resources Interest-bearing net deposits at 30 September 2015 amounted to DKK 1,300m, against DKK 1,490m at 30 September 2014, the increase being mainly due to a smaller securities portfolio and a smaller holding of cash and cash equivalents.
Statement of financial position and equity
Balance sheet At DKK 10,817m, total assets increased by DKK 438m relative to last year.
Intangible assets amounted to DKK 1,511m, which was DKK 30m more than at 30 September 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase in goodwill resulting from the appreciation of USD against DKK less amortisation of patents and trademarks. Investments in property, plant and equipment (CAPEX) increased by 10% to DKK 2,705m, driven by the ongoing investments in Hungary. As a result, non-current assets increased by a total of DKK 720m to DKK 5,052m.
Non-current assets increased by DKK 447m due to the deferred tax asset related to the lawsuits in the United States alleging injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.
Relative to last year, inventories increased by 11% to DKK 1,473m due to inventory build-ups in connection with new product roll-outs, relocation of production and weaker-than-expected sales. Trade receivables were up by 12% to DKK 2,467m, mirroring the revenue performance. Trade payables amounted to DKK 591m, marking a 4% increase relative to last year. This brought net working capital to 24% of revenue, which was in line with the percentage at 30 September 2014.

Amounts held in escrow decreased by DKK 346m from DKK 418m at 30 September 2014 to DKK 72m at 30 September 2015. The lower amount is due to settlement payments made in connection with lawsuits in the United States alleging injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh. However, the lower amount was partly offset by an increase in escrow deposits.
The value of security holdings decreased by DKK 100m and cash and cash equivalents by 90m relative to the beginning of the financial year. As a result, current assets decreased by a total of DKK 282m relative to last year to stand at DKK 5,765m.
An amount of DKK 3,992m is recognised under liabilities, of which DKK 3,335m is recognised under provisions and DKK 657m is recognised under other debt.
Equity Equity decreased by DKK 1,577m to DKK 4,706m. Payment of dividends of DKK 2,535m and share buy-backs of DKK 500m were partly offset by the comprehensive income for the year of DKK 1,156m and the net effect of treasury shares sold and losses on share options exercised, share-based payment and related tax charges amounting to DKK 302m.
In the second quarter of 2013/14, Coloplast's Board of Directors resolved to complete a share buy-back programme for a total of up to DKK 1bn running until the end of the 2014/15 financial year. The programme was completed in June 2015.
Treasury shares At 30 September 2015, Coloplast's holding of treasury shares consisted of 8,648,447 B shares, which was 802,516 fewer than at 30 September 2014. The holding was reduced due to the exercise of equity options, which was partly offset by the share buy-back programme.
The Board of Directors recommends to the annual shareholders attending the general meeting to be held on 9 December 2015 that the share

12

Management's report

capital be reduced by a nominal value of DKK 4m, equal to 4,000,000 shares with a nominal value of DKK 1. The capital reduction is recommended because Coloplast has bought more shares through the buy-back programmes than are needed to cover share option programmes for senior employees.
Financial guidance for 2015/16
 We expect organic revenue growth of 7-8% at constant exchange rates and 8-9% in DKK.
 We expect an EBIT margin of 33-34%, both at constant exchange rates and in DKK.
 Capital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 700m.
 The effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%.
Price pressures in 2015/16 are expected to be in line with those of 2014/15, for an annual price pressure of about 1%. Our financial guidance takes account of reforms with known effects.
Also, the financial guidance assumes sustained and stable sales growth in Coloplast's core markets and a continuation of the successful roll-out of new products.
The EBIT margin guidance assumes that Coloplast, in addition to generating sales growth, can successfully deliver scale economies and efficiency improvements. The guidance for investments in sales-enhancing initiatives remains at about DKK 150m.
The capital investments will boost the production capacity for new and existing products and will provide for the completion of the factory expansion at Tatabánya in 2016.
The provision made to cover costs relating to transvaginal surgical mesh products remains subject to a high degree of estimation.
Coloplast's long-term financial guidance, as announced at the Capital Markets Day on 4 June 2014, remains to generate 7-10% sales growth per year and to improve the EBIT margin

by 0.5-1.0 percentage point per year. The overall weighted market growth in Coloplast's current markets is about 5%.
Other matters
Proposal for changes to the number of members and composition of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors proposes that the Board be increased by two shareholder-elected members and recommends Executive Director Birgitte Nielsen and CEO Jette NygaardAndersen be elected to the Board at the annual general meeting on 9 December 2015. The Board recommends Birgitte Nielsen and Jette Nygaard-Andersen for the Board in order to complement the Board's skills in general management, marketing, sales and innovation.
New factory in Hungary We have decided to expand the production capacity at the Coloplast factory in Tatabánya, Hungary. The 20,000 sq.m. expansion is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2016. The total investment will amount to around DKK 150m.
Commercial partnership with Devon Medical discontinued Due to product safety issues involving the Devon Medical Extricare portfolio, Coloplast discontinued all commercial activities relating to NPWT end March 2015, including sales and marketing in Brazil, Switzerland and Greece, where the products had been launched. The decision put a final stop to the commercial partnership with Devon Medical. Coloplast remains committed to selling and marketing NPWT products as part of its product range.
Wellcome Support Center divested Coloplast divested its Japanese homecare activities, which generated revenue of about DKK 85m and moderate earnings in the 2013/14 financial year. The divestment had no impact on the financial results for 2014/15.

Management's report

Intellectual capital
Coloplast develops its products and services in close interaction between employees, users, healthcare professionals and opinion-makers. Coloplast believes that retaining employees, developing their skills and empowering them to engage in this interaction is a prerequisite for safeguarding its position as a market leader.
At Coloplast, innovation is a team effort between marketing, R&D, production and sales. Marketing prepares market research and manages relationships with users so as to build an understanding of their needs. This is then used to chart the course for innovation within the individual business areas. Next, Coloplast develops products and services consistent with that course. Concurrently with the development process, clinical tests are run and legal issues are clarified at an early stage, including prices and the potential for reimbursement. In 2014/15, Coloplast integrated the Chronic Care R&D department in the Global Operation production unit to ensure greater integration in the innovation process and the right production set-up at the lowest possible cost.
Human resources At 30 September 2015, Coloplast had 9,706 employees, of whom 8,226 were employed in international locations. During the financial year, the number of employees increased by 5%.
Corporate responsibility at Coloplast
In its Corporate Responsibility report, which is published along with the annual report, Coloplast communicates openly about social responsibility. The report has been prepared in compliance with the principles of the UN Global Compact.
With respect to the statutory statement on corporate social responsibility in compliance with section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act, see the Corporate Responsibility Report for 2014/15, which is available at
http://www.coloplast.com/About-Coloplast/Responsibility/Policies/

Risk management and internal controls
The management of each of Coloplast's individual business units and staff functions is in charge of identifying and managing risk factors in their specific parts of the organisation. The most significant risks are reported quarterly to Corporate Risk Management. The reporting process and risk interviews form the basis of the quarterly risk update submitted to the Executive Management and the Board of Directors.
A central unit of the Corporate Finance department conducts regular control inspections at Coloplast subsidiaries to ensure that corporate standards for internal controls have been implemented and operate effectively. Conclusions from these inspections and any proposals for improvement are reported to the Executive Management, the audit committee and the independent auditors.
The members of Coloplast's audit committee are the chairman of the Board of Directors (committee chairman), the deputy chairman and Board member Jørgen Tang-Jensen.
The duties of the audit committee are to monitor the following:
 The financial reporting process;  The company's internal control system and
risk management systems;  The statutory audit of the financial state-
ments; and  The independence of the auditors, including
in particular the provision of non-audit services to the group.
The Board of Directors has resolved to follow the audit committee's recommendation not to establish an internal audit function. For more information, click the link below to go to our website and see "Monitoring".
The committee held five meetings in the 2014/15 financial year.

15

Management's report

The Executive Management is responsible for Coloplast's overall risk profile and for aligning it with the overall strategies and policies. The Executive Management is also responsible for launching and validating projects and activities to cover the most significant risks. The Board of Directors reviews and considers, on a quarterly basis, the conclusions and recommendations submitted by the Executive Management.
Additional information about risk management and major risk factors is available from our website:
http://www.coloplast.com/internalcontrols
Share classes and authorisations
Coloplast has two share classes: A and B. Both share classes have a denomination of DKK 1 per share. The 18 million class A shares entitle the holders to ten votes per A share and the 202 million class B shares entitle the holders to one vote per B share. The class A shares are nonnegotiable instruments. The class B shares are negotiable instruments and were listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (Nasdaq Copenhagen) in 1983. Any change of ownership or pledging of class A shares requires the consent of the Board of Directors, whereas class B shares are freely negotiable.
The Board of Directors may increase the company's share capital by a nominal value of up to DKK 15m in one or more issues of class B shares. This authorisation is valid until the annual general meeting to be held in 2016. Moreover, the Board of Directors has been authorised to acquire treasury shares for up to 10% of the company's share capital. The highest and lowest amount to be paid for the shares by the company is the price applicable at the time of purchase +/- 10%. This authorisation is valid until the annual general meeting to be held in 2015.
At general meetings, matters are decided by a simple majority of votes. Resolutions to amend the company's articles of association require that not less than half of the share capital is represented and that the resolution is adopted by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as

of the voting share capital represented at the general meeting. The resolution lapses if the above-mentioned share capital is not represented, or if a resolution is not adopted by twothirds of the votes cast. If a resolution is adopted by two-thirds of the votes cast, the Board of
Directors must convene a new extraordinary general meeting within two weeks. If at this meeting the resolution is adopted by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast and of the voting share capital represented, it will be passed irrespective of the amount of the share capital represented at the meeting.
In the event of a change of control in the company resulting from a change of ownership, share options may be exercised immediately. No other important agreements are in place that would be affected in the event of a change of control of the company resulting from a takeover, and no special agreements have been made between the company, its management or employees if their positions are discontinued due to change in ownership.
There are no special provisions governing the election of members to Coloplast's Board of Directors.
Ownership and shareholdings
The company had 47,001 shareholders at the end of the financial year, which was 9,929 more than last year. Institutional investors based outside Denmark held 29% of Coloplast's shares at 30 September 2014, compared with 33% a year earlier.
Registered shareholders represented 95% of the entire share capital. Pursuant to the company's articles of association, shares must be registered in the name of the holder in order to carry voting rights. Three shareholders have reported to the company, pursuant to section 55 of the Danish Companies Act, that at the date of this annual report they held 5% or more of the share capital or voting rights.

17

The Board of Directors and the Executive Management share the committee's views and generally follow the new recommendations. See our corporate website for a presentation of which recommendations Coloplast does not follow and the reasons why.

 To ensure that investors receive information;  To increase investor and employee insight
into the company's strategy, objectives and risks; and  To create stakeholder confidence in the company.
The full report 'Corporate governance at Coloplast' is available from the corporate website: "Statutory report on corporate governance".
http://www.coloplast.com/Investor-Relations/CorporateGovernance

Openness and transparency
Investor relations Coloplast has established a policy for communicating information to shareholders and investors, under which the Executive Management and the Investor Relations team are in charge of communications pursuant to guidelines agreed with the Board of Directors. The communication of information complies with the rules laid down by Nasdaq Copenhagen, comprising:  Full-year and interim financial statements and
the annual report  Replies to enquiries from equity analysts,
investors and shareholders  Site visits by investors and equity analysts  Presentations to Danish and foreign investors  Capital markets days for analysts and inves-
tors  Conference calls in connection with the re-
lease of financial statements  Dedicated investor relations section on the
Coloplast corporate website.
Duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors
Rules of procedure A set of rules of procedure governs the work of Coloplast's Board of Directors. These procedures are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors and updated as necessary. The procedures set out guidelines for the activities of the Board of Directors including the supervision of the company's organisation, day-to-day management and results.Six board meetings were held in the 2014/15 financial year.
Composition of the Board of Directors
Board committees The Board of Directors has set up an audit committee consisting of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Board and an ordinary Board member.
Assessment of the work performed by the Board of Directors At least every other year, the Board of Directors assesses its working procedures and method of approach. Based on this assessment, the or-

18

Management's report

ganisation and efficiency of the Board of Directors' work are discussed at a Board meeting where any proposals for improvement are considered. The assessment has not given rise to any comments.
Remuneration to the Board of Directors and the Executive Management
Section 139 of the Danish Companies Act provides that shareholders adopt, at a general meeting, general guidelines for incentive pay to members of a company's board of directors and its executive management before a specific agreement to this effect can be made. Coloplast amended its guidelines for incentive pay at the annual general meeting held on 1 December 2010.
General guidelines for the company's remuneration of members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Board of Directors Members of the Board of Directors receive a fixed annual fee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors receive a supplement to this fee. The amounts of fees and supplements are approved by the shareholders in general meeting and disclosed in the annual report. Fees are fixed based on a comparison with fees paid by other companies. Members of the Board of Directors receive no incentive pay.
Executive Management The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors perform an annual review of the remuneration paid to members of the Executive Management. The remuneration paid to members of the Executive Management consists of a fixed and a variable part. The fixed pay consists of a net salary, pension contribution and other benefits. The value of each of those components is disclosed in the annual report for each member of the Executive Management. As an element of the variable pay, members of the Executive Management may receive an annual bonus, subject to the achievement of certain benchmarks. The bonus proportion varies among the members of the Executive Management, but is subject to a maximum of 25% of the

annual remuneration. The actual bonus paid to each member of the Executive Management is disclosed in the Annual Report. At the date of adoption of these guidelines, the bonus benchmarks are based on value creation and profitability, but they may be changed by the Board of Directors. Any such change will be communicated in a company announcement.
Another element of the variable pay is made up of options and is intended to ensure that the Executive Management's incentive correlates with the long-term creation of shareholder value. For that same reason, the option plan is revolving and not subject to the achievement of defined benchmarks.
Members of the Executive Management are awarded a number of options each year with a value equal to a maximum of 40% of the Executive Management's remuneration. The value is calculated in accordance with the Black-Scholes formula. Options are awarded at a strike price which is 15% higher than the market price at the award date calculated as the average price of all trades on the last trading day of the calendar year. The options have a term of five years and are exercisable after three years. The number of options awarded to each member of the Executive Management and their value is disclosed in the Company's annual report. Options in the Executive Management share option plan are covered by the Company's holding of treasury shares. In addition, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board perform an annual review of the remuneration paid to members of the Executive Management relative to the managements of other Danish companies.
Severance schemes As at 30 September 2015, a provision of DKK 1m had been made for a now discontinued postservice remuneration scheme for retired Board members. The scheme comprises one person. When current executives leave the company, the company will have an obligation of two years' pay.

Independent auditor's report

To the Shareholders of Coloplast A/S Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements of Coloplast A/S for the financial year 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies, for both the Group and the Parent Company, as well as statement of comprehensive income, and cash flow statement for the Group. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and the Parent Company Financial Statements are prepared under the Danish Financial Statements Act. Moreover, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for preparing Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence

about the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The audit has not resulted in any qualification.
Opinion In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 30 September 2015 and of the results of the Group's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Moreover, in our opinion, the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Parent Company's financial position at 30 September 2015 and of the results of the Parent Company's operations for the financial year 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Statement on Management's Review We have read Management's Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. We have not performed any procedures additional to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements. On this basis, in our opinion, the information provided in Management's Review is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements.

1. Key accounting policies This section provides a summary of significant accounting policies, new IFRS requirements and other general accounting policies. A detailed description of the accounting policies applied and the estimates made relative to each individual item is provided in relevant notes, such that all information about a specific accounting item can be found there.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements for 2014/2015 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements applying to listed companies.
General information The annual report is prepared on the basis of the historical cost principle, modified in that certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured as described below in respect of each individual item or in the relevant note.
Accounting policy changes Effective from the 2014/15 financial year, the Coloplast group has implemented all new, updated or amended international financial reporting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) as issued by the IASB and IFRSs adopted by the EU that are effective for the 2014/15 financial year. The implementation did not affect the financial statements.
New financial reporting standards adopted Other relevant standards or interpretations adopted by the IASB but not adopted by the EU have not been applied in this annual report. The amended IFRS 11 "Joint Arrangements" is expected to apply from the 2016/17 financial year. The new IFRS 9 "Financial instruments" is expected to apply from the 2018/19 financial year, while the new IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" is expected to apply from the 2018/19 financial year. None of the mentioned standards or interpretations are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Significant estimates and judgments In connection with the practical use of the accounting policies described, it may be necessary for Management to make estimates in respect of the accounting items. The estimates and assumptions applied are based on historical experience and other factors that Management considers reasonable under the circumstances, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Such assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or circumstances may arise. In addition, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to deviate from these estimates.
It may be necessary to change previous estimates as a result of changes to the assumptions on which the estimates were based or due to new information or subsequent events.

1. Key accounting policies, continued Management has made significant estimates in respect of, among others, the following items: Special items, Intangible assets, Research and development, Inventories, Trade receivables, Deferred tax including Deferred tax assets and Other provisions. A further description of the principal accounting estimates and judgments is provided in the relevant notes.
Foreign currency The financial statement items of individual Group entities are measured in the currency used in the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is the functional and presentation currency of the parent company. Other currencies are considered foreign currencies.
Foreign currency translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into an entity's functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange adjustments arising as the difference between exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and exchange rates at the transaction date of monetary items, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
On translation of entities with a functional currency other than DKK, balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and income statement items are translated at the exchange rates at the transaction date. The resulting exchange adjustments are taken directly to other comprehensive income.
Consolidation, business combinations and associates The consolidated financial statements comprise Coloplast A/S (the parent company) and enterprises in which the Group holdsmore than 50% of the voting rights or otherwise exerts a controlling influence (subsidiaries).
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by aggregating the audited financial statements of the parent company and the individual subsidiaries, all of which are prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Intra-group transactions, balances, dividends and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group enterprises are eliminated.
Enterprises, which are not subsidiaries but in which the Group holds at least 20% of the voting rights or otherwise exerts a significant influence, are regarded as associates. The Group's proportionate share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Coloplast Group and associates is eliminated.
Enterprises recently acquired or divested are included in the consolidation in the period in which the Coloplast Group has control of the enterprise.
Comparative figures are not adjusted to reflect acquisitions. Divested activities are shown separately as discontinued operations.
31

Consolidated financial statements
Notes
Note 1. Key accounting policies, continued
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method, according to which the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of enterprises acquired are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess value/goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries or associates is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of the group companies' proportionate share of identifiable assets less liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. The consideration for an enterprise consists of the fair value of the agreed consideration for the acquired enterprise. If part of the consideration is contingent on future events, such part is recognised at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised directly in the income statement as incurred. In cases where the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities subsequently turns out to differ from the values calculated at the date of acquisition, the calculation, including goodwill is adjusted until up to 12 months after the date of acquisition. Subsequently, goodwill is not adjusted. Changes to estimates of contingent consideration are generally recognised in the income statement. Goodwill arising in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised in the balance sheet under intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements and tested annually for impairment.
Revenue Revenue comprises income from the sale of goods after deduction of any price reductions, quantity discounts or cash discounts. Sales are recognised in the income statement when the risk related to the goods passes to the customer, and the amounts can be reliably measured and are expected to be received.
Marketable securities The fair value option is applied to marketable securities, because the securities form part of a portfolio managed and measured on a fair value basis.
Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement, which is presented according to the indirect method, shows the Group's cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the Group's cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt to credit institutions at the beginning and end of the year. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and debt to credit institutions recognised under current assets and current liabilities, respectively. Marketable securities include bonds with maturities of more than three months and are therefore recognised under investing activities.

Notes
Note 2. Segment information
Operating segments Changes to the management structure has led to changes in our management reporting and a change in the segment information for the 2014/15 financial year. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly. The operating segments are defined on the basis of the monthly reporting to the Executive Management, which is considered the senior operational management, and the management structure. Reporting to Management is based on three operating segments: Chronic Care, Urology Care and Wound & Skin Care. The operating segment Chronic Care covers the sale of ostomy care products and continence care products. The operating segment Urology Care covers the sale of urological products, including disposable products. The operating segment Wound & Skin Care covers the sale of wound and skin care products. The reporting segments are also Chronic Care, Urology Care and Wound & Skin Care. The segmentation reflects the structure of reporting to the Executive Management. Shared/non-allocated comprises support functions (Production units, R&D and Staff) and eliminations, as these functions do not generate revenue. Financial items and income tax are not allocated to the operating segments. Management reviews each operating segment separately based on EBIT before internal items and eliminations (market contribution) and allocates resources on that background. Costs are allocated directly to segments. Certain immaterial indirect costs are allocated systematically to Shared/Non-allocated and the reporting segments. Management does not receive reporting on asset and liabilities by the reporting segments. Accordingly, the reporting segments are not measured in this respect, nor are there resources allocated on this background. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenue. Coloplast A/S' registered office is situated in Denmark. Revenue from external customers in Denmark amounted to DKK 308m (2013/14: DKK 286m), while revenue from external customers in other countries amounted to DKK 13,601m (2013/14: DKK 12,142m). Total non-current assets except for financial instruments and deferred tax assets (there are no pension assets or rights pursuant to insurance contracts) placed in Denmark amounted to DKK 3,081 million (2013/14: DKK 2,555m), while total non-current assets placed in other countries amounted to DKK 1,163m (2013/14: DKK 1,417m).

5. Tax on profit for the year
Accounting policies Coloplast A/S is jointly taxed with wholly owned Danish subsidiaries. Full allocation is made of the jointly taxable income. The jointly taxed Danish enterprises are covered by the Danish on-account tax scheme. Additions, deductions and allowances relating to the on-account tax scheme are included in financial income and expenses. Current tax on the net profit or loss for the year is recognised as an expense in the income statement together with any change in the provision for deferred tax. Tax on changes in equity is taken directly to equity.

6. Earnings per share (EPS)
Accounting policies Earnings per share reflects the ratio between profit for the year and the year's weighted average of issued, ordinary shares, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury shares (note 16). Earnings per share is calculated as the net profit for the year divided by the average number of outstanding shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding share options in the money.

7. Dividend per share
Accounting policies Dividend is recognised in the balance sheet as a liability when adopted at the annual general meeting. Proposed but not yet paid dividend for the financial year is recognised in equity until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders attending the general meeting approve an additional dividend of DKK 8 per share of DKK 1 (2013/14: DKK 7.50). An interim dividend of DKK 4.50 per share was distributed in the financial year (2013/14: DKK 4.00), bringing total dividend per share for the year to DKK 12.50 per share (2013/14: DKK 11.50), for total dividends of DKK 2,644m (2013/14: DKK 2,423m). The increase in dividend per share thus amounts to 9%, and the pay-out ratio is 294% (2013/14: 101%).

8. Intangible assets

Accounting policies

Intangible assets with a finite life are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Borrowing costs are recognised as part of cost. Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over the expected

useful lives of the assets, which are:

Development projects

3-5 years

Software

3-5 years

Acquired patents and trademarks etc.

7-15 years

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment, while the carrying amount of intangible assets with finite lives, property, plant and equipment and investments measured at cost or amortised cost are assessed if there is an indication of impairment. If a write-down is required, the carrying amount is written down to the higher of net selling price and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped in the smallest group of assets that generates identifiable cash inflows (cash-generating units). The cash-generating units are defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and which are largely independent of cash flows from other assets or groups of assets.

8. Intangible assets, continued For other intangible assets, the amortisation period is determined on the basis of Management's best estimate of the expected economic lives of the assets. The expected economic lives are assessed at least annually, and the amortisation period is determined based on the latest assessment. For purposes of calculating amortisation, the residual value of the assets is nil, unless a third party has committed to purchasing the asset after its use or there is an active market for the asset. With the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have a finite life.
Gains or losses on the disposal of intangible assets are stated as the difference between the selling price less costs to sell and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are included in the income statement under other operating income or other operating expenses, respectively.
Development projects are recognised at the date when each individual project is expected to be exploited commercially. From this date, the directly associated costs will be recognised as an intangible asset in the balance sheet provided they can be measured reliably and there is sufficient certainty of the future earnings. As described below under "Significant estimates and judgments", costs incurred earlier in the development phase are recognised under research and development costs in the income statement.
Significant estimates and judgments Goodwill and other intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets, including goodwill, could be materially affected by significant changes in estimates and assumptions underlying the calculation of values. Uncertainty relating to goodwill is most pronounced in Urology Care. Goodwill in this business area amounted to DKK 348m at 30 September 2015 (30 September 2014: DKK 313m). The carrying amount of intangible assets was DKK 1,511m as at 30 September 2015 (30 September 2014: DKK 1,481m).
Research and development All in-house research costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Management believes that product development does not allow for a meaningful distinction between the development of new products and the continued development of existing products. As a result of mandatory regulatory approvals of products, completing the development of new products involves a high degree of uncertainty, for which reason the technical feasibility criteria are not considered to have been met. Against this background, it is believed that the Group's in-house research costs do not satisfy the capitalisation criteria. All in-house research and development costs are therefore recognised in the income statement as incurred. In 2014/15, DKK 442m (2013/14: DKK 390m) was expensed as research and development costs.

Goodwill Goodwill relates mainly to the acquisition of Mentor's urology and continence business and Mpathy acquired in 2006 and 2010 respectively. Goodwill from the acquired urology businesses has been allocated on the individual cash-generating units according to earnings at the date of acquisition. The allocation was made to the cashgenerating units Ostomy Care, Urology Care and Continence Care.
Pursuant to IAS 36, a goodwill impairment test is performed when there is an indication of impairment, but at least once a year. In the impairment test, the recoverable amount (value in use) of each cash-generating unit, calculated as the discounted expected future cash flows, is compared with the carrying amounts.

Future cash flows are determined using forecasts based in realised sales growth, earnings and strategy plans, etc. These forecasts are based on specific assumptions for each cash-generating unit during the planning period with respect to sales, results of operations, working capital, capital investments and more general assumptions for the projected period.

The impairment tests performed for the urology business were based on forecasts for the 2015/16 financial year. Assumptions for the long-term strategy of the urology business were used for the financial years 2016/17 to 2018/19. For Ostomy Care and Continence Care, impairment tests were based on forecasts for 2015/16 and on assumptions for the long-term strategy for the financial years 2016/17 to 2018/19.
The impairment tests performed reflect price pressures expected from healthcare reforms implemented in individual markets.

8. Intangible assets, continued
The tax rate applied in the impairment test for Urology Care was higher than the rate applied for the Group, because sales and production mostly take place in the United States, which imposes a corporate tax rate higher than the Group average. Non-recurring costs of postmarket surveillance studies, as are required by the FDA to keep products on the transvaginal mesh market have been applied in the period until 2019/20, at which time such studies are expected to be completed. The gross margin is expected to drop slightly until the terminal period, as our strategy for a broader geographical mix is expected to increase sales outside the USA, mainly to European countries with lower margins.

The most important parameters used to calculate the recoverable amounts are:

Growth rates are expected not to exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business area as a whole. Ongoing efficiency improvements contribute to a rising EBIT margin and improved cash flows.

Capital invested has been projected using the same growth rate as that for revenue with the exception of special assets associated with the acquisition of the urology business.

Acquired patents and trademarks etc. The majority of our acquired patents and trademarks are associated with the acquisition of Mentor's urology business in 2006 and the Mpathy acquisition in 2010 as specified in the table below. In connection with the acquisitions, intangible assets were identified, and their cost was allocated to net assets at fair value at the date of acquisition, calculated on the basis of factors such as expected sales and revenue trends. Each component is amortised over its estimated useful life using the straight line method.

8. Intangible assets, continued Patented technologies and unprotected technologies On acquiring Mentor's urology business, Coloplast acquired a large number of patented technologies (more than 300) and unprotected technologies. On acquiring Mpathy, Coloplast acquired about 50 patented technologies. Unprotected technologies include (Mentor only): 1. inventions not patentable/protectable 2. trade secrets 3. know-how 4. confidential information 5. copyrights on computer software, databases or instruction manuals and the like Most relate to know-how concerning various materials and processes used in production. A division of the individual components into small intangible assets is not considered material or relevant.

Trademark s In addition to patents, Coloplast acquired a large number (more than 150) of registered and unregistered trademarks when acquiring the Mentor business, including pending applications for trademark registration, but Coloplast did not acquire the Mentor trademark. Individual acquired trademarks, each representing a limited value, are not material for Coloplast's sales, as is also the case for patented and unprotected technologies. On acquiring Mpathy, Coloplast acquired a small number (less than 20) of trademarks.

Customer lists/loyalty Coloplast also acquired a substantial number of customer relationships with the acquisition of both the Mentor business and Mpathy. As long-term customer contracts are rarely made in the field of urology, customer lists are valued as a whole at the date of acquisition.

9. Property, plant and equipment

Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly attributable to the acquisition until the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets manufactured by the company, cost comprises materials, components, sub-supplier services, direct labour and costs directly attributable to the manufactured asset. In addition, borrowing costs are recognised as part of cost.
Leases, under which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are transferred, are classified as finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under a finance lease are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments at the date of acquisition. The capitalised residual lease liability is recognised in the balance sheet as a liability, and the interest element of the lease payment is recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated according to the same principles as the Group's other property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets. The expected useful

At the balance sheet date, the residual values, remaining useful lives and depreciation pattern of the assets are assessed. Any changes are treated as changes to accounting estimates. Gains and losses on the sale or scrapping of an item of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.

Accounting policies Special items comprise material amounts of a non-recurring nature, such as costs relating to divestment, closure or restructuring, provisions for lawsuits, etc. These items are presented separately to facilitate the comparability of the income statement and to provide a better picture of the operating results. The separation of special items requires the making of accounting estimates when stating special items in the income statement. Management reviews transactions presented as special items and considers whether such items are part of ordinary operations.
Special items for 2014/15 contain expenses to cover potential claims, settlements and other costs arising in connection with legal assistance relating to litigation about transvaginal surgical mesh products. See note 18 to the financial statements for more information about mesh litigation.

12. Deferred tax
Accounting policies Full provision is made for deferred tax on the basis of all temporary differences in accordance with the balance sheet liability method. Temporary differences arise between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts which are offset over time.
No provision is made for the tax that would arise from the sale of investments in subsidiaries if the investments are not expected to be disposed of within a short period of time. Uncertain tax positions are recognised under tax payable.

Note
12. Deferred tax, continued Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future positive taxable income will be generated, against which the temporary differences and tax losses can be offset. Deferred tax assets are measured at expected net realisable values.

Significant estimates and judgments
The recognition of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions requires an assessment by management. Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised if management estimates that the tax assets can be utilised within a foreseeable future by offsetting against future positive taxable income. The assessment is made annually on the basis of budgets and business plans for the following years, including any scheduled business measures. As the Group conducts business globally, transfer pricing disputes may arise with tax authorities in respect of settlement prices etc. Management assesses the possible outcomes of such disputes.

The losses listed above include a recognised tax asset of DKK 88m (2013/14: DKK 114m).

13. Inventories
Accounting policies Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO principle. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and indirect production overheads. Production overheads comprise indirect material and labour costs, maintenance and depreciation of the machinery and production buildings used in the manufacturing process as well as costs of production administration and management. Net realisable value is the expected selling price less cost of completion and costs to sell.

Significant estimates and judgments
Capitalised production overheads have been calculated using a standard cost method, which is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant assumptions concerning capacity utilisation, lead times and other relevant factors in the calculation of actual costs of sales. Changes to the calculation method for production overheads, including levels of capacity utilisation, lead times, etc. could affect the gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories. The carrying amount of capitalised production overheads was DKK 413 million as at 30 September 2015 (30 September 2014: DKK 359 million).

14. Trade receivables
Accounting policies Receivables consist mainly of trade receivables. On initial recognition, receivables are measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Receivables are written down on the basis of an individual assessment.
Significant estimates and judgments Trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost less provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Provision is made for losses considered likely to arise if a customer proves unable to pay. If the financial position of customers deteriorates, making then unable to make payments, it may prove necessary to make additional provisions in future accounting periods. When assessing whether the Group has made adequate provisions for bad and doubtful debts, management analyses the receivables, including previous losses on trade receivables, the customer's creditworthiness, current economic conditions and changes to customer payment terms and conditions.

Share options are granted to the Executive Management and executives. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options is determined at the grant date. The option value is subsequently recognised over the vesting period as staff costs. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted during the period is recognised as staff costs, whereas the fair value adjustment of granted options from previous periods is recognised under financial items. The purchase and selling price of treasury shares on exercise are deducted from or added to equity, as the case may be.

Share option programmes (B shares) have been set up for members of the Executive Management and executives.

Share options are granted to members of the Executive Management and other senior executives in order to motivate and retain a qualified management group and in order to align the interests of Management and the shareholders. In the period 2004-2006, options were awarded subject to the achievement of specific consolidated EP and EBIT margin targets. If only one of the targets was achieved, 50% of the options under the scheme were awarded. Options awarded in 2007 and later are made as unconditional allocations at the date of grant, but vest over a three-year period. The value of options at the date of grant equalled an average of two months' salary for each recipient, with the exception of the Executive Management.
Coloplast's holding of treasury shares fully covers the option programmes, so options exercised under the programme will not influence the Group's cash position by forcing it to buy up shares in the market.
The value of the options was calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, in which the interest rate applied was the yield on Danish government securities. Volatility in the share is calculated as monthly movements (periodend to period-end) over five years. Options are assumed to be exercised on average one year into the exercise period.

17. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
Accounting policies In defined contribution plans, the Group makes regular payments of fixed contributions to independent pension funds and insurance companies. The Group is under no obligation to pay additional contributions.
Costs for defined contribution plans are recognised in the income statement as Coloplast assumes an obligation to make the payment.
In defined benefit plans, the Group is under an obligation to pay a defined benefit on retirement. The actuarially calculated present value less the fair value of any plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet under provision for pension and similar obligations or in plan assets in the balance sheet. The total service costs of the year plus calculated interest based upon actuarial estimates and financial assumptions at the beginning of the year are recognised in the income statement. The difference between the forecast development in plan assets and liabilities and the realised values at the end of the year is called actuarial gains or losses and is recognised in other comprehensive income. In connection with a change in benefits regarding the employees' employment with the Group to date, there will be a change in the actuarial calculation of the net present value, which is considered historical costs. Historical cost is taken directly to the income statement.
Defined contribution plans The Group offers pension plans to certain groups of employees in Denmark and abroad. Most of the pension plans are defined contribution plans. The Group funds the plans through regular payments of premiums to independent insurance companies responsible for the pension obligations towards the beneficiaries. Once the pension contributions for defined contribution plans have been made, the Group has no further obligation towards current or former employees. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised in the income statement when paid. In 2014/15, DKK 238m (2013/14: DKK 199m) was recognised.

17. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations, continued Defined benefit plans For certain groups of employees in foreign subsidiaries the Group has signed agreements to pay defined benefits, including pension payments. These liabilities are not or are only partly covered by insurance. Uncovered liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet and in the income statement as indicated below. The figures below include liabilities regarding the post-service remuneration scheme applicable to Board members prior to the amendment to the Articles of Association adopted at the Annual General Meeting in 2002.
The pension plans are based on the individual employee's salary and years of service. A few countries may require that the liability is covered, but this is not the case for the majority of the countries. The plans have no requirements for risk diversification on equities or for matching strategies. The plans have a duration of an average of 17 years, and all plans generally mature after more than 10 years.

Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of the Group's financial resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured as Management's best estimate of the amount with which the liability is expected to be settled.
The Group recognises a provision for the replacement of products covered by warranties at the balance sheet date. This provision is calculated based on prior experience.

Significant estimates and judgments Provisions for legal obligations consists of provisions for pending litigation. Management makes assessments of provisions and contingent liabilities, including the probable outcome of pending and possible future litigation, which is inherently subject to uncertain future events. Based on information available, Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for pending litigation, but there can be no assurance that the scope of these matters will not be extended, nor that material lawsuits, claims, legal proceedings or investigations will not arise in the future.

Legal claims The amounts are gross amounts relating to certain legal claims. Having consulted external legal experts, the management believes that any losses resulting from these legal claims will not exceed the provisions made.
Since 2011, Coloplast has been named as a defendant in individual lawsuits in various federal and state courts around the United States alleging injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.

A multidistrict litigation (MDL) presided over by Judge Joseph Goodwin was formed in August 2012 to consolidate federal court cases in which Coloplast is the first named defendant in the Southern District of West Virginia as part of MDL No. 2387. The cases are consolidated for purposes of pre-trial discovery and motion practice. MDLs against other major transvaginal mesh manufacturers are being heard at the same venue.
As an alternative to litigation, Coloplast has entered into tolling agreements. The parties to a tolling agreement agree all defences are preserved while the parties exchange medical histories and other relevant information for the purpose of evaluating and potentially resolving or eliminating a claim out of court. Under a tolling agreement the limitation period is suspended. Against this background, Coloplast has reached settlements with groups of law firms.

54

Consolidated financial statements
Notes

Note
18. Other provisions, continued On September 14, 2015, Judge Joseph Goodwin ordered Coloplast to make substantial progress in the settlement process and to enter into the discovery phase of litigation with 200 cases.
Coloplast intends to dispute the current and any future litigation, and will continually consider which strategy and other steps that may serve the company's best interests. Coloplast will amend its strategy as a result of Judge Goodwin's order, and there is an increased probability that certain cases will proceed to trial.
An expense of DKK 3,000m was recognised in the 2014/15 financial year to cover potential claims and settlements and other costs arising in connection with legal assistance. The expense is recognised under special items in the income statement.
A similar provision, for DKK 1.5bn (before insurance cover of DKK 0.5bn), was recognised in the 2013/14 financial year, bringing the total expected cost of litigation in the USA including legal costs to DKK 4.5bn. The total expense is based on a number of estimates and assumptions and is therefore subject to substantial uncertainty. As a result, there can be no assurance that the amount will not change materially over time.
The remaining provision made for legal claims at 30 September 2015 amounted to DKK 3.3bn plus DKK 0.7bn recognised under other debt. In reference to the provisions of IAS 37, Coloplast will not disclose any further information about the assumptions for the provision, including any details about current and the expected number of claims and settlements.
The disclosure of such information is believed to be detrimental to Coloplast in connection with the ongoing confidential negotiations and could inflict financial losses on Coloplast and its shareholders.
Other Other liabilities relate to provisions for expenses associated with the vacating of leased premises, restructuring, guarantees and other non-legal claims.

20. Financial instruments
Accounting policies Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet under other receivables and other payables, respectively, and are adjusted to fair value in an ongoing process.
Adjustment of derivative financial instruments used to hedge expected future transactions (effective) is recognised in the fair value reserve under equity through other comprehensive income. The reserve is recognised in the income statement on realisation of the hedged transactions. If a derivative financial instrument used to hedge expected future transactions expires, is sold or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any accumulated fair value reserve remains in equity until the hedged transaction is concluded. If the transaction is no longer expected to be concluded, any fair value reserve accumulated under equity is transferred to the income statement.
Adjustment of derivative financial instruments used to hedge assets denominated in foreign currency is recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date. Value adjustments are recognised in the income statement together with any adjustments of the value of the hedged asset that concern the hedged risk.

The Group's risk management policy Financial risks are managed centrally and, accordingly, all derivative instruments are managed and controlled by the parent company. The framework is determined by the financial policy approved annually by the Board of Directors.The financial policy comprises policies for foreign exchange, funding, liquidity and financial counterparts. The core principle is for financial risk to be managed with a view to reducing significant risk.

1) The securities portfolio consists of mortgage bonds and corporate bonds. The bond portfolio carried an effective rate of interest of 16% (2013/14: 1-6%).
2) Financial instruments measured at fair value are broken dow n according to the follow ing measuring hierarchy: Level 1: Observable market prices of identical instruments Level 2: Valuation models primarily based on observable prices or traded prices of comparable instruments Level 3: Valuation models primarily based on non-observable prices

The fair value of forward exchange contracts and other derivative financial instruments are considered a level 2 fair value measurement as the fair value is determined directly based on the published exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates at balance sheet dates.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated on the basis of current market data.

Foreign exchange risk The objective of the foreign exchange policy is to neutralise and delay the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in the income statement and thereby enhance the predictability of the financial results. This is done by hedging significant balance sheet items denominated in foreign currency and a part of the expected future cash flows. Currency hedging is achieved by means of forward contracts and options. As at 30 September 2015, an average of 85% of the following twelve months of expected net cash flows were hedged (2013/14: 87% of the following twelve months of cash flows). The Group does not hedge amounts in euro.

The Group had no material foreign exchange risks relating to debt in foreign currency as at 30 September 2015. The Group's receivables and payables are to some extent affected by exchange rate fluctuations, and, accordingly, the Group's balance sheet is impacted to some extent by changes in exchange rates prevailing at 30 September 2015.

Note 20. Financial instruments, continued
Interest rate risk As the Group's interest-bearing debt is insignificant, the interest rate risk is also considered insignificant. The Group's cash reserve is placed in money market deposits and bonds with selected financial counterparties. Cash reserves are placed at an average duration not exceeding four years. As a result, the interest rate risk is considered to be limited.
Liquidity risk The funding policy is intended to ensure that the Group maintains a minimum cash reserve that will cover the Group's liquidity requirements from time to time.
The cash policy stipulates that the Group must obtain a competitive return and high liquidity when investing its excess cash. Cash pools is one of the means of achieving effective management of the Group's cash. The Group's cash reserve comprises cash and cash equivalents and securities.
Credit risk Pursuant to the counterparty policy, credit risk is managed and mitigated by making money market deposits only with selected financial institutions holding a satisfactory credit rating. In addition, maximum credit limits have been defined for each financial counterparty. There is only a limited credit risk involved in bonds as investments are made in selected liquid bonds with a high credit rating.
The Group's credit risks relate partly to receivables and cash holdings, partly to derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. The maximum credit risk related to financial assets equals the values recognised in the balance sheet.
The Group's credit risk relating to trade receivables is diversified over a large number of customers and is therefore not material. The Group's policy for undertaking credit risks involves an ongoing credit assessment of major customers and other key business partners.
Capital management The capital management objective of the Group is to raise new debt only for acquisition purposes or for other special purposes.
The Board of Directors generally intends to distribute excess cash to the shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks. It is expected that dividends will be paid twice a year; after the annual general meeting and after the release of the half-year interim report. However, share buybacks and distribution of dividend will always be made with due consideration for the Group's liquidity requirements and plans. The Group assesses the capital on the basis of the solvency ratio, which is calculated in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Danish Society of Financial Analysts.

25. Public grants
Accounting policies Public grants comprise grants for research, development and other investments. Grants for investments are recognised as deferred income, which is recognised systematically in the income statement under cost of sales from the date when the conditions attaching to them are deemed to be complied with until the date on which the deadline for retaining such conditions expires. Other grants are recognised as income on a systematic basis, so that they are matched with the related costs for which they compensate.
In the financial year, the Group received DKK 0m in public grants for research and development purposes (2013/14: DKK 1m). The Group received DKK 39m (2013/14: DKK 4m) in public grants for investments.
An amount of DKK 23m is recognised in the income statement (2013/14: DKK 24m) in production costs and DKK 0m (2013/14: DKK 1m) in research and development costs in respect of grants for investments.

Operating lease payments recognised in the income statement amount to DKK 86m (2013/14: DKK 80m).
Operating leases represent primarily leasing of cars. There are no purchasing rights attaching to assets held under operating leases. Liabilities concerning rent and other operating leases are limited to the minimum lease payments.

27. Contingent liabilities Other than as set out in Note 18 Other provisions, the Coloplast Group is a party to a few minor legal proceedings, which are not expected to influence the Group's future earnings.
In February 2014 the Department of Justice in the United States initiated an investigation of Coloplast and other Durable Medical Equipment producers, focusing on marketing and promotion activities related to the ostomy and continence business. Coloplast has cooperated with the Department of Justice in this investigation by providing documents and participating in interviews, and in June 2015 Coloplast reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice. Coloplast has taken a provision to cover the agreement in question and related costs. As part of the agreement, Coloplast will pay a settlement of USD 3.1m plus legal fees.

28. The Executive Management's and the Directors' remuneration, share options and shareholdings Remuneration It is Coloplast policy that the remuneration of members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management should be competitive relative to that of other major Danish companies. The principles applied for the remuneration of members of the Executive Management are unchanged from last year, with adjustments made only in terms of amounts. Share options vest over a three-year period of employment, but are otherwise awarded as unconditional allocations and at a percentage premium to the market price at the date of grant. The option value is calculated according to the Black-Scholes formula. See note 16.
Board of Directors Board members receive a fee of DKK 400,000 each (2013/14: DKK 375,000). The Chairman receives the basic fee plus 200% (2013/14: 200%), while the Deputy Chairman receives the basic fee plus 75% (2013/14: 75%). Members of the Audit Committee also receive a fee corresponding to 50% of the basic directors' fee (2013/14: 50%), while the chairman receives an additional fee of 50% of that amount. Members of the Board of Directors are not eligible for share option or bonus schemes.

28. The Executive Management's and the Directors' remuneration, share options and shares, continued
Executive Management The fixed remuneration paid to members of the Executive Management consists of salary, pension contribution and other benefits. Members of the Executive Management are also eligible for an annual cash bonus based on individually agreed financial performance targets. The bonus proportion varies for each member of the Executive Management, but is subject to a maximum of 25% of their annual remuneration.
In addition, each member of the Executive Management is granted share options at a value equal to a maximum of 40% of the Executive Management's remuneration. If a member of the Executive Management is given notice of termination by the company and such termination is not due to breach on the part of the member of the Executive Management, such member is entitled to compensation corresponding to a maximum of two years' salary and pension contribution.

The Executive Management's and the Directors' remuneration is included in staff costs (see note 3) by:

Parent company financial statements
Notes

Note
1. Accounting policies Basis of preparation The parent company financial statements are presented in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (reporting class D enterprises) and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The accounting policies of the parent company are the same as those of the Group, however, with the addition of the policies described below. The Group's accounting policies are set out in note 1 to the financial statements on page 30. Other than as set out above, there have been no changes to the accounting policies relative to last year.
Cash flow statement No separate cash flow statement has been prepared for the parent company as per the exemption clause of section 86(4) of the Danish Financial Statements Act. The consolidated cash flow statement is set out on page 28.
Intangible assets Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful life, estimated at 10 years. This estimate was made on the basis of estimated useful lives of the other assets acquired in the transaction.
Financial assets In the parent company's financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are recognised according to the equity method. The share of the results of subsidiaries less unrealised intra-group gains is recognised in the parent company's income statement. Net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associates exceeding the dividend declared by such enterprises is recognised in equity as reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method.
With reference to section 11(3) of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the company has derogated from the rules of the Act as it has in previous years. Accordingly, actuarial gains and losses are not recognised in the income statement but directly in equity. The derogation from the Danish Financial Statements Act is considered to provide a true and fair view and is within the scope of the IFRS. The change had a positive effect on profit/loss for the year in the amount of DKK 4m (2013/14: DKK 27m). Equity at 30 September 2015 and 30 September 2014 was not affected by the derogation.
Tax The parent company is taxed jointly with its domestic subsidiaries. The jointly taxed Danish enterprises are covered by the Danish on-account tax scheme. Current tax for jointly taxed companies is recognised in each individual company.

The Coloplast story begins back in 1954. Elise Sørensen is a nurse. Her sister Thora has just had an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out in public, fearing that her stoma might leak. Listening to her sister's problems, Elise conceives the idea of the world's first adhesive ostomy bag. Based on Elise's idea, Aage Louis-Hansen created the ostomy bag. A bag that does not leak, giving Thora ­ and thousands of people like her ­ the chance to return to their normal life.
A simple solution with great significance.
Today, our business includes ostomy care, urology and continence care and wound and skin care. But our way of doing business still follows Elise's and Aage's example: we listen, we learn and we respond with products and services that make life easier for people with intimate healthcare needs.

Coloplast develops products and services that make life easier for people with very personal and private medical conditions. Working closely with the people who use our products, we create solutions that are sensitive to their special needs. We call this intimate healthcare. Our business includes ostomy care, urology and continence care and wound and skin care. We operate globally and employ more than 10,000 people.
