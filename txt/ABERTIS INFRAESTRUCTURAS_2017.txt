LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

01 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present you the Integrated Annual Report for the 2017 financial year. A report which, according to the requirements established in the current accountability regulations, contains financial and non-financial information that allow consolidating an integrated vision of the economic, environmental, social and good governance performance of our organization, thus meeting the expectations of our various stakeholders. The Integrated Annual Report and its annex have been prepared according to the main international standards on the matter and have been reviewed externally.
The results of our activity throughout the year 2017 reflect the good performance of the business, driven by the growth of traffic in our main markets. In turn, the increase of our stake in Sanef in France and A4 Holding in Italy together with the new Via Paulista concession granted to Arteris in Brazil and the agreement reached with the Argentine government for the extension of the concessions of Ausol and GCO, are elements that allow us to embrace the future with optimism. These operations contribute to the renewal of our concessions portfolio, with new additions that replace those that will end their journey in the coming years. A strategy focused on achieving stability in the generation of cash flow, which is necessary to achieve our commitment to generate value for our shareholders.
The behavior of the Abertis share throughout 2017 can be described as exceptional, in the strictest sense of the word. The announcement of the Takeover Offer made by Atlantia last May, and the subsequent competing offer announced by Hochtief in October reveal an unprecedented situation for our company.

The interest shown by these two business groups to achieve a controlling position in the shareholding of Abertis is an example of the attractiveness that our company has today, endorsing a track record of success that has allowed us to position ourselves as world leaders in the industry. This, together with the high liquidity of our stock market value, has allowed them to compose two offers that have had a very positive reception from the markets.
This situation has benefited our shareholders, who have seen the value of their shares increase by nearly 40% over the entire year. A return that is added to the total dividend of 80 cents per share for the year 2017, which the Board of Directors has agreed to propose to the General Shareholders' Meeting.
Since Abertis' inception in 2003, and until the end of 2017, the average annual return of the share was 10.28%, including stock market appreciation, bonus issues and dividend yield. Likewise, during the last five years the cumulative yield rose to 113% with an annual average of 16%, for a shareholder who had bought his or her shares on December 31, 2012 and did not sell them until December 31 of 2017.
In the area of corporate governance, 2017 saw the incorporation as independent directors of Mr. Xavier Brossa Galofré and Mr. Antonio Viana-Baptista. With these appointments, ratified by the General Meeting in March, the Board has 9 independent directors or 60% of the total.

10 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

Also in this area, last October the Board of Directors agreed to the move our registered office. A temporary decision that seeks to protect the general interests of the company and its shareholders avoiding any uncertainty that could impact the current circumstances.
With respect to corporate social responsibility matters, Abertis has once again renewed its commitment with the United Nations Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals, known as the 2030 Agenda. In this sense, it has joined the initiative developed by the Spanish Network of the United Nations Global Compact to promote knowledge and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the business world.

day to provide a service of the highest quality to users through modern, safe and sustainable infrastructures.

Thank you very much.

Salvador Alemany Mas Chairman

Throughout 2017, work has continued on the development of specific CSR plans in each country and progress has been made to include the new activities and countries in the materiality analysis. Actions have been developed to promote eco-efficiency and the circular economy that will contribute to achieving the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and recovering construction waste. And, the objectives that we have set ourselves in terms of equal opportunities and diversity, as well as in the field of occupational health and safety, are equally ambitious.

I would also like to highlight the collaboration agreement signed with UNICEF to combat the main cause of death of school-age children, road accidents, offering children a safe journey to and from school. With this agreement, UNICEF recognizes our commitment to road safety and our program of campaigns adapted to the needs of the most vulnerable groups.

More and more agencies and entities are evaluating our compliance in economic, environmental, social and good governance matters. These external evaluations allow us to continue working permanently to improve the systemic performance of the organization, which has led us to remain in the main sustainability indices one more year.

To conclude, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I wish to thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in the work of the thousands of people who, from the companies that make up the Abertis group, strive every

02 LETTER FROM THE VICE-CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Dear shareholders,

2017 has been an important year for Abertis. On the one hand, in the last twelve months the Group has entered a new market -India- and has strengthened its position in the markets where it was already present -France, Italy and Brazil - with an investment in growth of about 3,700 million euros. On the other hand, the period of the 2015-2017 Strategic Plan has been successfully completed, and it is the result of a significant collective effort by the entire team of the Group.
2017, INVESTMENT AND GROWTH
Abertis has recorded double-digit growth in its main figures in 2017, closing the year with a net profit of nearly 900 million euros, and revenues that, for the first time in history, have exceeded 5,000 million euros.
These figures have been boosted by the improvement in the operating margin and also by the inclusion of the results of minority interests, following a broad participation purchase plan executed during the year.
Thus, in France, Abertis has assumed 100% control of Sanef (from 52% at the end of 2016); and in Italy, the company has increased its stake in A4Holding with the purchase of minority interests, from the initial 51.4% to more than 90% (until January 2018).
In the last 12 months, the Group has invested more than 3,700 million euros, allowing it to increase its concessional average life and consolidate its strategy of continuous investment in its network, and with an eye set on two clear objectives: road safety - through the Road Safety program - and the adaptation of our infrastructures to an increasingly digitized and interconnected world - through the Road Tech program - both of which are strategic for the Group.

2015-2017 STRATEGIC PLAN: FULFILLING OUR COMMITMENTS
The year 2017 is also special for Abertis since it closes the period linked to the 2015-2017 Strategic Plan which has been successfully completed, exceeding its commitments across its four strategic pillars: growth, focus, efficiencies and shareholder remuneration.
Between 2015 and 2017 Abertis has entered new countries with new subsidiaries, such as Emovis or Eurotoll, and through the purchase of new concessions in countries such as Italy, Brazil or India, consolidating its position as a world leader in the industry with a presence in 15 countries in Europe, America and Asia.
In turn, the company has completed its process of focusing on the toll road sector, which accounts for 100% of the business in the consolidated accounts of the Group.
In terms of efficiencies, Abertis has strengthened its efforts to search for synergies in our operations and among the Group's various companies. Three years later, our international subsidiaries stand out for their efficiency, their adaptation to the needs of the industry in their respective countries, and their management excellence, by leveraging and sharing the Group's know-how and best practices throughout the world.
Lastly, Abertis has continued to improve shareholder remuneration with an annual increase in remuneration of 10%.
Abertis' broad - international and institutional - shareholder base and the latest shareholding shifts are another example of the growing attraction offered by the Group's industrial and business project, which in 2017 was placed at the center of attention of the infrastructure sector in the world.

14 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

A TEAM COMMITTED TO THE PROJECT
At Abertis, we fulfill our commitments, and this is possible thanks to the daily collaborative effort of the entire team of the Group. Their commitment to the project, their enthusiasm for continuous improvement, their resolve before the day-to-day challenges, and their ability to adapt to change in a constantly-changing industrial environment have allowed us to meet all the objectives we had set ourselves more than three years ago today.

Today, Abertis has consolidated itself as the international leader in the toll road industry, a more internationalized, competitive, efficient, sustainable and attractive group for its employees, customers and shareholders. In short, a better company for society.
Thank you very much for trusting the entire Abertis team.

STRATEGY 25

04/02 INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

The toll road management industry offers several opportunities and poses a number of challenges of different nature that will have an impact on the future business prospects in the coming years.

OPPORTUNITIES

MOBILITY AS A SERVICE
Big data and the collaborative economy are driving mobility as a service, a new transport paradigm centered on the user. This new way of understanding mobility establishes a closer link between supply and demand, in which users seek the greatest efficiency in their travel decisions.
DIGITIZATION AND CONNECTIVITY
Road infrastructure should incorporate new digital components such as wireless networking technologies, digitization, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which will be vital for better managing the new generation of autonomous and connected vehicles.
NEW PAYMENT SYSTEMS
The demand for free-flow tolling systems is growing due to the advantages they bring through both the reduction in travel times and carbon emissions and the ease of payment.

ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT
Globally, the estimated infrastructure deficit is set in trillions of dollars, corresponding a significant part to road transport infrastructure. In the coming years, plenty of opportunities will arise both in new roads designing in developing markets such as India or Latin America, and in the upgrading of existing ones in mature markets such as Europe and the United States.
GENERATING FINANCIAL RESOURCES
There are multiple road transportation costs, including construction, maintenance, congestion and pollution. At a time when investment in infrastructure is paramount as a driver for economic growth, the private sector can contribute to the much-needed investments in infrastructure. The implementation of pay-per-use schemes in toll roads can be a way to transfer the risk of demand of infrastructure projects.

26 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

CHALLENGES
TRAFFIC GROWTH MANAGEMENT The increase in traffic (it is estimated that the number of vehicles in the world will grow 4 times by 2050) will pose important challenges such as pollution, congestion and other externalities on road safety and public health, imposting new ways of traffic management that seek a more sustainable, efficient and safe mobility.
EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION The uncertainty in the evolution of macroeconomic data and the collapse of prices of raw material along with other elements such as stalling investments and weak improvement of the productivity can contribute to discouraging consumption and road transportation.

INCREASING COMPETITION
In recent years, a number of new international players with interest in assets such as toll roads have appeared in the market. These are fundamentally infrastructure investment funds and pension funds. The current scenario, which is marked by low interest rates, have led these funds to increasingly invest in infrastructure assets due to their attractive profitability.
REGULATIONS AND LEGAL SECURITY
The majority of the Group's businesses are in the form of concessions, and thus, limited in time, based on agreements with governments, and carrying the duty to guarantee the concessional obligations and the investment commitments. The legal security that protects bilateral contracts is a cornerstone of the industry.
ADAPTING TO SOCIETY'S NEW EXPECTATIONS
Toll road clients and other stakeholders have new expectations that are related to services, customer care, new technologies, transparency and flexibility, among others.

INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 27

04/03 STRATEGIC PLAN
In 2017 Abertis has invested over 3,600 Mn in growth transactions.

GROWTH DEALS IN 2017

GROWTH IN THE EXISTING ASSET BASE
In 2017 Abertis gained control of 100% of the Holding d'Infraestructures de Transport (HIT) holding, a company controlling 100% of Sanef, after successive acquisitions of capital from the rest of the minority shareholders. Abertis has invested more than 2,200 million euros throughout the year in this process, which strengthens the Group's presence in its biggest market.
Abertis has also increased its stake in A4 Holding, its Italian subsidiary. The Group has closed agreements to acquire several minority interests until reaching close to 90% of the capital of the A4 and A31 toll roads concessionaire, which has been already completed in January 2018.
The Group has also strengthened its position in Brazil. In October, Arteris - a subsidiary of Abertis - signed the concession contract for Via Paulista in São Paulo. The concession was awarded by the State of São Paulo in April for a period of 30 years.
It is a concession totalling 720 kilometers, which includes 317 kilometers managed by Autovias (belonging to the Arteris Group) and other additional 401 kilometers, which, up to the time of the bidding process, were under direct management by the State of São Paulo.

With these operations, Abertis has achieved a greater balance of its global portfolio by growing in economies with stable concessional frameworks and a clear commitment to public-private partnerships in the toll road sector.
NEW ACQUISITIONS
In March, Abertis closed the agreement with the MSIIPL and SMIT funds, controlled by Macquarie and State Bank of India, for the acquisition of two of India's main toll roads, NH-44 and NH-45, for a total of 133 million euros.
After this deal, Abertis controls 100% of concessionaire Trichy Tollway Private Limited (TTPL), which manages the NH-45 toll road (State of Tamil Nadu), and 74% of Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL), which holds the concession of the NH-44 toll road (State of Talangana). These two toll roads are located in regions that are experiencing an economic growth that is above the average of the whole of India and both have GDP levels that are among the highest in the country.
This transaction, which represents the Group's entry into the Asian market, is an important step in Abertis' commitment to geographical diversification, with presence in an expanding continent and in one of the

28 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

countries with the highest potential growth in the world, reinforcing the Group's leadership and balancing its global exposure to different markets.
PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS
In January, Abertis' French subsidiary Sanef reached an agreement with the French Government for the implementation of a new investment plan for the upgrade of its network. Under the agreement, Sanef will invest 147 million euros in various projects in exchange for a rate increase of between 0.27% (Sanef) and 0.40% (Sapn) per year from 2019 to 2021.
This new plan will improve the French road network around four basic objectives: road safety, traffic flow, quality of service and environmental sustainability, while giving a new boost to the French economy through large-scale work aimed at promoting the activity and employment of the country's businesses network.
In August, Ausol, a subsidiary of the Abertis Group in Argentina, agreed with the Ministry of Transportation on new investments in its toll road network. This agreement contemplates an additional investment plan to improve the current road network for a total of US$430 million, which will be fully financed with future revenues of the concession thanks to the extension of the current contract, set to end in 2020, until the end of 2030.

CONTINUOUS SEARCH FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES
In 2017, the Abertis Business Development area analyzed more than 40 projects in 18 countries, of which seven projects have been successfully completed, enabling Abertis to consolidate its presence in countries where it already conducts business (France, Brazil, Italy and Argentina) and to gain access to new countries with high potential in the field of road concessions (India).
Without prejudice of the passivity duty due to the takeover offers on Abertis, the company keeps on working on a business-as-usual basis, and it is in a position to leverage all the opportunities that may arise.
Targeted markets
North America Western Europe Latin America
Australia India

Two months earlier, in mid-June of this year, the Group had reached a similar agreement with the Argentine Government regarding its other concessionaire in the country, Grupo Concesionario del Oeste S.A. (GCO), which also contemplates an investment plan of US$250 million and an extension of the concession term until the year 2030.

Abertis thus reinforces its commitment to public-private partnerships with the goal of achieving solutions aimed at creating future value for the territories through agreements with governments for new investments in exchange for extensions of the term of concessions or through rate increases.

In this sense, the Group has reached important agreements in the majority of countries where it operates, including Argentina, France, Italy, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico. In addition, the operation shows the Group's ability to grow its portfolio of existing assets, by increasing the average term of its concessions.

SHAREHOLDER REMUNERATION IN 2017
Delivering on the commitment established in the 2015-2017 Strategic Plan, the dividend per share has grown 10% in 2017.
With this policy of shareholder remuneration, Abertis will have distributed nearly 2,166 million euros in the 2015-2017 period in ordinary dividends alone.

04/04 STRATEGIC PROGRAMS
The Group's two strategic programs seek to respond to the main challenges of future mobility, such as road safety, congestion and pollution.

ROAD SAFETY

ROAD TECH

Abertis' Road Safety program builds on more than 60 years of knowledge and experience in toll road construction and management with the highest international standards.
The Group invests in smart technology and engineering to ensure that its customers have the best experience when traveling on our roads.
Abertis applies advanced construction and management practices and collaborates with reference institutions and organizations worldwide.

04/05 CSR MASTER PLAN
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy and the materiality analysis constitute the basis for the definition of the CSR Master Plan.

MASTER PLAN
The Board of Directors' CSR Committee is responsible for the follow-up and development of the CSR Master Plan, with the Corporation's CSR Department acting as the global coordinator; and the different business departments involved in all the activities and countries, acting as the operating parties.
· In 2017 the 2016-2020 CSR Master Plan was deployed internationally, with the goal of building action plans available in each country, that would centralize and deploy all actions related to the achievement of the different objectives set in the Master Plan.
· Work was undertaken for the progressive inclusion of Italy, India and Emovis in the existing CSR formal management processes, the initial result of which is their direct participation in the ESG (Environment, Social and Good Governance) accountability exercise.
· Abertis' CSR Department has conducted workshop sessions in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. The sessions have identified specific management and operational aspects that affect the deployment of actions related to the management of ESG impacts, as well as contextual facts that help explain and adapt the management approach of each of the aspects.
The development of the Road Tech and Road Safety strategic programs together with the deployment of the best corporate governance practices and the management of the rest of the environmental

and social aspects through the CSR Master Plan centralize the management approach of the material ESG aspects in connection with the organization's activities. The direct link with the Strategic Plan is formalized through the inclusion of shared monitoring indicators for both the Strategic Plan and the CSR Master Plan.
Data related to detailed performance by activity and country for each of the strategic objectives of the CSR Master Plan are detailed in the Annex linked to this report.
EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS
The frequency and significance of external evaluations of environmental, social and good governance matters have increased, as have their degree of systematization and procedure. This is partially due to the relevance and inclusion of the results in the decision-making process of the different stakeholders, including the investment and finance sector.
Participation in different evaluations has secured Abertis' continued presence, in different reference indices, such as the STOXX, MSCI and FTSE4Good families of the ESG indices. On the other hand, CDP has evaluated the performance of the organization and ranked it under the B category. After several years of Abertis' presence in the DJSI indices, the results obtained in the evaluation of 2017 have not allowed the company's maintenance in them.

CSR MASTER PLAN 35

STRATEGIC PILLARS AND OBJECTIVES

The CSR Master Plan is based on Human Rights as a prevention and risk management principle spanning the entire plan. This consists of four pillars and 13 strategic objectives that are deployed into 38

quantitative common objectives spanning the entire organization (the details about these objectives can be consulted in the Annex to this report).

2016-2020 CSR MASTER PLAN FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY

STRATEGIC PILLAR ASSESSMENT OF QUANTITATIVE GOALS FOLLOW-UP

Good governance, transparency and accountability

· The number of breaches of the code of ethics has increased in relation to the previous year, although the number of complaints has decreased.
· All claims have been addressed, with a positive trend with respect to compliance with the recommendations of the Code of Good Governance.
· Training in the code of ethics and prevention of corruption together with awareness-raising actions have continued to involve different stakeholders.
· The systematization of the supplier ESG evaluation is in the process of being implemented, although progress made in Brazil points to a significant increase in the tracking indicator in terms of the number of suppliers evaluated and approved according to CSR (applicable to the 4 pillars).
· We must continue with the deployment of actions for the inclusion of human right aspects in due diligence processes.

36 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

STRATEGIC PILLAR ASSESSMENT OF QUANTITATIVE GOALS FOLLOW-UP

Ecoefficiency

· Scopes 1 and 2 CO2e emissions have increased by 15% in absolute values and have decreased by 13% in relative values in according to revenue in relation to the base year (2015). The calculation methodology for scope 3 has been refined and will be shared for extensive use by the rest of the countries and activities. Actions are being carried out to manage the emissions of the company's own fleet of vehicles and vehicles transitting the toll roads. The assessment of energy management systematization to be conducted by the different activities and countries is pending.
· The usage percentage of electronic toll payment collection has exceeded 60% due to its extensive use in some countries. This objective will be reviewed next year in order to assess its modification.
· The development of products and services with positive ESG impacts is pending, which relate directly to the goal of favoring the use of less polluting vehicles and focusing further on construction waste management and related actions.

Integration with the community

· The number of projects and the volume of resources allocated to the relationships with the communities have remained constant, as has the volume of local purchases.
· All claims have been addressed and actions have been continued in terms of biodiversity enhancement. The identification of natural species is in the process of being systematized across the board, and the assessment of the services provided by ecosystems in relation to noise is still pending.

Safety and quality

· The number of road accidents has remained constant, although the number of fatalities has decreased in comparable terms. The increase in absolute terms results from the inclusion of India data. Accident and fatality rates have improved, although in the latter case India's incidence on the global figure does not reflect this improvement.
· All claims have been addressed, and road safety campaigns and related education and research projects have continued.
· Workplace accidents have evolved positively, and the number of health and safety training hours and other skills/ competence training hours has also increased.
· The trend towards gender balance is maintained, and work must continue to achieve equal pay.
· The number of people with functional disabilities has increased through direct contracting.

GOOD GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICES

Abertis follows a Corporate Governance policy of promoting diversity within its decision-making bodies. In recent years, the company has increased the number of independent directors, gender diversity and the diversity of geographical and industry origins of the members of its Board of Directors and its Committees.
In 2017, the Board of Directors approved the appointment of two new directors: Xavier Brossa Galofré and Antonio Viana-Baptista, as independent directors. These appointments have contributed to increase the percentage of independent members and broaden the international profile within the Board.
As of December 31, 2017, Abertis' Board of Directors has 9 independent directors, representing 60% of its members, thus in alignment with Corporate Governance best practices.

Commited to transparency, Abertis complies with Good Governance regulations applicable to listed companies and with most of the recommendations of the Code of Good Governance.
Of the 64 recommendations (58 of which apply), Abertis complies with 53. Furthermore, the Chairman reports to the General Shareholders Meeting on the compliance with these recommendations and provides justification in the case of the unfulfilled ones.

These guidelines of conduct are reflected in the Code of Ethics of the Abertis Group, a core code of the Group, whose principles are deployed in all the internal regulations. This Code of Ethics captures the principles and values that must guide the behavior of employees, as well as suppliers, customers, distributors, external professionals and representatives of governments.
The Group does not tolerate any act that is contrary to the Code of Ethics and formally and expressly condemns any form of corruption and its firm commitment to comply with the law. Any infringement carries penalties of a contractual nature for infringing employees, as well as sanctions of a commercial or administrative nature for the rest of the individuals who are part of the stakeholders.
The Ethics and Criminal Prevention Committees are entrusted with managing ethics and the criminal prevention model. The design, implementation and supervision of regulatory compliance processes and the rollout of the criminal prevention model are carried out by the Compliance functions of the Abertis Group. Abertis' Audit and Control Committee regularly monitors all complaints and irregularities arising in all Group companies.

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT 63

ETHICS CHANNEL

All Group companies, except Italy and India, have mechanisms for reporting irregularities of any kind that guarantee confidentiality in the investigation and the analysis of all communications received.
The corresponding Ethics and Criminal Prevention Committees are responsible for investigating and proposing solutions in the event of any

complaint or question regarding the Code of Ethics of the Abertis Group and / or its Local Codes of Ethics.
Abertis' ethics channel as well as the Group's Code of Ethics and Compliance standards are available at the company's website www.abertis.com.

Brazil Integrity Program In 2017 Arteris launched its Integrity Program (Compliance) with the aim of guaranteeing and promoting an ethical environment in the company, among its collaborators and third parties. The program is structured into five pillars that support the set of measures, instruments and responsibilities for preventing, detecting and extinguishing or mitigating potential risks. The launch of the program has been accompanied by an awareness campaign and mandatory training on the Arteris Code of Conduct.

COMPREHENSIVE RISK CONTROL

The members of the company's Government bodies commit to ensuring that all company-relevant risks are duly identified, appraised and prioritized. As well, they are commited to establish the mechanisms and basic principles required to achieve a level of risk that allows a sustainable growth of our share value and shareholder remuneration, protect the Group's reputation, promote good Corporate Governance practices and provide quality service in all infrastructures operated by the Group.
In 2017, the main materialized risks are those related to: political and social instability in some of the countries in which the Group operates

(mitigated by internationalization and geographical diversification), the persistence to restrict availability and the public and private financing terms of some countries (mitigated by strict financial discipline), damages as a result of adverse climatic conditions (mitigated by a corporate policy of insurance coverage and contingency plans), and the reduction of the average life of road concessions (mitigated through the achievement of new public-private agreements in most of the countries in which the
Group operates).

ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM

Through the Global Road Safety program, cross-functional teams from all disciplines and geographical locations work together in the Group to ensure road safety best practices are known and applied in all Abertis toll roads.
We work in interdisciplinary groups in all business units creating a single global vision for the Group, bringing together both the most operationsintensive units and those closest to the client, their environment and society in general.
We share this global vision with an ambition: reaching the zero fatalities goal on all Abertis roads, with 100% safe toll roads.

Abertis works on a vision of road safety that shares the values of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, which focuses on 5 pillars: Safe infrastructures, road safety management, safer vehicles, safer users and post-crash response.

As a result of this strategy, the main units of the Group have continuously improved their accident and fatality rates in recent years.

OPTIMAL SAFETY MANAGEMENT
Standardizing actions and training: In 2017 efforts were made to standardize best internal practices from across all of the Group's units in order to achieve a global vision on road safety.
­ Several documents began to be drafted in 2017 such as the White Paper on Tunnel Safety Strategy, the White Paper on the Quality Management System, and the White Paper on Crisis Management.
­ The Group has continued to promote employee training on road safety to ensure the best operation and maintenance through drills in most of the concessions, such as France, Spain or Chile.
· In Argentina, a special drill was conducted involving the transport of dangerous goods. The drill sequence consisted of a fuel spill from a bulk transport in the fuel pump sector, primary assistance, relevant notices in the face of imminent fire, evacuation and receiving the different representatives including the transfer of a wounded person.
For more information on safety training for Group employees please see the "Safety and Health" section.

AGREEMENT FOR A SAFER MOBILITY
The commitment to the road safety of our customers also drives us to look for partners whom we believe can add more value to our mission.
· A4 Holding (Italy) works in collaboration with Autovie Venete and CAV to offer integrated information to drivers in the north of the country. Thus, through a single source, it is possible to obtain realtime information of all the toll roads linking the north of Italy (from Brescia to Udine, Gorizia and Trieste, including the Mestre ring road (Venice)).
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACCIDENT PREDICTION SYSTEMS
· VíasChile works together with the Institute of Complex Systems of the University of Chile on an accident prediction model, which has obtained the COPSA Award in the Innovation category.
The project, which began 2 years ago, takes place along 2 kilometers of the Central toll road as a test, seeks to prevent risk situations and alert users promptly, leveraging many possibilities offered by real-time information collected by the toll road's electronic systems.

A first phase has enabled the identification of the variables that have an impact on the occurrence of accidents, and even predict 70% of occurrences. In 2017 we have worked on creating a software that allows sending the information to the toll road control center for processing,

Connected Citizens Program
In 2017 Abertis has signed a global agreement to join Waze's Connected Citizens Program, the pioneering social navigation application and mobile technology that offers free real-time traffic information, fed by the largest community of drivers in the world. Abertis thus becomes the first company to adhere to the program in seven countries: Spain, France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico.
Abertis uses the application as a sensor to understand traffic in real time as well as as another communication channel to inform its customers. The company receives anonymous information in real time directly from the source: the drivers.
On the other hand, users of the application obtain updated information from Abertis from the traffic management centers the Group has in each business unit, as well as the roadwork program information or information on other incidents that could affect travel.

with the aim of developing better actions geared at alerting users adequately and try to prevent accidents.
CONTINUOUS EVALUATION OF ALL ASPECTS OF ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT
­ Through its own management software that monitors both the state of the pavement and structures and retaining walls.
­ Through independent security controls: in addition to the internal control systems, the Abertis Group works with independent entities such as the iRAP Foundation (International Road Assessment Program), which carries out safety audits of roads.
IRAP is a non-profit institution based in the United Kingdom dedicated to saving lives on the road. They develop a scientific methodology and predictive tools recognized by higher-level institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, among others, with projects in more than 80 countries.
In 2017, Abertis has become the first private road operator to cooperate globally with iRAP. This methodology will allow Abertis to know the level of safety of its toll roads in a standardized and highly professional manner, identifying all areas of improvement that can help define the Group's future investment plans.
SAFER CARS
In 2017 the Group has seen its Road Tech and Road Safety strategic programs converge more and more, setting a trend toward using new technologies in the sector to enhance road safety. Advances in

autonomous driving, the increasing use of Big Data and the Internet of Things, or the collaborative economy, to name but a few factors, will undoubtedly have an effect on road safety. For this reason, Abertis participates in important international projects together with automobile companies to improve the safety of the cars of the future.
For more information about these and other projects, please see the "Road Tech" section.
POST-CRASH RESPONSE
The Group continues to work to offer the best possible solutions in the event of an accident. Our recent innovations include advanced intelligent transport systems and an application that automatically detects irregular situations in tunnels.
· EIn Chile, the fleet of emergency vehicles has been modernized with the new incorporation of electric motorcycles for paramedic personnel.
· In Argentina, it has been reached an agreement with the ambulance service provider to obtain data of each medical assistance given: time delay data and injury category (severity). This way, the Quality area produces statistical control charts, analyzes cases that are outside the control limits and takes improvement actions.

ROAD SAFETY 79

SAFER USERS
At Abertis, we not only focus on infrastructures, but also dedicate a special effort to our customers through studies and observatories to assess their driving habits with the goal to knowing them better, as well as through safe driving awareness campaigns.

Using a similar methodology, observations of toll road drivers' behavior are made through detailed observation and analysis in those sections of the network that, due to their characteristics, allow us to analyze behaviors and draw general conclusions. They focus on specific analysis factors such as speed, safety distances, lane occupation, use of the turn signal or use of the telephone behind the wheel.

DRIVING OBSERVATORY
In 2017, the Sanef Driving Observatory became internationalized. Thus, Autopistas (Spain), Arteris (Brazil), VíasChile (Chile), Metropistas (Puerto Rico) and Argentina (Ausol and GCO) have conducted Driving Observations in their respective territories.

By 2018, the Abertis Global Observatory will be launched, which will allow us to understand the global trends accross the world and the specific characteristics in each of our markets, with the aim of applying this knowledge to better adjust our awareness campaigns. The creation in Spain of an Observatory focusing on heavy vehicles is also planned for 2018.

MAIN FIGURES
In 2017, the positive evolution of traffic on the Group's toll roads continued, which continues to grow at a good pace in the company's main markets. The consistent levels of activity achieved in Spain, Chile and Italy stand out, as well as the continued growth in France and the change of trend in Brazil. India, a market that has joined the Group in 2017, has also experienced a significant growth in traffic. The negative evolution of the activity in Puerto Rico is mainly due to the impact of Hurricane Maria last September.

DIVIDEND

On April 3, 2017, the General Shareholders' Meeting of Abertis agreed to the distribution of a second and final payment of the 2016 dividend charged against available voluntary reserves of 0.37 euros gross per share, which became effective in April of 2017. In this way, the total 2016 dividend was 0.73 gross euros per share, representing 723 million euros and implies an increase of 10% over the total distributed amount against the results of the previous year.
The aforementioned Shareholders' Meeting agreed to offer shareholders the possibility to choose between receiving the second payment of the 2016 dividend of 0.37 euros gross per share in cash or through the awarding of shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. from shares held by the Company. 15.3% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. has opted to collect said dividend in the Company's own shares, which

has entailed the delivery of 2.9 million treasury shares representing 0.29% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.
The Board of Directors has agreed to propose to the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting the distribution of a second and final dividend payment for 2017 of 0.40 euros gross per share. With all of the above, considering the first dividend payment already distributed of also 0.40 / share, the total 2017 dividend will amount to 792.3 million euros, and represents an increase of 10% over the total distributed amount in 2016.
Thus, in compliance with the commitment established in the 2015-2017 Strategic Plan, shareholder remuneration has experienced an average increase of 10% per year in the period (specifically 10% in 2017, 11% in 2016 and 10% in 2015).

CLIMATE CHANGE
Abertis has formally identified the risks and opportunities arising from climate change and is currently in the process of conducting an economic assessment of the former as part of its corporate risk management framework and specific projects developed in this area.
The emissions derived from the use of the infrastructures, as well as the intensity related to liquid fuels and materials and energy used during maintenance and construction are some of the main sources of emissions related to the activity.
Annually, Abertis takes part in the climate change performance and management analysis conducted by the Carbon Disclosure Project, through the preparation of a detailed report on the management of risks and opportunities as well as details of its carbon footprint.
The calculation of the footprint, expressed in tons of CO2e, is a fundamental element for Abertis to determine which priority areas and processes the organization must focus on that require action, as well as to evaluate the advances taking place in response to actions implemented in the field of greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
In 2017, scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions were reduced by 13% relative to revenue with respect to 2016 in a non-constant perimeter. If an

estimate of the scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions is included from the new additions (India and Italy) in the year 2016, the evolution would represent an increase of 3.5%. Total emissions in relation to revenue have increased 16.6%.*

Of the total emissions of the Group in 2017, 86.3% of the contaminating emissions come from the vehicles that transit through its toll road network. In this sense, Abertis works to facilitate the circulation and implementation of more ecological, quieter and safer vehicles on its roads (see Road Tech section).

* The emissions included in the calculation of the carbon footprint are the following: scope 1 emissions: emissions derived from the direct consumption of fuels and refrigerant gases; scope 2 emissions: indirect emissions derived from electricity consumption; scope 3 emissions: other indirect emissions derived from the suppliers of the organization and from the use of the products and services provided by the organization (vehicles traveling on the included toll roads).

120 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

Likewise, with regard to the management of scope 1 and 2 emissions, different actions have been developed focused on contributing to the established overall emissions reduction target.
· In 2017, Autopistas obtained the environmental quality certification granted by the Generalitat de Catalunya, which recognizes Aucat's and Invicat's fleet of environmentally-friendly vehicles that contribute to ecoefficiency and sustainability. This action was developed as part of the deployment of the sustainable mobility plan formalized during the year.

· Among the measures implemented by Autopistas through its Electrical Maintenance Master Plan are the regulation of the lighting flux, the optimization of outdoor lighting or the renovation and installation of LED technology lamps.
· Photovoltaic panels, recycled material collection systems and a waste segregation center have been installed in Brazil.

ABERTIS ACADEMIC CHAIRS

Since 2003, Abertis and the Abertis Foundation have been promoting the creation of different academic chairs in collaboration with renowned universities and national and international academic institutions. Aware of the importance of working with the academic world to ensure social and economic progress, Abertis promotes training, research and the transfer of knowledge between University and Corporations.

The first Academic Chair was established in Spain together with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia - BarcelonaTec, and was subsequently followed by France (IFSTTAR-École des Ponts); Puerto Rico (University of Puerto Rico); Chile (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile) and Brazil (University of São Paulo). More recently, the Abertis-UPM Chair (Polytechnic University of Madrid) was also created.

1st Abertis Road Safety Award
The International Network of Abertis Academic Chairs has granted its first International Road Safety Award in 2017, which recognizes the best work among the winners of the national prizes of each Chair (Brazil, Chile, Spain, France and Puerto Rico). The award went to Dr. Hédi Hamdane, from the Aix-Marseille University (France). In his thesis, the author develops several road safety systems for vehicles to detect pedestrians and thus avoid impact. These systems analyze the trajectory of the vehicle by processing images with sensors; the emergency brake is activated whenever a pedestrian is detected in its path.

SOCIAL ACTION AND SPONSORSHIPS

2017 MILESTONES

CONTRACTING POLICY AND PROCEDURE

Abertis' supplier policy is based on the principles of competence, longterm relationship, adequate planning, efficiency and control. Abertis has several control mechanisms in place with the purpose of assuring adequate compliance with these principles and their traceability in order to revent certain risks. Said mechanisms combine committees and management tools that ensure that each and every contract is justified, that describe the implications resulting from not proceeding with them, and that verify their profitability.
The implemented supplier contracting process is electronic and includes a formal assessment and qualification process based on the risk levels associated with the supplier company.
Supplier involvement in the development of products and services with positive ESG (environmental, social and good governance) impacts is important, especially when they participate in activities related to road maintenance and construction. The objectives of the Master Plan in relation to external collaborators are present in the four strategic pillars of the plan, due to the cross-cutting impact they have on each of the aspects. In this sense, 100% of the tenders in 2017 have been formalized under environmental and social clauses (ESG).
The scope of the non-financial information and the main management procedures related to ESG aspects includes external collaborators, and performance in connection with the actions conducted a part of the life cycle of the organization's activity is reflected in the data presented.

The supplier management policy and the implemented contracting procedures establish, among other requirements, the qualification and evaluation of suppliers in matters pertaining to ESG. A formal system has been implemented in Brazil, Spain and Chile, through a joint evaluation tool that collects information on supplier performance and management in connection with different environmental, social and good governance aspects. Thus, it is possible to obtain an indicator of the performance of each supplier and establish a system of incentives for continuous improvement. In the rest of the countries, work is under way to integrate equivalent supplier evaluation procedures, although 100% of the critical suppliers have already been evaluated.
The ultimate goal is to ensure the standardization under common criteria in all countries and progressively increase the volume of purchases from these suppliers.
The increase in the number of evaluated suppliers according to CSR scoring in Brazil stands out, where the evaluation is a prerequisite to participate in the bidding processes. The good performance of this measure makes it a good case for replicability in other countries to encourage the increased participation of suppliers in this type of ESG performance evaluation exercises.

training and selection, among others. The overall remuneration ratio for women is 83.2%, a slightly higher percentage than the previous year.

The presence of women in executive and management positions has increased, thus consolidating a positive trend over time. Nevertheless, it is necessary to keep on working to guarantee the gender balance across all professional categories. All countries have regulations linked to equal opportunities, although only Spain imposes the obligation to prepare a specific equality plan in relation to the various management aspects surrounding this matter, in addition to remuneration, such as promotion,

Similarly, some countries have specific legislation on the hiring of functional-diverse people. Brazil, France and Spain require the hiring of a percentage of hiring of functional-diverse people, either workers, either directly or indirectly, through the use of alternative measures.

SUCCESSION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS

PROMOTION OF TALENT

In 2017, Abertis has started the implementation of its Succession Plan for both the Corporation and the subsidiaries. This plan allows to identify the successors of all critical positions at the company ("high potentials") and provide a global and cross-cutting vision to making the most of the organization's talent base.
The Succession Plan is already under way in most of the Group's business units. At present, the training needs of the so-called successors with respect to the responsibilities of the positions to which they are appointed are being analyzed.
Likewise, in 2017 work has continued on a development program for managers and key employees and specific training has been developed in the field of cultural competences as a result of the greater international and cultural diversity conforming the Group's employee base.
· In 2017 the HR Standards were created, a tool that helps streamline the development objectives and the improvement of the Human Resources departments of all business units.

Talent promotion and retention are the main elements that make up Abertis' professional development policy. Therefore, committing to this talent base is a fundamental pillar of our people management policy. One of the Group's strategic objectives is to ensure that at least 75% of the executives and managers vacancies are filled by internal candidates.
Proof of this is the importance that the company gives to people development initiatives, such as the Abantis program, designed for the executive development of high potential employees within the Group and which is now in its fourth edition, and the "Talent Development Program", both developed in collaboration with top business schools.
In the last five years, 39 executive positions have been renewed in the Group, 32% of the total number of Abertis executives. Ninety per cent of these new management positions have been filled by internal promotion via vertical or horizontal movements. In addition, more than 48% of employees who have gone through the Talent program are currently holding a leading position in the Group.
The Group has established a Management by Objectives system for the promotion of talent. Currently, 100% of the executives positions, 96.2% of managers (heads of department) and 60.3% of the remaining positions are under this performance evaluation system.

OPEN CULTURE

Abertis bases its business corporate culture on the basis of collective intelligence resulting from the sum of the intelligence of the entire team. The company has consolidated the so-called "Open Culture" through various programs:

Likewise, the Corporation has continued to work with different Open initiatives, such as the second edition of In Abertis, based on trust; the Nice to Meet You meetings; the Open Challenges or the Come In session dedicated to international intelligence presentations.

Open Circles: Participatory sessions to connect with the vision of the Corporation.
Come in!: Short presentations enabling direct and transparent access to knowledge about the organization's relevant issues and projects.

· In 2017 Sanef has completely renewed its corporate headquarters by adapting "open space" criteria. The company is studying the renovation of other corporate buildings with these same criteria. A4 Holding also plans to adapt its Verona offices to this new concept that seeks transparency, participation and teamwork.

Open Challenges: Participatory and voluntary projects. In 2017, the projects of the 5 teams have been approved. The most advanced one is the Innovation project that seeks the mobilization of 180 people of the corporation through a program consisting of several actions (6 in 2018).

· Autopistas has launched the Focus project on cultural transformation at the company, with initiatives such as a new intranet with access to all employees, a new workforce rotation policy that gives greater flexibility, and the implementation of process-based management.

Nice 2 Meet you: Short presentations about each department of the Corporation to promote greater knowledge in the various areas and a greater efficiency. In 2017, 5 units were submitted: Tax, Legal Counsel, Risk Control and Internal Audit, Engineering and Construction and Information and Technology Systems.

· In India, an inverse training program was launched whereby country employees were able to learn about the cultural differences between the Asian country and the rest of the countries of the Group.

HUMAN TEAM. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 139

KNOWLEDGE NETWORKS
To encourage the efficient use of this collective intelligence, Abertis has created the Connectis knowledge network, a space that allows people involved in the different phases of the operation to share knowledge and work collaboratively with the goal of implementing continuous improvement processes across the entire group.

· Vías (Chile) has conducted the "Yo opino (I give my opinion)" survey at the central offices, and it is planned to be rolled out in the toll roads.
CORPORATE VOLUNTEERING

Toll roads of Brazil, France, Spain, Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico are actively involved and, specifically, the areas of civil construction works, operations and exploitation, technology and information systems and procurement.
The initiatives identified in Connectis become projects that are implemented by the different activities and countries jointly, thus sharing good practices and the challenges encountered, from a broader perspective that enriches all stages of the project. This allows implementing continuous improvement processes across the entire Group using tools such as e-learning or webinars.

Abertis wants to encourage and support volunteering activities with the ...creation of the Abertis Infraestructuras and Abertis Foundation "Altruis Volunteer Program", through which its professionals can spontaneously donate part of their time, skills, knowledge and economic support to improve society.
This implies carrying out activities of a general interest that meet welfare, social services, civic action, educational, cultural, scientific, sports, health, development cooperation, environmental, defense of the social economy or research criteria oriented to that end, as well as development of associative life, the promotion of volunteering services or any other of similar nature at the national level.

WORK ENVIRONMENT
The Group periodically conducts work climate surveys to measure employee satisfaction and develop action plans focused on improving the well-being of the staff.
· In 2017, actions have been launched that focus on the analysis of the current performance evaluation processes and the promotion criteria for their revision and modification after the results of the work climate survey conducted among central services employees in 2016, which saw a participation of nearly 90%.
· Arteris (Brazil) has conducted the satisfaction survey as part of the Valor Carreira project, whose results have been satisfactory and an overall satisfaction rate of 80%.

In Brazil and through its Voluntários program, Arteris employees travel around the toll roads to locate homeless youth living near the infrastructures.
Among other corporate volunteering actions, Sanef workers in France give music lessons to small orchestras consisting of children without economic resources.
Likewise, VíasChile's landscaping professionals in Chile teach classes to women in prison to encourage their re-integration into the workplace. Also in VíasChile, as part of the "Construye tu Futuro (Build your Future)" plan, succeeded in helping more than 170 young people from highly socially vulnerable backgrounds in 2017 obtain state scholarships to pursue higher education careers. Thanks to this program, nearly 500 young people have gained access to technical and professional careers, with the support of tutors and volunteering collaborators of VíasChile.

Investment in training

Almost all countries have specific training plans aligned with the direct needs of collaborators and the achievement of the strategic objectives of the Group. Abertis has set the goal that, in the coming years, each employee of the Group will receive a minimum of one development action per year, thus increasing the average number of training hours per worker.

· Online Arteris University. The Arteris University was created in 2016 with the goal of sharing the knowledge about the business among internal collaborators, and promoting the professional development among talented company employees. In July 2017, the Arteris University was strengthened through the creation of the Arteris Online University and the Arteris Operations University.

· Autopistas has launched the CAMPUS platform with the aim of conducting online training through a platform available on the company's intranet. Due to the geographical dispersion of collaborators, it is a very useful tool that allows reaching out to the entire workforce simultaneously and offer regulatory-required training courses (health and safety, collective agreements and ISO certifications basically) and also required training applicable to the entire staff.

Arteris Online University: 31 published courses; 92% active collaborators in the network
Arteris Operations University: training for 362 collaborators; 54 courses completed.

aimed at preventing occupational risks. These committees have met on a total of 522 occasions, with the goal of addressing various issues such as training, safety activities, planning monitoring, investigation of events and coordination with contracted companies involving 25,924 employees.

The analysis of workplace risks, the deployment of preventive measures, training and the provision of specific equipment and the monitoring of performance indicators on a permanent basis are some of the actions included in the systems.
Likewise, 85% of the workforce is covered by a health and safety committee, which jointly between the workers and the organization, conduct a specific follow-up of the application plans and the measures

Workplace accidents have continued with a downward trend, as have the related rates, according to the established objective. Nevertheless, the potential incidence of India must be assessed as soon as the procedures and the safety culture are consolidated that allow to obtain related data. During the year 2017, one collaborator died in France due to an accident, and there were a total of 209 accidents among subcontractors, which are not included in the data analyzed in this report.

MAIN ACTIONS IN 2017

· Global Occupational Safety Program: Aligned with the Global Road Safety program, the Global Occupational Safety Program was launched in 2017 with the aim to work together as a Group to reduce accidents at work.
· Ongoing training: During 2017, 106,934 hours of Health and Safety training were completed at Group level (-27.1%).

· Global Corporate Challenge: Promotion of physical activity among Sanef employees. For 100 days, employees (divided into 7 teams) wore a pedometer to measure their physical activity. They competed symbolically between teams to see who had gone the furthest. The goal is to encourage employees to make progress, in particular by exceeding the 10,000 step per day threshold recommended by the WHO.

· Improved worker safety: In France, Sanef has driven actions such as the 9 golden rules of prevention and has completely banned the consumption of alcohol among its workers during corporate events, and has conducted several awareness actions as well.
· Implementation of the Workplace Risk Reduction Index (IRR) as a Strategic Objective of Arteris. In order to have available proactive measures to measure and monitor health and safety at work, the toll roads in Brazil have designed an index that relates the number of accidents that occur to the number of audits or prevention actions that have been developed, since a direct relationship between these two variables has been observed.

· Other actions performed: ­ Specific monitoring and control audits ­ Psycho-social evaluations ­ Procedures for continuous improvement ­ Workshops and awareness-raising activities.

Sanef's 9 golden rules of prevention
1. Remain aware and be concerned about safety 2. Comply with and enforce safety rules 3. Do not act with haste 4. Keep calm 5. Choose a safe route and do not run 6. Keep workspaces neat and clean 7. Control the vehicle and respect traffic laws 8. Make sure you have the necessary resources, carry/wear the right equipment and know the rules 9. Take care of the material and ensure its proper use

Stakeholders and materiality
The inclusion of the toll road activities in Italy and India together with the activity of Emovis, in addition to the exclusion of satellite telecommunications activity, represent the main changes with a significant impact on the area of stakeholders and materiality. In general terms, the organisation's stakeholders remain the same, although there have been some minor changes. The main changes will be delivered once an extensive materiality analysis of the new activities and countries is conducted, which will take place next year.

As regards the material aspects, there have been significant changes. Linked to the management of the toll roads, and the development of the connectivity (and the associated big data) of both vehicles and the infrastructure itself, the organisation has created a new business unit, Emovis, whose activity consists of developing products and services that allow connectivity potentialities to be harnessed to increase the positive effects of journeys and contribute towards the new ways mobility infrastructures operate, using an integrated approach.
The organisation may be involved in all stages of the project, or only in some, both those related to physical support, in which the involvement of suppliers is significant since no product with these characteristics is being produced, as well as those related to technological support, in which case a specific product is created, although this also involves the direct participation of suppliers. Equally important are the involvement in innovative traffic management projects and the non-intrusive classification of vehicles.

Products and services are provided in various countries, as detailed in the Integrated Annual Report, and can include all types of customers, organisations, users, and public administrations, although the value chain involved varies depending on each project. The complexity associated with the activity of Emovis will be analysed during the next financial year as part of a materiality updating process which will analyse the details of each of the various activities' value chains and the main environmental, social and governance impacts that are generated at each stage.
The toll roads in Italy, India and Spain, which are included in the scope, share an activity life cycle with the other existing toll roads, although there are some significant differences, particularly in India, when incorporating cultural factors associated with the country that differ from the situation in Spain and Italy. The lasts have a proven track record as regards the management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts, which includes direct involvement in a periodic ESG accountability process by Italy, which has also implemented various certified management systems. This situation is different from that in India, where the procedures are not systematic, and therefore it is necessary to work on creating an ESG culture. As well as the mobility services activity, the two new countries will be included in the updating of the materiality analysis, which will be performed during the next financial year.
Due to the interruption of the satellite telecommunications activity as explained in the Annual Accounts of the 2017 financial year, it has been excluded from the materiality scope and the CSR Master Plan.

CSR Master Plan
Implementation status
The strategy and outlooks for the future chapters of the 2017 IAR contain detailed information on the activities relating to the CSR Master Plan during 2017 and also track the progress as regards the objectives established in the Plan and the year's achievements.
The inclusion of content relating to the CSR Master Plan in the 2017 IAR should be noted as it increases the level of consolidation of the information and the synergies among the organisation's various strategic plans. As such the information in this annex mainly presents the breakdown of data by country for the various global indicators presented in the 2017 IAR.
The implementation of the action plans in each country and the updating of materiality constitute the main challenges for the coming financial year, together with the monitoring and formal measurement of the impact of the various projects executed. During 2017 specific action plans for each country were prepared, which included the implementation of work sessions in Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
Work must be continued to finish developing and consolidating a common monitoring system for the actions to be implemented so as to achieve the global objectives, and also to transversally incorporate the new material aspects relating to mobility services and to toll road activities in India into the CSR Plan and the related elements (materiality, life cycle, value chain, stakeholder mapping and reporting).
Furthermore, the advancement of CSR in the organisation and society in general should be highlighted, given that it is now 15 years since the publication of Abertis' first CSR report. The analysis and overview of this period continues to show how the implementation and integration of CSR in the organisation has increased in line with the development and formalisation of a way of understanding economic activity in the context of the systemic impact relationships that characterise complex systems, such as those involved in economic and social development.
This track record establishes a solid base for continuing to formalise and evaluate the environmental, social and governance achievements and integrate them with economic performance.

Area 1: Good governance, Transparency and Accountability
Organisational culture
The Compliance and Risk Management chapter of the 2017 IAR contains detailed information on the systems and procedures relating to the development of an organisational culture based on ethical principles. During 2017 a total of 211 complaints relating to the code of ethics were received, 83.9% of which were resolved, a higher percentage than the previous year. Of the complaints that were pending resolution in 2016, 49, 85.7% were resolved. Furthermore, 68.9% of the complaints resolved were dismissed, a lower percentage in relation to the previous year. Of the remainder, 68 cases in total, 19.6% were resolved through warnings, 6.8% through dismissals and 4.6% via other disciplinary measures. The number of total non-compliances increased in relation to the previous year, although some of those non-compliances are attributable to the 2016 financial year, thus having an impact on the variation of data.
Rejection of all forms of corruption
The corruption prevention policy of the Abertis Group applies to all its stakeholders, therefore it is extensive and available to the same, both actively and passively. Raising awareness and training with regards to preventing corruption within the Abertis Group is key and must endure systematically and recurrently in the actions and interrelations of the Group with its stakeholders. Actively, specific training sessions and awareness campaigns have been held in terms of preventing corruption in all countries, except for Italy and India, including members of the executive team and the different governance bodies of the Abertis Group.
Excellence in good governance
The corporate governance chapter of the 2017 IAR includes information about the organisation's governance bodies and the main actions of the year. The number of recommendations of the Code of good governance that were fulfilled slightly increased, and the percentage of independent advice reached 60% in 2017. In addition, the presence of women on the Board remained constant (40%) and best practices in other areas continued, as detailed in the Annual Corporate Governance report and the Annual report of payroll of members of the Board for the financial year. The existing complaint mechanisms continued to be active and as detailed in the 2017 IAR and in this annex, the different complaints were dealt with in their entirety. It is necessary to continue working on training and raising awareness about the incorporation of Human Rights aspects in the due diligence processes in compliance with that established in the CSR Master Plan.

The emissions from electrical energy consumption decreased by 1.3% in absolute values in relation to the previous year, which is a significant improvement due to the impact of the incorporation of India in the scope of the information whose electrical mix is more polluting than that seen in the rest of the countries included. This reduction was compensated by the increase in direct scope 1 emissions mainly due to the inclusion of information relating to the charging of refrigerant gases whose incidence is significant on the footprint (representing 7.7% of CO2 emissions for scope 1).
Furthermore, for scope 3, the emissions of all the vehicles driving on toll roads (including those that do not have a direct economic impact on the same) were incorporated, thus completing the scope of this category, which led to a direct increase in emissions of this category by 23.3% in relation to the previous financial year. Similarly, the increased consumption of materials and generation of waste linked to the major works carried out during the year has contributed to the total increase in the organisation's indirect emissions related to scope 3.

Electricity consumption decreased in almost all countries, therefore the total volume remained constant (the increased scope of the information from both Italy and India, and the central headquarters is of note).
Although the reductions are due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures, in Puerto Rico there was an interruption in electricity supplies due to Hurricane Maria, which had a direct impact on the consumption of electricity and liquid fuel of the generator equipment for the country's activities. Globally, electricity consumption in terms relative to turnover varied positively in relation to the previous year (-8.5%).

The average consumption of fuel for every million euros of turnover increased by 17.5% in relation to the previous year mainly due to the increase of consumption in Brazil and Chile, linked to investments

for infrastructure improvements. The substitution of electricity consumption for liquid fuels in Puerto Rico also had an impact on the global data.
The fleet of vehicles, consisting of a total of 3,216 vehicles of which 63.2% are cars and trucks, slightly varied in relation to the previous year (-6.9%) due to the reduction in the number of own fleet vehicles in Brazil.
Furthermore, the consumption of natural gas remained practically constant, with a certain increase due to the inclusion in the scope of the information from Italy and reduced consumption in France.

19.7% of water consumed comes from wells, a percentage slightly higher than that of the previous year due to the increased scope of the information showing Italy's high consumption of water from wells.
The total water consumption significantly decreased both in absolute terms and relative to turnover, due to the change of data from Chile. The relevance of this consumption for the activity of one of the toll roads in Chile has given rise to the implementation of tools for its reduction, which led to a clear improvement of consumption in relation to the previous year.

The carbon footprint calculation methodology that was updated during the previous year for the vehicles that use the toll roads has been consolidated this year. However, it will be shared among all the countries for the purpose of agreeing a common methodology that allows improvements to the vehicle fleet to be identified and which impacts on the emissions generated, at the same time as developing the technological developments described in the Safe and Innovative Infrastructures chapter of the 2017 IAR.
The toll roads in Spain have an advanced energy management system that involves the existence of a committee and explicit monitoring of consumption, as well a formal plan to reduce consumption and improve energy efficiency. The extension of these practices to the other countries as part of the implementation of the specific CSR action plans should be evaluated.

Innovation based on circular economy criteria

The bulk of the material consumption relates to construction and maintenance work of the infrastructure, both direct and indirect, and the majority of these materials are non-renewable. 12.7% of the materials consumed during 2017 were of recycled material, a higher percentage than that of the previous year, which needs to increase in order to achieve the objective established in the CSR Master Plan.

In addition to those materials, 417.8 tonnes of paper, 840.9 tonnes of de-icing fluid and 148,064 tonnes of topsoil were consumed. Globally, the annual consumption of materials increased in relation to previous years, due to the type and intensity of the work carried out during the period in different countries, particularly in France and Brazil. The specificity of tasks directly impact consumption, as has happened with the changes in the consumption of metal and paint linked to specific maintenance actions in Brazil.

Similarly, the most significant amount of waste generated by the organisation's activity is that linked to construction. 77.7% of the total non-hazardous waste relates to this category. The recovery objective is ambitious, so it is necessary to analyse the existing opportunities and potential alliances with other stakeholders to develop formal circles for the recovery of waste and its reuse as material. Throughout 2017, a total of 56,240.7 tonnes of that waste was recuperated in Spain and Puerto Rico.

As regards hazardous waste, wet sludge continues to be the most significant category (49.7% of the total hazardous waste generated), and relates to the treatment of the wastewater from the activity. For the most part, this is similar to domestic wastewater, although in some cases it requires specific treatment before being discharged due to the pollution load. During the year, the toll roads in Brazil, Argentina and Spain generated a total of 235,285.8 cubic metres of wastewater, which was duly treated before being discharged. Furthermore, 35,013.55 litres of hazardous substances were spilled as a result of accidents on the roads in Brazil and Spain, which were managed as hazardous waste by authorised waste managers.
The treatment methods vary depending on the type of waste and the authorised waste manager in charge of the process, within the context of the legislation in force as regards this matter in each country. 93.1% of non-hazardous waste and 93.2% of hazardous waste were treated.

Collaboration with suppliers is crucial when it comes to developing products and services with positive social and environmental impacts. The section on suppliers in the 2017 IAR describes the policies and procedures relating to supplier involvement in the management of the organisation's material environmental, social and governance impacts.
In addition to the evaluation and approval of suppliers, the inclusion of specific clauses relating to environmental, social and governance matters makes it possible to include these variables in the assessment and execution of the projects. All the tender processes included this type of clauses.

Area 3: Integrating into the community
Positive synergies with the local community
The Community chapter of the 2017 IAR presents the year's main activities as regards local community relations and social action and sponsorships, together with information on acquisition practices. Involvement with local community associations has remained constant in relation to the previous year since new data for the subsidiaries in India and Italy is not available. The total contribution to social action projects and sponsorships for the financial year was 6.3 million euros, (7.3 million including management costs), 6.3% higher than that of the previous year. Furthermore, the total number of projects stands at 315 initiatives, a shift which is also aligned with the quantitative objective of the CSR Master Plan. Therefore, we must work on conserving this trend and formalise the measurement of the impact of investments, both for society and for the organisation.

All complaints from the local community were addressed, and were mainly received through the customer care channels and the code of ethics reporting channel.
The Red Viva programme in Chile should also be noted as regards local community relations and stakeholder engagement, as should the development of formal complaint mechanisms. The development of infrastructure projects in Chile requires a social licence to operate, connected to both the relationship with public administrations and the relationship with the communities established in the territories where the work is performed. This licence requires the stakeholders' participation in and approval of the various infrastructure projects. Therefore, before developing new

intervention proposals, formal mapping of the stakeholders connected to the territory and the local community is performed, in which their expectations and needs are identified, so that they can be incorporated into both the design and the execution of the work associated with the development of the infrastructures. The methodology used includes four stages starting with early insertion, which involves social characterisation and involvement in the territory, followed by a socialisation stage that involves a consultation process and an environmental assessment, followed by a scouting stage and the formalisation of agreements. During these three stages, the Red Viva programme coordinates the territory liaison activities, thereby formalising a systematic procedure for direct relationships with the local community and the generation of positive social impacts from the activity. Once the work is completed and the new infrastructure is implemented, the Red Viva programme will maintain the relationships established in the initial stages.
Fostering and preserving natural capital
The Community chapter of the 2017 IAR contains information on the activities relating to the conservation of diversity around toll roads and the increase in natural capital. Most of the 1,418.3 kilometres that affect protected areas are concentrated in France, Brazil and Spain. The variation of the data in relation to the previous year is due, on the one hand, to the increased scope of the information, as the inclusion of Túnels in Spain has added a significant protected space; and on the other hand, to the change in value, since an error was detected in the units used in previous years when calculating the area involved, which in 2017 amounted to 6,144.8 hectares.

These spaces are inhabited by protected animal species included in international lists such as those promoted by the IUCN. Among the actions taken for their preservation, notable examples are fauna crossings and the installation of fencing to prevent them from being run over, as well as the awareness campaigns concerning domestic animals. During 2017, a total of 16,713 animals were run over, mainly concentrated in Brazil, Spain and Argentina.

Similarly, the compensatory planting of 127,500 plant species was carried out, mainly in Brazil, and air quality measurements were also taken in Argentina to ensure compliance with the legally established limits. In this regard, and linked to the monitoring of the air quality, the polluting emission values from the organisation's activity were estimated for the first time using its carbon footprint. The values shown below relate to scope 1 emissions linked to both facilities and transport and do not currently include scope 3, which relate to emissions from the vehicles that use the toll roads.

The number of kilometres of infrastructures and the activity of said infrastructures (measured in terms of ADT) enable a contextualised analysis of the data presented, data which is used to calculate the accident and mortality rates by country.

The total number of accidents for the year 2017 was 16,066, which represents an increase of 10.5% in relation to the previous year, mainly due to the inclusion of statistics from Italy and India and an increase in those from Chile, France and Spain. The breakdown of the number of deceased persons was parallel to that of accidents, except that globally the number of deceased persons decreased, although the increase in the total data in affected by the incidence of Italy and India.

The change occured in both men and women, being higher in women (-41.5%), and was due to improvements in Brazil, France, Chile and Argentina. The impact of new incorporations was low due to the reduced level of accidents in Italy and the unavailabliity of information in India.

The accident rates continued the positive trend initiated and significantly decreased in Brazil, France, Chile and Argentina, which had an impact on the global data which decreased by 44.7% in the case of the incidence rate, 27.7% in the frequency rate and 31.4% in severity rate. The total number of accidents involving subcontracted workers increased by 15% in relation to the previous year (246 accidents), mainly due to the variation in the figures from Brazil. The main reasons for accidents involving subcontracted individuals include falls on the same level, unsafe behaviour and reckless practices by road users, overexertion and contact with chemicals.

Fostering quality employment
The professional development section of the 2017 IAR describes the activities implemented in relation to talent retention, training and the measurement of job satisfaction.
During 2017, 2,484 new employees were hired, of which 53.2% were men and 51.4% were concentrated in Brazil, followed by France and Chile. The workforce distribution according to working hours remained constant, although the percentage of full-time workers generally increased for both men and women. The total number of temporary contracts formalised during the year amounted to 2,819, of which 59.9% related to women and were concentrated in Spain, Argentina, Chile and Brazil.

The turnover ratio increased in relation to the previous financial year mainly due to restructuring in Brazil, Chile and Argentina which involved an upward variation in the number of redundancies. The main reasons for turnover include unjustified absences in the case of dismissals and personal and professional improvements in the case of voluntary resignations. It should also be borne in mind that the permanent coverage of the road assistance services involves a high turnover of individuals in order to ensure said assistance, which is why the termination of contracts is not included in the turnover data.

Ensuring equal opportunities
Within the context of professional development, ensuring equal opportunities among the various groups that make up the organisation is one of the cornerstones for managing the human team, and the explicit non-discrimination policy contained in the organisation's code of ethics applies to all of its areas. The Human Team chapter of the 2017 IAR contains details on the management approach and actions implemented during the year.
Globally, the percentage of women in the various employee categories has continued to rise, although the total has remained constant, which is an indicator of a positive trend towards the objective established in the CSR Master Plan.

The number of people with parental leave decreased in relation to the previous financial year, an uneven variation in the case of men. The inclusion of people with functional diversity into the workforce has continued its positive trend, amounting to a total of 2% of the Brazilian workforce, 2.7% of the French workforce and 4% of the Spanish workforce. In this last case, the percentage includes both direct hiring and the use of alternative measures, as well as the purchase of goods and services from and donations to special employment centres and placement agencies.

Methodology and International Equivalences

Preparation methodology

The second edition of the Integrated Annual Report (IAR) relating to the 2017 financial year includes this annex as a comprehensive breakdown of certain non-financial data related to the monitoring of the CSR Master Plan, for which the preparation methodology is the same as that for the Integrated Annual Report.
The non-financial information contained in the Integrated Annual Report and the annex is prepared and presented following the guidelines set out in the standard for preparing the IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Committee) integrated reports, together with the methodology for preparing GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) sustainability reports and the policy for preparing the UN Global Compact (UNGC) Progress Reports.
A new consideration that should be highlighted is the entry into force of legislation on the publication of non-financial information, and therefore a table of equivalences related to the same has been added and the references to the new GRI standards already used for the first time last year have been updated. Furthermore, the methodology promoted by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) for the calculation and publication of the carbon footprint has been included.
The Integrated Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI comprehensive compliance option, which involves full application of the standards. Firstly, the IAR meets the following content definition principles established by the GRI in the Foundation standard (101):

Stakeholder engagement Sustainability context Materiality Completeness

·Continued involvement ·Materiality analysis
·Local-level data ·Global management approach
·Formal analysis ·Approval of matters
·Sufficient information ·Decision-making

The IAR also complies with the following principles for ensuring the quality of the content established by the GRI in the Foundation standard (101):

Balance Comparability, accuracy and reliability
Timeliness Clarity

·Performance for the year ·Neutral treatment
·Traceability and analysis ·External review
·Annual publication ·Ahead of time
·Information synthesis ·Conservation of structure

GRI SRS: 1021,-51602-54

General index GRI content index

ANNEX TO THE 2017 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT ­ MONITORING OF THE CSR MASTER PLAN 33
Scope of the information
The non-financial information includes the new toll road activities in India and Italy and Túnels in Spain, together with the central Emovis services in France and the exclusion of satellite telecommunications activities, amounting to 96.8% of the 2017 annual turnover. As it is the first year that non-financial accounts have been issued, there have been limitations with regard to the data for India and Italy, which have been specified in each case.
Calculation methodologies
The calculations performed and presented in the IAR and the annex meet the following standards:  GRI standards referenced in the content index.  ISO 14064-1:2012, based on "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard" and the criteria established in the "Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard" published in 2011 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and the CDSB methodology for calculating the carbon footprint.  London Benchmarking Group for quantifying the contribution to the community.
External review
According to the external review policy for performance data, the non-financial information included in the Integrated Annual Report and the annex have been verified by the same external auditor involved in the audit of the financial information, in accordance with the details specified in their report and the internationally applicable standards for nonfinancial information. Similarly, audit notes relating to the external review process have been detailed in the GRI content index. The annual review usually carried out by the GRI was not performed this year due to the related publication and documentation deadlines, which for the first time were the same for Annual Accounts as for the IAR, thus aspects of confidentiality of the information manifested did not allow for the conduct of this review.
Related documents
The global vision for financial, environmental, social and governance performance is included in the Integrated Annual Report, although both this annex and the organisation's other publications contain specific details that have been explained in the GRI content index, which allows the information to be expanded upon for those stakeholders who require it. These references have been specified and they relate to the following publications:
 2017 Consolidated Annual Accounts and Directors' Report (CAA)  2017 Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR)  2017 Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration (ARDR)  2017 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) questionnaire (the questionnaire relating to the 2016 financial year was
published during 2017). The pages indicated in the GRI content index refer firstly to the pages of the annex and then to the pages of the Integrated Annual Report (IAR) and the other publications.

the pay of the workforce of Hispasat to maintain the comparable perimeter). To calculate the ratio of pay the arithmetic mean of the wages and salaries, bonuses, incentives and other remunerations paid in the financial year of companies in Spain was carried out, as well as the equivalent average workforce of the companies. The figure for the highest paid person was calculated considering the total pay received in each financial year, without including life insurance premiums and contributions to pension funds or other long-term savings systems. [GRI SRS 102-38] e) The change in average pay in Spain with regard to 2016 was an increase of 5.09%, and the change in pay of the person who holds the position of Vice-Chairman and CEO was 1.3%. The changes correspond to total pay received, without considering contributions to life insurance and contributions to pension funds or other long-term savings systems.

Assurance notes
() Those indicators marked with the symbol  have been included in the verification process carried out, considering the omissions described in the table.
1) The information relating to contractors is partial and is subject to estimations, therefore it cannot be considered representative. The review consisted of the verification of the data completion process reported by the group's companies.
2) The 2017 materiality analysis was not updated with the incorporation of the companies of India, Italy or Emovis, as detailed in chapter 1 of the annex on "Stakeholders and materiality".
3) The emissions for scope 3 were calculated according to the methodology and estimations specified on page 38 of the Report Annex, in accordance with the information available. In said scope, the emissions corresponding to all the investments and purchase of products and services were not included.
4) Qualitatively reported. 5) Information estimated from the discharge capacity. 6) The verification of the types of waste was carried out based on the revision of the waste management reports, where the estimation of the type of waste managed is detailed. 7) The turnover rates do not consider seasonal contract completions. 8) Not broken down by region 9) It has not been verified that the information of contractors is integral. The review consisted of the verification of the data completion process of the group's companies. 10) Information verified through the communications received in the reporting channel. 11) The analysis limitations and participation of vendors in the poll/assessment processes do not allow for the extrapolation of the results to the organisation's entire supply
chain. 12) The Group's policy on contributions to political parties is reported.
