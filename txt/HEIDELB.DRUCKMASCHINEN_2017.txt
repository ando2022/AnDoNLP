of the total print volume, it also has the
greatest growth potential within the industry.

At just under 50%, the commercial printing market
for printed advertising materials is the largest market segment­ in terms of the global print production volume ­ and is enjoying stable development.

We categorize labels based on their usage: Variety of decorations thanks to
different APPLICATIONS: * )
-Self-adhesive -Wet-glue -Wrap-around -In-mould

-Monofoils

-Laminates -Shrink-sleeve -Peel-off ...

* ) The use of new, innovative materials is becoming increasingly important in terms of making a label stand out from the crowd

Innovative product decorations for a wide range of market segments:
- Food - Drink - Personal hygiene - Pharmaceutical - Industry - Household

The high level of demand for labels with unusual finishes and just-in-time delivery requires a new approach to production. Developed for maximum productivity and efficiency, our "end-to-end system" allows our customers to focus entirely on their own customers and on giving their products a label with a unique identity.

- Marketing: Target group-oriented advertising for the product, positioning vs. competitor products on the shelves
- Information: Legal information on ingredients, best-before date, manufacturer details
- Logistical function: Product tracking for retail
- Security function: Protection against confusion and theft - Technical function: Sealing, resealing, light protection

Asia is now the world's fastest-growing label market.
Between now and 2019, the Asian label market is expected to grow by 5.5%, while the forecast growth rate for self-adhesive labels is even higher at 6.3%.

­ The self-adhesive label ­
When people talk about labels, they often mean self-adhesive labels. Self-adhesive material was launched in the 1940s and has established itself as a classic in the field of product decoration. The combination of label and backing materials means the design options are countless, and they can now be customized, too. The Gallus Labelmaster makes it easy to design self-adhesive labels on demand ­ making it the ideal choice for producing personalized or limited-edition labels, including with special finishes, while maintaining a good price-performance ratio.
"It's the first digital printing press I've seen that can do exactly what I want it to do," says Thomas Dahbura, President of Hub Labels. "It integrates all of the necessary steps, from the roller to the finished label ­ whether digital or flexo printing, cold-foil printing or die-cutting ­ in a single pass." A real all-rounder, in other words.

Modular design

Inkjet Finishing: coating, printing laminating, die-cutting

Flexo/screen printing

The US-based company Hub Labels uses the Labelfire in highly competitive markets where labels need to look good, such as the rapidly growing craft beer segment or for specialty products like olive oil.

Dear Mr. Pomoznik,
A major pharmaceutical manufacturer was shown the Primefire at our print shop for a small run. Our customer was impressed and now wants us to produce its entire new over-the-counter (OTC) product range, DETOXlife. Security is an extremely important factor for the customer. As such, we require label solutions that enable Braille writing on plastic substrates in the familiar Heidelberg quality. We would also like labels for small vitamin shots that show whether the cold chain has been interrupted. Last but not least, we need to package a Detox Rescue vitamin tablet in blister packaging that complies with the corporate identity.
Sincerely

­ Security labels ­
The packaging of pharmaceutical products is enjoying above-average growth within the packaging market. Thanks to the growing share of non-prescription OTC (over-the-counter) products, vitamin compounds and food supplements, product decoration, i.e. the label, is also becoming increasingly important when it comes to pharmaceutical packaging.
Requirements in terms of preventing confusion and counterfeit products, the production conditions determined by the relevant guidelines, Braille writing, cold chain reliability: all of this requires corresponding production conditions and tools. Our end-to-end system meets these requirements optimally with machinery, consumables and services.

Braille writing? Not a problem, thanks to SCREENY!
Rotary screen printing units are integrated into the GALLUS printing presses ­ making them ideally suited for achieving a high degree of coverage, precise detail and color intensity. Screen printing also enables tactile printing like Braille for the blind. Coordinated printing systems, e.g. with screen printing, flexo printing and hot-foil stamping combined with various processing phases, serve to ensure reliable and economical label production.
This means it is easy for us to print a security label for food or medicine that clearly shows whether the cold chain has been interrupted.

­ The tubular laminate ­
When function and decoration need to be combined, the answer is often a laminate, also known as a composite material. Cosmetic products like toothpaste, shampoos and creams, and foodstuffs like tomato purée and juices are often packaged in tubular laminates or pouches 1) . For certain products, such as sun cream for example, long-life packaging and the demands of the environment in which it is used are important factors ­ meaning stringent technical requirements in terms of choosing the right substrate and the printing and finishing process. Additionally, the material costs are comparatively high for all laminates, making it important to reduce the level of wastage in processing.
And then there is always the question of design. A tubular laminate with metallic doming? A gold-colored pouch? Customers with demands like these have come to the right place ­ the Gallus RCS 430 makes it all possible! For small and large runs alike.
Anything else? Whatever the request, we combine modern materials like no-label look substrates 2) with a wide range of finishes, e.g. screen printing, cold-foil printing or metallic effects. For true beauty. Inside and out.

... and what happens once the tubular lami-
nates and pouches have

LM Re: Urgent ­ labels for exhaust gas treatment product
From: Labelmania
Hello,
Our customer is launching an exhaust gas treatment product for diesel engines in canister form for global retail. In addition to the large self-adhesive label, the customer needs an option for affixing the detailed ingredients in accordance with ISO 222 41 for the ultra-pure NOx reducing agent for compliance with the EURO 4, 5 and 6 emissions standards in a total of 20 languages. The solution must be space-efficient and also something that the consumer can retain, as a coupon collection campaign is being launched for market research purposes.
Do you have any ideas for how to produce a small booklet with this extensive content quickly and simply?
Regards Dieter Diesel Labelmania ­ The print shop for the automotive industry

Inbox
Dear Mr. Diesel,
We have the perfect solution for you. The content of the booklet can be printed using your SFO machine, with the large peel-off sticker printed using our Gallus Labelmaster with multi-web features. We will be happy to provide you with a detailed offer.
Sincerely

How it works:
Most engine manufacturers have opted for SCR catalytic converters in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulates and comply with the statutory requirements - which is where exhaust gas treatment products come in.

"No space"? No such thing!
Product information in multiple languages?
Information required by law?
Instructions for use?
No problem: it can all fit into a booklet. For any product. In any shape. And always with the right design.

Shapes
Booklets are available in every conceivable shape and size.

­ The label booklet ­
Packaging is getting smaller and smaller ­ but the volume of information is only getting bigger. What to do when it is no longer possible to fit everything onto a "conventional" label? Gutenberg himself would have been proud of the solution: a label booklet, i.e. a label consisting of a single-layer, folded "leaflet". It can be attached directly to the product using a base label.
Label booklets are available in every conceivable shape and size. They make consumers curious about the product and offer decorative space for important product information, promotions and competitions.
This makes them the ideal solution for food, pharmaceutical and industrial products, as they allow a lot of information to be provided in the smallest possible amount of space ­ e.g. for labeling liquids and ingredients. The legal requirements for packaging are complied with, and the labels meet all of the technical demands in terms of temperature stability and scratch resistance.

The monofoil label family, which includes IML, has enjoyed strong growth since around the end of the 1990s. The new "family members" include:

Wraparound labels

In-mold labels
Roll-on shrink-on labels

Shrinksleeve labels

Stretchsleeve labels

­ The in-mold label ­

The name speaks for itself: A printed label is placed into a mold that is shaped like an ice cream carton, for instance. The synthetic material polypropylene is then injected in molten form. It melds with the label and hardens in the mold, and the printed carton is complete!
Our rotary die-cutter XL 106 DD in combination with an XL 106 with LED UV helps to ensure that the product reaches the consumer even more quickly. It cuts everything into the perfect shape in the shortest possible time. Set-up takes just 15 minutes, the machine works far more quickly than any of its predecessors ­ and the tooling costs are significantly lower.

The tool is opened and the product can be removed.

The foil is placed into the open tool.

The tool is closed and the decorative foil is injected. Then everything is left to cool.

What makes the IML* unique? * In-mold label
Shape: The entire packaging is labeled using a single label. Time saving: The entire labeling process takes just one step. Print quality: The label is produced using top-quality offset printing. Flexibility: A combination of different materials, colors and coatings? No problem! Environmental protection: Label and packaging are fully recyclable.

That's why IML is becoming more popular: On average, the global market for IML is growing by around 4.3%. More than two-thirds of global production is required for food packaging.

What colors mean around the world
Some colors are perceived differently in the oriental countries than in Europe:
Green stands for prosperity and a better life. Brown communicates safety and security.

Blue is seen as a positive color in almost all parts of the world. In the oriental countries, doors and windows are often painted blue to attract the attention of good spirits and gods.
Orange is the color of freedom in the Netherlands. It represents the highest level of enlightenment in Buddhism and is the color of the Caribbean, samba and joyous encounters.

software for the perfect
­ wet-glue label ­
Looking to label a lot of products in a short space of time? In markets with large print runs, like mineral water, spirits, beer and wine, wet-glue is the dominant label type. The wines and spirits segments in particular, as well as lifestyle products, find themselves confronted with increasingly demanding requirements in terms of finishing.
Wet-glue may not sound like high-tech, but it is. And it has to be, as the labels serve multiple purposes when it comes to food in particular: Firstly, they need to comply with all of the relevant provisions of food law. Secondly, the material must meet the requirements for factors such as frost resistance. And thirdly, the labels have to look good and simply invite the consumer to enjoy the product inside.
The first impression counts! Consumers form a verdict within 7 seconds
of their first impression. And if the label is anything but perfect, customers simply won't pick up the product.

To our Investors
We made great progress in transforming Heidelberg into a digital company last year. As an end-to-end system provider of printing presses, consumables, software, consulting and services, we are actively shaping and pioneering digitalization in our industry. The strategic focus is on the requirements of our customers and the endeavor to generate value added in terms of efficiency, profitability and success in a dynamically changing world. We have brought together the necessary strategic pillars in the three core areas of technology leadership, digital transformation and operational excellence. We are consolidating our technology leadership by consistently digitalizing and integrating products to create a smart print shop. The connectivity of our systems and the opportunity to process performance data from our equipment in real time and upload it to the Heidelberg cloud gives rise to new capabilities, especially the development of performance benchmarks, process monitoring and the projection of service conditions and the consumption of printing materials. The overall process optimization achieved with our powerful equipment and software and data-processing expertise means that our systems are now able to print autonomously. In addition, we have rapidly expanded our digital printing press portfolio. The demand is extremely gratifying. For example, we are fully booked for the next two years with regard to digital packaging printing presses. We view our current expertise in data, intelligent autonomous printing presses, software and services as a basis for new, use-based payment models. With the launch of subscription models for the entire printing press lifecycle at the end of 2017, we successfully passed another milestone in Heidelberg's digital transformation. We are the only provider in our industry that offers its customers a full range of printing presses, services, consumables, consulting and software in an all-in contract. Under this model, the customer no longer pays for individual components on a one-off basis, but rather for the result, i.e. the printed sheet. The new business format guarantees constant revenue streams over the entire usage period. Data-based improvements to the capacity and productivity of this system provide significant growth potential for our customers, and therefore for us. We also want to grow in the field of e-commerce. At the end of 2017, we launched a center of competence for digital marketing and e-commerce with the Internet specialist iQ!, with which we intend to virtually triple sales via this channel over the next few years. In addition, our profitability is to be increased by operational excellence at all levels. This comprises a large number of measures to leverage efficiency and cost-cutting potential. The optimization of our logistics and production site and space consolidation, the standardization of printing press platforms, and the establishment of a new, leaner and more agile management organization are particularly notable. Heidelberg is on course to follow up its words with the corresponding actions. In reporting year 2017/ 2 018, we achieved the specified targets with consolidated sales of around 2.4 billion and an EBITDA margin of
2

Heidelberg on the Capital Markets

7.1 percent. Incoming orders were again on a par with the high level of the previous year. The foundation for the financing of our strategic realignment "Heidelberg goes digital!" is secured for the long term by the early refinancing of the syndicated credit facility and the further optimization of the capital structure. For the new financial year, we expect a moderate rise in the sales volume while the margin situation remains stable. However, the bulk of the growth potential defined by our digital agenda will not be realized until later years. We are accordingly confident in our medium-term targets. These envisage consolidated sales of around 3 billion and earnings after taxes of more than 100 million by 2022.
We would be delighted if you, dear shareholders, would remain loyal to us on this promising journey. The digital transformation continues to pick up speed.
Our thanks go to our employees for enabling the strategic enhancement pursued by Heidelberg in the first place with their tremendous commitment and loyalty. We would also like to thank our customers, suppliers and other business partners for their close and trusting cooperation.

SDAX

The Heidelberg share and the Heidelberg bonds
¬Heidelberg share outperforms both DAX and SDAX
with a price increase of around 30 percent
¬Heidelberg bonds were traded almost continuously at
over 100 percent
The Heidelberg share performed well in the 2017/2018 reporting year, with significant price gains in the first half of the year in particular. The price declined temporarily in the second half of the year, but recovered again towards the end of the year under review. The price of the Heidelberg share began the financial year at 2.32, climbed tangibly

until the beginning of May 2017, and then rallied again when the new corporate strategy was presented. The solid figures for the first quarter of the 2018 financial year caused the share price to continue to rise sharply to its highest level for the year of 3.58 on October 4. Virtually all mechanical engineering companies experienced profittaking in mid-October. This triggered a significant decline in prices, with the share falling to 2.78 by mid-December. It tracked sideways at around 2.90 in the weeks that followed. In early February, the price of the Heidelberg share fell again prior to the publication of the figures for the third quarter, at times reaching a low of 2.57. The price of Heidelberg's stock then continued to recover, trading at 3.04 on March 29, 2018, corresponding to a price increase of around 30 percent compared to the beginning of the financial year. The Heidelberg share clearly outperformed

the DAX, which fell by approximately two percent in the financial year 2017/2018. The rise in the price of the Heidelberg share was also significantly higher than the performance of the SDAX, which rose by more than 18 percent in the 2017/2018 reporting year.
Bondholders in the 2013 Heidelberg convertible bond converted around 95 percent of their units (60 million) into Heidelberg shares as of June 30, 2017. This reflects the capital market's renewed confidence in the future of Heidelberg and confirms our "Heidelberg goes digital!" strategy.
The development of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen's 2015 convertible bond mirrored that of the share. Thus, the bond also rose sharply in the first half of the financial year 2017/2018, reaching its high for the year of more than 130 percent on October 4. Like the Heidelberg share, the convertible bond also lost ground in November and settled at around 120 percent by the end of March.
By contrast, the performance of Heidelberg's 2015 corporate bond was much less volatile. It traded in excess of 100 percent throughout the financial year 2017/2018 and approached the redemption rate of 104 percent as the first call drew close.
Multiple corrections on German DAX benchmark index The German DAX benchmark index began the financial year 2017/2018 at around 12,250 points in April 2017. After an initially strong start, the DAX came under pressure as a result of geopolitical uncertainty, such as the North Korea conflict and the unpredictability of US President Trump's new course. It was also held back by the growing strength of the euro. The German benchmark index rose again at the start of September, achieving a high for the year of 13,479 points in November. The price increase was mainly driven by the good economic situation in Germany and low interest rates. In particular, the ECB's decision to keep the key interest rate at 0 percent and to halve future bond purchases while also extending its purchases to September 2018 gave the rally on the DAX a further boost. At the same time, the decision slowed the euro's appreciation against the dollar. There was a renewed price correction at the beginning of the 2018 calendar year, with the result that at times the DAX dipped below the key line of 12,000 points. Ultimately, the DAX was at 12,097 points as of March 31, and therefore down by around 2 percent compared to the beginning of the financial year.

Capital market communications: In constant dialog with private investors, institutional investors and analysts The aim of our investor and creditor relations activities is to present Heidelberg transparently on the capital markets in order to achieve an appropriate valuation for the Heidelberg share and bonds. For that purpose, we inform all stakeholders in an open and timely manner and set great store on not only publishing financial figures but also explaining them. This includes working continuously with financial analysts and rating agencies. Two more banks began covering the Heidelberg share in the reporting year. We are therefore now regularly rated by fourteen financial analysts.
The analysts' conference in June 2017 was held in Frankfurt/Main this year. It was also the first accounts press conference for the new Chief Executive Officer Rainer Hundsdörfer, who succeeded Dr.Gerold Linzbach. The new "Heidelberg goes digital!" corporate strategy was presented, and the Management Board set out a package of measures focusing on technology leadership, digital transformation and operational excellence.
In addition to the analyst and investor conference on the annual financial statements and regular conference calls on the publication of quarterly figures, our investor relations activities focus on constantly communicating with investors, analysts and other capital market participants at a number of international capital market conferences and roadshows. Our work was supplemented by a series of visits to our Company's production sites by investors and analysts. As well as one-on-ones and group discussions with the Management Board and the Investor Relations team, these visits also included tours of our production facilities and printing demonstration centers.
Contact with private investors is very important to us, which was reflected as in previous years by the events for private shareholders in cooperation with Schutzgemeinschaft der Kapitalanleger e.V. (SdK), Deutsche Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz e.V. (DSW) and regional banks. We presented Heidelberg's strategic "Heidelberg goes digital!" reorientation at four events in total.

BASIC INFORMATION ON THE GROUP
Business Model of the Group
Company profile
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft has been a reliable and highly innovative partner to the global printing industry for many years. For more than 160 years we have stood for quality and future viability. This means that we are a company with a long tradition, but at the same time we help define the future trends in our industry thanks to state-of-the-art technologies and innovative business ideas.
Our mission is to shape the digital future of our industry. We are aiming to develop Heidelberg into an end-toend digital system for industrial value added, assisting print shops in their own digital transformation.
But with everything that is new, the proven values are always retained. Customers are at the heart of our business, and our customer-centric approach is continually advanced. We have geared our portfolio towards the growth areas of our industry. It is based on products for prepress, printing and further processing, service, consumables and software solutions, with a strong focus on a digital future.
Also and above all, the potential resulting from combining individual product portfolio offerings to create an endto-end productive solution for customers must be leveraged to increase productivity and profitability for our customers and us. What we do ­ which is unique on the market ­ is to create a smart end-to-end system from a data-supported configuration of all equipment, consisting of machinery, software, service and consumables. We, too, share in the benefits this entails. With new digital business models, our interests are aligned with those of the customer. It is in our own interest to ensure that the customer succeeds.
Beyond the printing industry, we are also addressing new markets with our digital platform for industrial customers. For example, we have successfully joined the e-mobility market with our expertise in power electronics.
With a market share of more than 40 percent for sheetfed offset presses, we were able to consolidate our position as the printing industry's market and technology leader in

the current financial year as well. Consolidated sales amounted to around 2.4 billion in the 2017/2018 financial year.
Together with our sales partners, around 11,600 employees in total at 250 production sites in 170 countries around the globe ensure the implementation of our customers' requirements and our continuous development on the market.
Service network, sites and production
¬Service portfolio supports print shop performance ¬Focus on greater efficiency in the production network ¬Global production partner ¬China: Key production site and center of excellence
for customers from Asia
Around 85 percent of our sales are generated outside Germany. Our sales and service network spans the globe. In all key printing markets, we offer our customers high machine availability, guaranteed quality and on-time delivery directly or via partners.
A global service and sales network supports print shop performance The range of the global Heidelberg Service Organization is highly valued by our customers and is considered to be an engineering leader throughout the printing industry. Our service logistics network ensures that customers can enjoy a reliable supply of original Heidelberg service parts over the entire product life cycle. Customers can choose what they need from a range of 260,000 different service parts. We have around 130,000 service parts permanently in stock, meaning that, on a daily basis, we can fulfill 98 percent of incoming orders when they are received and dispatch the respective parts to any destination worldwide within 24 hours. We also use the network to supply customers with our consumables. The performance promise of our integrated logistics network supports our customers' performance around the world and ensures high machine availability and reliable quality.
Through strategic partnerships with logistics providers, we are constantly optimizing our logistics network.

Consolidated Management Report

The digitization of the entire print media industry is allowing most print shops to tap further efficiency potential. The innovative services offered by Heidelberg in the "Technical Services" and "Performance Services" categories also make an important contribution to this. For example, on the basis of 10,000 connected presses and a further 15,000 software systems, the Company has a very large and wellfounded database with which to serve its customers according to their exact requirements. The findings from this enable "Technical Services" to focus on planned service applications and "Performance Services" to focus on additional productivity increases and process optimization.
Big data is becoming smart data; the trend towards predictive services is therefore continuing. Heidelberg wants to use the benefits resulting from this for the good of its customers. Thus, Heidelberg is now offering its advanced and online-based service tool for preventive fault detection known as predictive monitoring (formerly Remote Monitoring). The Company is thereby highlighting the greater precision in the prediction of possible disruptions. With Predictive Monitoring, the technical condition of presses can be preventively monitored and analyzed at all times. Around 500 million data sets are generated per year for each press connected. These are then analyzed using algorithms which leads to a preventive action catalog. The goal is to identify possible faults early on and, if possible, to take care of them during the next scheduled servicing. Customers benefit from maximum press availability, reduced downtime and a more plannable production process.

Heidelberg production network: Focus on greater efficiency The Heidelberg production network covers seven countries spread across three continents. This constitutes a global network that is organized by families of components or by products. Our sheetfed offset machines are built at two production sites: In Wiesloch-Walldorf, Germany, we assemble highly automated and more specially configured high-tech printing presses in all our format classes based on customer requirements. In Qingpu near Shanghai in China, we produce high-quality preconfigured models. The latest Labelfire, Omnifire and Primefire digital printing systems are assembled at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site.
The Ludwigsburg production site manufactures individual parts and modules, and builds postpress machinery. The Amstetten site is the most important casting supplier for our production locations, and is continuing to expand industrial customer business as a limited liability company. Sales with industrial customers increased by around 24 percent. The primary production site for label printing systems is St.Gallen (Gallus) in Switzerland. The production areas of the St.Gallen, Langgöns and Ludwigsburg sites will be integrated into the network moving ahead, thereby further consolidating the production network. The US, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are home to our experts for specialty coatings and pressroom chemicals, while our specialist for business and automation software is also located in Belgium.
In manufacturing we focus on parts for which quality is a key factor and products that provide competitive benefits for us and our customers thanks to our specialization. We continually analyze costs and processes with a view to optimizing vertical integration.
Heidelberg is continuing the development of its production system with high intensity in order to realize enduring efficiency enhancements in the future as well. The next step of the reorganization of the production system is now to involve the administrative areas even more. Efficient process and project management are the main areas of the ongoing development in the lean administration environment.

A milestone was reached in the optimization of the assembly processes at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site at the end of 2017. The completion of the moMo (modular assembly) project was the final step towards flexible, efficient and therefore more cost-effective assembly. The activities of this project combined with the production system tools have resulted in a substantial concentration of the required assembly space while at the same time boosting flexibility.
In addition to the ongoing programs and optimization activities, an efficiency project affecting all divisions was launched at the start of the financial year 2016/2017 to further sustainably reduce manufacturing and process costs. The concept, with its special project workshops and the associated bundling of synergies from various functional areas, was new at Heidelberg. Product development, procurement, manufacturing, assembly, sales, service and controlling are just some of the most important functions. Efficient decision-making is a key component in reducing costs, whereby speed is the essential part of the process for achieving the goal of savings in the eight-figure range. The measures already implemented as of the end of the financial year 2017/2018 have so far led to consistent savings in the high seven figures.

China: Key production site and center of excellence for customers from Asia In total, Heidelberg has approximately 850 employees in China, some 500 of whom work in sales and service positions. This puts Heidelberg in a strong position to realize future growth opportunities in China and Asia and to further develop and secure its position on these markets. Two branches in Beijing and Hong Kong and three offices in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen serve to ensure comprehensive local customer care.
We have our own production site in China, which is one of our largest individual markets. The product portfolio manufactured in China is adjusted and expanded continuously to reflect the requirements of the Asian market. The Qingpu production site is fully integrated into Heidelberg's plant network. This means that all its processes and its quality are compliant with Heidelberg's uniform global quality standards even though the share of certified local suppliers is on the rise. The proverbial Heidelberg quality is now also known beyond China's borders, which was reflected in an export volume to other countries (Asia, Europe and the Americas) of some 11 percent of the total production volume.

Heidelberger Druckmaschinen as a global production partner As a result of rapidly increasing demand for individualized solutions for different markets, the scalability of the production process is necessary for external providers as well. Heidelberg was able to position itself as a partner in the production of high-precision 3D printing platforms for the flexible production of such new systems with its Smart Factory division. Heidelberg also completes the assembly of 3D printing platforms at its Wiesloch-Walldorf production site, documents their condition and delivers them on time to customers worldwide. To do this Heidelberg uses its View2Connect® collaboration tool, a cloud-based application for digital networking of today's process chains across Company boundaries.

Markets and customers
¬The market for printed products is transforming ¬Heidelberg is increasingly focusing on providing
end-to-end solutions over the entire life cycle of a press ­ data deliver value added
¬The print production volume is growing: Heidelberg
has the right solution
The market for printed products is transforming The worldwide print production volume has been at more than 400 billion annually for years. A figure of 427 billion is expected for 2022. Within this market, however, there are changes with interesting growth opportunities. While print volumes are continuing to grow overall in the emerging economies, print service providers in the industrialized nations are facing a highly dynamic and rapidly changing market environment. The increasing substitution of printed products and business stationery by the Internet and the impact of demographic change on the buying and reading habits of the population is leading to a decline in sales. This is partially being compensated by the increase in the finishing of printed products, above all in cosmetics and customization, as they raise the value of indi-

vidual printed products. This applies in particular to the market ­ which is growing overall ­ of packaging and label printing.
There are also technological changes. Two-thirds of the print volume is created using sheetfed offset, flexographic and digital printing processes, and the trend is rising. sheetfed offset printing accounts for around 40 percent of the printing volume, and is still the most frequently used printing technology. digital printing has steadily increased its share of the global printing volume to around 15 percent since 2000, and the trend towards customization means that it will continue to gain in importance, particularly in industrial applications. flexo printing, an important technology on the packaging market, continues to benefit from the stable and significant growth in packaging and labels, and holds a share of around 13 percent of global print volumes.
Across all areas of the printing industry, industrialization and digitization are driving structural change. While there used to be a balanced relationship between the three success factors of price or productivity benefits, print quality and customer proximity, these factors have changed over time and have favored the consolidation process in the printing industry. Productivity benefits can today be

achieved through the use of software and a higher level of automation. This increases capacity utilization and, ultimately, the overall effectiveness of the system. In addition, print quality has become less dependent on the operator and more on the system, and the high level of investment in state-of-the-art equipment leaves less and less potential for differentiation. Finally, the Internet has replaced customer proximity with globally transportable data. This goes hand in hand with increasing price competition, which in turn raises the pressure on productivity. Around the world, we are therefore seeing the global growth of ever-larger, usually international print media and packaging groups, coupled with a decline in small, more artisanal, but also medium-sized companies in particular. Shorter production times, workflow automation and the regular review and fine-tuning of cost efficiency are increasingly a part of day-to-day life for printing operations. In addition to the scaling of company sizes, a requirement for developing capacity utilization and productivity potential is the bundling of printing capacity and, above all, digitization, i.e. software-controlled process optimization. Thus, data analysis and interpretation are becoming more and more important ­ to us and to our customers ­ to be able to network the use of autonomous and interactive processes. For example, work steps can be spared by using optimized software-aided processes. This shortens production times, reduces susceptibility to errors and leads to lower production costs overall. Fully integrated systems make the production process predictable, and real-time data collection enables a continuous improvement process. This development is increasingly resulting in business innovations and new business models among our customers, which are repositioning themselves in various forms: moving away from being pure play copiers and towards being innovative and consulting service providers, or by also taking on upstream and downstream aspects of the value chain. For example, on the key market for packaging, a customer often not only prints folding boxes, but also handles card production and recycling, which gives that customer a competitive edge, particularly for food packaging, as it is in control of the quality of raw materials and can rule out

potential migration problems. To allow their services to stand out, print shops must therefore invest heavily in their own increasingly digital customer relationships. Digital marketing, an Internet presence and the digitization of ordering for print customers are increasingly becoming crucial success factors.
Heidelberg is increasingly focusing on providing end-to-end solutions over the entire life cycle of a press ­ data deliver value added Our mission is therefore to assist print shops in their digital transformation. So that our customers can concentrate on their business innovations or new business models in the future, we are increasingly using high levels of automation (such as with our push-to-stop philosophy) and the networking of a print shop to create a smart print shop. Since the end of 2017, we have also been offering "subscription models" (see "Strategy"), which are end-to-end solutions over the entire life cycle of a press, and are thus focusing even more on the digital future. The use of software will not just be the key to growth for the printing industry, but for Heidelberg as a leading provider of capital goods for the print media industry it will be the key to its transformation into a new digital business model that shares equally in the industrialization of its customers. A milestone on this path of digital transformation was the launch of the Heidelberg Assistant, a digitization solution that redefines the foundations of the customer-supplier relationship. We began to use the data at our disposal before others, in particular to optimize our service offerings and operations for customers. The Heidelberg Assistant provides our customers with data and information that enable them to smoothly manage their processes or the smart and efficient running of their print shop. For example, they receive a full overview of the service and maintenance status of their equipment, including data-based failure prediction. They can also access the industry's biggest knowledge base so as to fully leverage the potential of their entire value chain. Furthermore, access to big data performance analysis offers potential for further productivity enhancement.

Consolidated Management Report

The print production volume is growing: Heidelberg has the right solution Our new business models, such as our subscription plans, are based on our business area strategies for the packaging, commercial and label market segments. Here we are devising strategic approaches to create sustainable solutions, like the "smart print shop", for our customers. We are also strategically well positioned on our new markets outside the traditional printing industry.
Packaging market In total, around 25 percent of all printed materials are packaging. At the same time, the packaging market is the fastest growing market segment with average growth of around 3 percent. Packaging is a key element in the marketing mix and brand communication. Three seconds. That's how long it takes a consumer in a supermarket to decide to buy something. International brand companies, which put a lot of money into advertising and product staging, have the highest standards of quality: If there is even a tiny flaw on a single folding box, all the pallets delivered are returned to the packaging supplier. So there can be no errors in production. Heidelberg has the solution in "zero defect packaging": The greater the degree of automation, the data workflow and the more integrated inspections, the closer the print shop gets to claiming zero defects. The digital tools needed for this are provided by the Prinect software. Using assistance systems such as Intellistart, firms can link up their printing presses and color measurement and inspection systems to form smart systems that share data across all production steps. This results in an intelligently networked production environment that automatically checks actual values against the defined targets for each process step and monitors production quality. Packaging printers operating and producing internationally are facing another challenge as well. Brand manufacturers are increasingly developing new packaging

variants for each product, which is leading to greater product diversity and smaller print runs. We have something for that, too: Our Primefire digital printing press is the optimal solution for high-quality industrial packaging needed in small quantities and as quickly as possible. Even customized packaging is possible, which opens up new options for manufacturers of branded goods. Heidelberg's Primefire combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility and versatility of digital printing with the reliability and precision of offset printing. Based on market requirements, we will steadily expand our offering for this growth market.
Commercial printing market The commercial printing market for printed advertising materials such as flyers, brochures or calendars is the largest market segment with approximately 50 percent of the world's print production volume, and is enjoying a stable development. Printed advertising is facing tough competition from digital options. But it offers crucial advantages within the marketing mix: It attracts a lot of attention, because the "scroll speed" is significantly slower, and it is more credible and perfectly suited for advertising highquality products and conveying emotional messages. This market segment is also undergoing change: Online print shops especially are reporting high growth rates. The success of this business model for the production of individual printed materials in the sense of Industry 4.0 is based on three pillars: online sales, collective printing ­ where several print jobs are put on the same sheet and produced jointly ­ and fully integrated production from ordering to dispatch. Classic commercial printers are changing as well: While one variant of a supermarket advertising insert used to be printed per week, today there are several dozen due to the different offers available according to store size and the trend towards products from regional producers. Our answer to this is to increase productivity with our pushto-stop philosophy. For example, for order sequences with the same parameters for stocks and color assignment, as happens for collective printing or signature changes, even completely autonomous printing is possible.

Label market While the label market is one of the smallest markets with around 5 percent of the total print volume, it has the biggest growth opportunities in the printing industry on account of the high demand for exceptionally finished labels and just-in-time delivery. The digitally printed volume in label printing today accounts for around 32 percent, with this share growing at double-digit growth rates, in inkjet techniques in particular. Digital printing is therefore driving the change in this promising market segment. It is expected that almost every second press sold in this area will print digitally in the medium term. Heidelberg's answer for demand-driven digital printing is "Labelfire". By integrating conventional printing and finishing processes in addition to inline finishing, Labelfire allows label makers to print the finished label from a single file ­ using just a single printing press. There are virtually no manual touch points between the print file and the finished product. The result is less waste, lower costs, greater energy efficiency and shorter delivery times. For print shops that want to secure an extra competitive edge, the aspects of waste prevention and energy efficiency are not only costeffective, but also benefit their life cycle assessment.
New markets New markets refer to those areas outside the classic printing industry. Here, using our expertise from the areas of development, production, service and sales, we are attempting to develop new applications together with new potential customer groups and thus cultivate new markets. One example of this is our high-performance Wallbox for electric vehicles. The product is based on our comprehensive expertise in power electronics, and is already a proven success on the market with around 20,000 Wallboxes for electric cars from a premium manufacturer and more than 100,000 smart charging cables produced on behalf of a customer. But we are also using our smart factory as a global production partner for other sectors as well: By handling all aspects of industrialization and production, we give our industrial customers the necessary freedom to focus on

their core competence. Our industrial design, our foundry and end-to-end manufacturing ­ from prototype to small series and high volume serial solutions ­ are all at our customers' disposal, as are our expertise in bespoke control and power electronics and our assembly capabilities, from components and mechatronic equipment and presses to entire systems. The Heidelberg Digital Platforms segment offers companies outside the classic printing industry digital process support in product life cycle management. The segment thus combines the expertise of a world market leader in mechanical engineering with state-of-the-art IT in an Industry 4.0 setting. For this purpose, we have acquired docufy GmbH, based in Bamberg, Germany, a manufacturer of professional software solutions for technical documentation and the first provider of multilevel documentation. We therefore also have TopicPilot, a mobile publishing platform, at our disposal to round off our smart factory in terms of data mobility.

Segments and business units
In line with its internal reporting structure, the operating activities of the Heidelberg Group were divided into the following segments in the 2017/2018 financial year: Heidelberg Digital Technology, Heidelberg Digital Businessand Services and Heidelberg Financial Services. These are also the reportable segments in accordance with IFRS. Within the segments, Heidelberg is divided into business units (BUs). Each business unit formulates plans for how best to leverage the potential offered by its respective submarket. The production, sales and administration functions, which continue to be organized centrally, derive targets on the basis of these plans and implement them. This organizational approach allows us to define our strategies at the level of the respective submarkets while generating synergies within the functions and upholding the principle of "one face to the customer". Our sheetfed offset, flexo and digital printing press technologies are developed, produced and marketed by the corresponding business units. Finishing technologies for packaging and advertising are the responsibility of the Postpress business unit. The global provision of service capacity and service parts is coordi-

nated by the Service business unit, which has around 3,000 service employees and a global logistics system for service parts. The Consumables BU ensures that our customers around the world are supplied with consumables. Remarketed printing presses, mainly manufactured by Heidelberg, are traded in the Remarketed Equipment business unit. The Digital Solutions BU generates growth potential by expanding software business.

Strategy

Strategic agenda

Profitable growth through systematic implementation of digital agenda In the 2017/2018 reporting year, Heidelberg revealed and documented its path to sustainably profitable growth by publishing a digital agenda. The agenda is systematically built on the corporate strategy presented in the previous year with the slogan "Heidelberg goes digital!". As an endto-end system provider of printing presses, consumables, software and services, Heidelberg is actively shaping and pioneering digitization in the industry. The most important component on this path is the smart use of the data already available to Heidelberg through the digital connection and networking of customer equipment. The Company is focused on customer requirements and on generating value added in terms of efficiency, profitability and customer success. Heidelberg has encapsulated the strategic milestones in the three core areas of technology leadership, digital transformation and operational excellence, and it defined clear medium term goals for growth and profitability in the year under review.
Growth potential on our markets Heidelberg has developed value-based business models for the areas of sheetfed offset equipment, digital printing, service and consumables (see also "Markets and customers", pages 12 to 15) in order to efficiently tap growth potential. With a market share of more than 40 percent and a potential market volume of around 2.4 billion, we are already the undisputed market leader in sheetfed offset printing. By contrast, Heidelberg's share in digital printing ­ which has a market volume of around 2.5 billion ­ is still less than 5 percent. Our market share in consumables (market volume of around 8 billion per year) is only slightly higher at approximately 5 percent. Heidelberg anticipates major potential for expansion in both areas. This will be leveraged firstly by our positioning as the technology leader and secondly by offering new digital business models as a holistic solution in the life cycle of a printing press. With the acquisition of Fujifilm's coatings and press-

Growth through expansion of technology leadership By expanding its technology leadership, Heidelberg anticipates additional sales potential of around 200 million by 2022. To achieve this, we are developing, producing and marketing new technologies, new products and new business models. Around 5 percent of consolidated sales is channeled into research and development to expand our innovation leadership. With automation functions such as push-to-stop and the networking of printing presses, software, consumables and services to create a smart print shop, Heidelberg is a pioneer and digitization driver in offset printing. The networked presses serve as information providers (big data), which form the basis for digital business and therefore growth opportunities. The expansion of the software range is therefore one of the central pillars of our growth and digitization strategy. With our comprehensive Prinect production workflow, our management information systems for central operations management and the Heidelberg Assistant, which enables digital cooperation with the customer throughout the entire life cycle and assists in productivity enhancement with big data performance analysis, Heidelberg already has a digitization solution that redefines the foundations of the customer-supplier relationship. Heidelberg will further develop its software solutions towards creating a cloud-based subscription model.
We are the clear number one in industrial digital printing, and we will continue to expand this position. The series launch of the first Primefire 106 industrial digital packaging printing press took place as scheduled in early 2018. Demand is huge, and current production capacity is already fully booked for two years. For digitally printed packaging and labels as well, demand remains at a high level. We are forecasting annual growth of 4 percent in the global printing volume for self-adhesive labels, with only 6 percent printed digitally to date. As this share is growing at double-digit rates, we are excellently positioned with Gallus digital label printing presses ("Labelfire").

Digital transformation ­ participating in customer performance enhancement with subscription models The digital transformation is also focused on achieving the greatest possible efficiency and productivity by means of intelligent systems and autonomous processes, because we asked ourselves: "What are our customers really looking for? `Just' a printing press to print premium products, or an entire powerful and reliable system that helps them concentrate on their own customers ­ such as brand manufacturers ­ to give their products a unique identity with its label?" The foundation for this is once again Heidelberg's smart print shop, i.e. Heidelberg's unique strategic positioning as an end-to-end system across the customer's entire value chain and utilization phase. Heidelberg is the only provider in the industry that can offer its customers a full range of printing presses, services, consumables, consulting and software in an all-in contract. The customer's value added comes from the data-based, optimal interaction of all coordinated individual components, as this leads to a substantial enhancement in overall system effectiveness. Put simply, we deliver results and not individual products. Under digital business models, the objective for our sales and marketing work is therefore not individual deals, but rather the long-term success of our customers ­ because this benefits both us and our customers.
Accordingly, unlike under transactional business models, under a subscription contract the customer no longer pays for the individual components, but rather for the use of the performance product, as measured by the number of printed sheets. This is a logical consequence when products are offered as services. The first customer signed up for such a pay-per-use model at the end of 2017; five printing presses were already under contract by the end of March 2018. The new business format guarantees constant revenue streams over a long period, independently of volatile new machinery business and instead with a direct link to rising global print production volumes. Under this model, the greatest growth potential for Heidelberg mainly arises from additional sales of consumables, on which print shops spend around 8 billion per year. Over a five-year contract, the potential project sales can be increased by up to 70 percent compared to a one-time transaction. Thus, improved

19

Consolidated Management Report

purchasing benefits and rising economies of scale can also lead to higher margins. The goal is to have at least 30 contracts by the end of 2019 and then, after a soft ramp-up, as many as 100 contracts the following year.
But we also want to create value added for customers that do not take part in the subscription model. Using data from printing presses we can build an automated e-shop, which means networking our smart product to create a "product system" and at the same time switching from purely product sales to a service business. The printing press therefore automatically reorders depleted consumables and automates its own resupply. With this new revenue model, we intend to create a digital platform for the printing industry because we know exactly what our customers need and can deliver everything via our platform. Naturally, being able to always know how a product is being used also shifts the focus of the customer relationship, because rather than a sale ­ usually a one-time transaction ­ the crucial factor is maximizing value for the customer over a longer period. This likewise gives rise to new requirements and opportunities for sales and marketing. Heidelberg has therefore launched the Heidelberg Digital Unit, a new center of competence for digital marketing and e-commerce, which should, among other things, virtually triple e-commerce sales to around 300 million over the next few years. This will also be helped by our new digital customer interface, into which the Heidelberg e-shop has been integrated. To this end, the series launch of the "Heidelberg Assistant" took place in December, initially in Germany, the US, Canada and Switzerland. This enables us to serve customers digitally throughout the entire life cycle of their products. In total, Heidelberg expects these measures to generate an additional sales volume of at least 250 million by 2022.

Sales potential from new high-tech industrial applications Another key component of the digital transformation is the smart use of technologies that already exist within the Group for new business areas and product offerings. In this way, we intend to achieve additional sales of around 50 million per year by 2022 ­ by offering new digital platforms that will establish IT solutions for design, production and services for all aspects of high-tech applications for industrial customers. In the Heidelberg Industry area, for instance, we have extensive expertise in control and power electronics for industrial and e-mobility applications, for example as a supplier of high-performance Wallboxes and smart charging cables for electric vehicles or as an entrylevel product for consumers. Together with the Berlin tech start-up Big Rep, we have also developed an innovative large-format 3D printing solution that has been in series production since October 2017.
Operational excellence at all levels to increase productivity However, Heidelberg's strategic development does not end with the generation of additional sales potential; it is also concentrating on leveraging efficiency and cost-cutting potential of 50 million in total by no later than 2022. This comprises improvements in our logistics, the site and space consolidation and the standardization of printing press platforms. In order to adapt our corporate culture, and thus our management culture, to the challenges of modern, globalized and digital business, after determining our new strategic alignment, the Company's management structure was converted into a leaner, more efficient and more agile organization. The new management organization began at the start of the new financial year on April 1, 2018.

New organizational structure The new organization is more customer-centric, which means it is intended to create value added for customers. It was designed according to holistic solutions for customers, rather than individual products. Our smart products require continuous coordination across segment boundaries, as the customer journey extends from product development to cloud operation and the improvement of services to after-sales customer contact. Administrative functions in the sales and marketing units have been centralized and globally aligned, at the same time reducing the number of levels. Moving ahead, the different customer segments will be addressed with their own strategies and offers, and with one central face to the customer for all Heidelberg products and services. The businesses bundled in the previous segments Heidelberg Digital Technology (HDT) and Digital Business&Services (HDB) are being restructured into the Heidelberg Digital Technology and Heidelberg Lifecycle Solutions segments. The Heidelberg Financial Services segment will continue to exist unchanged.
Heidelberg Digital Technology: Global product portfolio and supply chain management The Heidelberg Digital Technology segment now comprises sheetfed offset business, label printing, print processing and digital printing. In addition to the responsibility this entails for the global product portfolio, including the strategic product roadmap, the core functions for the entire value process ­ i.e. research and development, procurement and production ­ are still located within this segment and given global mandates in their respective areas of responsibility.

Heidelberg Lifecycle Solutions: Value added over the entire life cycle The Heidelberg Lifecycle Solutions segment bundles life cycle business (Service, Consumables), Software Solutions and Heidelberg Platforms (offerings outside the print media industry). We create value added for customers here by addressing our customers' entire value chain with bespoke solutions and new business models.
The restructuring of the segments will affect both the organization and reporting of key performance indicators from April 1, 2018.
Focus still on medium-term targets In line with planning, the incipient series start-up of digital products and the establishment of the installed printing press base for the subscription model will at first deliver only small contributions to sales and earnings, before rising to tangible and significant increases in the medium term. Overall, we expect these strategic pillars to generate additional sales potential of at least 500 million by 2022. As a result, operating EBITDA is set to increase by approximately 100 million. We therefore defined new mediumterm targets for the next five years in 2017. Consolidated sales are to improve to around 3 billion with EBITDA rising to between 250 million and 300 million. With our financial result continuing to improve at the same time, we are aiming to pass the threshold of 100 million in post-tax earnings by 2022.

More detailed information on the development of these financial performance indicators can be found in the individual sections of the "Economic report" on pages 27 to 40 and in the "Future prospects" section on pages 52 and 53.

We have already achieved key strategic targets with the implementation of our digital agenda measures. Profitable growth is a core objective of this strategic orientation. In its management of the Group, the Management Board primarily uses key financial figures as the basis for its decisions. These control parameters are the main basis for the overall assessment of all issues and developments being assessed in the Group.
Most significant controlling performance indicators Our planning and management are mainly based on the sales and earnings development of the Group. In terms of operational financial performance measurement, the most significant key financial performance indicators relevant to control in addition to sales are the result of operating activities before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization without the result of restructuring (ebitda excluding the result of restructuring), the result after

Other financial and non-financial performance indicators Other key figures applied in operational financial performance measurement are primarily the result of operating activities before interest and taxes excluding the result of restructuring (ebit excluding the result of restructuring), net working capital in relation to sales and free cash flow. Moreover, we determine the return on capital employed (roce) for the Group. We are striving to sustainably increase our enterprise value after deducting capital costs, which we measure as economic value added (EVA). We have again improved this parameter in the year under review and, including the result of restructuring, have again covered our cost of capital. More information can be found in the "ROCE and value added" section on page 38.
In addition to financial key figures, the Management Board also uses non-financial performance indicators, particularly relating to quality assurance.

Partnerships
¬Partnerships and cooperations integrate expertise
and accelerate developments
¬Focus on digitization and industrialization in all
projects
¬Tapping new market potential
In the past, Heidelberg's unique position has allowed it to establish itself as a market and technology leader and preferred industry partner for worldwide cooperations at various levels. The resulting cooperations with companies that are likewise the leaders in their fields are paying off more and more. They are a key component of our strategy of becoming a digital company and a powerful engine for advancing our business. Cooperations help us to make our established activities more efficient and contribute to the faster cultivation of new market segments in defined growth areas and other sales regions. There is a focus on digital transformation in practically all projects. We combine our own innovative drive with that of our partners. This ensures the rapid integration of expertise and optimized resource management on both sides.
With the aim of establishing digital sales channels for Heidelberg sales organizations, at the start of 2018 Heidelberg launched the Heidelberg Digital Unit, its own center of competence for digital marketing and e-commerce. This will become the digital Internet service provider of our global sales organization. With the new unit we are placing Heidelberg's online content on an entirely new footing, including e-commerce, Web pages and the Group's Internet presence. For this purpose, Heidelberg was joined by a team from the Internet consulting company iq! special izing in the establishment of e-commerce business. iq!'s Internet specialists are thereby complementing our existing skillset in the fields of digital marketing and e-commerce.
In the period under review we significantly expanded or extended some of the partnerships that have already existed for many years. We will maintain this approach and continue to define key projects moving ahead to allow our customers to access new technologies and services and to strengthen our own business. As a solutions provider,

Heidelberg is always interested in attracting further cooperation partners to logically and efficiently supplement its portfolio.
As part of the ongoing digitization and industrialization of our industry, we see digital business as one of Heidelberg's most important growth paths. This is not just about digital printing, but also the integration of offset and digital printing systems into a continuous workflow that transparently connects customers, service providers and suppliers. To expand our share of this market further, we are investing in new business applications and cooperating with innovative partners who are the leaders in their respective segment. We are aiming to be the preferred partner in the industry.
We have a successful cooperation with Fujifilm, Japan, in digital printing. Intensive field trials in the past financial year show that the jointly developed digital printing system is the right solution for packaging manufacturers to offer new business models for the personalization and customization of packaging. Above all, pronounced expertise on the packaging market, outstanding color and print quality, in conjunction with the service promise and the reliability of the Heidelberg brand are key decision-making factors that lead customers to choose the Primefire 106. There is therefore a high level of interest from many packaging manufacturers around the world in examining the potential applications of Primefire technology for forwardlooking and innovative business models. As planned, series production started in 2018. Thanks to this strategic development project from two industry leaders, we are allowing users to try out new business models while at the same time opening up new market segments. We have already begun series production at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site of the digital label printing machine Gallus Labelfire, which was also developed in collaboration between Heidelberg, Fujifilm and Gallus.
Since the start of the partnership between Heidelberg and Ricoh in 2011, more than 1,000 users have already opted for a Versafire CP/CV digital printing system from the cooperation between the two companies for the economic and flexible production of small editions, including variable data printing. Using the Prinect Digital front-end developed by Heidelberg, systems can be completely integrated into the Prinect print shop workflow. Customers can therefore control digital and offset printing systems from a single workflow.

23

Consolidated Management Report

The strategic partnership between us and the Chinese Masterwork Machinery Co. (MK) in the field of further processing for packaging printing likewise continued to develop in the year under review. Since the start of the past financial year, Heidelberg has supplemented its range with three new products from its Chinese partner. The new Promatrix 106 FC die cutter with hot foil stamping, the new Promatrix 106 CSB with integrated blank separation and the new Diana Easy 115 folded box gluer together create a continuous workflow that shows how maximum process security can be achieved, and that fits seamlessly with Heidelberg's push-to-stop philosophy.
Heidelberg's development into a service company also requires cooperation with innovative providers in the field of services in order to promote digitization in this area as well. For example, we operate cloud-based service platforms with leading providers such as PTC and USU Software AG. Using big data analytics, we are now able to offer our customers new data-driven service products (smart services) to increase their competitive capability. With personalized access to the newly developed "Heidelberg Assistant" customer portal, customers can access important data and address their service requirements.

In the area of internal and external logistics, we are optimizing our processes and structures with various partners and reducing our costs. The logistics points in Asia and the Americas work together with the World Logistics Center in Wiesloch-Walldorf in a hub structure and are centrally managed from Germany. As part of an innovative logistics concept, we are working closely with LGI in Hall 11 at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site. LGI carries out a major part of production logistics tasks there. As part of our industrial customer business, we supply our automotive customers with electrical components just-in-time via their shipping partners.
In research and development, we share information with a number of partners in order to bring about new developments more quickly. We test new developments prior to their market launch in cooperation with selected customers. Our internal research projects are supplemented by partnerships with institutes and universities such as Darmstadt University of Technology, Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, the University of Wuppertal and the SID (Sächsisches Institut für die Druckindustrie). These activities are rounded off by our cooperation within and membership of associations such as the VDMA, the FGD and Fogra in addition to DIN/ISO committees.
Heidelberg Financial Services has been successfully supporting print shops in developing financing solutions for a number of years. We actively moderate between our customers and global financing partners. Tailored financing solutions are an essential element for our customers' success.

Research and Development
¬Further advances in digitization ­ autonomous

¬Launch of digital printing systems ­ Fire family
expanded further
¬Greater integration of digital and offset systems ¬New innovation center on schedule
Strong customer orientation characterizes the culture of innovation at Heidelberg. The expectations and requirements of our customers are constantly rising and changing at an ever faster rate. Short reaction times, flexibility, agility and reliability exactly in line with actual requirements are also key factors for a successful customer relationship from a development perspective. The digitization of the printing industry, in which processes are increasingly autonomous, and the further development of digital printing are the clear trends and key growth drivers in our industry. We have systematically geared our development strategy towards this, shaping and driving digital transformation and our digital road map, to ensure that our customers remain successful on the market moving ahead.
Focus on digital portfolio In the period under review we continued to expand our digital offering to realize our growth objectives. We are convinced that the requirements and demand in digital packaging printing in particular will change the market. Among brand companies especially, there is a growing need for additional and industrially produced packaging variants for a more individual approach to customers and a shorter time-to-market in order to be successful in the long term at the point of sale.
Heidelberg has successfully developed the Primefire 106 to market readiness. The first units have been installed at customers, and the product was launched on schedule at the start of the year. In particular, the system allows packaging printers to build new business areas, for example with the production of variable or even individual packaging, or by adding traceability and security elements to individual packaging. The needs-driven printing of small runs with Primefire 106 optimizes supply chain processes and helps to reduce storage costs.

We serve another field with the Gallus Labelfire 340. This product family allows our label printing customers to digitally produce small runs and individualized, high-quality labels industrially and economically.
We also presented a more advanced Versafire family in the year under review. In the Versafire EV (Electrophotography&Versatility), we offer a digital production system for both the entry-level target group and experienced digital printing providers, allowing them to further expand their digital business model through diversification and optimization.
Our Omnifire 1000 successfully went online at an automotive supplier for painting technology in October. There, Omnifire applies finishes to high-quality components for a range of automotive manufacturers, such as trim strips, switches, instrument panels and other finished components.
Integrating digital and offset printing Our Prinect workflow plays a key role. With Prinect, users can control and transparently manage their digital and offset printing workflow across locations and including customers and vendors using a centralized and integrated workflow system. This creates a fully automated and industrialized printing process. Digitization in the print media industry is also affecting the machine design of various systems. Especially for industrialized and therefore very powerful production systems, it is important that the operator always has an overview of all functions and the relevant processes. In addition, easy access to all control elements is crucial, and they should be designed so that physical exertion is reduced to a minimum while safety is increased to the maximum. Modern workstations on printing presses should also allow the user to fully utilize their potential and reduce operator errors ­ and the systems should also be an eye-catcher at the same time.
Our goal is therefore that customers and users can easily take advantage of the trends in digitization and thus become more successful in the long term.

Autonomous printing is the backbone of our digital subscription model Heidelberg is further developing its push-to-stop approach with the help of digitization. With this approach to the printing process, we have initiated a paradigm shift in industrial print production using sheetfed offset printing presses. While to date processes have been actively planned, launched and handled by operators, in the future this will be done by the press itself. The process, which runs from order creation through to logistics, is largely auton omous. An operator only intervenes in the process when something is not running completely smoothly. With this highly automated industrial solution, consisting of machine operation and our Prinect connection, we are advancing and securing the future viability of our core business. Our customers can therefore significantly increase their competitive capability and will have more time to take care of their own customers.
At the same time, the push-to-stop philosophy is the backbone of our new digital subscription offer. In many cases, the productivity promise made to subscription customers can be achieved or even surpassed by using push-tostop.

Relocation of the new innovation center in Wiesloch-Walldorf already underway Together with the Baden-Württemberg Minister for Science, Research and the Arts, Theresia Bauer, Heidelberg officially announced the launch of its new innovation center at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site in November 2016. The world's most state-of-the-art research facility for the printing industry will be completed by 2018, becoming home to around 1,000 workplaces.
The Company is setting benchmarks with its new innovation center, including as regards the architectural design in a former factory building. It will be the most significant center of excellence in the printing industry. The first employees and labs, such as component testing, have already moved into the new premises. The relocation from the previous research and development center in Heidelberg will be completed by the end of the 2018 calendar year. The official opening is planned for December 2018.
R&D in figures Currently around 8 percent of our workforce is employed in the area of research and development. We invested around 5 percent of our sales in research and development in the year under review. Heidelberg submitted a total of 81 new patent applications in the 2017/2018 financial year (previous year: 75). This means that Heidelberg's innovations and unique selling propositions are protected by around 3,240 active patents and patent applications worldwide.

Business Development
¬Sales volume virtually on a par with previous year
after adjusting for exchange rate effects
¬ EBITDA margin stable at 7.1 percent ¬Result before taxes up moderately; net result after
taxes down year-on-year at 14 million due to US tax reform
¬Leverage kept well below target of 2
Overall assessment of business development Heidelberg advanced and implemented its "Heidelberg goes digital!" strategy in all areas in the financial year 2017/2018: Its business structure and organization were adapted to the challenges of digitization, new business models were implemented, acquisitions were carried out in growth areas and new products were successfully launched both within and outside the print media industry.
At 2,420 million, sales virtually matched the previous year's level in the financial year 2017/2018 after adjusting for exchange rate effects. Essentially as a result of significant negative currency effects of around 72 million in total and the targeted reduction in remarketed equipment business of around 34 million, reported sales were down by around 4 percent as against the previous year.
Operating profitability, measured as the EBITDA margin excluding the result of restructuring, was within the target corridor at 7.1 percent. The segments Heidelberg Digital Technology and Heidelberg Digital Business and Services were within their forecast EBITDA ranges of 5 to 7 percent and 8 to 10 percent respectively.
The pre-tax result increased to 39 million in the reporting year (previous year: 34 million). Driven by the US tax reform, the net result after taxes was negatively impacted by deferred tax expenses of some 25 million reported by the US tax group. The non-cash write-down of

deferred tax assets reflects the cut in the US federal corporate income tax. The net result after taxes was therefore 14 million in the financial year 2017/2018 after 36 million in the previous year. Adjusted for this effect, the net result after taxes would have risen moderately as forecast.
Thanks to the operating result achieved and the lower net debt, as forecast we kept our leverage (net debt to EBITDA) well below the target of 2.
We continued to optimize our financing structure in the year under review. This has led to lower interest payments and an improved financial result. Our instruments and maturities are diversified and balanced.
Incoming orders on a par with previous year At 2,588 million, total incoming orders were stable yearon-year in the financial year 2017/2018 (previous year: 2,593 million); adjusted for negative currency effects (of around 81 million in total) they would have been up. Incoming orders in our key market China increased by more than 10 percent, while Germany and the US matched the previous year's level.
Sales down on previous year essentially on account of exchange rates Including significant negative currency translation effects of around 72 million, sales amounted to 2,420 million in the reporting year (previous year: 2,524 million). Sales were also affected by the targeted reduction of remarketed equipment business. Adjusted for these effects totaling more than 100 million, the sales volume was level with the previous year. Sales per employee (excluding trainees) were 209 thousand in the reporting year after 219 thousand in the previous year.
The order backlog was significantly higher than in the previous year (497 million) at around 604 million as of March 31, 2018.

At 172 million, EBITDA excluding the result of restructuring almost equaled the previous year's level (previous year: 179 million). The EBITDA margin excluding the restructuring result was around 7.1 percent regarding sales and thus in line with the previous year's level as expected.

Income statement: Moderate increase in result before taxes As a result of the lower sales volume, the Group's total operating performance decreased from 2,556 million in the previous year to 2,507 million in the year under review. As in the previous year, the ratio of cost of materials to total operating performance was around 45 percent. At around 35 percent, the staff cost ratio was slightly higher than the previous year's level (approximately 33 percent) on account of the rise in pay rates and working hours in Germany and the first-time consolidation of the companies acquired in the financial year).
Other operating expenses and income were down yearon-year at a net amount of 340 million (371 million) in the year under review. The restructuring result fell slightly from ­18 million in the previous year to ­16 million in the year under review.
Following the almost complete conversion of a convertible bond in the reporting period, the financial result benefited from lower interest expenses and amounted to ­48 million (previous year: ­56 million).
Thanks to the improved restructuring and financial result, the net result before taxes improved to 39 million (previous year: 34 million). The result after taxes was 14 million (previous year: 36 million) owing to the mentioned effects of the US tax reform.

Net Assets
¬Asset and net working capital management

¬Conversion of convertible bond reduces net
financial debt
¬Leverage below target of 2

We continued to make progress with the optimization of net working capital and reduced it to less than 30 percent of sales on average for the year. Thanks to the optimization of inventories, systematic cash management in terms of receivables and liabilities and an improved ratio between advance payments and the order backlog, committed capital was reduced further.

We again reduced our capital commitment through systematic asset and net working capital management. Net financial debt was reduced further. This enabled additional investment in the digital sector and in our new innovation center at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site.

Non-current assets climbed in the year under review, essentially as a result of property additions and construction work for our new innovation center. As in previous years, we used leasing as a form of financing when this made good business sense ­ particularly for vehicle fleets and IT.

Inventories were up year-on-year at around 622 million as of the end of the reporting period, essentially on account of the higher order backlog, the start of series production of industrial digital printing presses and a higher share of sheetfed offset presses in larger format ranges (previous year: 581 million). Trade receivables amounted to 370 million as of March 31 of the year under review (previous year: 375 million). We continued to successfully pursue our proven strategy of many years of arranging customer financing agreements with financing partners in the Heidelberg Financial Services segment. On account of direct financing granted, receivables from sales financing were higher than in the previous year as of March 31, 2018.

Equity and liabilities: Leverage remains below target figure of 2 On the equity and liabilities side, the Heidelberg Group's equity matched the previous year's level at 341 million as of March 31, 2018, and the equity ratio was therefore around 15 percent.

Pension provisions rose from 488 million in the previous year to 523 million as of March 31, 2018, essentially as a result of the lower interest rate for German pensions; provisions therefore fell to 878 million in total.
As a result of the almost complete conversion of a convertible bond, net debt was reduced to 236 million (March 31, 2017: 252 million) and is therefore still at a low level. At 1.4, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (leverage) was still significantly less than the target level of 2.
By the same stroke, financial liabilities declined to 438 million after 470 million as of March 31, 2017. Trade payables amounted to 237 million as of March 31, 2018, up on the previous year's figure of 190 million on account of the higher inventories.

Financial Position
¬Financing sources and maturities diversified and

¬Interest costs reduced ¬Stable liquidity framework, long-term security
We continued to optimize our financing structure in the year under review, and extended the existing syndicated credit facility with our banking consortium at better terms as of the end of the financial year. The sources of financing and the maturities of instruments are appropriately diversified.
Statement of cash flows: Clearly positive cash flow Cash flow was clearly positive and on a par with the previous year's level at 104 million. Other operating changes resulted in a net cash outflow of ­16 million. Thus, the

balance of cash flow and other operating changes was positive at 88 million (previous year: 139 million). Cash used in investing activities was ­95 million in the year under review. In particular, we invested in digital projects, corporate acquisitions and our new innovation center at the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site in the past financial year.
In total, free cash flow was therefore slightly negative in the year under review at ­8 million.
Financing structure: Further optimization of financing sources and maturities The pillars of our financing portfolio ­ capital market instruments (corporate bond and convertible bonds), the syndicated credit line plus other instruments and promotional loans ­ are well balanced. Net debt of 236 million is financed by our basic funding in the long term until 2023 and beyond.

In March 2018 Heidelberg extended its existing syndicated credit facility with its banking consortium at better terms. With an increased volume of 320 million and a term until March 2023, this affords Heidelberg financial flexibility and long-term planning security. In addition to the day-today operations of the global organization, this credit facility in particular will also provide strategic support for the further expansion of new digital business models, such as the newly established subscription business. The new framework also opens up the possibility of early repayment of portions of the corporate bond ­ thereby further reducing interest expenses ­ and advancing the digital transformation and growth with further strategic acquisitions.

With its range of instruments, Heidelberg currently has comfortable total credit facilities of around 760 million.
Thanks to the almost complete conversion of a convertible bond in the reporting period, the financial result already benefited from lower interest expenses in the financial year 2017/2018.
We supplement our financing with operating leases where economically appropriate. Other off-balance-sheet financing instruments do not have any significant influence on the economic position of the Group. Thus, Heidelberg continues to have a stable liquidity framework. In the future, we will continue to work on the diversification of sources and maturities in order to further reduce our interest expenses.

Heidelberg Digital Technology segment: Moderate increase in results At 1,315 million (previous year: 1,367 million), sales in the Heidelberg Digital Technology segment were below the previous year in the financial year 2017/2018. This was essentially due to the significant negative exchange rate effects. Nevertheless, incoming orders were still higher than in the previous year at 1,437 million (1,413 million).
The order backlog was 510 million as of the end of the reporting period and therefore significantly higher than the prior-year figure of 439 million.
The segment's EBITDA excluding the restructuring result was 75 million and its margin was around 6 percent, putting it within the target corridor of 5 to 7 percent and above the figure for the previous year. A restructuring result of ­9 million was recognized in the segment in the year under review. The Heidelberg Equipment segment had a total of 7,357 employees as of March 31, 2018 (previous year: 7,398). Investments in the segment amounted to 81 million in the year under review. In addition to replacement investments, we primarily invested in our new innovation center.

Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segment: Results influenced by series start-ups in digital printing The Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segment's sales were below the previous year's level (1,152 million) at 1,101 million. Incoming orders also declined slightly to 1,147 million (previous year: 1,176 million). In addition to the negative currency effects, this segment was impacted by the targeted reduction in remarketed equipment business of around 34 million.
EBITDA excluding the result of restructuring was 94 million (previous year: 103 million). The decline as against the previous year is essentially due to the series start-up of new digital printing products. Thus, the operating result of the segment, at around 8.5 percent, was also within the target corridor of 8 to 10 percent. A restructuring result of ­8 million was incurred in this segment. 
Investments in the Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segment were up year-on-year at 58 million and predominantly related to the expansion of our digital business and corporate acquisitions. With the acquisition of Fujifilm's coatings and pressroom chemicals business for the EMEA region and of the software provider docufy, Heidelberg has thus strengthened its position in key growth areas.

year 2017/2018 as a result of the granting of direct financing. The volume of counter-liabilities assumed decreased at the same time by 4 million to 17 million (previous year: 21 million).
The segment result (EBITDA) amounted to 3 million and was therefore lower than the previous year's result (6 million). This is due to lower interest income and a lower risk provisioning result. Overall, we generated a balanced risk provisioning result which, in addition to the relatively lower volume, was also significantly influenced by our consistent receivables management and the resulting decline in amounts past due. Thanks to the systematic implementation of our strategy in receivables and risk management, we were able to keep the loss ratio below the long-term average and thus make a positive contribution to earnings.

Heidelberg Financial Services segment: Customer financing delivers positive earnings contribution, cooperation with financing partners continues to reduce capital commitment In a capital-intensive sector like the printing industry, financing solutions are crucial to our customers' success. Heidelberg Financial Services has been successfully supporting print shops in implementing their planned investments for a number of years, primarily by means of its dense network of financing partners worldwide. We actively moderate between our customers and financing partners. Where required, we help our customers ­ especially in emerging economies ­ to acquire Heidelberg technologies via direct financing provided by one of our Groupowned print finance companies.
In addition, we successfully continued our long-standing cooperation with our financing partners in the past financial year. Against this backdrop, overall demand for new direct financing was low.
As expected, the decline in the volume of receivables in recent years was accompanied by lower interest income of 4 million (previous year: 5 million). As expected, our receivables from sales financing increased from 58 million in the previous year to 66 million in the financial

Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) In the year under review, we again achieved a minor increase in the order volume in the EMEA region from the previous year's 1,129 million ­ already a strong figure thanks to drupa ­ to 1,151 million. The markets of France and Italy contributed to this in particular. Germany's incoming orders were the same as in the previous year, though its sales were lower following the previous year's impressive performance after the trade show. The region's sales volume was on a par with the previous year (1,088 million) at 1,085 million. The UK saw a decline in sales due to the uncertainty of the forthcoming Brexit, though incoming orders were stable as of the end of the reporting year.

Asia/Pacific In the Asia/Pacific region, incoming orders at 671 million (previous year: 667 million) were marginally higher than in the previous year, while sales fell short of the previous year at 610 million (previous year: 646 million). However, half the negative currency effects were attributable to this region alone. Our key market of China reported increases in sales and incoming orders in particular, also as a result of the successful China Print trade show in May 2017. The sales volume on the Japanese market was lower than in the previous year, though there was a significant increase in orders. There were slight reductions in sales and incoming orders in Australia and New Zealand.
Eastern Europe With incoming orders of 262 million (previous year: 284 million), the Eastern Europe region was down year-on-year in the year under review. By contrast, there was an increase in sales to 265 million (previous year: 254 million). The Russian market continued to recover over the course of the financial year and increased both figures at a low level. The Turkish market likewise reported a minor increase in sales and a significant increase in incoming orders.

North America In the reporting year, the North America region was unable to maintain the previous year's high level in either incoming orders at 425 million (previous year: 440 million) or sales at 399 million (previous year: 453 million) ­ essentially on account of negative currency effects of around 30 million in incoming orders and around 27 million in sales. Canada reported a significant decline in both figures, while the US market's incoming orders were slightly higher than in the previous year at around 26 million despite significantly negative currency effects.
South America At 79 million, incoming orders in the South America region outperformed the previous year's level (73 million) and Brazil also increased its incoming orders. By contrast, sales in the region declined sharply from 83 million in the previous year to 62 million in the reporting year. Argentina, Chile and Venezuela in particular experienced a significant decrease in sales volumes on account of the persistently tense economic and political situation.

ROCE and Value Added
¬ ROCE on a par with previous year ¬Value added positive
roce stands for "Return On Capital Employed". This figure is calculated by comparing the result of operating activities excluding the result of restructuring plus net investment income to average capital employed. The cost of capital is determined using the weighted average cost of capital before taxes of Heidelberg of currently around 5.7 percent (previous year: 6.6 percent). Regardless of the slightly lower debt ratio, the cost of capital was reduced by nearly one percentage point. Overall, the cost of capital is around 13 percent lower than in the previous year at 59 million with similar average operating assets.

ROCE was clearly positive for the year under review at 101 million, thereby confirming the prior-year figures. Through active management of capital commitments, average restricted assets were again kept at a low level.
The low capital commitment largely benefited from the net working capital program and low receivables from sales financing (due to the ready availability of external financing partners). The net average operating assets are almost equal to the previous year's level (1,034 million) at 1,028 million.
ROCE as a percentage of average operating assets therefore changed from 10.2 percent in the previous year to 9.8 percent in the year under review and, with lower costs of capital, contributed positive value added of 42 million.

Employees
Motivated and qualified employees are Heidelberg's greatest asset. Against the backdrop of demographic change and rising digitization it is our objective to prepare our workforce for the future requirements of their rapidly changing work environment.
FIT project: New organizational and management structure In the past financial year, we performed intensive work as part of the FIT project on our new organizational and management structure. The introduction of the new corporate organization requires intensive support for the associated change process. The training of our key account sales organization is one of the most comprehensive challenges.
"Vocational training@Heidelberg": Digital future through young, flexible and motivated employees Training is a top priority at Heidelberg and it relies on premium quality. 99 young people began their training with Heidelberg on September 1, 2017. We provide training in 15 occupations at four locations and offer various bachelor programs in the areas of engineering, media and business.

HR development: Tailored and goal-oriented HR management and HR development are supporting the process of change through specific concepts for implementing our strategy in day-to-day management, running and moderating departmental workshops and the definition of qualification and strategy projects and their implementation. The portfolio comprises management training such as employee qualification, training offers and seminars, in addition to individual coaching and external qualification modules.
Heidelberg idea management: Joining in and thinking it through For 66 years, our employees have been getting involved in idea management to help save the company costs and thus keep it competitive. At 1,654, the flow of incoming ideas in the 2017/2018 reporting year maintained the level of the last three years. The savings achieved amounted to 3.3 million. The launch of the new idea management software has given ideas at Heidelberg a new platform; in the future they will be prioritized and processed more transparently and effectively.
Employees by region

"WIEfit": Strong interest in Wiesloch-Walldorf health center We opened our own health center ("WIEfit") on the grounds of the Wiesloch-Walldorf production site in April 2017. This health center is run by an external operator according to the latest physiotherapeutic knowledge. Around 400 employees are now working out here. The range of offerings is rounded off by prevention courses and health checks.
"Listening" as a guideline for the employee-supervisor dialogue With the annual employee-supervisor dialogue, we make the principle of listening, of promoting discussion, of formulating common goals and discussing supporting steps a firm fixture in the calendar. The focus here is jointly reflecting on cooperation, taking steps for the improved implementation of agreed goals and developing suitable concepts. Measurement against defined management criteria and the relationship to the individual value added is also an established practice for management. Our "Performance Leadership Evaluation" tool grants an overview of the management portfolio and the leadership qualities of senior management.

Sustainability
For Heidelberg, sustainability means combining long-term business success with ecological and social responsibility. Attention to sustainability aspects is part of the Group's environmental standards and our standards of conduct as they apply to our products, our production processes and our supply chain and as regards our interactions with each other and our partners. Compliance with standards of conduct and environmental standards is mandatory throughout the Group, and is set out in the Heidelberg Group's environmental policy and in our Code of Conduct, both of which can be found on the Heidelberg website.
Sustainability is a firm fixture of the Heidelberg Group's organization. Group-wide ecological goals and issues are defined by the Eco Council, which reports to the Management Board on sustainability and environmental issues, and whose members include a representative of the Eco Steering Committee and representatives from the

areas of Production, Digital Technologies, Product Development and Product Safety, Lifecycle Solutions (Service, Consumables), Quality, Investor Relations/Communications and Legal. The interdisciplinary Eco Steering Committee advises the Eco Council, proposes an environmental strategy and program, and oversees their implementation in the individual areas. Other committees and working groups focus on key subjects.
The content of our activities is defined by our environmental policy, which is geared towards raising awareness, conserving resources and resource efficiency, and reducing emissions. The Heidelberg Group's environmental policy can be found on the company's website: www. heidelberg.com/eco.

RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
As an internationally operating company, Heidelberg is exposed to macroeconomic, financial, industry and company-specific uncertainties and changes. We define risks and opportunities as possible future developments or events that can lead to a positive or negative deviation from planning, forecasts or targets. The early identification of risks and opportunities serves as the basis for the conscious handling of risks and the targeted exploitation of potential opportunities.
Risk and Opportunity Management System
Objectives and strategy The goal of Heidelberg's risk and opportunity management system is to enable both opportunity-oriented and riskaware action on the basis of a comprehensible and rulebased approach, in order to be able to increase enterprise value and to ensure its continuation as a going concern. Sustained business success requires the avoidance of risks to the Company's existence, the monitoring and active management of risks consciously taken and the optimal exploitation of opportunities. Furthermore, the objective is not just to comply with all regulatory requirements for the risk and opportunity management system, but also to establish a risk culture and to raise risk awareness in the Company as a whole.
Opportunities can arise both externally, for example through a change in the competitive environment, regulatory conditions and customer requirements, and internally, through innovation, the development of new products, quality improvement and the adjustment of the Company's own structures. Opportunities are therefore not exclusively identified by management or risk officers, but also by individual employees.
Structure and process Both Heidelberg's company-wide opportunity and risk management system and its internal control system (ICS), which, among others, serves as a basis for the Group accounting process, are based on the framework and guidelines provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Risk and opportunity management is solidly integrated as part of corporate planning at Heidelberg. The Management Board is responsible for appropriate risk and opportunity management in the Company. Clear values, principles and guidelines help the Management Board and the management operate and control the Group. The Company's guidelines and organizational instructions stipulate a structured process with which individual risks in the Group, general risk and any opportunities are systematically tracked, assessed and quantified.
The operating units and central divisions are incorporated in this process. The companies included in the risk management system are the same as those included in the consolidated financial statements. Information on risks is collected locally. The risk-significant areas of observation and the risk survey methodology are set out in the guidelines. The classification into risk categories is based on the potential impact on the net results and liquidity of the individual units. Reporting thresholds are set on a uniform basis. For all key areas such as Procurement, Development, Production, Human Resources, IT, Legal and Finance there is a risk officer who reports risks to central Group Risk Management (GRM) in a standardized form. Each risk officer is responsible for the identification, assessment, control and monitoring of risks within his or her area.
Risks reported to Group Risk Management are recorded in a risk catalog several times a year at Group level. GRM checks the completeness, identification and compilation of the top risks in cooperation with the Risk Committee and prepares the risk report.
The Risk Committee is an interdisciplinary body whose members work closely with GRM on the continuous improvement of the risk management process, and is required to regularly examine risks and opportunities from all angles ­ including non-quantifiable risks in particular. It consists of Management Board members and selected senior executives from various fields of business. It designs the risk catalog of the most significant risks and, among other things, determines the materiality thresholds for the reporting of risks. Based on the risk catalog, GRM prepares the risk report containing all material risks and submits this to the Management Board. The Management Board regularly reports to the Audit Committee or directly to the Supervisory Board on existing risks and their development.

41

Consolidated Management Report

In line with audit planning, the Internal Audit department checks risk and opportunity management procedures and the effectiveness of the ICS at process level. A representative for Internal Audit is a member of the Risk Committee. Finally, the Audit Committee also deals with the effectiveness of the ICS, the risk management system and the internal audit system, examines their functionality and arranges for regular reporting (in some cases from the directly responsible executives) on audit planning and findings.
Heidelberg's risk and opportunity management process comprises the elements of risk identification, assessment, control and monitoring (see diagram below).
Identification of risks and opportunities The Group-wide risk officers perform ongoing monitoring of the general economic environment, which contributes to the effective identification of risks and opportunities. Furthermore, GRM assists in the identification and categorization of risks and opportunities by preparing the risk catalog. The catalog and its potential risk areas are reviewed and, if necessary, updated several times a year.

Risk and opportunity identification is not limited to external risk factors, but also considers internal aspects such as internal processes and projects, IT, compliance and HR issues. The identification of risks and opportunities as early as possible is a priority in order to be able to promptly take any appropriate measures.
Assessment of risks and opportunities After risks and opportunities have been identified, they are assessed. All individual risks ascertained are assessed qualitatively and quantitatively, taking risk-mitigating activities into account (net analysis). If possible, the assessment is based on objective criteria or empirical evidence. Similar individual risks are combined as an aggregated risk. The risk assessment is based on the dimensions "probability of occurrence", "extent of damage" and "expected risk development in the planning period". For risks with a probability of occurrence of more than 50 percent ­ if so stipulated in IFRS standards ­ provisions are recognized or taken into account in the corporate planning on which forecasts are based.

The categories for the extent of damage are represented as a "possible loss" with quantitative figures in millions of euros, and also by the qualitative levels low, medium and high. The final assessment of a risk is made by grouping the risks on the basis of the two dimensions of the risk matrix. Thus, the risk as a whole is classified as low, medium or high.

An important factor in risk and opportunity assessment is the earliest period in which the Group's targets can be influenced. The occurrence of a risk can therefore affect the achievement of goals in the current financial year or also in subsequent financial years.

Controlling risks and opportunities Depending on the risk, suitable management strategies are defined in the course of risk controlling. General strategies for risk control are risk avoidance by not going ahead with an originally planned activity, risk mitigation with the aim of minimizing the probability of occurrence, or risk transfer with the aim of reducing the consequences of the occurrence of the risk and risk acceptance, in which the risk is deliberately taken. It is the task of every risk officer to take opportunities in his or her area and to devise and implement suitable risk-mitigating measures. The guideline for this is the Group Risk Management Policy, which sets out the principles for risk and opportunity management. The internal policy also stipulates responsibilities, risk categories and materiality limits.
Monitoring of risks and opportunities Regular risk monitoring allows the detection of changes in individual risks. Adjustments in risk management can therefore be promptly turned into the initiation of necessary measures. Within his or her own area, taking materiality limits into account, each risk manager is responsible for reporting all known risks to risk management periodically, or also to the Management Board on an ad hoc basis as necessary, and checking their completeness. In addition to complying with and implementing suitable countermeasures, risk officers are responsible for their own monitoring of risks and opportunities. This way, the developments in constantly changing risks and opportunities, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the current risk strategy, are continually examined and reviewed by risk officers.

Strategic risks and opportunities Political risks As a key factor influencing economic conditions, political risks can have a direct impact on Heidelberg's business activities and its financial position and performance. As a result of the trade policy decisions by the governments of some economies, economic risks have become more present again. In particular, the risk of an international trade conflict due to the protectionist measures by the United States and the associated negative effects on the global

economy has increased tangibly. Moreover, there is still a high level of uncertainty as to the nature of the future relationship between the European Union and the UK after Brexit, and what consequences this will have for our company. Sanctions already in place, such as those against Russia or other emerging economies, can have consequences for Germany's export-oriented economy. In addition, there are political risks due to persistent or rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including in connection with the scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal by the United States.
However, in its forecast and the planning on which the risk and opportunity report is based, Heidelberg assumes that the general conditions for free world trade will remain unchanged and the protectionist tendencies that can currently be observed will have no material effect.
Political risks are currently regarded as high.
Industry-specific risks and opportunities For the coming year, economists at the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) are forecasting that the general economic upswing from 2017 will continue at its current pace for mechanical engineering in 2018. For the print and media industry, however, Heidelberg expects a similarly challenging environment as in the past financial year, on account of the sector's ongoing industrialization, with the result that larger, mostly international print media service providers are growing in the industrialized countries and the number of medium and smaller print shops is shrinking. On the emerging markets ­ particularly in the Asia/Pacific region ­ we anticipate further growth in the printing volume, whereas in the industrialized nations we generally see a growing need for individualized and elaborately processed printed products. In view of the changes in the printing industry, in calculating our sector risk assessment we have taken into account the risk that planned sales and margin targets will not be met.
Against this background as well, in the year under review we began to establish Heidelberg's new digital business model to offer print shops further value added. Under this subscription model, the customer only pays for productive industrial performance, i.e. for the number of printed sheets. Under the classic business model, the customer buys the printing presses and pays separately for consumables or services. With the new digital business model, the price paid per sheet includes all the equipment, all necessary consumables and comprehensive service

44

geared to availability. The series start-up of the Primefire 106 in the 2018 calendar year will be another milestone for digital printing at Heidelberg. In addition, Heidelberg's proven push-to-stop operating philosophy allows its customers to significantly increase net productivity in industrial print production.
As part of the strategic reorientation launched in the 2016/2017 financial year, we see digital business as a key growth market for Heidelberg. Heidelberg will therefore also invest in new business applications in the future and cooperate with innovative partners who are the leaders in their respective segment.
Heidelberg sees itself not just as a provider of equipment, but also as a partner to our customers, offering a comprehensive service for effective and reliable production processes and easy access to necessary consumables. This is discussed in greater detail in the "Markets and customers" and "Partnerships" sections.
In our research and development activities, we always work in close cooperation with partners such as customers, suppliers, other companies and universities. This enables us to meet the requirements of our customers and markets in a targeted and comprehensive way. Partnerships also allow us to combine the innovative strength of our partners with our own in order to respond more quickly to current market conditions and reduce our product risks. Before we invest in possible new ventures, the risks and opportunities are weighed on the basis of various scenarios.
We then protect the results of our research and development work with our own property rights, thereby reducing risks in relation to research and development. Further information can be found in the "Research and Development" and "Partnerships" sections.
The development of key foreign currencies can also have a major impact on our competitive situation and thus directly on our sales volumes. For example, the current depreciation of the US dollar despite the Fed raising the interest rate leads to a competitive disadvantage for German companies. We are reducing the influence of exchange rate developments by carrying out procurement and production activities outside the euro area as well.
The collective agreement in the metalworking and electrical industry in February 2018 for a pay increase of 4.3%

and the end of the works agreement to reduce working hours per week mean that Heidelberg has to absorb these cost increases by improving its profitability. There is also a risk that price increases on the market, particularly for new machinery, may only be possible to a limited extent ­ especially given a strong euro. Furthermore, there could be synergies from possible business combinations between some market participants, which can lead to a rise in price pressure on account of the higher market share.
The risks arising from the market environment and competition are considered to be high.
Operational risks and opportunities Economic and market development risks In the business planning for the Digital Technology (HDT) and Lifecycle Solutions (HDLS) segments, we are assuming moderate growth in the global economy. Particular attention must be paid to the BRIC countries as the handling of the economic situation on these emerging markets constitutes a challenge. Above all, the economies of Brazil and Russia are recovering only at a slow rate. The economy in China in the period under review rose faster than in the previous year, but the speed of expansion is expected to diminish moving ahead. The contribution to the expansion of the global economy is likely to increase considerably as a result of growth in the industrialized countries.
If the global economy were to grow less than expected, or if key markets were to suffer an unexpected economic downturn, there is a risk that the planned sales performance will not be achieved, particularly in new machinery business (above all in the HDT segment). Heidelberg has implemented its digital business model to reduce the inherent risk of new machinery business. Under this model, the customer only pays for productive industrial performance, i.e. for the number of printed sheets. The Lifecycle Solutions segment is considerably less cyclical as it depends on the installed base and on the print production volume to a greater extent than on new machinery business. The share of total sales from less cyclical business with service and consumables has increased in recent years and thus economic fluctuations within the Group have been reduced.
A continuous improvement in key business processes and constant cost control are of essential importance for further increasing Heidelberg's profitability. Heidelberg is

45

Consolidated Management Report

of the opinion that the opportunities to further optimize cost structures within the Group have not yet been exhausted. The measures initiated by management to achieve operational excellence at Heidelberg were taken into account in planning as cost-reducing factors.
Overall, operational risks from the economy and the markets, including the planned cost reductions, are considered to be high.
Sales financing In sales financing business, there are risks of default on receivables due to industry, customer, residual value and country risks. The majority of the financing portfolio consists of receivables from customers located in emerging countries, particularly Brazil. As a result of the persistently weak economy, Heidelberg still has a relatively high share of overdue contracts in Brazil. However, these are monitored and managed very closely with intensive receivables management. The risks arising from counter-liabilities have diminished year-on-year. Overall, losses on sales financing were in line with the average level for previous years in the past financial year.
Furthermore, liquidity risks could arise for sales financing as the Company's own need for financing commitments could increase in the event of limited availability of third-party financing partners. These higher requirements would tie up the additional funds available to Heidelberg and raise the risk profile of sales financing.
Intensive cooperation with external financing partners has allowed Heidelberg to significantly scale back the financing it has taken on in recent years and keep it stable in the year under review. Moreover, internal financing is only made available following a comprehensive review that takes into account the customers' business model and credit rating. Sales financing commitments are regularly reviewed using internal rating processes. These (like the Basel standards) comprise both debtor-specific and transaction-specific components. Heidelberg operates a policy of risk provisioning that is appropriate for the business model

in sales financing. Appropriate risk provisions are recognized early on for discernible risks.
The risks from sales financing are currently considered to be medium.
Procurement risks Heidelberg is dependent on ensuring that its suppliers and service providers can deliver the required quality at all times. Risk management is therefore a fixed component of our supplier management. Heidelberg works closely with selected systems suppliers on a contractual basis and reduces risks relating to supplier defaults and late deliveries of components or low-quality components. It also works continuously to optimize its supply methods and procurement processes with key suppliers to ensure the reliable supply of parts and components of the highest quality. As Heidelberg generates around two-thirds of its sales outside the euro area, the option of global procurement is constantly being examined and expanded (natural hedging). We increased our procurement activities in foreign currency in the year under review as well in order to reduce currency risks.
Wherever it benefits Heidelberg, we pursue a dual vendor strategy to reduce unilateral dependencies. As part of Heidelberg's operational excellence strategy, work began in the year under review to bundle our procurement and product management activities even more to guarantee a high level of transparency.
Procurement risks are considered to be low.
Production risks Production disruptions or downtime, not to mention disruptions in transport and logistics, are a fundamental high risk that Heidelberg counters by implementing very high technical and safety standards. Nevertheless, the risk of a business interruption at the production sites cannot be entirely ruled out. Such interruptions could result from external factors that are beyond Heidelberg's control, such as natural disasters.

46

The probability of occurrence of these risks is rated as very low on account of the (safety) precautions taken (e.g. works fire department). Furthermore, specific risks are covered by insurance policies with typical sums insured.
Production risks are therefore considered to be low.
Sales partnership risks Heidelberg relies on global strategic partnerships to offer its customers a broad range of solutions ­ also tailored to the performance of their own products. It is constantly working to intensify its cooperation with sales partners, especially in the areas of Consumables and Postpress. There is a risk that sales partnerships could be terminated, thereby adversely affecting Heidelberg's business performance.
This risk is considered to be low.
IT, information and data protection risks As a result of advancing digitization, Heidelberg could suffer damage if the availability of data and systems or the confidentiality of sensitive information were violated or restricted. This could have a direct impact on business operations (for example the non-availability of products and services) and lead to a business interruption. An indirect consequence could also be a loss of image, though this cannot be quantified. In addition to a sharp rise in the threat emanating from increasingly professional cybercrime and the greater quantity of sensitive information in connection with the subscription model, the regulatory requirements for IT security are also on the rise, due in part to the EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018.
Comprehensive protective measures are taken preventively to guarantee the availability and confidentiality of systems and data. These include technical protection measures such as virus protection and firewall systems, access controls, data backups and data encryption. Systems, procedures and the organization are regularly checked for possible risks and adapted if necessary. The IT infrastructure continued to undergo its overhaul in the year under review, further improving both performance and system security.

Furthermore, high demands are made on IT security management when selecting IT service providers.
IT, information and data protection risks are considered to be medium.
HR risks and opportunities Heidelberg's success is substantially influenced by qualified and motivated employees and management. It therefore invests both in maintaining the capabilities of its own employees and management and in improving its attractiveness to new employees in order to meet the challenges of forthcoming digitization and demographic change. The Company has responded to the changes entailed by an aging workforce by improving its preventive healthcare and adapting its pension schemes. As a result of past challenges and those yet to come, it cannot be ruled out that negative financial or non-financial effects (loss of key personnel, image, attractiveness as an employer) could arise for Heidelberg.
This risk is considered to be medium.
Financial risks and opportunities Currency and interest rate risks and opportunities As an internationally operating company, Heidelberg conducts business in various currencies, which can lead to risks and opportunities due to exchange rate changes. The risks are identified centrally and suitable strategies and measures are derived to counteract them. Some of these measures are derivative financial instruments, specifically forward exchange transactions and currency options. Details on these instruments and on the impact of hedging transactions can be found in note 31 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The functional separation of trading, settlement and risk controlling and compliance with the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) formulated by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are regularly reviewed by Internal Audit. Currency risks are managed in the medium and long term and operationally, whether through appropriate hedges or by increasing procurement volumes in foreign currency (natural hedging).

47

Consolidated Management Report

Changes in exchange rates can have a positive or negative effect on earnings and can also affect equity directly.
There are interest rate risks for floating-rate liabilities as changes in the underlying market interest rate can affect their interest. Fluctuations in interest rates can have either a positive or a negative effect on earnings. If possible, interest rate risks are limited by suitable interest rate swaps.
Currency risks are currently considered to be medium overall; interest rate risks are considered to be low.
Risks and opportunities from pension obligations Pension obligations to employees under defined benefit pension plans are calculated on the basis of externally produced actuarial reports. In particular, the amount of pension obligations is dependent on the interest rate used to discount future pension payments. As this is based on the returns from corporate bonds with good credit ratings, market fluctuations in these therefore influence the amount of pension obligations. Changes in other parameters, such as rising inflation rates and higher life expectancy, also influence the amount of pension and payment obligations. Opportunities or risks can arise from this depending on the change in these parameters.
Heidelberg's pension obligations are, partly completely or pro rata, covered by plan assets managed in trust, and are reported net in the balance sheet. The future funding requirements for pension payments from operating activities are reduced by payments from plan assets. Plan assets consist of interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other investment classes and are continuously monitored and managed in line with risk and earnings considerations. The broad diversification of assets helps to further reduce risk.
Remeasurement effects from pension obligations and plan assets are offset directly against equity, taking deferred taxes into account. The occurrence of pension

risks (as a result of a reduction in the interest rate in particular or even unexpected developments on the capital market) could have a direct negative effect on equity and the equity ratio.
This risk from pension obligations is currently considered to be medium.
In a favorable capital market environment, an increase in the interest rate used to discount future pension payments and the development of plan assets offer the opportunity that the provisions for pensions and similar obligations decrease and that equity increases due to actuarial gains.
Risks and opportunities from taxation Heidelberg conducts business worldwide on the basis of an implemented transfer pricing system and is subject to the local tax laws applicable in the respective countries and to multilateral and bilateral tax agreements. Changes in the underlying legal provisions and the application of law can have consequences for Heidelberg's tax positions.
Tax risk is considered to be medium overall.
Liquidity To ensure the Company's solvency in order to settle its liabilities in the correct amount as they mature, liquidity is constantly monitored and the necessary minimum liquidity is maintained. The potential funding needs of affiliates and the resulting potential liquidity risks are pinpointed at an early stage with the help of monthly rolling liquidity planning. A broad diversification of financing sources, the planning of financing requirements and the procurement of funds are also intended to ensure financing in the longer term.
Given the cash and cash equivalents available and the current financing structure, liquidity risk is currently considered to be low.

Refinancing risk Heidelberg is dependent on being able to refinance financial liabilities that become due, to meet existing financing commitments and to finance additional funding requirements for the development of its business activities. If reliable financing were not ensured, the willingness to pay would be at risk. Heidelberg has a stable financing base with a broadly diversified financing structure (banks, capital market and other financing commitments) and a balanced, long-term maturity profile as far as 2023. Furthermore, Heidelberg has demonstrated in the past that it can reduce its gearing through internal financing thanks to successful asset and net working capital management.
The details of the financing structure are described in the "Financial Position" section on pages 32 and 33. Notes 28 and 37 to the consolidated financial statements explain in more detail that financing is linked to standard financial covenants. If the results of operations and financial position were to deteriorate to such a degree that it were no longer possible to guarantee compliance with these financial covenants and if, at the same time, it were not possible to modify the financial covenants, this would have an adverse financial impact on the Group. There are currently no indications of such a development.
The refinancing risk is considered to be low.
Rating The capital market uses ratings from agencies to assist lenders in assessing the risk of default by a borrower or financial instrument. Heidelberg is currently rated by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Its rating from Moody's has been B2 with outlook stable since June 2017. Its rating from Standard&Poor's has been B with outlook stable since February 2013. There is a risk that the rating agencies could downgrade Heidelberg's credit rating if the relevant performance indicators (such as its dynamic gearing ratio) deteriorate and the financing costs for new financing therefore increase or this becomes more difficult.
Given the economic performance of Heidelberg, this risk is currently considered to be low.

Legal and compliance risks As part of its general business operations, Heidelberg is involved in judicial and extra-judicial legal disputes whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. The principal legal disputes relate to product liability cases.
In addition, there are legal disputes regarding warranty cases in connection with sales of machinery that could also lead to rescission. In addition to legal risks there are also antitrust risks, though their probability of occurrence is considered to be very low. Provisions are recognized accordingly for risks resulting from legal disputes, provided utilization is likely and the probable amount of the provision required can be reliably estimated. Heidelberg reduces legal risks from individual agreements by utilizing standardized master agreements wherever possible. Heidelberg's interests in the area of patents and licenses are protected in a targeted manner. Risks will be reduced further by systematic controls of compliance with our comprehensive policies in all areas and the commitment of suppliers and service providers to the updated Code of Conduct, which also reflects the ten guiding principles of the UN Global Compact. The ombudsman system at the level of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft for the Heidelberg Group is being adapted to specific local circumstances and further established in corporate culture through ongoing communication measures with employees and third parties. The entry into force of the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25, 2018 is of particular importance. Risks resulting from a violation of the GDPR are countered by a data protection organization that complies with the new requirements. This includes, for example, the implementation of a data protection management system and the establishment of various processes in line with the GDPR, e.g. to answer inquiries from data subjects or to comply with the reporting obligations for privacy violations. The risk is further reduced by fulfilling the necessary documentation obligations.
Legal and compliance risks are currently considered to be medium.

49

Consolidated Management Report

General statement on risks and opportunities There are currently no discernible risks to the Heidelberg Group as a going concern. This applies both to business activities already implemented and to operations that Heidelberg is planning or has already introduced.
In the assessment of the risk situation and the determination of the overall risk, individual risks were looked at not just in isolation, but in terms of their interdependencies as well. Opportunities are not netted. The overall risk situation of the Heidelberg Group is slightly elevated compared to the previous year.
In addition to the political risks (in particular protectionist trade policy and the possible hobbling of global economic momentum by retaliatory measures), which are considered to be high, there are also technical risks in connection with the development and launch of new products or the establishment of new business models during development and risks regarding the assessment of the sales market in the launch phase.
A high risk of failing to meet our earnings targets essentially lies in expectations for economic developments on key sales markets (Europe­ in particular Germany, US, China) not, or not fully, materializing. A weaker than expected performance by these countries could have a negative impact on sales and margins in the HDT segment. Despite this risk assessment, it is assumed that the share of the print volume produced using the sheetfed offset printing method will remain stable globally. Additionally, the barriers to entry in sheetfed offset printing are high and therefore no significant competition from new providers is expected. Secondly, the precise transportation of paper sheets at high speeds remains a core competency of Heidelberg and we are therefore an ideal partner for providers of new technologies. Partnerships allow Heidelberg to bundle the innovative strength of partners with its own in order to respond more quickly to current market conditions. Furthermore, the Group has a strong global sales and service network. Heidelberg considers itself to be strategically well positioned, not just in sheetfed offset printing processes, but also in digital printing processes, which are seeing global increases in the print volumes produced.

Before making investments in a new business area, potential risks and opportunities are weighed on the basis of business plans.
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board deal with risks that could arise from organization, management or planned changes. For further information, please see our detailed "Corporate Governance Declaration" on the Internet.
opportunities for Heidelberg lie in particular in the strategic measures as described in detail in the "Strategy" section on pages 18 to 21. This includes the continued transformation from being a technology-oriented company to being a more customer-oriented one with a focus on expansion in the growth areas of digital, packaging, service and software with a continuous improvement in cost structures.
With new digital printing presses, other products and subscription models developed as part of cooperations and the Company's own research and development activities in the future, Heidelberg anticipates the opportunity to establish a strong position in the area of industrial digital printing. Thanks to Heidelberg's global service and logistics network and the integration of independent providers into this network, there is also growth potential in the less cyclical lifecycle business.
Above and beyond this, a major opportunity for Heidelberg lies in the possibility of more positive economic performance in the print and media industry than is currently forecast. In the BRIC nations there is a possibility that economic growth will be higher than anticipated. The economic recovery in the advanced economies could lead to a rise in the investment volume there as well. For example, the corporate tax reform in the US could trigger other knock-on effects as a result of the strong fiscal stimulus. A shift in exchange rates in Heidelberg's favor would also have a positive effect on sales and earnings planning. There are opportunities ­ and risks ­ that social and political changes, government intervention, customs regulations and changes in legislation could influence our business development in several countries.

Internal control and risk management system for the Group accounting process in accordance with section 289(4) and section 315(4) HGB Accidental or deliberate accounting errors could theoretically result in a view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations that does not correspond to reality. Heidelberg systematically counters this risk ­ and other risks that could arise from it ­ with its own internal control system (ICS). The principles, procedures and measures of the ICS are based on the framework for internal control systems of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Heidelberg Group thus ensures that management decisions are implemented effectively, that control systems work profitably, that laws and internal regulations are observed and that accounting is done properly. Using systematic controls and set processes in particular that also require audits based on random sampling, the Company takes every conceivable measure to prevent errors in the consolidated financial statements and in the Group management report.
Central consolidated accounting responsibilities such as the consolidation of the financial figures and the review of recognized goodwill are undertaken by central accounting on behalf of the entire Group. Corporate accounting also regularly monitors whether the accounts are properly maintained and if the Group-wide Heidelberg Accounting Rules are adhered to, thereby ensuring that the financial information complies with regulatory requirements. In addition, our Internal Audit team, which has access to all data, examines individual areas and affiliates throughout the Group on the basis of random sampling. In doing so, it

examines, among other things, whether the internal control system has been implemented in this regard or whether transactions have been controlled, and whether the principles of the separation of functions and dual control are adhered to in all areas. The latter is mandatory, for example, for every order that is placed, for every invoice that is issued, and for every investment decision that is made. Compliance with all other internal guidelines and directives that have an impact on accounting operations is also monitored.
Risks are also reduced by a number of automated controls. Authorization concepts have been implemented in the Group-wide uniform IT system. If a unit is examined by the internal auditors, these authorization models and their implementation are also reviewed. Automated controls and plausibility checks ensure the completeness and accuracy of data inputs, and in some cases data are validated on a fully automated basis and discrepancies are brought to light.
All segments and regions report their financial data for consolidation to the Group in accordance with a reporting calendar that applies uniformly throughout the Group. Consolidation controls are carried out in addition to controls of whether tax calculations are appropriate, and whether tax-related items that are included in the annual financial statements have been properly recognized. Overall, these procedures ensure that reporting on the business activities of the Group is consistent worldwide and in accordance with approved accounting guidelines. The effectiveness of the internal accounting control system is also regularly monitored by our Internal Audit team.

OUTLOOK
Expected Conditions
The global economy is expected to expand rapidly again in the 2018 calendar year at 3.2 percent. While the acceleration in the past year was roughly equally due to the economic development in the advanced economies and on the emerging markets, the contribution to expansion by the advanced economies is expected to rise noticeably this year.
For example, gross domestic product in the US is expected to climb by 2.7 percent in 2018 after 2.3 percent in 2017. The lower effective tax rate for private households and companies will lead to a strong fiscal stimulus.
GDP in the euro area is forecast to rise by 2.2 percent in 2018, a similar figure to 2017. However, the rate of expansion could slow somewhat as the year progresses, as foreign trade stimulus is expected to be slightly lower on account of exchange rate effects.
The economy will remain expansive in Japan as well. At 1.4 percent, GDP is likely to climb at a slightly slower rate than last year while still staying ahead of the longer-term trend.
The economy of the emerging markets is not set to accelerate further in the forecast period. This is essentially because the rate of expansion in China will slow to 6.7 percent. The monetary policy turnaround already initiated there, and the measures to curb overheating on the real estate market, indicate that stability policy objectives are currently a higher priority than in the last two years, when the government sought to stimulate the economy with more expansionary economic policies. This is also in line with the government's efforts to advance the structural transformation of the Chinese economy towards industry and services with more intensive value added.
Despite the positive growth prospects, economic policy risks in the advanced economies have returned to the fore in recent weeks. Thus, the risk has increased that the global

trade conflict will escalate as a result of the US government's protectionist measures, creating a stumbling block for global economic momentum. The situation could be exacerbated by retaliatory action. This could harm investor and consumer confidence in the economic future and slow investment or consumer spending.
Nonetheless, economists at the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) are forecasting that the economic upswing from 2017 will continue at its current pace for mechanical engineering as well in 2018. The VDMA therefore expects real GDP growth of 3 percent this year. In particular, signs are pointing to expansion in 2018 for Germany as the biggest sales market. Industrial capacity utilization is now at its highest level since 2008, with the result that complaints about capacity bottlenecks for machinery and equipment are beginning to mount.
Future Prospects
The economic and political conditions presented on the markets relevant to Heidelberg, and the expected development of the printing industry, serve as premises for the forecast planning for financial year 2018/2019. Digital transformation, the expansion of technology leadership and greater value added in new high-tech applications and digital platforms should contribute to sales growth of up to 3 billion in the medium term.
The subscription models covering the entire printing press lifecycle, which were launched in 2017/2018, are being met with strong customer demand. The first customers took advantage of this offer in the financial year 2017/2018. In the new financial year 2018/2019, the number of presses under contract is set to rise to around 30, while the business volume resulting from this is expected to amount to around 150 million over the full term of the contracts. The start of series production of digital packaging and label printing presses (Primefire and Labelfire) will increasingly have a positive effect on Heidelberg's sales performance. Positive stimulus is also anticipated from additional sales of Consumables and from e-commerce, in addition to the ramp-up of Digital Platforms.

Accordingly, the Company is forecasting moderate sales growth for 2018/2019. The solid order backlog at the beginning of the financial year supports this forecast. The first half of the year is again expected to be impacted by negative currency effects, first and foremost on account of the US dollar/euro exchange rate and out of Asia as well. As in previous years, Heidelberg is currently intensively examining several options for external growth, but the probability of such transactions cannot be reliably quantified at this time. The moderate growth in sales, combined with efficiency enhancement measures, including initial savings from the recently initiated operational excellence program, should allow an EBITDA margin excluding restructuring result in the range of 7 to 7.5 percent in the 2018/2019 financial year. The additional staff costs resulting from the new collective bargaining agreement have been taken into account.
Potential margin upside in both segments thanks to ongoing strategic development Looking at the segment results, it should be noted that Heidelberg will be reorganizing its two segments from April 1, 2018. This essentially relates to the reassignment of digital printing sales to the Heidelberg Digital Technology (HDT) segment. Within HDT, the lower margin for digital printing on account of ramping up activities will be offset by an improved margin for sheetfed in 2018/2019, stemming from the cost efficiency described above in addition to a better price level and product mix. Overall, an EBITDA margin of between 2 and 3 percent is therefore expected in HDT. This is then set to rise to up to 8 percent in the medium term essentially as a result of rising sales and improving margins for digital printing activities.
In the new financial year, the new Heidelberg Digital Lifecycle Solutions segment (HDLS, previously Heidelberg Digital Solutions) will mainly benefit from improvements in procurement and additional sales in Consumables and Digital Platforms. Accordingly, the segment is aiming for an EBITDA margin of 12 to 13 percent, which is expected to be maintained in the medium term as well.
Our consolidated sales will increasingly benefit from the success of the subscription model in the coming years.

This will also contribute to more stable consolidated sales. The Heidelberg Financial Services segment should continue to make a positive contribution to EBITDA.
As a result of the forthcoming transformation activities and the optimization of processes and structures in the context of operational excellence, Heidelberg is assuming restructuring expenses of around 20 million in the new financial year.
Interest expenses are to be reduced to around 20 million in the medium term as a result of the ongoing optimization of our credit facilities. However, the anticipated positive effects will initially be outweighed by the negative impact of the planned early partial repayment of the existing high-yield bond (8 percent) in 2018/2019. However, this move will reduce interest expenses in subsequent years.
In the financial year 2018/2019, while we are also forecasting higher tax expenses at foreign Group subsidiaries, we still expect a moderate increase in earnings after taxes compared to the previous year (including a non-recurring tax effect in 2017/2018), which is set to rise further in subsequent years.
On the basis of the stable and long-term financial framework, and sustainable profitability, leverage has already been significantly reduced to below the current target of 2. We will therefore still have the financial flexibility moving ahead to invest in our digital portfolio, finance acquisitions and continue Heidelberg's strategic development.
Medium-term targets confirmed: Consolidated sales of 3 billion and net result after taxes in excess of 100 million Heidelberg is standing by its medium-term goals of increasing consolidated sales, including the above-mentioned additional sales potential of at least 500 million, to around 3 billion. At the same time, operating EBITDA excluding restructuring result is set to rise by approximately 100 million to between 250 million and 300 million. Combined with further improvement in the financial result, earnings after taxes are then forecast to exceed 100 million.

LEGAL DISCLOSURES
Remuneration Report ­ Management Board and Supervisory Board1)
¬In the reporting year: Review and redesign of multi-
year variable compensation and adjustment of the obligation for personal investment in shares
¬Compensation structure for the Management Board
will continue to comply with statutory requirements (German Stock Corporation Act) and requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code in the future
The Supervisory Board discussed the appropriateness of Management Board compensation and the structure of the compensation system as scheduled during the year under review. This was also done in connection with the agreement and review of agreements on objectives with Management Board members. With the introduction of the compensation system in place since financial year 2012/2013, the procedure and the benchmarks for measuring the variable compensation elements were defined and, in respect of the multi-year variable compensation elements, adjusted to reflect the requirements of the revolving credit facility and its financial covenants. In the reporting year, the multi-year variable compensation was reviewed and redesigned. The aim was to increase variability by redesigning expected values, but also to enable higher payout potential while reinforcing the idea of shareholder value. These changes also influence the compensation system as a whole. Specifically:
The overall structure and amount of compensation of the management board are determined at the recommendation of the Personnel Matters Committee by the Supervisory Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and reviewed at regular intervals. In each case, Management Board compensation (not including fringe benefits or service cost) amounts to a maximum of 370 percent (previously: 280 percent) of fixed annual compensation, divided into 100 percent for fixed annual compensation and a maximum of 270 percent (previously: 180 percent) for the variable compensation elements, i.e. a maximum of 90 percent for the one-year variable compensation, as before, and 180 percent (previously: 90 percent) for the multi-year variable compensation.
1) This remuneration report also forms part of the corporate governance report

The compensation of the management board consists firstly of fixed annual compensation paid in equal installments at the end of each month, one-year variable compensation and multi-year variable compensation, which is calculated on the achievement of certain three-year objectives using defined parameters, and secondly of fringe benefits and company pension benefits.
The one-year variable compensation is dependent on the Group's success in the respective financial year, the benchmarks for which are currently defined as EBIT and free cash flow according to IFRS. In addition, each member of the Management Board receives a personal, performance-based bonus that is determined by the Supervisory Board at the recommendation of the Personnel Matters Committee, taking into account their particular duties and responsibilities in addition to any individual objectives agreed. If objectives are achieved in full, the personal annual bonus can amount to up to 30 percent of the fixed annual compensation; the Company bonus can also account for up to 30 percent or if objectives are exceeded 60 percent of the fixed annual compensation. With respect to their personal annual bonuses for the year under review, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board had again agreed to give priority to the annual financial objectives. Until further notice ­ starting with financial year 2012/2013 ­ the 30 percent of the personal bonus will be added on to the Company bonus subordinate to the financial objectives on which it is based. The one-year variable compensation is paid out at the end of the month in which the Annual General Meeting resolves on the appropriation of the net result.
The multi-year variable compensation was reviewed and redesigned in the reporting year. From this reporting year, the multi-year variable compensation is determined according to two benchmarks: éarnings before taxes according to the IFRS consolidated income statement (EBT) and total shareholder return (TSR). The targets for these two benchmarks, the respective thresholds and the maximum overfulfillment, are all defined at the beginning of the relevant three-year period (performance period). Half the multi-year variable compensation is attributable to each benchmark, i.e. 45 percent of the fixed annual compensation in the event of 100 percent fulfillment of the targets for each of the relevant benchmarks. Overfulfillment of a benchmark is recognized and can at most result in a doubling of the attributable multi-year variable target compensation. Accordingly, multi-year variable compensation

Supplementary Report

can amount to 90 percent of the fixed annual compensation for each benchmark and to 180 percent of the fixed annual compensation in total. Both benchmarks are associated with an objective fulfillment threshold that must be reached in order for the multi-year variable compensation for the benchmark in question to be paid out. However, overfulfillment of a benchmark can only increase the multi-year variable compensation if the other benchmark reaches at least the threshold. The first benchmark (Group earnings before taxes) is based on the five-year planning adopted by the Supervisory Board. The attributable multiyear variable compensation is determined after the end of the performance period by comparing the actual earnings before taxes of the three financial years within the performance period according to the IFRS income statement with the expected earnings before taxes for these three financial years. The averages of the actual and the expected earnings before taxes are compared in order to calculate and identify the actual achievement of objectives. The basis for target measurement for the second benchmark (total shareholder return) is the long-term expected return (Heidelberg share price increases) during the performance period (period of three financial years). The baseline value for each performance period is determined at the beginning of the first financial year of the performance period. For this purpose, the arithmetical average price (closing prices) of the Company's share in XETRA trading at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the 60 trading days immediately preceding the start of the three-year performance period is measured. The fixed baseline value is then compared with the arithmetical average price (closing prices) of the share over the 60 trading days immediately preceding the end of the performance period. If the Company pays dividends to the shareholders during the performance period, these dividends are translated in terms of the share price immediately preceding the end of the performance period. The achievement of objectives is checked and ascertained at the end of each three-year period. The multi-year variable compensation is paid out at the end of the month in which the Annual General Meeting ­ after the end of the final financial year of the three-year period ­ resolves on the appropriation of the net result.

For both one-year variable compensation and multi-year variable compensation, achievement of the relevant threshold results in a payout amounting to 25 percent of the sum that would be payable in the event of 100 percent objective fulfillment. If the objective attainment lies between the threshold and the defined objective, the payout is determined by linear interpolation. If overfulfillment is to be recognized, the amount of the payout is either determined as a percentage according to the degree of overfulfillment or ­ if a maximum recognizable value for overfulfillment has been defined ­ by linear interpolation between the objective and the maximum recognizable value.
In the event of a member joining or leaving within an ongoing performance period, that member has a pro rata temporis claim to any multi-year variable compensation determined after the end of the performance period. In the event of a member leaving, pro rata temporis multi-year variable compensation is calculated for the performance periods still ongoing at this time on the basis of the determination of goals as of the exit date, which is then frozen.
The Management Board members' personal investment was also increased compared to the status quo in the year under review. During the period of appointment to the Management Board, each Management Board member must use the one-year and multi-year variable compensation to establish and hold a portfolio of shares in the Company in the value of their current fixed annual compensation. Shares in the Company already held by the respective Management Board member are counted towards this value. There is no obligation to acquire shares using other compensation or private wealth. The Company is entitled to invest 10 percent of the one-year variable compensation and 10 percent of the multi-year variable compensation (before deduction of taxes and contributions) in the form of shares in the Company. A bank or financial service provider is commissioned to acquire the shares; the Company bears the costs of processing and custody. The Company's entitlement to invest variable compensation to build the share investment portfolio in the form of shares ends when the respective Management Board member leaves office. The respective Management Board member may only sell shares from the personal investment share portfolio during their term in office if the minimum value of the fixed annual compensation is complied with and statutory or regulatory restrictions do not prohibit the sale.

There is a special rule for the three-year period 2017/2018 to 2019/2020. The amount resulting according to the previous rule from the objective already set for the first portion of the multi-year variable compensation of financial year 2017/2018 (2017/2018 tranche) and the related evaluation with regard to the (proportional) target compensation of no more than 30 percent of the fixed annual compensation is, in the event of the agreed achievement of objectives, counted towards this new rule and paid out after the end of the three-year period in financial year 2019/2020.
The objective agreements for the multi-year variable compensation (three-year period) concluded at the beginning of financial year 2015/2016 (2015/2016 tranche) and at the beginning of financial year 2016/2017 (2016/2017 tranche) are still based on the previous rule and are accordingly ascertained and paid out on this basis. As a result, the multi-year variable compensation is scheduled to be ascertained and paid out on the basis of the previous rule for the last time at the end of financial year 2018/2019 ­ with the exception of the above transitional rule.

As such, the one-year variable compensation and the multiyear variable compensation alike provide an additional long-term performance incentive, increasingly gearing the compensation structure towards sustainable business development.
Rainer Hundsdörfer, Dirk Kaliebe, Prof.Dr. Ulrich Hermann and Stephan Plenz invested the portions of the one-year variable compensation paid for financial year 2016/2017 and Dirk Kaliebe and Stephan Plenz the corresponding portions of the multi-year variable compensation for financial years 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 in shares of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft on August 11, 2017, in accordance with Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014; the investment was reported to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority by all Management Board members and published on the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft website on August 11, 2017.
In the year under review, fringe benefits primarily consist of the value of the private use of a company car to be determined according to fiscal guidelines.

The benefits to members of the management board who left are as follows: No members of the Management Board left in the reporting year. In the financial year 2016/2017, the term in office of Dr.Gerold Linzbach as Chief Executive Officer, member of the Management Board and Chief Human Resources Officer ended on November 13, 2016; his service agreement with Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktieng esellschaft ended on August 31, 2017. The term in office of Harald Weimer as a member of the Management Board ended on November 13, 2016; his service agreement with Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft ended as agreed on March 31, 2017. Please see note 39 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on members of the Management Board who left in the past year.
post-employment benefits for the members of the Management Board are as follows:
Rainer Hundsdörfer (Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer), Dirk Kaliebe, Prof.Dr.Ulrich Hermann and Stephan Plenz have each been appointed as

ordinary members of the Management Board for periods of three years. The pension agreement provides for a defined contribution for pension benefits that is essentially consistent with the defined contribution plan for executive staff (BVR). On July 1 of each year, the Company pays a corresponding contribution based on the relevant fixed compensation retroactively for the previous financial year into an investment fund. The fixed pension contribution is 35 percent of the corresponding fixed compensation.
The pension agreements for all members of the Management Board stipulate that the amount paid can rise depending on the earnings situations of the Company. The exact amount of the pension also depends on the investment success of the fund. The pension can be drawn as an early pension from the age of 60. In the event of a member of the Management Board leaving the Company, the pension will be paid from the age of 65 or 60 respectively, principally as a non-recurring payment of pension capital. In addition, the agreements also provide for disability and surviving dependents' benefits (60 percent of the disability

payment or the pension) contingent on the amount of the last fixed compensation. In deviation from the defined contribution plan for executive staff, the percentage in the event of a disability pension is based on the length of service on the Company's Management Board, with attributable time up to the age of 65 and a maximum pension percentage of 60 percent. If the contract of employment expires prior to the start of benefit payments, the claim to the accrued pension funds at that point in time remains valid. The other pension benefits (disability and surviving dependents' benefits) earned in accordance with section 2 of the German Company Pension Act (BetrAVG) remain valid on a pro rata temporis basis. In a departure from section 1b BetrAVG, the benefits of Rainer Hundsdörfer and Prof.Dr. Ulrich Hermann are vested immediately. Moreover, the statutory vesting periods have been met for Dirk Kaliebe and Stephan Plenz.
In terms of early termination benefits, all service agreements provide for the following uniform regulations in the event of the effective revocation of a Management Board member's appointment or a justifiable resignation by a member of the Management Board: The service agreement ends after the statutory notice period in accordance with section 622 (1), (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB). In event of the effective revocation of a Management Board member's appointment, the member receives a severance payment at the time of termination of the service agree-

ment in the amount of his or her previous total compensation under the service agreement for two years, but not exceeding the amount of the compensation for the originally agreed remainder of the service agreement. An entitlement to multi-year variable compensation determined, established and thus already vested at the date of departure is unaffected by the severance and transitional regulations and is paid immediately after departure or, with regard to the new multi-year variable compensation, as soon as the annual financial statements of the financial year in question have been prepared, but no later than the end of the first quarter of the financial year following the departure. This does not affect the right to extraordinary termination for cause in accordance with section 626 BGB. The severance payment is paid in quarterly installments in line with the originally agreed residual term, but in not more than eight quarterly installments. Other compensation received by a then former member of the Management Board, which this former member has agreed to disclose to the Company, must be offset in accordance with sections 326(2) sentence 2 and 615(2) BGB mutatis mutandis during the originally agreed residual term. If a member of the Management Board becomes unable to work due to disability, the benefits stipulated in the respective pension agreement will be paid. If no decision on reappointment is made by at least nine months before the end of the term in office and the Management Board member is not reappointed thereafter,

1) The pension entitlement that can be achieved by the age of 65 (Rainer Hundsdörfer; Dirk Kaliebe; Prof.Dr.Ulrich Hermann and Stephan Plenz) is dependent on personal compensation development, the respective EBIT and the return achieved, and hence cannot be determined precisely in advance. If the pension option is utilized and the current assumptions continue to apply, the retirement pension resulting from the accrued pension funds is expected to be as follows: Rainer Hundsdörfer: approx. 7 percent, Prof.Dr.Ulrich Hermann: approx. 36 percent, Dirk Kaliebe: approx. 21 percent and Stephan Plenz: approx. 34 percent of the respective last fixed compensation
2) For Rainer Hundsdörfer, Dirk Kaliebe, Prof.Dr.Ulrich Hermann and Stephan Plenz, the pension contribution for the reporting year is calculated on the basis of the pensionable income on March 31, without taking into account the earnings-based contribution not yet determined

Consolidated Management Report

the Management Board member receives a severance payment in the amount of the fixed annual compensation (transitional payment). The entitlement to this fixed annual compensation arises at the time of termination of the service agreement. It does not arise if, when the decision on reappointment is made or by the time of termination of the service agreement, there is good cause for which the Management Board member is responsible that would give the Company a right to termination in accordance with section 626 BGB. The above rule applies accordingly to the payment and eligibility of other compensation.
The compensation of the members of the supervisory board is governed by the Articles of Association and approved by the Annual General Meeting.
Each member of the Supervisory Board receives fixed annual compensation of 40,000.00. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives three times this amount, the Deputy Chairman twice this amount. The members of the Management Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Committee on Arranging Personnel Matters of the Management Board receive additional compensation for work on

these committees. Each committee member receives compensation of 1,500.00 per meeting for participation in a meeting of these committees. The Chairman of the Audit Committee receives compensation of 4,500.00 per meeting; the Chairman of the Management Committee and the Chairman of the Committee on Arranging Personnel Matters of the Management Board receive compensation of 2,500.00 per meeting. The members of the Supervisory Board also receive an attendance fee of 500.00 per meeting for attending a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees. Furthermore, the expenses incurred by members of the Supervisory Board and value added tax thereon will be reimbursed. In order to boost the Supervisory Board's role as a controlling body, compensation does not include a variable, performance-based component. The Supervisory Board currently consists of 12 members.
The members of the union and the Works Council have declared that they will transfer their Supervisory Board compensation to the Hans Böckler Foundation in accordance with the guidelines of IG Metall.

Takeover Disclosures in Accordance with Section 315a (1) of the German C ommercial Code
In accordance with section 315(4) sentence 1 nos.1 to 9 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), we address all points that could be relevant in the event of a public takeover bid for Heidelberg in the consolidated management report:
As of March 31, 2018, the issued capital (share capital) of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft amounted to 713,562,818.56 and was divided into 278,735,476 no-par-value bearer shares that are not subject to any restriction on transferability. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company held 142,919 treasury shares, from which no rights arise for the Company in accordance with section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
The appointment and dismissal of members of the management board is based on sections 84 et seq. AktG in conjunction with sections 30 et seq. of the German Codetermination Act (MitbestG).
amendments to the articles of association are made in accordance with the provisions of sections 179 et seq. and 133 AktG in conjunction with Article 19(2) of Heidelberg's Articles of Association. In accordance with Article 19(2) of the Articles of Association, unless otherwise stipulated by law, resolutions of the Annual General Meeting are passed with a simple majority of the votes cast and, if a capital majority is required by law in addition to a majority of votes, with a simple majority of the share capital represented in the passing of the resolution. In accordance with Article 15 of the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized to make amendments and additions to the Articles of Association that affect their wording only.
Heidelberg is permitted to acquire treasury shares only in accordance with section 71(1) nos. 1 to 6 AktG. With the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Management Board is authorized to use the treasury shares held at the end of the reporting period as follows while disapplying shareholders' preemptive subscription rights:
¬for the disposal of treasury shares if sold in exchange
for cash and at a price not significantly less than the stock market price as defined more precisely in the authorization; the volume of shares thus sold together with other shares issued with preemptive subscription rights disapplied since July 18, 2008 must not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the share capital on July 18, 2008 in total and 10 percent of the share capital at the time the authorization is exercised;

¬to offer and transfer treasury shares to third parties if
companies, equity investments in companies or parts of companies are thereby acquired, or if mergers are thereby implemented;
¬to end or settle mediation proceedings under com-
pany law.
This authorization can be exercised in full or in part in each case.
The Management Board also is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to withdraw treasury shares without a further resolution by the Annual General Meeting. This authorization can be exercised in full or in part in each case.
On July 26, 2012, the Annual General Meeting had authorized the Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue bearer or registered warrants or convertible bonds, profit-sharing rights or participating bonds, or a combination of these instruments (collectively referred to as "bonds") up to a total nominal amount of 150,000,000.00, dated or undated, on one or several occasions by July 25, 2017, and to grant or impose on the bearers or creditors of option warrants or option profit-sharing rights or option participating bonds, option rights or obligations, or to grant or impose on the bearers or creditors of convertible bonds, convertible profit-sharing rights or convertible participating bonds, conversion rights or obligations to bearer shares of the Company with a pro rata amount of share capital of originally up to 119,934,433.28 in total, in accordance with the further conditions of these bonds. It was permitted to disapply shareholders' preemptive subscription rights in accordance with the further conditions of this authorization. For this purpose, the share capital was originally contingently increased by up to 119,934,433.28, divided into 46,849,388 bearer shares. Due to the conversion of five partial debentures resulting from the convertible bond issued in July 2013, the share capital was increased by 488,547.84 utilizing Contingent Capital 2012. The Contingent Capital 2012 available was therefore reduced to 119,445,885.44, divided into 46,658,549 bearer shares. On July 24, 2015, the Annual General Meeting resolved the cancellation of Contingent Capital 2012 to the extent that it is not intended to serve rights under the 2013 convertible bond. For this purpose, the share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft was now contingently increased by up to 58,625,953.28, divided into 22,900,763 bearer shares (Contingent Capital 2012). In June 2017, 21,297,697 new shares were issued from Contingent Capital 2012 to serve rights

61

under the 2013 convertible bond. This increased the share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft from 659,040,714.24 to 713,562,818.56, now divided into 278,735,476 shares. The remaining issue volume of the 2013 convertible bond of 3.7 million was fully repaid on maturity on July 10, 2017.

Shareholders' preemptive subscription rights can be disapplied in accordance with the further conditions of this authorization. For this purpose, the share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft was originally contingently increased by up to 58,625,953.28, divided into 22,900,763 bearer shares. On July 24, 2015, the Annual General Meeting resolved the cancellation of Contingent Capital 2014 to the extent that it is not intended to serve rights under the 2015 convertible bond. The share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is now contingently increased by up to 48,230,453.76, divided

into 18,840,021 bearer shares (contingent capital 2014), for this purpose; details of Contingent Capital 2014 can be found in Article 3(3) of the Articles of Association.
On July 24, 2015, the Annual General Meeting authorized the Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue warrants, convertible bonds and/or participating bonds as well as profit-sharing rights including combinations of these instruments (collectively also referred to as "bonds") up to a total nominal amount of 200,000,000.00, dated or undated, on one or several occasions by July 23, 2020, and to grant or impose on the bearers or creditors of option warrants or option profitsharing rights or option participating bonds, option rights or obligations, or to grant or impose on the bearers or creditors of convertible bonds, convertible profit-sharing rights or convertible participating bonds conversion rights or obligations to up to 51,487,555 bearer shares of the Company with a pro rata amount of share capital of up to 131,808,140.80 in total, in accordance with the further conditions of these bonds. Shareholders' preemptive subscription rights can be disapplied in accordance with the further conditions of this authorization. The share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft was contingently increased by up to 131,808,140.80, divided into 51,487,555 bearer shares (contingent capital 2015), for this purpose; details of Contingent Capital 2015 can be found in Article 3(4) of the Articles of Association.
In accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on July 24, 2015, the Management Board was authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital of the Company by up to 131,808,140.80 on one or more occasions by issuing up to 51,487,555 new shares against cash or non-cash contributions by July 23, 2020 (authorized capital 2015). The Management Board was authorized, with the approval of

the Supervisory Board, to determine the further content of share rights and the conditions for the issue of shares. Details on Authorized Capital 2015 can be found in Article 3(5) of the Articles of Association.
The credit facility signed on March 25, 2011 and extended until June 2023 by way of an agreement with several banks in March 2018, a bilateral loan agreement with the European Investment Bank dated March 31, 2016 and a promotional loan agreed with a syndicate of banks with refinancing by the KfW dated October 20, 2016 and a bilateral loan agreement with a German Landesbank dated May 23, 2017, contain, in the versions applicable at the end of the reporting period, standard change of control clauses that grant the contracting parties additional rights to information and termination in the event of a change in the Company's control or majority ownership structure.
The terms of the convertible bond that was placed on March 25, 2015 and issued on March 30, 2015 also include a change of control clause. If there is a change of control as described in the bond terms, the bondholders can demand early repayment within a defined period. Heidelberg would then be obliged to pay a change of control exercise price to the bondholders who demanded early repayment. This exercise price corresponds to the notional amount of the bond adjusted using a mathematical technique described in greater detail in the bond terms. The terms of the bond that was placed on April 17, 2015 and issued on May 5, 2015 include a change of control clause that requires Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft to buy back the respective debt instruments (or parts thereof) from bondholders on demand if certain conditions named in that clause materialize. In this case, the buyback price would be 101 percent of the total nominal amount of the respective debt instruments plus interest accrued but not yet paid.

A technology licensing agreement with a manufacturer and supplier of software products also contains a change of control clause; this grants each party a right of termination with notice of 90 days if at least 50 percent of the shareholdings or voting rights of the other party are acquired by a third party.
An agreement with a manufacturer and supplier of digital production printing systems for the sale of these systems also includes a change of control clause. This clause grants each party the right to terminate the agreement with notice of three months from the time of receipt of notification from the other party that a change in control has occurred or is possibly imminent, or from the time that such a change in control becomes known. A change of control under the terms of this agreement is considered to have occurred if a third party acquires at least 25 percent of the voting rights of the party concerned or the ability to influence the activities of the party concerned on a contractual basis or based on articles of association or similar provisions that grant the third party corresponding rights.

In addition, its product portfolio comprises other products as well as consulting and other services in the field of mechanical engineering, electronics and electrical engineering and the metal industry. The Group is divided into the segments Heidelberg Digital Technology, Heidelberg Digital Business&Services and Heidelberg Financial Services.

The consolidated financial statements of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union and in accordance with the supplemental provisions of Section 315a (1) of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB ­ German Commercial Code). The consolidated financial statements also comply with the IFRS in force and applicable in the EU as of the end of the reporting period.
Certain consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position items have been combined to improve the clarity of presentation. A breakdown of these items is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated income statement has been prepared in line with the nature of expense method.
All amounts are generally stated in thousands. For subsidiaries located in countries outside the euro zone, the annual financial statements prepared in local currency are translated into euros (see note 5).
From the 2017/2018 financial year, what was previously reported as "special items" is reported as the "restructuring result" and within the corresponding items of the income statement.
These consolidated financial statements relate to financial year 2017/2018 (April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018). They were approved for publication by the Management Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft on May 23, 2018.

The Heidelberg Group applied all standards that were mandatory in the reporting year.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) have approved the following changes to existing standards, which are to be applied for the first time in financial year 2017/2018.

¬The amendments clarify that transfers to or from investment property are only permissible when there is evidence of a change in use.
¬In addition, it is clarified that the list of indi cators for a change in use in IAS40 is not exhaustive.
¬The amendments include clarifications on accounting for cash-settled share-based payment transactions and for modifications of commitments when a previously cash-settled share-based payment transaction is reclassified as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction.
¬The amendments provide an option either to recognize the volatility from IFRS9 before the application of IFRS4 in other comprehensive income or, if the activities are primarily linked to insurance, to delay the first-time application of IFRS9 until 2021.
¬The amendments enable measurement at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income for prepayable financial assets for which the terminating party receives reasonable additional compensation.
¬The amendments clarify how the results of transactions between an investor and an associate or joint venture must be recognized. If the transaction relates to a business in accordance with IFRS3, the profit or loss must be recognized in full. Otherwise there is partial recognition of the result.
¬The effective date of the changes was postponed indefinitely in December 2015.
¬Minor and non-urgent improvements are made to IFRS as part of the IASB's annual improvement project. These relate to the standards IFRS1, IFRS12 and IAS28.

¬ IFRS 9 replaces the previous standard IAS39. ¬ IFRS9 contains new regulations on the recog-
nition and measurement of financial instruments. The basis for accounting are the cash flow properties and the business model by which the financial asset is managed. In the future, impairment on financial assets is to be based on forecast credit losses. IFRS9 also contains revised regulations on hedge accounting.
¬According to IFRS14, rate-regulated entities adopting IFRS for the first time can continue to account for rate regulations according to the local accounting policies used previously.
¬Regulatory deferral accounts and their effects are to be reported separately in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and in other comprehensive income. In addition, IFRS14 requires disclosures in the notes regarding these items.
¬The European Commission has decided not to endorse IFRS14 in EU law.
¬ IFRS15 provides a uniform, five-step model for calculating and recognizing revenue to be applied to all contracts with customers. It replaces the previous standards IAS18 and IAS11 and various revenue-related interpretations.
¬Basically, revenues should reflect the transfer of goods or services at the amount that the company expects to receive as consideration (payment) for these goods or services.
¬ IFRS15 contains extended guidelines on issues including multi-component agreements, service agreements and contractual amendments in addition to extended disclosures in the notes.
¬In September 2015, it was stipulated that application of IFRS15 will be mandatory for the first time for financial years that begin on or after January 1, 2018.
¬In April 2016, the IASB published various clarifications regarding IFRS15.

¬I FRS16 replaces the previous standard IAS17. ¬The changes mainly relate to accounting by
lessees, who will have to recognize assets for rights of use obtained and liabilities for payment obligations assumed under all leases in their statements of financial position. There are recognition exemptions for leased assets of a low value and for short-term leases.
¬ IFRS17 replaces the previous standard IFRS4. ¬The standard provides three variants for the
future accounting treatment of insurance contracts. On initial recognition, insurance contracts are measured at their settlement amount plus the service margin.

Please refer to remarks below this table
Currently being examined

¬The interpretation clarifies that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate for the translation of trans actions in foreign currencies that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration, is the date of initial recognition of the asset or liability resulting from the advance consideration.
¬The interpretation includes provisions on the recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes and thus closes a loophole with regard to this issue in IAS12.

The effects of the introduction of IFRS9: Financial Instruments were analyzed in a project on the implementation of the new standard. This focused on the analysis of the effects of the new impairment model and the revised hedge accounting requirements. The new requirements for classification will lead to recognition of financial assets largely in the "at amortized cost" category. On the basis of the new impairment model, expected losses from financial assets will generally have to be expensed earlier than before. IFRS9 also stipulates extensive new disclosures in the notes, especially on expected credit losses and hedge accounting. Heidelberg will choose the modified retrospective method as a transitional method for the initial application. Accordingly, the previous year's figures will not be adjusted; the effects of the initial application will be recognized cumulatively in retained earnings as of April 1, 2018. No material changeover effect is expected with regard to the new classification and measurement provisions. In line with the modified retrospective method, Heidelberg expects equity to be reduced by a low seven-figure effect on

trade receivables and receivables from sales financing as of April 1, 2018. There are no changeover effects with regard to hedge accounting.
The effects of the new requirements of IFRS15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers was analyzed in a project on the implementation of the new standard. In particular, this comprised qualitative and quantitative analyses, contractual analyses and surveys of the sales-related areas. There will be changes in the statement of financial position due to the separate recognition of contractual assets and liabilities. The notes to the consolidated financial statements will contain additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, such as the cumulative amount of the performance obligations of all relevant contracts with customers not yet fulfilled at the end of the reporting period. The ascertainment and structure of these disclosures were analyzed as part of the implementation project. Overall, the analysis in this project has shown that the initial application of IFRS15 will have no material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations.

Heidelberg will choose the modified retrospective method as a transitional method for the initial application, so that, in particular, the comparative figures of prior-year periods will not be adjusted.
The initial adoption of IFRS16: Leases is expected to lead to an increase in non-current assets and liabilities, particularly as the rights and obligations resulting from operating leases will be accounted for as rights of use and lease liabilities in the future. There may be shifts in the income statement between the result of operating activities (EBIT) and the financial result as, in contrast to the previous recognition of operating lease expenses, write-downs of rightof-use assets and the interest cost of discounting lease liabilities will be required to be recognized in future. The effects of the new requirements of IFRS16 are currently still being analyzed as part of a Group-wide project on the implementation of the new standard, which incorporates qualitative and quantitative analyses. Its impact on the presentation of financial position and performance therefore cannot yet be conclusively assessed at this time. In this context, please refer to the information on other financial obligations under operating leases in note 33. Heidelberg will presumably choose the modified retrospective method as a transitional method for initial application.

3 Scope of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft include a total of 72 (previous year: 70) domestic and foreign companies controlled by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft within the meaning of IFRS10. Of these companies, 61 (previous year: 61) are located outside Germany.

Control within the meaning of IFRS10 exists when an investor controls the material activities of the investee, has exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to utilize its control to influence the amount of returns from the investee. Inclusion in the consolidated financial statements occurs at the time that control is established. Subsidiaries that are of minor importance are not included. These subsidiaries are of minor significance if the total of the equity, total assets, sales and net profit or loss of the subsidiaries not included amounts to only an insignificant portion of the Group figure. The list of all shareholdings of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, which is a component of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, can be found in the annex to these notes (see pages 144 to 147).
The scope of consolidation changed as follows as against the previous year:
As of July 1, 2017, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft took over the coatings and pressroom chemicals business for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region with a total of about 70 staff from Fujifilm Europe B.V., Tilburg, the Netherlands. The acquisition includes the

81

Financial section

development, production and marketing operations at the production sites in Reutlingen, Germany, and Kruibeke, Belgium, as well as at the sales locations in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Finland. The takeover was concluded in the form of an asset deal by acquiring the assets and liabilities associated with this business in the relevant countries. Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is thereby expanding in the attractive growth segment for consumables. This transaction is another step in pursuing the Company's growth strategy of developing a comprehensive cross-sector portfolio geared toward specific customer requirements. The acquired operations account for a sales volume of approximately 25 million. Heidelberg is thus roughly trebling its previous sales of pressroom chemicals and achieving a market share of around 10 percent in Europe.
With effect as of May 1, 2017, Heidelberger Druck maschinen Aktiengesellschaft acquired all shares in docufy GmbH, Bamberg, Germany. docufy is a manufacturer of professional software solutions for technical documentation and the first provider of multi-level documentation. docufy solutions optimize processes for creating technical documentation and making them available to all business areas along the value chain. In recent years, docufy GmbH has enjoyed strong and profitable growth and most recently generated sales of 6.5 million with around 80 employees. The acquisition of docufy is part of the plan to boost the Digital Platforms business area, which comprises IT solutions for the design, production and servicing of innovative high-tech products for industrial customers and offers end-to-end process support in digital product life cycle management. At the same time, the acquisition expands the existing base of industrial customers, offering Heidelberg additional sales and earnings potential.
The purchase price for both acquisitions totaling 14,007 thousand was paid in cash. Performance-based payments (earn-out) were agreed in connection with the acquisition of docufy GmbH, which are linked to specific targets stipulated in the purchase agreement. The obligation of the earn-out is reported under other provisions. Total transaction costs in the low single-digit million euro range were incurred in connection with the two acquisitions. The transaction costs were reported in profit or loss in the result of operating activities under other operating expenses. The purchased assets and liabilities were carried

at fair value in the context of purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS3. The fair values of the assets and liabilities identified in the two acquisitions were as follows at the date of acquisition:
Fair value at date of acquisition

Non-current assets
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment

The biggest effects of the acquisitions on the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement resulted from the initial consolidation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at fair value, the goodwill (3,013 thousand) from the acquisition of docufy and the reversal of the remaining difference (2,596 thousand) included in "Other operating income" from the business activities acquired from Fujifilm Europe B.V. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technologies, formulations and trademarks. The negative difference recognized for the corporate acquisition of Fujifilm Europe B.V. was caused by the purchase price, which among other things was influenced by Fujifilm Europe B.V.'s focus on its core business.

For Heidelberg, the goodwill from the acquisition of docufy GmbH of 3,013 thousand reflects a strategic addition to the smart factory product portfolio and thus a further step toward Industry 4.0. In addition, the acquisition of docufy GmbH gives Heidelberg access to expertise and talent in the fields of web services, smart devices, internet technology, augmented reality, cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) and thus enables the faster implementation of the service product life-cycle management road map at Heidelberg.
The pro rata net sales, which represent the additional sales for the Heidelberg Group and consequently do not include internal group sales generated by Heidelberg affiliates with business activities acquired from Fujifilm Europe B.V. and with docufy GmbH, for the period after the acquisition date amount to around 22.6 million, assuming a pro rata net result after taxes. This pro rata net result after taxes also includes depreciation and amortization on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment recognized at fair value, but without consideration of the reversal in profit or loss of the negative difference from the business activities acquired from Fujifilm Europe B.V. or the expenses attributable to the integration of the acquired business activities into the Heidelberg Group.

Had these acquisitions already been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Heidelberg Group as of April 1, 2017, net sales would have been around 6.5 million higher, with a negligible effect on the net result after taxes.
SABAL GmbH&Co. Objekt FEZ Heidelberg KG is a structured entity that was founded to manage, let and utilize the research and development center in Heidelberg, and in which Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is the limited partner with an interest of 99.9 percent of the capital. In 2007 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft sold the research and development center to SABAL GmbH&Co. Objekt FEZ Heidelberg KG and rented the center from it. SABAL GmbH&Co. Objekt FEZ Heidelberg KG is not included in consolidation as Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft does not control it. The carrying amount of the interest in SABAL GmbH&Co. Objekt FEZ Heidelberg KG is reported in financial assets and is around 10 thousand.

4 Principles of consolidation
In accordance with IFRS3, all business combinations are recognized using the purchase method in the form of the full revaluation method.
On first-time consolidation of acquired companies, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value as of the date of acquisition. If the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets less liabilities and contingent liabilities, this is recognized as goodwill. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition at less than market value is recognized in profit or loss after a repeat assessment of the measurement performed.
Intra-Group sales, expenses and income, receivables, liabilities and contingent liabilities are eliminated. IntraGroup transactions are calculated both on the basis of market prices and on the basis of arm's length transfer prices. Assets from commercial transactions among consolidated companies included in inventories are adjusted to eliminate intercompany profits and losses. In consolidation processes affecting profit or loss, income tax effects are taken into account and the corresponding deferred taxes are r ecognized.
5 Currency translation
In the individual financial statements of the consolidated companies, which are prepared in local currencies, monetary items in foreign currencies (cash and cash equivalents, receivables, liabilities) are measured at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period and exchange rate effects are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are posted at their historic exchange rates.

The financial statements of the companies included in consolidation that are prepared in foreign currency are translated on the basis of the functional currency concept (IAS21) in accordance with the modified closing rate method. As our subsidiaries financially, economically and organizationally effect their transactions on an independent basis, the functional currency is usually the same as each subsidiary's respective local currency. Assets and liabilities are therefore translated at the closing rates, the equity ­ except income and expenses directly recognized in equity ­ at the historical rates, and expenses and income at the average exchange rates for the year. The difference resulting from the foreign currency translation is offset against other reserves outside profit and loss.
Currency differences arising as against the previous year's translation in the Heidelberg Group are also offset against other reserves outside profit and loss.
Accounting in line with IAS29 was not required as the Heidelberg Group does not have any subsidiaries located in countries with hyperinflationary economies.
The main exchange rates used in currency translation are as follows:

6 General accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are presented below. Further information on the individual items of the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position and corresponding figures are presented in note 8 et seq.
General principles In the opinion of the IASB, the consolidated financial statements present a true and fair view and a fair presentation (overriding principle) if the qualitative criteria of the presentation of accounts are met and the individual IFRS guidelines are complied with. Consequently, to achieve fair presentation, preparers cannot deviate from the individual regulations.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of a going concern.
Uniform accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting policies that are applied uniformly throughout the Group. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in line with the principle of historical cost, with the exception of certain items of the statement of financial position, which are reported at fair value.
Consistency of accounting policies With the exception of changes resulting from new or amended standards or interpretations (see note 2), the accounting policies applied in the previous year remain unchanged.
Revenue recognition product sales are recognized when the material risks and rewards of ownership of the merchandise and products sold are transferred to the buyer. Neither a continuing managerial involvement nor effective control over the sold merchandise and products remain. The revenue amount can be reliably determined; the inflow of economic benefit from the sale is sufficiently probable.

Sales from services are recognized when the services are rendered provided that the amount of income can be reliably determined and the inflow of economic benefit arising from the transaction is sufficiently probable. Sales from long-term service contracts are generally distributed on a straight-line basis.
Income from operating and finance leases is recognized based on the provisions of IAS17.
Intangible assets With the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have a limited useful life and are therefore amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life. In accordance with the option provided under IAS38, intangible assets are measured at amortized cost. In accordance with IFRS3 in conjunction with IAS36, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and also if there is any evidence to suggest a loss of value. Purchased intangible assets are capitalized at cost. Internally generated intangible assets are capitalized to the extent that the criteria for recognition in IAS38 are met. Manufacturing costs include all directly attributable costs.
Research and development costs Development costs for newly developed products are capitalized at cost to the extent that expenses are directly attributable and if both the technical feasibility and the marketing of the newly developed products are assured (IAS38). There must also be a sufficient degree of probability that the development activity will lead to future inflows of benefits. Capitalized development costs include all direct costs and overheads that are directly attributable to the development process. If capitalized development projects meet the criteria of qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalized as part of cost in line with IAS23. The corresponding interest expense is calculated using the effective interest method. Capitalized development costs are amortized on the basis of the estimated period during which sales may be expected.
In accordance with IAS38, research costs cannot be capitalized and are therefore recognized in profit or loss directly in the consolidated income statement.

85

Financial section

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, including that leased in operating leases, are measured at cost less cumulative straight-line depreciation and cumulative impairment in line with the option provided under IAS16.
In addition to direct costs, the cost also includes appropriate portions of material and production overheads.
Borrowing costs that can be assigned directly to qualifying assets are capitalized as a part of cost in line with IAS23.
Costs of repairs to property, plant and equipment that do not result in an expansion or substantial improvement of the respective asset are recognized in profit or loss.
Investment property Investment property (IAS40: Investment Property) is recognized at cost less cumulative straight-line depreciation and cumulative impairment in line with the option provided under IAS40. The fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. This value is calculated by non-Group, independent experts in line with internationally acknowledged valuation methods; otherwise it is derived from the current market price of comparable real estate.
Leases Under finance leases, economic ownership is attributed to lessees in those cases in which they bear substantially all the risks and opportunities of ownership of the asset (IAS17). To the extent that economic ownership is attributable to the Heidelberg Group as the lessee, they are capitalized from the commencement of the lease term at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method on the basis of the shorter of the economic life or the term of the lease.

If economic ownership is not assigned to the Heidelberg Group as the lessee and the leases in question are therefore operating leases, the lease installments are recognized in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The operating leases in which we operate as the lessee predominantly relate to leased buildings. Some of the building leases contain prolongation options.

Depreciation and amortization Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment and investment property is calculated primarily on the basis of the following useful lives, which are applied uniformly throughout the Group (in years):

Development costs
Software/other rights
Buildings
Technical equipment and machinery
Other equipment, operating and office e quipment
Investment property

2016/2017

25 to 50

2017/2018
3 to 12 3 to 9
25 to 50
12 to 31
4 to 26 25 to 50

Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for an individual asset must be estimated if there is any indication that this asset could be impaired. There is a separate rule if an intangible asset (including capitalized development costs) or an item of property, plant and equipment is part of a cash-generating unit. If an asset is part of a cash-generating unit, impairment is determined on the basis of the recoverable amount of this unit. This is the rule for property, plant and equipment; the cash-generating units are the same as the segments (see note 36).
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. If goodwill has been assigned to a cash-generating unit and its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the goodwill is first

86

Consolidated financial statements

Responsibility statement

Independent auditor's report

Further information

Report of the Supervisory Board

Corporate governance and compliance

impaired by the amount of the difference. Any additional impairment requirements are recognized by way of the pro rata reduction of the carrying amounts of the other assets of the cash-generating unit.
If the reason for earlier impairment ceases to exist, the impairment on intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment is reversed. However, the carrying amount increased by reversal may not exceed amortized cost. No impairment on goodwill is reversed.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Valuations are generally determined on the basis of the weighted average cost method.
Costs include production-related full costs determined on the basis of normal capacity utilization.
In particular, the cost of products includes directly attributable direct costs (such as production materials and wages used in construction) and fixed and variable production overheads (such as materials and production overheads), including an appropriate depreciation on manufacturing equipment. Particular account is taken of costs that are charged to specific production cost centers.
The risks of holding inventories arising from reduced usability are taken into account by appropriate writedowns. These write-downs are recognized on the basis of the future production program or actual consumption. Individual periods are used for different inventory items, which are monitored and adjusted based on appropriate criteria. Measurement takes into account lower realizable net selling prices at the end of the reporting period. If the reasons for a lower valuation no longer apply to inventories that have formerly been written down and the net selling price has therefore risen, the reversal of the write-down is recognized as a reduction of the cost of materials.

Financial instruments Basic information A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognized when Heidelberg becomes party to a contract for the financial instrument. If the trade date and settlement date differ for standard purchases or sales, financial instruments are recognized at the settlement date. First-time measurement of financial assets and liabilities is at fair value. The carrying amount of financial instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss includes the directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement of financial instruments is in line with the measurement categories defined in IAS39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Under IAS 39, on first-time recognition financial assets and liabilities can be designated as financial instruments in the fair value through profit and loss category. Heidelberg did not exercise this option.
Financial assets and liabilities are reported without being offset. They are only offset when there is an enforceable legal right to do so at the end of the reporting period and the entity intends to settle them on a net basis. The recognized carrying amount of current and variable interest non-current financial assets and liabilities is an appropriate estimate of the fair value.
In accordance with IAS39, an impairment loss is recognized when there is sufficient objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset. Such evidence may lie in a deterioration of the customer's creditworthiness, delinquency or default, the restructuring of contract terms, or the increased probability that insolvency proceedings will be opened. The calculation of the amount of impairment needed takes into account historical default rates, the extent to which payment is past due, any collateral pledged and regional conditions. Financial assets are examined for impairment requirements individually (specific allowances for impairment losses). Appropriate risk provisioning was recognized for all discernible risks of default. The theoretically maximum remaining risk of default of financial assets is the same as their recognized carrying amounts.
For loans and receivables the amount of impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial asset.

87

Financial section

Impairment is either recognized directly in income by reducing the carrying amount of the financial asset or by using an allowance account. The way in which the impairment is shown is dependent on the estimated probability of the risk of default. The carrying amount of uncollectible receivables is derecognized. If the amount of the impairment is objectively reduced in subsequent reporting periods due to an event occurring after recognition of the impairment, the impairment recognized is reversed accordingly in income.
Impairment on financial assets available for sale measured at fair value is recognized in the consolidated income statement as the difference between cost (net of any principle repayments or amortization) and current fair value, less any impairment previously recognized in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses on equity instruments are not recognized in profit or loss. If the amount of the impairment on debt instruments is objectively reduced in subsequent reporting periods due to an event occurring after recognition of the impairment, the impairment recognized is reversed accordingly in income.
Impairment on financial assets available for sale carried at cost is recognized in profit or loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the current rate of return for similar financial assets. These impairment losses are not reversed.
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to cash flows end or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to another party. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or legally canceled. If financial liabilities are extinguished in full or in part via the issue of equity instruments by the obligor in accordance with IFRIC19, the difference between the carrying amount of the liability repaid and the fair value of the equity instruments issued is recognized in profit or loss. The costs attributable to the issue of equity instruments are deducted directly from equity (IAS32).

The net gains and losses essentially include changes in the fair value and exchange rate effects recognized in net operating income and the financial result and interest income and expense from financial instruments recognized in the financial result. Changes in fair value also include the effects of financial assets available for sale recognized outside profit or loss.
For information on risk management please refer to note 31 and to the Risk and Opportunity Report in the Group management report.
Financial assets Both financial and non-financial assets are reported under financial assets, which include shares in subsidiaries, other investments and securities.
IAS39 breaks down financial instruments such as securities into the categories of financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss, financial investments held to maturity and financial assets available for sale.
Securities are classified as financial assets available for sale. In line with IAS39, these financial instruments are carried at fair value. Securities are measured at their stock market prices. If this value cannot be reliably determined, securities are measured at cost. Unrealized profits and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized outside profit or loss, taking into consideration deferred taxes. At the time of a sale, realized profit or loss is taken directly to the income statement in the financial result.
The appropriate classification of securities is determined at the time of purchase and is reviewed as of the end of each reporting period.
Shares in affiliated companies and other equity investments are measured at cost.
The carrying amounts of shares in affiliated companies, other equity investments and securities measured at cost are tested for impairment as of the end of each reporting period; impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss.

Loans Loans are credit that we extend and are classified as loans and receivables under IAS39. Non-current non-interestbearing and low-interest-bearing loans are carried at net present value. After initial recognition, financial assets in the measurement category of financial assets available for sale are measured at fair value; unrealized gains and losses are recognized outside profit or loss. A reclassification from equity is performed by recognizing the accumulated losses in profit or loss only when the assets are sold or there is objective evidence of impairment. Measurement in subsequent periods is at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Receivables from sales financing Receivables from sales financing include receivables from our customers arising in connection with the financing of machinery sales and receivables under finance leases.
Finance leases include leased installations considered as sales under non-current financing. In line with IAS17, these receivables are carried at the net investment value, i.e. discounted future minimum lease payments plus any unguaranteed residual values. Lease payments are broken down into repayments and interest income, and interest income is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the term of the leases reflecting a constant periodic rate of return.
Receivables from sales financing are assigned to the IAS39 category loans and receivables and carried at fair value. Measurement in subsequent periods is at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.

Trade receivables First-time recognition of trade receivables is at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Measurement in subsequent periods is at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method due to the loans and receivables measurement category.
Receivables and other assets The receivables and other assets item includes both nonfinancial assets and financial assets including derivative financial instruments. With the exception of derivative financial instruments, financial assets are assigned to the loans and receivables category under IAS39 and are therefore measured at amortized cost. Non-financial assets are measured in line with the respective applicable standard.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash on hand and bank balances are carried at amortized cost. Bank balances have a remaining term of up to three months.
Financial liabilities Primary financial instruments include financial liabilities, trade payables and non-derivative other financial liabilities. Trade payables and non-derivative other financial liabilities include accruals for outstanding invoices and accruals relating to staff.
In accordance with IAS39, primary liabilities are stated at fair value. Directly attributable transaction costs are included for financial liabilities not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Measurement in subsequent periods is at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Liabilities from finance leases are recognized in the amount of the present value of the minimum lease payments. Financial guarantees are recognized at the higher of the amount calculated in line with IAS37 and the initial amount carried as a liability less any amortization. They are reported under other provisions.

Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments in the Heidelberg Group comprise hedging instruments used to manage interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments serve to reduce income volatility. The Group does not enter into trading positions, i.e. derivatives without an underlying hedged item. We currently use over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. At present, these are exclusively forward exchange transactions.
The scope of hedging by financial derivatives comprises recognized, onerous and highly probable hedged items.
In accordance with IAS39, derivatives meet the recognition criteria for assets and liabilities, as a result of which they must be capitalized (other assets) or expensed (other liabilities) at fair value. First-time recognition is as of the settlement date.
Under IAS39, the distinction between a fair value hedge and a cash flow hedge is of fundamental importance for hedge accounting.
The aim of a fair value hedge is to offset the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities with opposing changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument. Any profit or loss resulting from the change in fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognized directly in the consolidated income statement. From the inception of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are also recognized in profit or loss.
A cash flow hedge serves to hedge the changes in cash flows that typically arise in connection with floating rate assets or liabilities recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, foreign currency onerous contracts or planned future transactions. The gains and losses of the fair value of derivatives designated as a hedging instrument are recognized outside profit or loss until the respective hedged item becomes effective.
Hedging instruments that do not satisfy the documentation requirements of IAS39 for hedge accounting or whose underlying hedged items no longer exist are classified as held for trading.

Hybrid financial instruments Financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component are recognized in different items in the statement of financial position according to their nature. As of the date of issue the fair value of the liability component, which is the present value of the contractually determined future payments, is recognized as a bond liability. The conversion option is recognized in capital reserves as the difference between the issue proceeds and the fair value of the liability component. During the term of the bond the interest expense of the liability component is calculated using the market interest rate as of the issue date for a similar bond without a conversion option. The issuing costs of convertible bonds reduce the cost of the equity or liability components in direct proportion. The deduction from equity is recognized outside profit or loss after taking into account any related income tax benefit.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated in accordance with the liability method (IAS12). Under this method, deferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between IFRS carrying amounts and the tax carrying amounts of the individual companies or Group companies and on corresponding consolidation adjustments. In addition, deferred tax assets for future benefits from tax loss carryforwards are also taken into account. Deferred tax assets for accounting differences and for tax loss carryforwards are recognized in the amount for which it is probable that taxable income will be available, i.e. for which utilization seems reasonably assured. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the income tax rates of the respective countries. A tax rate of 28.15 percent (previous year: 28.19 percent) is used to calculate domestic deferred taxes. In addition to the corporation tax of 15 percent and the solidarity surcharge of 5.5 percent, the average trade tax rate was also taken into account.
In accordance with the provisions of IAS12, neither deferred tax assets nor liabilities have been discounted. Deferred tax assets were offset against deferred tax liabilities when required according to the provisions of IAS12. In line with this, offsetting must be effected if there is a

legally enforceable right to offset the actual taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and originate from the same company or in the same group of controlled c ompanies.

In the case of defined contribution plans, compulsory contributions are offset directly as an expense. No provisions for pension obligations are recognized, as in these cases the Company does not have any obligation beyond that to pay premiums.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations The pensions and similar obligations comprise the obligations of the Group to establish provisions under both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
In the case of defined benefit plans, the pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method (IAS19). Under this method, expert actuarial reports are commissioned each year. The discount rate used for the present values of defined benefit obligations is based on the yields of high-quality corporate bonds with matching maturities and currencies and ratings of AA on the basis of the information provided by Bloomberg. This discount rate is also used to determine the net interest on the net liability/asset from defined benefit plans. Mortality and retirement rates are calculated in Germany according to the current 2005 G Heubeck mortality tables and outside Germany according to comparable foreign mortality tables. Plan assets carried at fair value are offset against defined benefit obligations. Current service cost and any past service cost is recognized immediately and reported under staff costs; the net interest expense, as the net total of interest expenses on benefit obligations and interest income on plan assets, is reported in the financial result. Gains or losses resulting from changed expectations with regard to life expectancy, future pension and salary increases and the discount rate from the actual developments during the period are recognized outside profit or loss directly in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income. Recognition of the gains or losses from remeasurements reported in other comprehensive income in profit or loss in later periods is not permitted. The difference between the (interest) income on plan assets calculated at the start of the period and the actual return on plan assets determined at the end of the period is also recognized outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income.

Other provisions Other provisions, including tax provisions (for current taxes) are recognized when a past event gives rise to a current obligation, utilization is more likely than not and its amount can be reliably estimated. This means that the probability must exceed 50 percent. They are measured either at the most likely settlement amount or, if probabilities are equal, at the expected settlement amount. Provisions are only recognized for legal or constructive obligations in respect of third parties. Provisions are measured at full production cost, taking into consideration possible cost increases. Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized to the extent that the criteria of IAS37 are met.
Non-current provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are carried at the discounted settlement amount at the end of the reporting period on the basis of appropriate interest rates if the time value of money is material. The underlying interest rates depend on the term of the obligation.

Cash-settled share-based payment From the 2017/2018 financial year, in the context of the multi-year variable remuneration of the Management Board, share-based, cash-settled payment has been granted on the basis of the total shareholder return performance indicator. This is then paid out at the end of the respective three-year performance period. In accordance with IFRS2, this remuneration component is measured on the basis of fair value using a Monte Carlo situation. Given a three-year vesting period, the respective fair value is recalculated as of the end of each reporting period and as of the settlement date, and recognized in staff costs starting from the year granted.
Advance payments received Advance payments received from customers are recognized under liabilities.
Government grants For taxable government investment subsidies and tax-free investment allowances there is an option to recognize these as deferred income or deduct them when determining the carrying amount of the asset. Heidelberg reports these subsidies as deferred income that is reversed and recognized as income in line with the expected pattern of economic benefits from the asset over its useful life.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that relate to past events and whose existence will not be confirmed until one or more uncertain future events occur. These future events, however, lie outside the sphere of influence of the Heidelberg Group. Furthermore, current obligations can represent contingent liabilities if the outflow of resources is not sufficiently probable to recognize a respective provision or if the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of contingent liabilities is equal to the best possible estimate of the settlement amount resulting from the liability.

7 Estimates and judgments
When preparing consolidated financial statements, certain assumptions and estimates are made that have an effect on the amount and reporting of assets and liabilities, information on contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period and on income and expense reported in the period under review. The preparer of consolidated financial statements has a degree of discretion here.
The following are the key issues affected by assumptions and estimates:
¬ assessing the recoverability of goodwill, ¬the measurement of other intangible assets and of
items of property, plant and equipment,
¬assessing impairment of trade receivables and
r eceivables from sales financing,
¬ recognition and measurement of other provisions, ¬recognition and measurement of provisions for
pensions and similar obligations.
In the impairment test for goodwill, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined as the higher of its fair value less the cost to sell and its value in use. The fair value here reflects the best estimate of the price independent market participants would receive under standard market conditions for the sale of the cashgenerating units at the end of the reporting period. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit. A change in determining factors may change the fair value or the value in use and could result in the recognition of an impairment loss.

The goodwill impairment test is based on the parameters listed in note 18. As in the previous year, increasing the discount rate before taxes by one percentage point to 7.5 percent (previous year: 7.8 percent) for the cash-generating unit Heidelberg Digital Technology (previous year: Heidelberg Equipment) and 7.6 percent (previous year: 7.9 percent) for the cash-generating unit Heidelberg Digital Business and Services (previous year: Heidelberg Services) would not result in any impairment requirements. The same applies to a reduction in the growth factor used to calculate the perpetual annuity by one percentage point either way and 5 percent for the reduction in the result of operating activities.
The useful lives used throughout the Group for intangible assets ­ with the exception of goodwill ­ and for items of property, plant and equipment are subject to management assessments. In addition, the impairment test determines the recoverable amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit to which the asset is attributed as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value here reflects the best estimate of the amount for which an independent third party would acquire the asset at the end of the reporting period. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows that can be anticipated from the continued use of the asset or cashgenerating unit. A change in determining factors may change the fair value or the value in use, and could result in the recognition or reversal of an impairment loss.

Credit and default risks arise for trade receivables and receivables from sales financing to the extent that customers do not meet their payment obligations and assets are lost as a result. The necessary impairment is calculated in line with the creditworthiness of customers, any collateral pledged and experience based on historical default rates. The customer's actual default may differ from the expected default on account of the underlying factors.
The amount and probability of utilization are estimated in the recognition and measurement of other provisions. They are measured either at the most likely settlement amount or, if probabilities are equal, at the expected settlement amount. The amount of the actual utilization can deviate from estimates. Please refer to note 26 for information on the sensitivity analysis regarding provisions for pensions and similar obligations.
The assumptions and estimates are based on the information and data currently available. Actual developments can deviate from the estimates. The carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are adjusted accordingly if actual amounts deviate from estimated values.

 17Taxes on income

Taxes on income are broken down as follows:

Current taxes of which Germany of which abroad
Deferred taxes of which Germany of which abroad

2016/2017 2017/2018

8,124 (1,286) (6,838) ­10,113 (­100) (­10,013) ­1,989

4,025 (2,015) (2,010) 21,550 (­408) (21,958) 25,575

As in the previous year, the adoption of amended or new standards did not result in any additional tax expenses or tax income.
Taxes on income comprise German corporate tax (15 percent) plus the solidarity surcharge (5.5 percent), trade tax (12.32 percent; previous year: 12.36 percent) and comparable taxes of the foreign subsidiaries. The nominal total German tax rate is 28.15 percent for the financial year (previous year: 28.19 percent).
No deferred tax liabilities were recognized for temporary differences on shares in subsidiaries of 181,564 thousand (previous year: 185,534 thousand) as it is unlikely that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future or the corresponding effects are not subject to taxation. Any recognition of deferred taxes would be based on the respective applicable tax rates in line with local taxation on distributed dividends.
Deferred tax expenses resulting from the write-down and deferred tax income from the reversal of a previous write-down of deferred tax assets on temporary differences in the reporting year amounted to 0 thousand (previous year: 459 thousand) and 1,992 thousand (previous year: 3,206 thousand) respectively. Driven by the US tax reform, the US tax group is reporting deferred tax expenses of 25,120 thousand, while the cut in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent did not affect cash.

Total tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets were recognized amount to 1,284,018 thousand (previous year: 1,277,236 thousand). Of these, 12,534 thousand can be used by 2021 (previous year: 7,517 thousand by 2020), 3 thousand by 2022 (previous year: 2 thousand by 2021) 428 thousand by 2023 (previous year: 593 thousand by 2022) and 1,271,053 by 2024 and later (previous year: 1,269,124 by 2023 and later).
For interest carryforwards amounting to 78,712 thousand (previous year: 73,996 thousand) no deferred tax assets were recognized.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized for tax loss carryforwards and interest carryforwards if their realization is guaranteed in the near future. Write-downs of deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards recognized in previous years were recognized in the amount of 1,802 thousand in the year under review (previous year: 840 thousand). Deferred tax assets totaling 5,468 thousand (previous year: 7,270 thousand) were recognized in the reporting year on tax loss carryforwards not previously recognized. In the reporting year deferred tax assets on current tax losses in the amount of 897 thousand (previous year: 1,126 thousand) were recognized in profit or loss.
The reversals of deferred tax assets on temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards not yet recognized relate essentially to foreign European sales companies. The reversal is essentially due to the economic recovery of the sales company.

Deferred tax assets of 7,786 thousand (previous year: 76,070 thousand) were capitalized at companies that generated a tax loss in the reporting year or in the prior financial year, as on the basis of tax planning it was assumed that positive taxable income will be available in the foreseeable future.
No income from loss carrybacks was recognized in the reporting year or the previous year.
Unutilized tax credit for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position amounted to 3,801 thousand (previous year: 4,752 thousand).
Current taxes were reduced in the reporting year by 1,675 thousand (previous year: 2,424 thousand) as a result of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards that had not previously been taken into account. In the reporting period, current income taxes included net prior-period income of 5,788 thousand (previous year: 1,813 thousand).
Taxes on income can be derived from the net result before taxes as follows:

Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position
18 Intangible assets
goodwill includes amounts arising from the takeover of businesses (asset deals) and from the acquisition of shares in companies (share deals). For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are allocated to cash-generating units. These are the same as the segments (see note 36). The carrying amounts of the goodwill associated with the cash-generating units Heidelberg Digital Technology (previous year: Heidelberg Equipment) and Heidelberg Digital Business and Services (previous year: Heidelberg Services) total 60,816 thousand (previous year: 64,948 thousand) and 66,405 thousand (previous year: 59,499 thousand) respectively.
According to IAS36, as part of the impairment test the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined based on the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The fair value here reflects the best estimate of the price independent market participants would receive under standard market conditions for the sale of the cash-generating units at the end of the reporting period. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit. The calculation of the value in use by Heidelberg on the basis of the discounted cash flow method is based on the planning authorized by the Management Board, which in turn is based on medium-term planning for the result of operating activities for a period of five (previous year: five) financial years. This planning process is based on past experience, external information sources and expectations of future market development. Key assumptions on which the calculation of the value in use by the management is based include forecasts in the planning period of the development of sale prices, the EBITDA margin, sales growth, market prices for raw materials, the Company's investment activities and the costs of capital. A constant growth rate of 1 percent and unchanging investment activity are assumed after the end of the planning period to show expected inflation.
As a result, and as in the previous year, there were no impairment requirements for the Heidelberg Digital Technology (previous year: Heidelberg Equipment), Heidelberg

97

Financial section

Digital Business and Services (previous year: Heidelberg Services) or Heidelberg Financial Services cash-generating units.
The calculated cash flows were discounted on the basis of market data using weighted average costs of capital (WACC) before taxes of 6.5 percent (previous year: 6.8 percent) for the Heidelberg Digital Technology (previous year: Heidelberg Equipment) cash-generating unit and of 6.6 percent (previous year: 6.9 percent) for the Heidelberg Digital Business and Services (previous year: Heidelberg Services) cash-generating unit.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted as part of the impairment test in accordance with the requirements of IAS36.134; no impairment requirements were identified (see note 7).
Capitalized development costs mainly relate to the development of machinery in the digital printing sector in the Heidelberg Digital Technology and the Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segments. Non-capitalized development costs from all segments ­ including research expenses ­ amount to 93,485 thousand in the reporting year (previous year: 84,038 thousand).
 19Property, plant and equipment and investment property
The carrying amounts of assets capitalized in non-current assets from finance leases in which we are the lessee are 769 thousand (previous year: 1,204 thousand) for land and buildings and 3,146 thousand (previous year: 3,946 thousand) for other equipment, operating and office equipment. The latter are vehicles and IT equipment.
The carrying amounts of assets capitalized in non-current assets from operating leases in which we are the lessor are 9,075 thousand (previous year: 10,779 thousand). These assets are reported under technical equipment and machinery. These assets are printing presses leased to customers. The gross carrying amounts were 19,803 thousand (previous year: 30,763 thousand) and cumulative depreciation amounted to 10,728 thousand (previous year: 19,983 thousand). Depreciation of 3,485 thousand (previous year: 4,039 thousand) was recognized in the reporting year. Future lease income of 10,217 thousand (previous year: 3,280 thousand) is anticipated from operating

leases. Payments with maturities of up to one year, between one and five years and more than five years amount to 2,700 thousand (previous year: 1,236 thousand), 7,517 thousand (previous year: 2,021 thousand) and 0 thousand (previous year: 23 thousand) respectively.
In connection with the refinancing of the Heidelberg Group (see note 28), property, plant and equipment, as well as investment property were pledged as collateral by way of assignment and the appointment of a collective land charge. The carrying amounts of this collateral as of the end of the reporting period were 381,798 thousand (previous year: 331,156 thousand) and 5,097 thousand (previous year: 5,064 thousand).
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment that are partially unused or are no longer used are of minor significance.
For property, plant and equipment leased to customers of the Heidelberg Group in finance leases, corresponding receivables have been capitalized in the amount of the discounted future minimum lease payments. Leased items are therefore not reported under non-current assets.
The fair value of investment property (IAS40: Investment Property) corresponds to the second level in the measurement hierarchy according to IFRS13 and is 12,352 thousand (previous year: 12,879 thousand). Investment property with a fair value of 5,191 thousand (previous year: 6,942 thousand) was measured by non-Group independent experts in line with internationally acknowledged valuation methods. The other fair values were derived from current market prices of comparable real estate.
As in the previous year, only immaterial current income or expenses were incurred in connection with investment property in the reporting year.
20 Financial assets
Financial assets include shares in subsidiaries totaling 4,945 thousand (previous year: 5,920 thousand), other investments of 3,388 thousand (previous year: 3,388 thousand) and securities of 3,853 thousand (previous year: 4,131 thousand). Information on the fair value of the securities is included in note 31.

In order to adjust inventories to the net realizable value, impairment of 1,502 thousand was recognized in the year under review (previous year: 1,432 thousand). The reason for the write-down to the lower net realizable value is primarily the decreased likelihood of market success for a small portion of our inventories. Remarketed equipment was repossessed as collateral owing to the insolvency of customers. In the year under review, remarketed equipment of 0 thousand (previous year: 1,340 thousand) was reported under finished goods and goods held for resale. The repossession of this collateral resulted in cash and cash equivalents of 3,451 thousand (previous year: 717 thousand) at German companies in the reporting period.
The carrying amount of the inventories pledged as collateral in connection with the refinancing of the Heidelberg Group (see note 28) was 386,570 thousand (previous year: 356,637 thousand).

25 Equity
Share capital/number of shares outstanding/ treasury stock The shares are bearer shares and grant a pro rata amount of 2.56 in the fully paid-in share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft.
The share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft amounts to 713,562,818.56 and is divided into 278,735,476 shares.

For this purpose, the share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft was contingently increased originally by up to 58,625,953.28, divided into 22,900,763 shares (contingent capital 2014).
On March 30, 2015, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft issued an unsecured, unsubordinated convertible bond with an option for conversion into shares in Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft (convertible bond 2015). This convertible bond has an issue volume of 58,600,000.00, a term of seven years (maturity date: March 30, 2022) and a coupon of 5.25 percent per annum, which is distributed at the end of every quarter.
From April 20, 2018, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is entitled to repay the convertible bond 2015 ahead of schedule in full at the nominal value plus accrued interest. This requires that the share price multiplied by the applicable conversion ratio on 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the announcement of the date of the early repayment exceeds 130 percent of the nominal value as of each of these 20 trading days. Each holder of the convertible bond 2015 is entitled to demand the repayment of all or some of his/her bonds for which the conversion right was not exercised and for which early repayment was announced by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft as of March 30, 2020 at the set nominal amount plus interest incurred by March 30, 2020 (exclusively).
On July 24, 2015, the Annual General Meeting resolved the cancellation of Contingent Capital 2014 to the extent that it is not intended to serve rights under the 2015 convertible bond. The share capital of Heidelberger Druck maschinen Aktiengesellschaft has now been contingently increased by up to 48,230,453.76, divided into 18,840,021 shares, through Contingent Capital 2014; details on Contingent Capital 2014 can be found in Article 3 (3) of the Articles of Association.

Retained earnings The retained earnings include the earnings generated by consolidated subsidiaries in previous years, the effects of consolidation and the effects of the remeasurement of net liabilities (assets) under defined benefit pension plans.
Other retained earnings The other retained earnings include exchange rate effects and IAS39 fair value changes outside profit or loss.

 26Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
The Heidelberg Group operates pension schemes ­ either directly or through premium payments to schemes financed by private institutions ­ for the majority of employees for the time after their retirement. The amount of benefit payments depends on the conditions in particular countries. The amounts are generally based on the term of employment and the salary of the employees. Liabilities include both those arising from current pensions and vested pension rights for pensions payable in the future. Financing of pension payments expected following the start of benefit payments is distributed over the employee's full period of employment.
Notes on significant pension commitments heidelberger druckmaschinen aktiengesellschaft (based in heidelberg, germany), heidelberger druck maschinen vertrieb deutschland gmbh, heidelberg postpress deutschland gmbh and heidelberg manufacturing deutschland gmbh (each based in wieslosch, germany) accounted for 938 million (previous year: 905 million) of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 461 million (previous year: 472 million) of plan assets.
Until financial year 2014/2015, benefit commitments essentially comprised retirement, disability and surviving dependents benefits (widows', widowers' and orphans' pension) plus an age bonus and death benefits. The amount of retirement and disability pensions was based on the pension group to which the employee is assigned on the basis of his/her pensionable income and the eligible years of service. In the event of disability this also takes into account creditable additional periods of coverage. Pensionable years of service are all years of service spent by the employee at the Company, starting from the age of 20, until the pension begins.
The funded, defined benefit plans financed at Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Vertrieb Deutschland GmbH were closed to new entrants on February 28, 2006.

The employees of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktien gesellschaft and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Vertrieb Deutschland GmbH who joined the Company after March 1, 2006 were assigned to an employer-financed defined contribution policy offered by an insurance provider.
By way of agreement with the Group Works Council of February 27, 2015, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktien gesellschaft and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Vertrieb Deutschland GmbH introduced a new pension system effective from January 1, 2015, with greater incentives for private retirement provision. This agreement changed the defined benefit plan described above to a defined contribution plan, which also still includes retirement, disability and surviving dependents benefits (widows', widowers' and orphans' benefits). The new general works agreement applies to future pensions for active employees at Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Vertrieb Deutschland GmbH and Heidelberg Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, which was spun off with effect from April 1, 2015. The pension components vested in accordance with the old system were transferred in the form that a corresponding initial component was credited to the pension account of the respective employee as of April 1, 2015, for the pension commitments as of March 31, 2015 (transfer date). The amount of this initial component is based on the monthly pension achieved by March 31, 2015, multiplied by a flat-rate capitalization factor. The annual pension contribution is determined based on the employee's completed years of service on the basis of the respective eligible remuneration. In addition, for each active employee with a deferred compensation plan, the employer will provide a further annual contribution to the employee's pension account based on his/her supplementary benefit contribution and amounting to a quarter of the cumulative deferred compensation amount of the employee per financial year and capped at a maximum amount. The pension credit is paid out in 12 annual installments, or optionally the employee can choose 14 annual installments with an increased initial installment. Alternatively, the employee can access his/her pension credit as a pension for life and, under certain conditions, have this

paid out as a one-time capital payment. The installment/annuity payment option of 60 percent/40 percent constitutes a further actuarial assumption for calculation of the present value of the defined benefit obligation in Germany.
As part of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) at Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Vertrieb Deutschland GmbH set up in March 2006, assets were transferred to a trustee, Heidelberg Pension-Trust e.V., Heidelberg, which is legally independent from the Company. The respective trust agreement establishes a management trust between the respective company and the trustee and a security trust between the trustee and the beneficiaries (dual trust). The purpose of the CTA is to finance all pension obligations. The respective plan assets are managed by the trustee in accordance with the respective trust agreement.
As of March 1, 2006 a defined contribution plan was introduced for key executives. This provides for interest on contributions based on salary and EBIT at rates based on the respective maximum permissible interest rate for life assurance companies in Germany and the investment of the CTA's assets. This plan provides for a capital payout with the option of conversion into a pension for life. Furthermore, this group of persons has the option of deferred compensation to increase the employer-funded benefit scheme.
In Germany there are no legal or regulatory minimum allocation obligations.
For details of the pension commitments for members of the Management Board of Heidelberger Druck maschinen Aktiengesellschaft please see the remuneration report in the Group management report.
The heidelberg group pension scheme in the UK comprises a defined benefit and a defined contribution plan. The Heidelberg Pension Scheme accounts for 242 million (previous year: 250 million) of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 230 million (previous year: 233 million) of plan assets. The defined benefit portion is based on final salary with a guaranteed pension level. The pension level is dependent on the length

107

Financial section

of employment and the respective salary before retiring. Pension payments are adjusted based on the development of the retail price index. This plan is subject to the statutory funding objective under the UK Pension Act 2004. The necessary financing is performed at least every three years by way of so-called technical assessments. These determine whether the statutory funding objective has been complied with. The defined benefit plan is managed by a trustee, the board of which is elected partly by the Company and partly by the members of the plan. The trustee is responsible for obtaining the assessment, the pension payments and investing the plan assets; if necessary these functions are transferred to professional advisors. The last assessment of technical funding took place as at March 31, 2015 and ­ on the basis of the assumptions at this date determined by the trustee ­ identified a technical funding deficit of GBP 14.0 million. On the basis of this, the agreement reached in July 2013 between Heidelberg and the trustee for annual payments over ten years of GBP 2.47 million, commencing in July 2013, will continue. The assessment of technical funding as of March 31, 2018 has not been completed.
The pension funds of the swiss companies, which manage pension assets as foundations independent of the Company and are subject to Swiss legislation on occupational pensions, accounted for 139 million (previous year: 153 million) of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 138 million (previous year: 150 million) of plan assets. These obligations are based on retirement, disability and surviving dependents benefits. The retirement benefits are usually a pension. This is determined based on the individual pension credit saved by the employee by the time of retirement and the regulatory conversion rates. However, at the discretion of the employee, pension credit can also be drawn in the form of a lump sum payment. Disability and surviving dependents benefits are calculated from the pension credit projected at regulatory retirement age and/or are defined as a percentage of the pay insured. For each insured employee, the Swiss companies pay an annual employer's contribution to the respective pension fund. The amount of this is determined in the

respective pension regulations as a percentage of the pay insured and can be adjusted by the pension fund board of trustees, which consists of equal numbers of employer and employee representatives. In the event of a severe deficit the pension fund board of trustees can resolve to impose recapitalization contributions, if there are no other measures to remedy the deficit. In such an event, the Swiss companies would be legally required to pay at least as much as the respective employee contributions.
The heidelberg australia superannuation fund in Australia comprises defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The Heidelberg Australia Superannuation Fund accounts for 7 million (previous year: 9 million) of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 9 million (previous year: 12 million) of plan assets. The defined benefit component is based on the average final salary and the length of employment. As their pension benefit, some entitled members of this plan receive the higher of the respective defined benefit obligation and an obligation accrued during the qualifying period based on the individual contributions by the employee and corresponding capital gains; entitlement to this is dependent on when employees joined the plan. The Heidelberg Australia Superannuation Fund is subject to the statutory minimum benefit obligation as per the superannuation guarantee legislation, which provides for a gradual increase in minimum obligations from July 1, 2013. It is managed by an independent trustee, the board of which is equally appointed by the Company and elected by the members of the plan. The trustee is required to act in the best interests of the plan members.
Notes on risks In addition to the standard actuarial risks, the defined benefit obligations are exposed in particular to financial risks in connection with plan assets, which above all can comprise counterparty and market price risks.

Corporate governance and compliance

The plan assets serve exclusively to satisfy defined benefit obligations. The funding of these defined benefit obligations with assets constitutes a reserve for future cash outflows in the form of pension payments, which is based on the statutory regulations in place in some countries and is voluntary in others, such as Germany.
The ratio of the fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations is referred to as the funding ratio of the respective pension plan. If the defined benefit obligations (DBO) exceed the plan assets, this is a plan deficit; the reverse is an excess.
However, it should be noted that both the defined benefit obligations and the plan assets fluctuate over time. This gives rise to the risk of a growing plan deficit. Depending on the statutory regulations in the respective countries, there is a legal obligation to reduce this deficit by contributing additional funding. Fluctuations can arise in the measurement of defined benefit obligations in that the underlying actuarial assumptions, such as discounting rates, the development of pensions and salaries or life expectancy, are subject to adjustments that can materially influence the amount of defined benefit obligations. The return on plan assets is assumed in the amount of discounting rates, which are also used in determining the defined benefit obligations and are based on corporate bonds rated AA. If the actual return on plan assets is less than the discounting rates applied the net liability under defined benefit plans increases. However, given the equity backing ratio it is assumed that the actual return can contribute to greater volatility in the fair value of plan assets in the medium and long term. Possible inflation risks, which could lead to a rise in defined benefit obligations, exist to the extent that some plans are based on final salary.
The material German and international pension plans in the Heidelberg Group are subject to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and risks of pay increases. The Swiss pension funds are also exposed to the risk that, in the event of a severe deficit, the effectiveness of recapitalization would be limited to the

extent that this would have to be covered by future pension beneficiaries and the employer as it is legally prohibited to include current pensioners in the recapitalization.

The information on pensions is structured as follows:

1)Composition and development of the net carrying amounts
2)Development of net liability from defined benefit plans
3) Composition of plan assets 4) Costs of defined contribution plans 5) Sensitivity analysis 6)Forecast contributions to plan assets, future forecast

for "age x+1" in each case (age shift)

In the sensitivity analysis, one actuarial assumption was changed at a time while the other actuarial assumptions remained constant. In actual fact, there are dependencies between actuarial assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and forecast pay increases, as both are based to a certain degree on the forecast inflation rate. The sensitivity analysis does not take these dependencies into account. The sensitivity analysis is performed on the basis of the projected unit credit method, which was also used to calculate the defined benefit obligations.

6)The forecast contributions to plan assets are expected to amount to 8 million in financial year 2018/2019 (previous year: 8.5 million). With regard to the essential defined benefit obligations, undiscounted pension payments amounting to 43 million (previous year: 44.5 million) are anticipated for financial year 2018/2019. The weighted average duration of the material defined benefit obligations is 16 years (previous year: 16.5 years).

Additions include accrued interest and the effects of the change in discount rates of 2,408 thousand (previous year: 1,886 thousand). These relate to expenses of 326 thousand (previous year: 358 thousand) for staff obligations, 19 thousand (previous year: 30 thousand) for sales obligations and expenses of 2,063 thousand (previous year: 1,498 thousand) for miscellaneous other provisions.
As in previous years, tax provisions primarily recognize the risks of additional assessments.
staff provisions essentially relate to bonuses (49,426 thousand; previous year: 53,838 thousand) and the cost of early retirement payments and partial retirement programs (8,256 thousand; previous year: 9,276 thousand).
sales provisions mainly relate to warranties, reciprocal liability and buyback obligations (42,180 thousand; previous year: 46,751 thousand). The provisions for warranty obligations and obligations to provide subsequent performance and product liability serve to cover risks that

are either not insured or which go beyond insurable risks. Utilization of these provisions in Germany is predominantly expected over a short- to medium-term horizon. The reciprocal liability and buyback obligations of 1,859 thousand (previous year: 3,038 thousand) relate entirely to financial guarantees (previous year: 3,038 thousand) generally issued to finance partners of our customers for sales financing. The maximum risk of default of these financial guarantees that can result in cash outflows in the subsequent financial year is 17,832 thousand (previous year: 21,724 thousand). Utilization of the provisions for reciprocal liability and buyback obligations is predominantly expected over a short- to medium-term horizon. In connection with the finance guarantees for sales financing, there are claims against third parties for the transfer of machinery. Outstanding claims were not capitalized.
miscellaneous other provisions include provisions for onerous contracts of 44,599 thousand (previous year: 58,663 thousand) and provisions for legal disputes

of 14,629 thousand (previous year: 16,526 thousand). Furthermore, there are provisions of 60,681 thousand (previous year: 66,244 thousand) relating to portfolio and capacity adjustments and measures to optimize our management and organizational structure. Utilization of these provisions is primarily expected over a short- to mediumterm horizon.
As part of general business operations, Heidelberg is involved in judicial and extra-judicial legal disputes in different jurisdictions whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. For example, legal disputes may arise in connection with product liability cases and warranties. Provisions are recognized for risks resulting from legal disputes that are not already covered by insurance, provided utilization is likely and the probable amount of the provision required can be reliably estimated. The assumptions

required for this mean that the recognition and measurement of provisions for legal disputes is subject to uncertainty.
The provisions recognized as of the end of the reporting period for legal disputes predominantly relate to the categories described below.
The major legal disputes relate to product liability cases in connection with machinery whose production has already been discontinued and that were produced and sold by the former Linotype-Hell Aktiengesellschaft and its legal successors. In addition, there are legal disputes regarding warranty cases in connection with sales of machinery that could also lead to rescission. Provisions have been recognized at an appropriate amount for these; their amount is monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary.

Corporate bond On May 5, 2015, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft issued an unsecured corporate bond of 205 million with a maturity of seven years and a coupon of 8.00 percent (2015 corporate bond).
The fair value of the 2015 corporate bond on the basis of the stock exchange listing is 214,503 thousand (previous year: 222,555 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 204,320 thousand (previous year: 202,943 thousand). In both cases, the fair values correspond to level 1 of the measurement hierarchy set out in IFRS13, as only quoted prices observed on active markets are used in m easurement.
Convertible bonds On July 10, 2013, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktien gesellschaft issued an unsecured, unsubordinated convertible bond with an option for conversion into shares in Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft (convertible bond 2013). This convertible bond had an initial volume of 60 million and a term of four years.
As a result of the conversion of five partial bonds on November 18, 2013 (see note 25), the original total nominal amount of the convertible bond had decreased by 0.5 million from 60 million to 59.5 million.
From July 30, 2014, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft was entitled to repay the 2013 convertible bond in full ahead of schedule at the nominal value plus accrued interest.
The liability component of the 2013 convertible bond was recognized at present value on issue, taking into account a market interest rate, and was increased at the end of each reporting period by the interest portion of that period in line with the effective interest rate method. The amount of interest accrued, which results from the difference between the coupon and the effective interest rate, was 99 thousand in the year under review.
In June 2017, 21,297,697 new shares were issued from Contingent Capital 2012 to meet demands under the convertible bond 2013. This increased the share capital of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft from 659,040,714.24 to 713,562,818.56, now divided into 278,735,476 shares. The remaining issue volume of the convertible bond 2013 of 3.7 million was fully repaid at maturity on July 10, 2017.

On March 30, 2015, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft issued an unsecured, unsubordinated convertible bond with an option for conversion into shares in Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft (convertible bond 2015). This convertible bond has a volume of 58.6 million and is convertible into approximately 18.84 million no-par shares. The convertible bond was issued in denominations of 100,000. It has a term of seven years, was issued at 100 percent of the nominal value and is 100 percent repayable. The coupon is 5.25 percent p.a. and is distributed at the end of every quarter. The initial exercise price per underlying share is 3.1104 at an initial conversion ratio of 32,150.2058.
From April 20, 2018, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is entitled to repay the convertible bond 2015 ahead of schedule in full at the nominal value plus accrued interest. This requires that the share price multiplied by the applicable conversion ratio on 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the announcement of the date of the early repayment exceeds 130 percent of the nominal value as of each of these 20 trading days. Each holder of the convertible bond 2015 is entitled to demand the repayment of all or some of his/her bonds for which the conversion right was not exercised and for which early repayment was announced by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft as of March 30, 2020 at the set nominal amount plus interest incurred by March 30, 2020 (exclusively).
The liability component of the 2015 convertible bond was recognized at present value on issue, taking into account a market interest rate, and is increased at the end of each reporting period by the interest portion of that period in line with the effective interest rate method. The amount of interest accrued, which results from the difference between the coupon and the effective interest rate, was 1,197 thousand in the year under review.
The fair value of the 2015 convertible bond on the basis of the stock exchange listing corresponds to the first level of the IFRS13 measurement hierarchy and is 69,833 thousand (previous year: 61,487 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 55,890 thousand (previous year: 53,562 thousand).

In connection with the borrowing of a long-term loan in 2008 (March 31, 2018: 0 thousand; previous year: 9,082 thousand), the lender was granted usufructuary rights to three developed properties. The basis of this was a sale (usufructuary rights) and leaseback transaction in accordance with SIC27, which had a fixed basic term for the lease agreement of ten years and provided for two renewal options of four years each. The usufructuary rights each had an original term of 18 years. The usufructuary rights were able to be commuted after ten years. On December 11, 2017, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft exercised the contractually agreed call option. The usufructuary rights to the three developed properties accordingly expired at the end of the fixed basic term on March 26, 2018.
The Heidelberg Group was able to meet its financial obligations at all times in the reporting year. The credit lines not yet fully utilized in our Group of 336,738 thousand (previous year: 286,096 thousand) can be used as financing for general business purposes and for measures in connection with our portfolio adjustments.
The revolving credit facility that came into force in 2011 with an original term until the end of 2014 was extended ahead of schedule in December 2013 until mid-2017 and ahead of schedule in July 2015 until June 2019. In March 2018, this revolving credit facility was agreed anew with a consortium of banks at improved conditions with a volume of 320 million and a term until March 2023.

An amortizing loan funded by the KfW in the amount of 20 million maturing in December 2018 was issued in April 2014. Its fair value on the basis of the discounted cash flow method using market interest rates corresponds to the second level of the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy and is 4,264 thousand (previous year: 8,521 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 4,211 thousand (previous year: 7,368 thousand).
Another amortizing loan funded by the KfW in the amount of 5 million maturing in September 2020 was issued in December 2015. Its fair value on the basis of the discounted cash flow method using market interest rates likewise corresponds to the second level of the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy and is 2,769 thousand (previous year: 3,768 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 2,750 thousand (previous year: 3,500 thousand).
On March 31, 2016, a loan of 100 million with a staggered term until March 2024 was agreed with the European Investment Bank to support Heidelberg's research and development activities, especially with regard to digitalization, and the expansion of the digital printing portfolio. The development loan is available in callable tranches, each with a term of seven years. In April 2016, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft called an initial tranche of 50 million from this loan; this will amortize by April 2023. The remainder was called in January and March 2017 via further tranches of 20 million and 30 million respectively; these will amortize accordingly over terms until January 2024 and March 2024 respectively. The fair value of the loan on the basis of the discounted cash flow method using market interest rates corresponds to the second level of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and is 90,388 thousand (previous year: 88,360 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 100,739 thousand (previous year: 100,739 thousand).

Financial section

To finance the investment in relocating our research and development activities to our Wiesloch-Walldorf site, a development loan of 42.1 million maturing in September 2024 was arranged with a syndicate of banks refinanced by KfW ("Energy Efficiency Program ­ Energy-efficient Construction and Renovation"). The funding will be disbursed over the course of construction. Heidelberger Druck maschinen Aktiengesellschaft called an initial tranche of 5.1 million from this development loan in March 2017 and a second tranche of 20.7 million in March 2018. Its fair value on the basis of the discounted cash flow method using market interest rates corresponds to the second level of the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy and is 24,658 thousand (previous year: 4,968 thousand) compared to the carrying amount of 25,798 thousand (previous year: 5,138 thousand).
A loan of 25.7 million amortizing by the end of June 2027 was borrowed in May 2017. It is secured by the lender's equal participation in the existing collateral concept. The fair value of this loan on the basis of the discounted cash flow method using market interest rates corresponds to the second level of the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy and is 22,242 thousand (previous year: 0 thousand) compared

to the carrying amount of 24,637 thousand (previous year: 0 thousand).
The financing agreements for the revolving credit facility, the European Investment Bank loan and other significant loans contain standard financial covenants regarding the financial situation of the Heidelberg Group. Two of the key performance indicators relate to the Heidelberg Group's equity and cash funds. The minimum required liquidity of 80 million is significantly less than the cash available in recent financial years.
With the existing financing portfolio, Heidelberg has total credit facilities with balanced diversification and a balanced maturity structure until 2023.
The carrying amounts of the collateral pledged in connection with the loan agreements as part of a collateral pool concept is shown under the appropriate notes. The carrying amount of the other amounts due to banks and other financial liabilities is primarily to be taken as an appropriate estimate of the fair value.

Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments include liabilities from cash flow hedges of 1,906 thousand (previous year: 2,343 thousand) and from fair value hedges of 1,559 thousand (previous year: 827 thousand).
Deferred income Deferred income includes taxable investment subsidies of 696 thousand (previous year: 819 thousand), tax-free investment allowances of 426 thousand (previous year: 682 thousand) and other deferred income of 61,924 thousand (previous year: 68,579 thousand).
The taxable subsidies item essentially relates to subsidies for an investment at the Shanghai/Qingpu production site in China of 670 thousand (previous year: 732 thousand). These are subsidies paid to Heidelberg Graphic Equipment (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., China, by a government institution to promote the Shanghai Qingpu development zone.

tax-free allowances include allowances under the German Investment Allowance Act of 1999/2005/2007/2010 of 426 thousand (previous year: 682 thousand) for the Brandenburg production site.
other deferred income essentially includes advance payments for future maintenance and services. These amounts are reversed to profit or loss over the term of the agreement.
Miscellaneous other liabilities Recognized liabilities are essentially the undiscounted contractual cash flows. The carrying amount of the remaining miscellaneous other financial liabilities is primarily to be taken as an appropriate estimate of the fair value.

Liquidity risk from non-derivative financial liabilities The following table shows the contractually agreed, undiscounted cash flows of non-derivative financial liabilities. The yield curves of the respective currencies valid as of the end of the reporting period were used to determine the variable interest payments from financial instruments. Where necessary, foreign currencies were translated at closing rates. Financial liabilities repayable on demand are always assigned to the earliest time band. Utilization of the syndicated credit facility is on a short-term basis. The period of utilization is normally not more than three months. These loans have therefore been assigned to the "Up to 1 year" column, although the agreements on which they are based run until the end of March 2023.

Changes in the value of financial assets available for sale of 99 thousand (previous year: ­145 thousand) were also recognized in other comprehensive income.
Net gains and losses include 3,963 thousand (previous year: 2,639 thousand) of interest income and 36,167 thousand (previous year: 40,183 thousand) of interest expenses for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Derivative financial instruments The Corporate Treasury department of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for all hedging and financing activities of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and our subsidiaries. It is also responsible for the cash pooling operations of our Group as a whole. Within the Corporate Treasury department, we ensure that there is both a functional and a physical separation of the trading, processing and risk control activities, and that this is regularly reviewed by our Internal Audit department.
The prerequisite for an adequate risk management system is a well-founded database. The Corporate Treasury department of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft operates a Group-wide financial reporting system ­ the Treasury Information System. This system is used to identify interest rate, currency and liquidity risks within the Group and to derive appropriate action plans and strategies with which to manage these risks on a central basis in line with guidelines issued by the Management Board. Heidelberg operates a monthly, annualized consolidated liquidity planning system on a rollover basis, which makes it possible to manage current and future liquidity needs in a timely manner.
The Heidelberg Group is exposed to market price risks in the form of interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. In general, derivative financial instruments are used to limit these risks. Corresponding contracts with third-party banks are mainly concluded through Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft. The credit ratings of these business partners are reviewed regularly. The risk control activities include an ongoing market evaluation of contracted transactions.
currency risks arise in particular as a result of exchange rate fluctuations in connection with net risk positions in foreign currency. These occur for receivables and liabilities, anticipated cash flows and onerous contracts.
interest rate risks generally occur for floating rate refinancing transactions.

The positive and negative fair values of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are offset by opposing value developments in the hedged items. All derivative financial instruments are carried as assets or liabilities at their corresponding fair values.
The following table shows the contractually agreed, undiscounted incoming and outgoing payments for derivative financial instruments.

Currency hedging Cash flow hedge The forward exchange transactions outstanding as of the end of the reporting period essentially hedge highly likely currency risks expected from purchase volumes of our subsidiaries over the next 12 months. Therefore, the remaining term of these derivatives at the end of the reporting period was up to one year. Of the hedges, 25 percent (previous year: 8 percent) of the hedging volume relates to the Japanese yen and 33 percent (previous year: 27 percent) to the Swiss franc as of the end of the reporting period.
As of the end of the reporting period, hedges resulted in total assets of 1,369 thousand (previous year: 1,699 thousand) and liabilities of 1,906 thousand (previous year: 2,343 thousand). The change in value of the designated portion of the hedge was recognized outside profit and loss and will be recognized in income from operating activities over the subsequent 12 months. As the forecast purchasing volumes of our subsidiaries are no longer highly likely, no cash flow hedges were terminated early and no expenses were transferred from the hedge reserve to the financial result (previous year: 0 thousand).
Fair value hedge This is essentially the exchange rate hedge for loan receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies within the Group. The net results on the fair value of hedges of ­14,126 thousand (previous year: ­21 thousand) and the translation of hedged items at closing rates of 13,905 thousand (previous year: ­337 thousand) are reported in the consolidated income statement.
Interest rate hedging Cash flow hedge The Heidelberg Group limits the risk from increasing interest expenses for refinancing by using interest rate swaps, under which Heidelberg receives variable-rate interest and pays fixed interest (payer interest rate swap). No interest rate swaps were held in the reporting year, which was also the case on March 31, 2017.

Sensitivity analysis In order to clearly show the effects of currency and interest rate risks on the consolidated income statement and the equity, the impact of hypothetical changes in exchange rates and interest is shown below in the form of sensitivity analyses. It is assumed here that the position at the end of the reporting period is representative for the financial year.
Recognized currency risks as defined by IFRS7 are caused by monetary financial instruments not in the functional currency. The portfolio of primary monetary financial instruments is mainly held directly in the functional currency or transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives. It is therefore assumed in this analysis that changes in exchange rates show no influence on income or equity with regard to this portfolio. The impact of the translation of the subsidiaries' financial statements into the Group currency (translation risk) is not taken into account either. Accordingly, the analysis includes those derivative financial instruments that were concluded in order to hedge highly probable future cash flows in a foreign currency (cash flow hedge). Assuming a 10 percent increase in the value of the euro against all currencies in which hedges are held, the hedge reserve would have been 2,595 thousand (previous year: 4,649 thousand) higher as of the end of the reporting period and the financial result would have been 9 thousand higher (previous year: 34 thousand lower). Assuming a 10 percent decrease in the value of the euro, the hedge reserve would have been 3,172 thousand (previous year: 5,682 thousand) lower and the financial result would have been 11 thousand lower (previous year: 41 thousand higher).
In accordance with IFRS7, recognized interest rate risks of the Heidelberg Group must also be shown. These are partly due to the portion of primary floating rate financial instruments that were not hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments within cash flow hedges. In addition, a hypothetical change in market interest rates with regard to derivative financial instruments would result in changes to the hedge reserve in the cash flow hedge. However, fixed-income financial instruments carried at amortized cost and floating rate financial

instruments hedged within cash flow hedges are not subject to any recognized interest rate risk. These financial instruments are therefore not taken into account. Assuming an increase of 100 basis points in the market interest rate across all terms, the hedge reserve would have been unchanged (previous year: 0 thousand lower) as of the end of the reporting period and the financial result would have been 1,096 thousand (previous year: 764 thousand) higher. Assuming a decrease of 100 basis points in the market interest rate across all terms, the hedge reserve would have been unchanged (previous year: 0 thousand higher) and the financial result would have been 1,096 thousand (previous year: 764 thousand) lower.
Risk of default The Heidelberg Group is exposed to default risks to the extent that counterparties do not fulfill their contractual obligations arising from derivative financial instruments. In order to control this risk, default risks and changes in credit ratings are continually monitored. There is a theoretical risk of default (credit risk) for the existing derivative financial instruments in the amount of the asset fair values as of the end of the respective reporting period. However, no actual default of payments from these derivatives is expected at present.
Fair values of securities, loans and derivative financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are allocated to the three levels of the fair value hierarchy as set out in IFRS13 depending on the availability of observable market data.
The individual levels are defined as follows:

Securities are classified as financial assets available for sale and recognized at fair value. The underlying quoted prices for the measurement of the vast majority of securities correspond to level 1 of the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS13, as only quoted prices observed on active markets are used in measurement. If the fair value of securities cannot be reliably determined, they are carried at cost.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments correspond to changes in value arising from a notional revaluation taking into consideration market parameters applicable at the end of the reporting period. The fair values are calculated using standardized measurement procedures (discounted cash flow and option pricing models). This corresponds to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS13, as only input data observable on the market, such as exchange rates, exchange rate volatilities and interest rates, is used.
The loans allocated to the third level of the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS13 relate to a fixed-income cash investment classified as a financial asset available for sale that was made by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft in August 2016. The fair value is calculated using a standardized valuation method (discounted cash flow method). One of the key input parameters for calculating the fair value is the discount rate, which amounted to 13.85 percent as of March 31, 2018. If this had been 0.5 percentage points higher (lower), the fair value would have been 93 thousand lower (94 thousand higher) provided all other assumptions were unchanged.
The financial assets and financial liabilities recognized at fair value were assigned to the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy as follows on March 31, 2018:

level 1:Financial instruments traded on active markets whose quoted prices can be used to measure fair value without adjustment.
level 2:Measurement on the basis of measurement procedures whose inputs are derived from observable market data, either directly or indirectly.
level 3:Measurement on the basis of measurement procedures whose inputs are not derived from observable market data.

In the reporting year, there were no reclassifications between the first and second levels of the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying amount of the financial asset allocated to the third level of the measurement hierarchy set out in IFRS13 as of March 31, 2018 (20,644 thousand), is reconciled as follows:
Carrying amount as of April 1, 2017 (26,171 thousand), disposal (2,674 thousand), other changes recognized outside or in profit or loss (­2,853 thousand).

minimum lease payments for operating leases:
¬the research and development center (Heidelberg) in
the amount of 14,052 thousand (previous year: 17,560 thousand);
¬the administrative building in Tokyo, Japan in the
amount of 12,090 thousand (previous year: 16,117 thousand);
¬the administrative building in Kennesaaw, USA, in the
amount of 11,828 thousand (previous year: 14,991 thousand);
¬the administrative building in Brussels, Belgium, in
the amount of 5,050 thousand (previous year: 5,267 thousand);
¬the administrative and production building in Dur-
ham, USA, in the amount of 4,665 thousand (previous year: 7,762 thousand);

¬the administrative and production building in Roches-
ter, New York, USA, in the amount of 2,634 thousand (previous year: 3,036 thousand); and
¬motor vehicles with a total value of 25,528 thousand
(previous year: 22,912 thousand).
Investments and other purchasing commitments are essentially financial liabilities in connection with orders of property, plant and equipment and obligations for the purchase of raw materials and supplies.
Future payments for other financial liabilities are partially offset by future incoming payments for license a greements.

The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result after taxes by the weighted average number of the shares outstanding in the reporting year of 273,429 thousand (previous year: 257,295 thousand). The weighted number of shares outstanding was influenced by the holdings of treasury shares. As in the previous year, there were still 142,919 treasury shares as of March 31, 2018.

The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of outstanding debt securities (convertible bond) to shares. The convertible bond is only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when it has a diluting effect in the respective reporting period.
Taking into account the corresponding number of shares from the convertible bond issued March 30, 2015, there is no dilution of earnings per share, as the net result for the period is adjusted for the interest expense (coupon and accrued interest) recognized in the financial result for the convertible bonds. In the future, such instruments may have a fully dilutive effect. There were no circumstances leading to the dilution of earnings per share in the previous year.
The reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share is as follows:

35 Information on the consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows shows the changes in the cash and cash equivalents of the Heidelberg Group during the financial year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. Cash flows are broken down into operating, investing and financing activities (IAS7). The changes in statement of financial position items shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows cannot be derived directly from the consolidated statement of financial position as the effects of currency translation and changes in the scope of consolidation do not affect cash and have therefore been eliminated.
30,754 thousand (previous year: 38,011 thousand) of investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property relate to intangible assets, 83,813 thousand (previous year: 64,234 thousand) to property, plant and equipment. Investments do not include additions from finance leases of 1,343 thousand (previous year: 2,290 thousand). 90 thousand (previous year: 178 thousand) of income from the disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property relates to intangible assets and 9,781 thousand (previous

year: 15,862 thousand) to property, plant and equipment. Investments in corporate acquisitions relate to the acquisition of docufy GmbH and of Fujifilm Europe's coatings and pressroom chemicals business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
The payments from operating leases in which Heidelberg is the lessee are shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows under operating activities. The repayment portion of lease installments for finance leases in which Heidelberg is the lessee is reported under financing activities. The interest portion of lease installments is shown under operating activities.
Payments received from operating and finance leases in which Heidelberg is the lessor are reported under changes in cash from operating activities.
The carrying amounts of the collateral pledged in connection with the loan agreements as part of a collateral pool concept is shown under the appropriate notes. Please see note 28 for information on the unutilized credit lines.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and cash equivalents only (201,607 thousand; previous year: 217,660 thousand).
Further information on the consolidated statement of cash flows can be found in the Group management report.

Financial section

In the Heidelberg Group, segments are defined by the services performed by the divisions. The segments are based on internal reporting in line with the management approach.
As part of the adjustment of the corporate strategy, the segments were reorganized as of April 1, 2017. The previous Heidelberg Equipment and Heidelberg Services segments were restructured; the Heidelberg Financial Services segment remained unchanged. The Heidelberg Group's structure has since been broken down in line with the internal organizational and reporting structure into the segments Heidelberg Digital Technology, Heidelberg Digital Business and Services, and Heidelberg Financial Services. Heidelberg Digital Technology essentially comprises sheetfed offset, label printing and postpress business. Services, consumables and remarketed equipment business as well as digital printing technologies and solutions along the value chain are bundled in the Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segment. The Heidelberg Financial Services segment continues to comprise sales financing business. The figures of the previous year were adjusted accordingly. In the period from April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017, there was accordingly a 12,503 thousand reduction in sales for the Heidelberg Digital Business and Services segment and a 1,257 thousand reduction in EBITDA excluding restructuring result. Further information on the business activities, products and services of the individual segments can be found in the chapters "Management and control" and "Segments and business units" in the Group management report.
Regionally, we distinguish between Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe, North America and South America.
Further information on the business areas can be found in the chapters "Segment report" and "Report on the regions" in the Group management report. Transfer prices for internal Group sales are determined using a marketdriven approach, based on the principle of dealing at arm's length.

Notes on segment data Segment performance is measured on the basis of EBITDA excluding restructuring result ­ the result of operating activity before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring result.
In the year under review and the previous year, the Heidelberg Group did not generate more than 10 percent of (net) sales with any one customer.
Inter-segment sales are of minor financial significance. The segment result is transitioned to the net result before taxes as follows:

37Capital management

In the context of implementing the holistic management approach, it is the task of capital management to provide the best possible support in the attainment of the Heidelberg Group's goals. The focus here is on ensuring liquidity and creditworthiness and increasing the enterprise value of the Heidelberg Group on an ongoing basis. We calculate the value contribution for a reporting period, the benchmark used for this, as the net total of return on capital employed (ROCE) and capital costs (see Group management report, page 38). The value contribution can be seen as the profit remaining after deducting the capital costs for the capital employed in the reporting period. If the value contribution is positive, the Heidelberg Group has earned more than its capital costs. The following capital structure is used to calculate the cost of capital:

Equity Net deferred taxes Adjusted equity Annual average

2016/2017
340,087 94,019
246,068 224,867

Adjusted total capital Annual average

1,265,057 1,281,322

1,294,335 1,279,696

For the Heidelberg Group, capital management prioritizes reducing the commitment of capital, strengthening the equity and securing liquidity. In the year under review, the equity of the Heidelberg Group increased from 340,087 thousand to 340,914 thousand. Based on total assets, the equity ratio is close to the previous year's level at 15.1 percent (previous year: 15.3 percent).

131

Financial section

Despite the slightly negative free cash flow in the year under review, net debt was down year on year at 236,413 thousand (previous year: 252,439 thousand). The net debt is total financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and current securities.
Heidelberg is not subject to any capital requirements arising from its Articles of Association.
As of March 31, 2018, the financing of the Heidelberg Group mainly consists of an unsecured corporate bond with a maturity of seven years in a nominal amount of 205 million (2015 corporate bond), a loan from the European Investment Bank of 100 million with a staggered maturity until March 2024, a convertible bond totaling 58.6 million with a maturity of seven years (2015 convertible bond), a development loan of 42.1 million maturing in September 2024 arranged with a syndicate of banks refinanced by KfW, a loan of 25.7 million borrowed in May 2017 and maturing at the end of June 2027, and a revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate totaling around 320 million with a maturity until March 2023.
The financing agreements for the revolving credit facility, the European Investment Bank loan and other significant loans contain standard financial covenants regarding the financial situation of the Heidelberg Group. Two of the key performance indicators relate to the Heidelberg Group's equity and cash funds. The minimum required liquidity of 80 million is significantly less than the cash available in recent financial years.
The 2013 convertible bond was almost entirely converted into new shares of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft in the year under review. The remaining issue volume of 3.7 million was fully repaid at maturity in July 2017.
Heidelberg's financing structure is thus well-balanced with regard to the diversification of instruments and the maturity profile. For further details regarding the financing instruments, please refer to note 28.

 38Declaration of compliance in accordance with section 161 AktG
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft issued the declaration of compliance in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and made it permanently accessible to the shareholders on the website www.heidelberg.com under Company > About Us > Corporate Governance. Earlier declarations of compliance are also permanently available here.
 39Executive bodies of the Company
The basic characteristics of the compensation system and amounts of compensation for the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board are presented in the remuneration report. The remuneration report is part of the Group management report (see pages 54 to 60) and the corporate governance report.
The members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are listed in the separate overview presented on pages 148 to 149 (Supervisory Board) and 150 (Management Board).
members of the management board: The total cash compensation (= total compensation) in accordance with HGB amounts to 5,072 thousand (previous year: 4,807 thousand), comprising the fixed compensation including fringe benefits of 1,940 thousand (previous year: 1,849 thousand), one-year variable compensation of 1,669 thousand (previous year: 1,599 thousand) and multi-year variable compensation of 1,463 thousand (previous year: 1,359 thousand). The multi-year variable compensation includes 666 thousand (previous year: 0 thousand) for the fair value calculated as of the grant date for the total shareholder return (cash-settled share-based compensation); this is not distributed over the performance period (three years). Deviating from the amount included in total compensation, the cost of the share-based payment for the reporting year in accordance with HGB is 437 thousand (previous year: 0 thousand).
The total compensation according to IFRS of 5,771 thousand (previous year: 8,411 thousand) relates to shortterm benefits of 3,609 thousand (previous year: 3,448 thousand), post-employment benefits of 650 thousand (previous year: 1,184 thousand), other long-term benefits of 1,075 thousand (previous year: 1,359 thousand), termination benefits of 0 thousand (previous year: 2,420 thousand) and share-based payments of 437 thousand

(previous year: 0 thousand). In accordance with IFRS, total compensation includes the fair value of the claim to share-based payment earned in the respective financial year in the form of cash settlement; this means that, given a three-year vesting period, the respective fair value is recognized in profit or loss over three years from the grant year. No preemptive subscription rights or options were granted. Rather, cash settlement was granted depending on the development of the price of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft shares.
From the 2017/2018 financial year, the multi-year variable compensation granted is determined according to two benchmarks: earnings before taxes (EBT) according to the IFRS consolidated income statement and total shareholder return (TSR). The targets for these two benchmarks, the respective thresholds and the maximum overfulfillment are all defined at the beginning of the relevant three-year period (performance period). Half the multi-year variable compensation is attributable to each benchmark, i.e. 45 percent of the fixed annual compensation in the event of 100 percent fulfillment of the targets for each of the relevant benchmarks. Overfulfillment of a benchmark is recognized and can at most result in a doubling of the attributable multi-year variable target compensation. Both benchmarks are associated with an objective fulfillment threshold that must be reached in order for the multi-year variable compensation for the benchmark in question to be paid out. However, overfulfillment of a benchmark can only increase the multi-year variable compensation if the other benchmark reaches at least the threshold. The basis for target measurement for the total shareholder return is the long-term expected return (Heidelberg share price increases) during the performance period. The baseline value for each performance period is determined at the beginning of the first financial year of the performance period. The achievement of objectives is checked and ascertained at the end of each three-year period. The multi-year variable compensation is paid out at the end of the month in which the Annual General Meeting ­ after the end of the final financial year of the three-year period ­ resolves on the appropriation of the net result. For the multi-year variable compensation, achievement of the relevant threshold results in a payout amounting to 25 percent of the amount that would be payable in the event of 100 percent objective fulfillment. If the objective attainment lies between the threshold and the defined objective, the payout is determined by linear interpolation. If overfulfillment is to be recognized, the amount of the payout is either determined as a percentage according to the degree of overfulfillment

or ­ if a maximum recognizable value for overfulfillment has been defined ­ by linear interpolation between the objective and the maximum recognizable value. In the event of a member joining or leaving within an ongoing performance period, that member has a pro rata temporis claim to any multi-year variable compensation determined after the end of the performance period. In the event of a member leaving, pro rata temporis multi-year variable compensation is calculated for the performance periods still ongoing at this time on the basis of the determination of goals as of the exit date, which is then frozen.
This share-based payment is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. This simulates the log-normal processes for the price of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengeselschaft to establish an average share price at the end of the respective performance period. Depending on the total shareholder return, a percentage of the target value to be paid out is calculated using the TSR performance matrix.

Independent auditor's report
To Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, Heidelberg

Pursuant to §322 Abs.3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report
Audit Opinions We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, Heidelberg, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at March 31, 2018, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. We have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the "Other information" section of our auditor's report in accordance with the German legal requirements.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
¬ the accompanying consolidated financial statements
comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2018, and of its financial performance for the financial year from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, and
¬ t he accompanying group management report as a
whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the "Other Information" section of our auditor's report.

Basis for the Audit Opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with §317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No.537/2014, referred to subsequently as "EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10(2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5(1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.
In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:

Corporate governance and compliance

1 R ecoverability of goodwill 2 D eferred tax assets in respect of tax loss
carryforwards
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:
1 Matter and issue 2 Audit approach and findings 3 Reference to further information
Hereinafter we present the key audit matters:
1 R ecoverability of goodwill 1 In the Company's consolidated financial statements
goodwill amounting in total to EUR 127.2 million (5.6% of total assets or 37.3% of equity) is reported under the "Intangible assets" balance sheet item. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need for write-downs. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the groups of cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cashgenerating units, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally determined using the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective group of cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective group of cash-generating units. The impairment test determined that no writedowns were necessary. The outcome of this valuation

is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective group of cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to associated uncertainty. Against this background and due to the highly complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.
2 A s part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. We discussed and examined supplementary adjustments to the medium-term business plan for the purposes of the impairment test with the members of the Company's staff responsible. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we also focused our testing on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company. Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future net cash flows. Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.
3 The Company's disclosures on impairment testing and goodwill are contained in numbers 6, 7 and 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

2 Deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards
1 In the consolidated financial statements of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, deferred tax assets amounting to EUR 65.7 million (of which EUR 23.1 million relates to tax loss carryforwards) are reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. The deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards concern in particular the US consolidated tax group (EUR 11.8 million), which decreased by EUR 9.1 million due mainly to the reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This item was recognized to the extent that the executive directors consider it probable that taxable profit will be available in the foreseeable future which will enable the unused tax losses to be utilized. For this purpose, future taxable profits are projected on the basis of the adopted business plan. No deferred tax assets were recognized in respect of tax loss and interest carryforwards amounting in total to EUR 1,362.7 million. The majority of these related to loss and interest carryforwards in Germany. From our point of view, the deferred tax assets in respect of loss carryforwards were of particular significance in the context of our audit, as they depend to a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties.
2 For the purposes of our audit we included internal tax accounting specialists in our audit team. With their assistance, we began by reviewing the internal processes and controls for recording tax matters as well as the methodology adopted for the determination, accounting treatment and measurement of deferred taxes, in particular against the background of the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate. We also assessed the recoverability of the deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards on the basis of the Company's internal forecasts of its future earnings situation, and the appropriateness of the underlying estimates and assumptions. Based on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are substantiated and sufficiently documented.

3 T he Company's disclosures on deferred taxes in respect of tax loss carryforwards are contained in numbers 6, 17 and 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Information The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:
¬the statement on corporate governance pursuant to
§289f HGB and §315d HGB included in the "Legal disclosures" section of the group management report
¬the corporate governance report pursuant to No.3.10
of the German Corporate Governance Code
¬the separate non-financial report pursuant to §289b
Abs.3 HGB and §315b Abs.3 HGB
The other information comprises further the remaining parts of the annual report ­ excluding cross-references to external information ­ with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report.
Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information
¬is materially inconsistent with the consolidated finan-
cial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
¬otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to §315e Abs.1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the

140

Consolidated financial statements

Responsibility statement

Independent auditor's report

Further information

Report of the Supervisory Board

Corporate governance and compliance

preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with §317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compli-

ance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
¬Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
¬Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant
to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.
¬Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.
¬Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive
directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

141

Financial section

¬Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and con-
tent of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to §315e Abs.1 HGB.
¬Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regard-
ing the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
¬Evaluate the consistency of the group management
report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.
¬Perform audit procedures on the prospective informa-
tion presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.
Other legal and regulatory requirements
Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as auditor by the annual general meeting on July 27, 2017. We were engaged by the supervisory board on July 27, 2017. We have been the group auditor of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft, Heidelberg, without interruption since the financial year 1997.
We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).

Report of the Supervisory Board
dr.siegfried jaschinski Chairman of the Supervisory Board
Dear shareholders,
In financial year 2017/2018, an extensive efficiency project was launched to optimize the Company's organization and processes and reduce ongoing costs by around 50 million in the medium term (FIT efficiency project). In addition, Heidelberg focused its corporate strategy on establishing new digital business models and expanding its technology leadership by expanding the portfolio in growth markets, such as packaging and label printing, digital printing, selected consumables and software, as well as by making targeted acquisitions.
The acquisition of Fujifilm's European coatings and pressroom chemicals business in the EMEA region is also to be viewed in this context. With this acquisition, Heidelberg expanded in the attractive growth segment for consumables. The transaction was another step in pursuing the Company's growth strategy of developing a comprehensive cross-sector portfolio geared toward specific customer requirements and is intended to further enhance Heidelberg's position in the market for coatings and pressroom chemicals.
In addition, the Company acquired docufy GmbH in Bamberg. docufy is a manufacturer of professional software solutions for technical documentation and the first provider of multi-level documentation. This acquisition augments the portfolio of the Heidelberg Digital Platforms segment, which offers IT solutions for the digitalization and automation of processes in the design, production and servicing of innovative high-tech products.
Another step into the digital future was the signing of the first deals under the new subscription model. The successful market launch of this new business model is another important component for the achievement of future growth objectives.
In addition, Heidelberg has positioned itself in the power electronics and electric mobility business. The Heidelberg "Wallbox," a charging device for electric vehicles, was successfully introduced at industrial trade shows. It appeals to automotive manufacturers, retail chains and consumers alike. This offering will gradually be expanded.
Moreover, Heidelberg has launched the Heidelberg Digital Unit, a new center of competence for digital marketing and e-commerce, which will significantly increase e-commerce sales over the next few years.

Corporate governance and compliance

In addition, Heidelberg agreed a new syndicated credit facility with its banking group at better terms in March 2018. With an increased volume of 320 million and a term until March 2023, this affords Heidelberg financial flexibility and long-term planning security. The new framework also opens up the possibility of early repayment of portions of the corporate bond ­ thereby further reducing interest expenses ­ and advancing the digital transformation and growth with further strategic acquisitions.
Close cooperation between Management Board and Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board continuously monitored the management by the Management Board in financial year 2017/2018 and regularly advised it on the running of the Company. We were assured of the legality and propriety of the work of the Management Board at all times.
The Management Board reported to the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively in written or verbal form on all matters relevant to the Company. Namely, these include planning, the corporate strategy, major transactions by the Company and the Group and the associated opportunities and risks, and compliance issues. The Management Board kept the Supervisory Board informed continuously and in detail about the Group's sales, earnings, employment and business performance and the Company's financial position. On receipt of the information, the Supervisory Board discussed and dealt with all the above topics in depth. In particular, we discussed and examined all the business transactions of significance to the Company verbally and in writing with the Management Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee dealt intensively with other material concerns of the Company in their meetings and separate discussions. The members of the Supervisory Board also discussed current topics with the Management Board outside of meetings. As Supervisory Board Chairman, I was in continuous contact with the Management Board and especially with the Chief Executive Officer and discussed significant current issues and developments at the Company with them. These discussions focused on the FIT efficiency project and the subscription business model. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the committees reported on key findings no later than the next Supervisory Board meeting. Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board was always involved in good time in all decisions of material importance to the Company and the Group and reviewed these decisions before their implementation.
When necessary, the shareholder and employee representatives discussed the agenda items for the Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary talks. The Supervisory Board granted its approval for individual transactions to the extent required by law, the Articles of Association or the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board.
No members took part in only half or less of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and committees of which they are members. The average attendance rate at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was nearly 100 percent in financial year 2017/2018.
Key topics at Supervisory Board meetings The Supervisory Board's discussions focused on issues relating to strategy, portfolio and business activities of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board addressed the liquidity situation and the capital structure.
In the year under review, the plenum of the Supervisory Board met four times. In particular, I would like to highlight the following key topics:
At its meeting on June 1, 2017, the Supervisory Board discussed the reporting of the Management Board on the business situation, as in every meeting held in the year under review. In addition, the Supervisory Board adopted the consolidated and single-entity financial statements for financial year 2016/2017 following the presentation and discussion of the auditor's report, thereby concurring with the recommendation of the

153

Supervisory Board and corporate governance
Audit Committee. It also approved the agenda for the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported on the meetings held on May 4 and May 31, 2017, and the Chairman of the Personnel Matters Committee reported on the meeting of June 1, 2017.
The meeting ahead of the Annual General Meeting on July 27, 2017, was used to prepare for the Annual General Meeting. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board resolved to commission PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the auditor for financial year 2017/2018. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported on the meeting held on July 26, 2017. Moreover, the Supervisory Board discussed an amendment to the Articles of Association (cancellation of the Contingent Capital 2012 authorization due to the passage of time).
Following the account of the current business situation at the Supervisory Board meeting on November 24, 2017, the Supervisory Board was then informed in detail about the meetings of the Audit Committee on November 7, 2017, the Strategy Committee on November 23, 2017, and the Personnel Matters Committee on November 24, 2017, and discussed with the Management Board the concept of potential refinancing alter natives, including the aforementioned new credit facility. In addition, the Supervisory Board determined the attainment of the gender ratio target defined in 2015 and set the new target for the Management Board until 2022. It also approved the 2017 declaration of compliance, having previously discussed the criteria for the future composition of the Supervisory Board and adopted a profile of skills and expertise. After thorough discussion and on the basis of a corresponding recommendation, the Supervisory Board also approved the reformulation of the multi-year variable compensation (LTI) for the Management Board. Following discussion of the new arrangement with the Management Board including the necessary contractual amendments, the reformulation took effect as of the year under review (see Remuneration Report on pages 54 et seq). We then approved the new syndicated credit facility by way of circulation in writing on March 20, 2018.
The topics discussed at the Supervisory Board's last meeting of the reporting year, on March 27, 2018, were the current business situation, planning for the coming financial year and projections for the following years. The Supervisory Board acknowledged the planning presented to the meeting. The Supervisory Board was also informed about the meetings of the Audit Committee on February 6, 2018, and of the Personnel Matters Committee on March 27, 2018, and the new organizational chart.
Another issue that we discussed in depth and resolved upon at the last meeting of the reporting year was the engagement of Schuh&Co. ­ in which one of our Supervisory Board members is a shareholder ­ as part of a development project with our subsidiary Heidelberg Web Carton Converting GmbH. Schuh&Co. is to provide methodological and practical support here with its expertise in strategic and operational complexity management. We were convinced of the scope, quality and competitiveness of the offer in a tendering procedure. Furthermore, we ascertained that this very technical complexity consulting did not equate to the customary controlling and consulting activities of a Supervisory Board member; in addition, Prof. Dr. Schuh was not personally involved in this consulting.
Corporate governance The corporate governance of the Company was a regular topic of the discussions in the Supervisory Board, as were the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) as revised in 2017. Further information on the Company's corporate governance and related activities of the Supervisory Board can also be found in the corporate governance report on our website www.heidelberg.com under Company > About Us > Corporate Governance.

Work in the committees The Supervisory Board of the Company has set up six committees to support it in its work:

¬ Mediation Committee

¬ Audit Committee

¬ Management Committee ¬ Nomination Committee

¬ Personnel Matters Committee ¬ Strategy Committee

The Supervisory Board's six committees prepare decisions for the plenum and pass resolutions on matters delegated to them for a decision.
The chairs of the respective committees reported to the Supervisory Board regularly and comprehensively on their activities at the meetings of the Supervisory Board. The composition of the committees is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Personnel Matters Committee met three times in reporting year 2017/2018. Besides the regular reappointment of Mr.Kaliebe and the extension of his contract by another three years, its work focused on compensation issues, especially the reformulation of the multi-year variable compensation and other matters relating to former and current Management Board members. The Audit Committee held five regular meetings. It examined quarterly and event-driven questions relating to the Company's net assets, financial position and results of operations, and its risk reporting. Furthermore, together with the auditor, this committee also focused intensively on the annual and consolidated financial statements in addition to the interim financial statements, the accounting policies applied and the specifics of the separate and consolidated financial statements. Other topics discussed at the meetings included the liquidity situation of the Heidelberg Group and its refinancing, the development of the capital structure (equity and borrowed funds), the integration of newly acquired activities (e.g. docufy GmbH) and the effects of the reorientation and development of business areas, the new standards for revenue recognition, risk management, the internal controlling and audit system, compliance, the implementation and impact of the portfolio and restructuring measures, the accounting treatment of pension provisions, investment controlling and sales financing.
The Strategy Committee met once and discussed the strategic orientation of the Sheetfed business area, the equity situation and the financial framework. It also discussed the FIT efficiency project and the new subscription business model. The Nomination Committee met once and held an extraordinary meeting on May 18, 2017, at which it discussed the filling of the vacant Supervisory Board post. The Management Com mittee did not meet. The Mediation Committee in accordance with section 27 (3) of the German Codetermination Act (MitBestG) also did not have to be convened.

Audit of the single-entity and consolidated financial statements The Annual General Meeting on July 27, 2017, appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the auditor. This company audited the single-entity financial statements for financial year 2017/2018, the management report of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and the consolidated financial statements and Group management report of the Heidelberg Group prepared by the Management Board and issued each with unqualified opinions. The single-entity financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, the management report of the Company and the management report of the Heidelberg Group were submitted to the Supervisory Board immediately on their completion. The reports of the auditors were distributed to all the members of the Supervisory Board in time before the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on June 5, 2018. The auditors who signed the audit reports took part in the Supervisory

155

Supervisory Board and corporate governance
Board's discussions. During the meeting, they reported on the results and on the fact that there are no significant weaknesses in the internal controlling or risk management system with regard to the (Group) accounting process. They were available to the members of the Supervisory Board to answer questions. The auditor also informed the meeting about the services provided in addition to the audit of the financial statements and confirmed that there were no circumstances giving rise to concerns over its impartiality. The audit report does not include any comments or indications of any inaccuracies in the declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. The Audit Committee recommended the adoption of the single-entity financial statements and the approval of the consolidated financial statements at the meeting of the Super visory Board on June 4, 2018. We examined and accepted the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, the management report of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft and the management report of the Heidelberg Group prepared by the Management Board. We thereby concurred with the audit findings of both sets of financial statements, adopted the single-entity financial statements and approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018. Personnel changes in the Supervisory Board and the Management Board There was one change among the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. Mr.Oliver Jung was appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board by way of a judicial appointment effective May 23, 2017, and elected to the Supervisory Board for the regular term of five years at the Annual General Meeting on July 27, 2017.
The Supervisory Board will continue to monitor the Company's interests and its long-term development and work towards its well-being. Thank you from the Supervisory Board This year, my particular thanks go once again to the employees of Heidelberg and their representatives in the Supervisory Board, the Works Council and the Speakers Committee for all their dedicated work.
I would also expressly like to include the members of the Management Board and the managerial staff who have turned Heidelberg into a healthy and sustainably profitable enterprise once again. I would like to conclude by thanking you, dear shareholders, for the confidence you have placed in our Company and in the shares of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft.

Corporate governance and compliance

Corporate governance and compliance
¬Recommendations of the German Corporate Gover-
nance Code complied with, with few exceptions
¬Compliance activities in the Heidelberg Group
expanded by commitments of service providers and suppliers to the new Heidelberg Code of Conduct, update of the internal regulations and corporate guidelines renewed
¬Planned focus in financial year 2017/2018: Enhance-
ment of the existing compliance management system, introduction of online training, increased assurance of ethically sound behavior
The standards of good corporate governance set out in the German Corporate Governance Code were again an important guideline for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft in financial year 2017/2018. The recommendations and suggestions of the Code are still largely complied with. Ensuring effective management and control in an evolving corporate structure remains the priority. It is regularly checked to ensure that all laws and regulations are complied with throughout the Group and that recognized standards and recommendations are followed in addition to the Company's values, Code of Conduct and corporate guidelines.
Declaration of compliance in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act The Management Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following declaration of compliance on November 24, 2017:
Since issuing its last declaration of compliance on November 16, 2016, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft has complied with all recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended February 7, 2017, and as promulgated by the German Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the Federal Gazette on April 24, 2017, with the following exceptions, and will continue to comply in the future with the following exceptions:
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft deviated from the recommendations in items 4.1.5, 5.1.2 sentence 2 and 5.4.1(3) of the Code as amended February 7, 2017, and will also continue to deviate from item 4.1.5 sen-

tence 1 in the future to the extent that consideration or participation of women was/is intended or provided for. Naturally, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board have complied with the requirements of the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private Sector and the Public Sector.
The Supervisory Board and the Management Board of the Company have taken further measures in financial year 2016/2017 for the professional advancement of women in the Company. It is agreed that, in the event of vacancies being filled, given the same technical and personal suitability, the appointment of women to the Supervisory Board, the Management Board and the two management levels below the Management Board will be considered to increase the share of women in the medium to long term. The Supervisory Board and the Management Board welcome all efforts to counter discrimination based on gender or any other form of discrimination and to appropriately promote diversity.
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft deviated from the recommendations of item 5.4.1(2) of the Code as amended February 7, 2017, and will also continue to deviate from them in the future in that the Supervisory Board is expected to set a time limit for its members. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board of the Company, nominations of suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board should be based primarily on personal qualifications, longterm experience and expertise.
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board intend to update the annual declaration of compliance, prospectively on November 29, 2018, following due examination. All declarations of compliance are made permanently available on our website www.heidelberg.com under Company > About Us > Corporate Governance. The current declaration of compliance of November 24, 2017, can also be found there; it is also included in the current, detailed corporate governance declaration. This declaration ­ and our corporate governance report ­ is likewise permanently available on our website www.heidelberg.com under Company > About Us > Corporate Governance.
By resolution passed at the meeting of November 24, 2017, taking the sector, the size of the Company and the proportion of international business into account, the Supervisory Board is guided in particular by the following targets and profile of skills and expertise for the current and future composition of the Board as a whole:

157

Supervisory Board and corporate governance

a)All Supervisory Board members must have sufficient corporate or operating experience as well as knowledge of their field and ensure that they have enough time to perform their Supervisory Board tasks, so that the Supervisory Board as a whole has the knowledge, skills and specific experience necessary to perform its tasks properly.
b)All Supervisory Board members must have the reliability and personal integrity necessary for the fulfillment of the Supervisory Board's monitoring duties.
c)At least two members of the Supervisory Board must be "independent" as defined by item 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code. This stipulation is met by the appointment of Dr.Siegfried Jaschinski and Dr.Herbert Meyer as members of the Supervisory Board.
d)No more than two former members of the Management Board may sit on the Supervisory Board.
e)At least two Supervisory Board members must have international experience in a non-German market with relevance for the Company or particular expertise in the printing and media industry.
f)The Supervisory Board must have at least one member with experience in mechanical engineering and the associated industry expertise.
g)At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in accounting or auditing (financial expert).
h)The Supervisory Board must have at least one member with experience in financing and the capital market.
In accordance with Section 96(2) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board is made up of at least 30 percent women (i.e. at least four) and at least 30 percent men (i.e. at least four). This gender ratio must be complied with by the Supervisory Board as a whole unless the shareholder or employee representatives raise an objection against overall compliance according to Section 96(2) sentence 3 AktG. The shareholder representatives raised an objection against overall compliance with the statutory gender ratio according to Section 96 (2) sentence 3 AktG. The Supervisory Board must therefore comprise at least two women and at least two men on both the shareholder representative and employee representative sides.

Supervisory Board members must not remain in their post beyond the end of the Annual General Meeting following their 72nd birthday. There is no defined limit for length of membership of the Supervisory Board. This enables continuity and the preservation of long-standing expertise on the Supervisory Board in the interests of the Company.
The above targets for the composition and the profile of skills and expertise for the Board as a whole supplant all previous Supervisory Board targets.
The current composition of the Supervisory Board complies with these targets and fulfills the profile of skills and expertise.
Compliance management The activities of the Heidelberg Group are subject to various national and international legal provisions and guidelines in addition to the Group's own Code of Conduct, which was introduced on June 1, 2005, and revised on March 20, 2017. The Code of Conduct forms the foundation of the compliance culture at Heidelberg and, among other things, has been adapted in line with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. This is supplemented by a comprehensive system of values, principles, general and other internal guidelines hierarchically structured as a pyramid. The aim of these regulations is to provide the executive bodies and employees of the Heidelberg Group with guidance on how to use and practice these rules for fair, constructive and productive dealings in day-to-day operations with respect to the general public, customers and suppliers, competitors, other business partners and shareholders, but also other Heidelberg employees. Therefore, integrity in everyday business and respectful cooperation at all work levels is expected. The central task of the Compliance Office is to ensure Company-wide compliance with these regulations ­ both by the Group's executive bodies and each individual employee. The Compliance Office is integrated into the legal department. The Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the CFO, who is also the head of the Heidelberg Financial Services segment. Heidelberg's measures to ensure compliance with Company-wide regulations are based on a preventive and risk-based approach. Compliance checks are carried out for identified compliance risks in certain compliance areas (e.g. environmental

158

Consolidated financial statements

Responsibility statement

Independent auditor's report

Further information

Report of the Supervisory Board

Corporate governance and compliance

and product safety) with the responsible operational compliance experts to determine any need for further improvement. This centers around a threat analysis, knowledge of the legal requirements, the level of organization and documentation, the functionality of processes in the compliance area concerned and the tracking of prior audit findings. Where necessary, measures in addition to ordinary training requirements can be arranged. Several compliance areas are subjected to cursory checks at the smaller Heidelberg production sites in the context of compliance checks at production sites. Other compliance issues such as antitrust law, corruption prevention, capital market law or conduct in the event of official investigations are addressed by targeted information, presentations at management meetings, specific training sessions or specially formed committees or working groups, such as the Ad Hoc Committee. Independently of this, Heidelberg executives are responsible for ensuring that their own conduct and that of their employees in their areas and organizational units is compliant. In financial year 2018/2019, there will be a continued focus on the review, revision and/or adjustment of the existing compliance management system in order to improve it also in light of current developments.
In order to evaluate the compliance areas specific to the Group, the Compliance Committee meets regularly under the Chief Compliance Officer. In this context, current global developments are evaluated in order to take centrally directed, appropriate preventative compliance measures. The expansion of the top-down approach through management and employee compliance training and the information and any delegation of compliance duties nec-

essary in this context, including associated training, continue to be implemented. The whistleblower system introduced in 2016 has become established at the level of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft; global establishment of the whistleblower system is being evaluated by the Compliance Committee with support from the significant local Group companies. Another priority in this financial year is again to advise and train employees, especially in the areas of the Code of Conduct, corruption prevention, antitrust law and non-disclosure. For the latter subject, Heidelberg has revised the existing non-disclosure concept and is currently providing extensive training to employees in particularly sensitive areas. Compliance training is also under way at the new Group companies added via acquisitions. Internal findings and comparisons and communication with other companies contribute to the ongoing development of our compliance management system. In its meetings, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly discusses compliance issues and activities. The Chief Compliance Officer issues a comprehensive compliance report there at least once a year on behalf of the Management Board.
