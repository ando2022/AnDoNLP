IN OUR HANDS
The responsibility for balancing economic, environmental and social needs today, and for the conditions which future generations will encounter when seeking to meet their needs, rests in our hands. As empowered consumers, employees and employers and as members of the society in which we live, our decisions contribute to shaping the present and the future. It is up to us to use our individual opportunities responsibly and sustainably. At AGRANA, the globally operating processor of agricultural raw materials, an average of about 8,800 pairs of hands in the Sugar, Starch and Fruit business segments work for the economic future of the Group.
In going about our work, it is important to us to consider the environmental impacts of our actions and honour our social responsibility to employees, colleagues and fellow citizens. This is a daily balancing act which, especially in a demanding business environment, requires dedication and a deft touch.
The story of how we mastered this challenge in the 2013|14 financial year is told in this annual report under the motto
"In our hands".
In a sustainability feature section in the annual report 2012|13, AGRANA for the first time presented non-financial performance indicators compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Version 3.1). In the current report on the 2013|14 financial year, important sustainability aspects are integrated directly in the corporate governance report and Group management report. To make the non-financial information easier to find, page 67 provides a content index to all indicators included in the report. In addition, relevant passages on the respective pages are marked with a green fingerprint.

LET TER FROM THE CEO
02
In front of you is our report on the 2013|14 financial year, during which, in a demanding market environment, we were able to repeat the prior year's record revenue of more than  3 billion, overcoming the effect of declining prices by achieving higher sales volumes.
In pre-exceptionals operating profit in the Sugar segment, falling market prices and significantly risen raw material costs led to a sharp drop from the extraordinarily good earnings of the previous two years. Operating profit in the Starch segment eased from the prior-year level as expected, as selling prices decreased more strongly than raw material prices and as the start-up costs of the wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, made themselves felt. In the bioethanol business (part of the Starch segment), market confidence was adversely affected by the pending decision by European policy-makers regarding bioethanol (calling into question the targets for bioethanol content in petrol) and the circumvention of tariff protection of the EU sugar market by imports from the USA. The earnings evolution in the Fruit segment, however, was very positive. The structural measures we took in the European fruit preparations activities, the clear volume gains in the markets outside Europe and the successful business trend at AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH enabled the Fruit segment to close ranks with the other segments in terms of profitability.
At the same time, our fundamental strategy of diversification proved its worth, as the impacts of volatile conditions were softened by the diversification across our different businesses. We will remain true to this strategy to ensure AGRANA's lasting success.
Commitment to stock market listing The exit, announced in February 2014, of British financial services firm Prudential plc (M&G Investments), which had held more than 15% of the share capital of AGRANA, did not lead to a shift in the core shareholder structure and effectively did not have any major implications for the share price, as each of our main owners acquired an equal portion of the shares sold. Additionally, our principal shareholders communicated a clear commitment to the AGRANA Group's continuing listing on the stock market and are seeking to increase the effective free float. AGRANA's presence in the capital markets is to be further improved and the trading liquidity of its shares strengthened again.
AGRANA continues to follow a dividend policy with a long-term focus. This year as well, the Management Board will recommend to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of  3.60 per share, the same amount as for the prior year. This would represent a payout ratio of approximately 47% and a dividend yield of about 4.1% based on the closing share price at the end of the financial year.
The power to succeed rests in our hands Although the mildly positive economic trend helped us hold revenue stable year-on-year, our longer-term ability to generate satisfactory results requires focused investment in sustainable growth, combined with measures to reduce costs. With this in mind we continue to work on finetuning aspects of our organisational structure to make optimal use of our in-house expertise and to reap the full benefits of efficiency gains, especially in energy management.

EU sugar regime With the ending of the European sugar regime in 2017, challenging years of greater competitive pressure are ahead for the sugar industry in Europe. However, this will also enable AGRANA to supply more beet sugar to the Eastern European deficit market and give us the opportunity to win market share in isoglucose (a liquid saccharification product based on starch). In our joint venture plant in Hungary with an isoglucose quota of about 250,000 tonnes, AGRANA already manufactures more than one-third of all isoglucose produced in the EU.

Even without this change in IFRS reporting, however, AGRANA foresees a price-driven reduction in revenue in the new financial year. We do not expect an improvement in the market situation for the Sugar segment, but are projecting stable business in the Starch segment and growth in the Fruit segment thanks partly to the start of production at the new fruit preparations plant in the USA.
On behalf of the whole Management Board, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to AGRANA's successful year, particularly our employees for their loyalty and hard work, and our commercial partners and shareholders for their confidence and trust.

Economy and ecology go hand in hand As a result of the close dependence on agricultural crops that is inherent in our business, the quest for sustainability has always been vital to AGRANA and thus integral to our business model. We are convinced that lasting success is possible only by balancing environmental, economic and social imperatives.

Sincerely
Johann Marihart
Chief Executive Officer

SUPERVISORY BOARD'S REPORT
04 The Supervisory Board actively oversaw and supported AGRANA's performance in the 2013|14 financial year and fulfilled its responsibilities and exercised its powers under the law and the Articles of Association while observing the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In a total of four meetings, of which all its members attended at least half, the Supervisory Board, through the reports of the Management Board and detailed written material, informed itself about the company's business situation and financial position, about all relevant matters concerning the business results, financial situation, investment plans and exceptional business transactions as well as the corporate strategy, and discussed these subjects with the Management Board. The thorough deliberations in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees centred on the corporate strategy and opportunities for the further development of the Group, as well as the current challenges of the general economic environment. The Supervisory Board was briefed in a timely and comprehensive manner about measures requiring its approval. In accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board commissioned an external evaluation of its activities, the findings of which it thoroughly discussed.
Regular key agenda items of the Supervisory Board's deliberations were the strategic orientation and further development of the Group, the business trend in all segments and the optimisation of corporate financing. Outside the regular meetings as well, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board had numerous conversations with the Management Board to discuss ongoing developments in the Group's environment, their impact on current business results, and the risk situation.
In its meeting on 13 May 2013, the Supervisory Board dealt with the audit of the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2013, the nomination of the independent auditor for election for the 2013|14 financial year, and the medium-term investment planning. The independent auditor attended this meeting and reported on the focal points and results of the audit, which also included the accounting-related portion of the internal control system. The Supervisory Board adopted the parent company financial statements and approved the consolidated financial statements. In its meeting on 5 July 2013, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the medium-term planning. The meeting on 14 November 2013 discussed the reporting on the forecast financial results for 2013|14, the subject of corporate governance, and strategic equity investment projects. In February 2014, by circular resolution, the Supervisory Board approved the acquisition by AGRANA Starke GmbH of the 25.1% interest in AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH that was held by Rübenproduzenten Beteiligungs GesmbH. In its meeting on 27 February 2014, the Supervisory Board deliberated on the planning and the investment projects for the 2014|15 financial year. The meeting also discussed the self-evaluation under the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.

Believing both

an important

dual element

of our manage-

ment culture.

AGRANA is committed to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. The Code, a voluntary self-regulatory initiative of private industry, is a comprehensive set of best practices that stipulates equal treatment of all shareholders and transparency of corporate governance. The Code can be viewed on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance at www.corporate-governance.at.
The Code consists of binding so-called L rules (these are based on legal requirements); of C rules (comply-or-explain rules), which are expected to be adhered to, with deviations to be explained in order to achieve compliance with the Code; and of R rules (recommendations), non-compliance with which requires neither disclosure nor explanation.
In the 2013|14 financial year, AGRANA applied the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the version of July 2012. At its meetings on 14 November 2013 and 27 February 2014, the Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of compliance with the Code.
By providing the following explanations, AGRANA is also in conformity with all of the Code's C rules:
 Rule 27 (Management Board compensation criteria) A retroactive change to existing contracts does not appear justified. The existing employment contracts of the Management Board members do not tie variable compensation to nonfinancial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts. Setting ceilings on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unforeseeable developments and to honour special achievements.
 Rule 27a (severance pay) In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act. The Management Board contracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay.
 Rule 49 (contracts requiring approval) Under section 95 (5)(12) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the approval of the Supervisory Board is required for contracts with members of the Supervisory Board by which members undertake, outside their role on the Supervisory Board, to provide a service to the Company or a subsidiary for a material consideration. This also applies to contracts with companies in which a Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest. For business policy and competition reasons, the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the annual report as stipulated in rule 49.
 Rule 54 (appointment of an independent Supervisory Board member) Until 27 February 2014, AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG had a free float of more than 20%. Above this threshold, rule 54 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance stipulates the election of an independent member of the Supervisory Board who is neither a holder of more than 10% of the company's share capital nor represents the interests of such a shareholder. The Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG does not have such a free-float representative. As a result of the change in shareholder structure at the end of February 2014 (also see page 77), rule 54 no longer applies to AGRANA from the new 2014|15 financial year.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The business culture of the AGRANA Group has always been marked by open and constructive teamwork between the Management Board and Supervisory Board, which together ensure that the Code's requirements are fulfilled. The Management and Supervisory Boards of AGRANA, and especially their chairmen, are thus engaged in ongoing dialogue regarding the Group's performance and strategic direction, both at and between Supervisory Board meetings.
To safeguard open and transparent communication with shareholders and the interested public, information given to investors during conference calls and road shows is simultaneously made available to all other shareholders via the Group website (www.agrana.com).

External evaluation In accordance with rule 62 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, AGRANA commissioned an external evaluation of compliance with the Code, which was performed by Univ.-Prof. DDr. Waldemar Jud Corporate Governance Forschung CGF GmbH. The evaluation was conducted using the questionnaire issued for this purpose by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance and is available to the public on the AGRANA website at www.agrana.com. The report confirms that AGRANA complied with the Code in the 2013|14 financial year.

Supervisory Board independence The Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG applies the guidelines for the definition of supervisory board independence in the form set out in Annex 1 to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance:
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past five years, have been a member of the Management Board or other management staff of the company or a subsidiary of the company.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not have a business relationship, of a size significant to the member, with the company or a subsidiary of the company, and shall not have had such a business relationship in the past year. This also applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member holds a significant economic interest, but does not apply to board positions held within the Group.
 The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board under L rule 48 does not automatically imply a member's designation as non-independent.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past three years, have been an external auditor of the Company or a partner or employee of the external auditing firm.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a management board member of another company in which a member of the Company's Management Board is a supervisory board member.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not serve on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a strategic shareholding in the Company or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.
 A Supervisory Board member shall not be a close relative (direct descendant, spouse, common-law spouse, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, nephew or niece) of a Management Board member or of persons holding any of the positions referred to in the foregoing points.

Committees and their members Where the importance or specialist nature of a particular subject matter makes it appropriate, the Supervisory Board also exercises its advisory and supervisory functions through the following three committees:
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee deals with the legal relationships between the Company and the members of the Management Board. The Committee is responsible for succession planning in respect of the Management Board and approves the compensation schemes for the Management Board members. In the 2013|14 financial year the Nomination and Remuneration Committee met once.
The Strategy Committee prepares strategic decisions of the Supervisory Board by providing decision support, and makes decisions in urgent matters. The Strategy Committee held no meetings in the 2013|14 financial year.
The Audit Committee prepares for transaction by the Supervisory Board all matters related to the Company's separate financial statements and to the auditing of the accounting records and of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report, including the corporate governance report. It monitors the effectiveness of the internal control system, audit system and risk management system and verifies the independence and qualifications of the external auditors. In the 2013|14 financial year the Audit Committee met twice. Its meetings focused particularly on the audit of the 2012|13 financial statements, the preparation of the audit of the 2013|14 financial statements, and the supervision of the risk management system.
The Supervisory Board terms of reference include the procedures for the committees; an excerpt of the terms of reference is available on the AGRANA website at www.agrana.com.
Supervisory Board committees consist of the Supervisory Board Chairman or a Vice-Chairman, and of as many Supervisory Board members as the Supervisory Board shall determine. The only exception is the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which consists of the Supervisory Board Chairman and two members appointed from among the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting. If the Supervisory Board has two Vice-Chairmen, they shall be appointed as these two other members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

14 COMPENSATION REPORT

Compensation of the Management Board The Supervisory Board duly reviews and discusses the appropriateness of the Management Board's compensation, also taking into consideration the Group's internal compensation structure.

The total compensation of the Management Board members consists of a fixed and a variable, performance-based component. The performance-based component is contractually tied to the amount of the dividends paid over the respective last three years, in order to take into account sustainable, long-term performance criteria.

The compensation paid out in the 2013|14 financial year and in the prior year to the members of the Management Board was as follows:


2013|14 Johann Marihart (Chief Executive Officer) Fritz Gattermayer Walter Grausam Thomas Kölbl3

On average, the fixed compensation of the Management Board members increased by about 10.9% from the prior year. Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board under the Company's plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme (ASVG) are met. The amount of the pension is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assessment base. For the 2013|14 financial year, pension fund contributions of  968 thousand (prior year:  684 thousand) were paid, while  655 thousand (prior year:  848 thousand) was added to provisions for pension obligations within the balance sheet item "retirement and termination benefit obligations".

In the event of retirement below the age determined under the ASVG, the amount of the pension is reduced. The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund. An amount of  3,940 thousand (prior year:  3,285 thousand) was recognised in the balance sheet at 28 February 2014. In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act (see note on rule 27a).

No compensation agreements in the event of a public takeover offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.

AGRANA maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage for management staff. This D&O insurance covers certain personal liability risks of the persons acting as legal representatives of the AGRANA Group. The cost is borne by AGRANA.

Transactions of members of the Management Board in financial instruments are notified to the Financial Market Authority (FMA) in accordance with section 48d (4) Stock Exchange Act and published on the website of the FMA. During the reporting period there were no such transactions.

Compensation of the Supervisory Board On 5 July 2013 the Annual General Meeting approved an annual aggregate remuneration for the Supervisory Board of  250,000 (prior year:  200,000) for the 2012|13 financial year and delegated to the Supervisory Board the responsibility for allocating this sum among its members. The amount paid to the individual Supervisory Board members is tied to their function on the Board. No meeting fees were paid.

The compensation of the individual members of the Supervisory Board was as follows:

In accordance with section 110 (3) of the Austrian Labour Act, the Supervisory Board members who are employee representatives do not receive Supervisory Board compensation.

COMPLIANCE
For AGRANA, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is integral to good corporate governance.
The Group's compliance policies and the AGRANA Code of Conduct express and establish important values of the Group and its people.
To reduce its various liability risks, the AGRANA Group maintains a compliance organisation with a dedicated compliance office led by the compliance officer. The responsibilities of the compliance officer include assuring the implementation of internal policies, providing support in compliance matters, conducting compliance trainings and documenting any cases of non-compliance.
The purpose of the AGRANA compliance organisation is to protect the Group's best interests, help employees to avoid violating laws or company policies and assist them in applying these correctly.
The Internal Audit department verifies the compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies. Among its activities in the 2013|14 financial year, it audited twelve of the 51 AGRANA sites (23.5%) that fall within the sustainability report boundaries (see page 56), including audits for corruption and fraud. The audits did not find any significant misconduct. Recommendations for minor adjustments to business processes and authorisation structures were and are implemented on an ongoing basis in the companies concerned.

16 MEASURES TO PROMOTE EQUITY FOR WOMEN
Equality of opportunity in the workplace and equal treatment of employees without regard to gender are principles that AGRANA has enshrined in its Code of Conduct. Any form of discrimination is resolutely confronted. The aim of AGRANA's diversity management is to create a work environment where employees feel integrated, respected and connected so that the breadth and depth of their abilities, experience and viewpoints can be harnessed synergistically for the Group.
In line with its core business activity of processing agricultural raw materials, AGRANA is regularly looking for prospective employees with technical training and education. As the proportion of women with vocational training or technical academic degrees is relatively low in Austria and other countries, a "Daughters' Day" was again held in 2013 to raise girls' interest in the technical trades and professions.
Keeping work and family life in harmony is a universal challenge on the career path. Besides the company day-care centre, in 2014|15 AGRANA is therefore offering a childcare service for staff in Vienna on days when schools close locally for a day, and on long-weekend days falling between a public holiday and the weekend. As well, in the summer of 2014 the company is for the first time providing a week of care during the summer holidays for children of employees at the sugar plant in Tulln, Austria. In this initiative, trained educators from the Lower Austria section of Hilfswerk (a non-profit organisation that is one of the country's largest providers of childcare) will put on age-specific, interesting programmes for the children. This pilot project is to help working parents during the summer.

In 2013 the expectation of a continuing expansionary central bank monetary policy, of persistently low interest rates in the longer term and of a mild economic recovery in the industrialised countries led to significant price gains for the major stock markets. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the United States not only reached new historic highs but also charted its largest advance in almost 20 years. Nonetheless, 2013 did not see a global equity boom, as many smaller stock markets ­ and particularly in emerging economies ­ managed only modest gains or even lost ground. As a result of investors' focus on large, liquid equity markets, the performance on the Vienna Stock Exchange lagged that of the eurozone-wide EURO STOXX 50 benchmark index.
AGRANA (ISIN code: AT0000603709) started the 2013|14 financial year at an opening share price of  101.50. The average trading volume rose from the prior year to just over 2,200 shares per day (based on double counting, as published by the Vienna Stock Exchange). AGRANA's share performance differed between the two halves of the financial year: In the middle of June 2013 the share price reached a new all-time high of  115.10, but beginning in the summer it corrected to below  100. Towards the end of the financial year the price moved in a range between  85 and  90. The closing price of AGRANA's shares on the balance sheet date was  87.70. In the financial year under review AGRANA's share price thus decreased by 13.60%, while the performance of the Austrian benchmark index, the ATX, was slightly positive (+4.92%) over the same period.

ACTIVE CAPITAL MARKET COMMUNICATION
AGRANA's investor relations activities are based on the key principles of providing comprehensive information, transparency and ongoing communication with investors and analysts. At the press conferences presenting the annual and half-year results, the financial and industry media were provided with detailed information on the financial results and business performance. In addition, the Management Board gave one-on-one interviews to financial, agricultural and other trade journalists and kept the public informed on current developments through press releases. Journalists were also invited on tours of operational sites.
At several road shows and investor conferences in Austria and abroad, the Management Board provided Austrian and international institutional investors and analysts with information on the performance and prospects of the AGRANA Group. This dialogue was supplemented by numerous individual conversations as well as by conference calls at the publication of quarterly and full-year results. In the financial year AGRANA also hosted an international Capital Markets Day. In October 2013, institutional investors and analysts were invited to tour the new wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf and the sugar factory in Tulln and learn about new developments at the Group. At the GEWINN trade fair, private shareholders had the opportunity to find out about current projects and the operating business of AGRANA directly from the Management Board. AGRANA encourages young people's interest in the capital market; in 2013|14 the Group participated in a business congress for students and invited students to visit company sites as part of an Austria-wide stock market investment game.

In the 2013|14 financial year, Berenberg Bank, Goldman Sachs and Raiffeisen Centrobank published research reports on AGRANA. At the balance sheet date of 28 February 2014 the investment houses respectively rated AGRANA buy, hold, and sell. On 5 March 2014, Koch Bank also initiated coverage of AGRANA's shares.

AGRANA is committed to a dividend policy that takes the long view, with the objective of annually paying out approximately one-third of profit for the period. For the financial year under review, the Management Board will again propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 4 July 2014 to pay a dividend of  3.60 per share or a total of approximately  51.1 million, representing a dividend yield of 4.10% based on the share price of  87.70 at the end of February 2014 (prior year: 3.55%). The dividend payment date is 9 July 2014.

STABLE SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE AND COMMITMENT TO THE CAPITAL MARKET
AGRANA has a long-standing, stable principal shareholder in Z&S Zucker und Stärke Holding AG ("Z&S"), Vienna, which itself is indirectly co-owned by Zucker-Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. ("ZBG"), Vienna, and Germany's Südzucker AG Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, Mannheim, Germany ("Südzucker"). Under a syndicate agreement between Südzucker and ZBG, the partners in the syndicate have mutual rights to appoint members of each other's management board and supervisory board.
In February 2014, AGRANA received notification that British financial services firm Prudential plc (M&G Investments), London, United Kingdom, and several of its subsidiaries had fully divested their holdings in AGRANA. Z&S, which as AGRANA's majority shareholder had until then held 75.5% of the share capital, acquired an additional, direct interest of 10.7% from Prudential plc, giving Z&S a new total of 86.2% of the voting rights in AGRANA. Another 4.9% of AGRANA's shares was acquired directly by Südzucker and is to be returned to free float in order to improve AGRANA's capital market presence and increase its trading liquidity. Z&S holds a call option for this stake of just under 5% of AGRANA's share capital.
The shareholder structure is presented in detail in the section "Capital, Shares, Voting Rights and Rights of Control" on page 77.

AGRANA'S STRATEGY

22

As a partner to

our customers,

we work hand in

hand with them

and commu-

nicate closely.

As an Austrian industrial group with an international focus, AGRANA's Sugar and Starch segments operate in Europe and its Fruit segment's operations are global. In these markets, AGRANA seeks or already commands a leading position in the industrial processing of agricultural raw materials. The Group pursues a growth strategy oriented to the respective local market opportunities. Long-lasting, stable customer and supplier relationships, respectful treatment of all stakeholders and continual growth in the company's value are major cornerstones of the corporate strategy, which is guided by the principles of sustainable management. AGRANA's aim is to provide both its globally operating and its regional customers worldwide with high product quality, optimum service and innovative product development ideas and expertise.
AGRANA controls and manages the product value chain from the purchase of agricultural raw materials to the production of the resulting intermediate goods for industrial customers (and end products for consumers in the case of the Sugar segment). AGRANA utilises the Group's strategic know-how across segment boundaries. This pertains especially to agricultural grower contract management and raw material procurement, the knowledge of customer requirements and markets, the opportunities for the development of inter-segment products, and synergies in logistics, purchasing, sales and finance. These commonalities form the basis for a good market position in relation to competitors in all product groups, and underpin AGRANA's innovative strength and lean cost position.
In its business operations, AGRANA seeks to make the part of the product value chain that it has influence over as sustainable as possible. By sustainability, in this context AGRANA means primarily the following three aspects, which apply to all business segments:
 Utilisation of almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed, and use of low-emission technologies to protect the environment
 Respect for all stakeholders and communities where the Group operates  Engaging in long-term partnerships

The strategic goal: Customer- and market-
oriented growth in Central, Eastern and
South Europe

The strategic goals: Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products

Synergies: Exploit cross-segment synergies to gain ideal positioning for the ever more volatile environment in the business segments

SUGAR SEGMENT STRATEGY

FRUIT SEGMENT STRATEGY

23

The strategic goal: Customer- and market-oriented growth.

The strategic goal: Customer- and market-oriented global growth.

In the Sugar segment, AGRANA is very well positioned as a supplier in the Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries. Through high standards of quality, an extensive sugar product portfolio and the building of the Group's regional brands, AGRANA differentiates itself from the competition. In addition to the goal of positioning sugar as a regional brand-name product, AGRANA continues to strive for full capacity utilisation everywhere and an intensification of marketing activities in Southeastern Europe. AGRANA's Sugar segment is also working to further expand the reselling and refining activities.

In the Fruit segment, the Group's business activities are fruit preparations (AGRANA Fruit, about 70% of the segment's revenue) and fruit juice concentrates (AUSTRIA JUICE, about 30% of segment revenue):
 AGRANA Fruit, acting as a partner to food manufacturers, produces custom fruit preparations for the dairy, ice-cream and baking industries. With local production units close to customers, AGRANA is the world leader in this global market and intends to further expand its presence and follow its internationally operating customers into new markets.

STARCH SEGMENT STRATEGY
The strategic goals: Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products.
In the Starch segment, AGRANA focuses on highly refined specialty products. Innovative, customer-driven products supported by application advice and continuous product development, combined with cost optimisation, are the key to the segment's success. Examples are the leading position in organic and in GMO-free1 starches for the food industry and, in the non-food sector, the leadership role in specialty starches for the paper, textile, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and building materials industries. And AGRANA's essential core competency ­ processing agricultural raw materials into industrial products ­ is also the basis for the bioethanol business. In Austria, AGRANA is the leading vendor of this climate-friendly fuel. Through the new wheat starch plant, AGRANA wants to both further optimise the product portfolio and continue to progress towards the ideal of complete raw material utilisation.

 AUSTRIA JUICE is a producer and reseller mainly of juice concentrates from apples, red fruits and berries. Manufacturing locations near the fruit growing areas allow AGRANA to ensure the high quality of its products, safeguard the global sales to the beverage industry and further expand these sales, including in not-from-concentrate juices and in fruit wines.
Through organic growth and with the help of acquisitions and cooperative new ventures, the Group aims to consolidate and steadily add to its worldwide market position.

SYNERGY STRATEGY

The strategic goal: Use inter-segment synergies to ensure the Group's ideal positioning amid the volatile operating environment in the business segments.

The synergy strategy encompasses the strategies of the three individual segments and also includes the sustainability dimension. For AGRANA, sustainability has an environmental, a social and an economic aspect. The Group strives for careful, prudent use of natural resources, achieves almost 100% utilisation of its raw materials and employs highly efficient technologies to protect the environment.

CAPITAL MARKET STRATEGY
The strategic goal: A long-term partnership with shareholders.
The Group's sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility. For its overall financing needs, in addition to the ability to self-finance, AGRANA has access to committed credit lines and also, in 2012|13, placed a Schuldscheindarlehen (a loan with some bond-like characteristics, sometimes translated as "bonded loan" or "promissory note loan"). AGRANA sees its shareholders as long-term partners in realising the Group's goals and offers them an attractive, long-run return on investment at a reasonable level of risk. With a policy of open and transparent communication, AGRANA aims to ensure investors' confidence in the Group and make its business performance and management decisions predictable and easy to understand.

The growing sustainability consciousness on the part of consumers, and thus of the Group's customers in the downstream food processing industry, increasingly makes the assurance of sustainability criteria along the entire product value chain a condition of buying and sourcing decisions.
As a long-term average, AGRANA procures about 90% of its agricultural raw materials in the European Union, where rigorously enforced legal requirements as well as sociocultural conditions impose very high social and environmental standards. In the EU the challenge is to document the relevant sustainability aspects without unreasonable administrative effort.
In the Fruit segment, AGRANA sources its raw materials worldwide. Here, sustainable production conditions in the upstream supply chain can only be ensured by sourcing primary raw materials that are certified to international sustainability standards, or alternatively by expanding direct procurement from contract growers. As the available worldwide supply of certified agricultural crops and fruits for industrial processing is still very small, AGRANA's Fruit segment wants to further expand the model of buying from contract growers, which is well-established in the other segments. By working directly with the contract farmers, not only is a supply of raw materials secured economically, but environmental and social criteria for agricultural production can be established and implemented together with these suppliers.
At the end of 2013|14, to deepen the work on the environmental and social aspects relevant to AGRANA's procurement of crops and on the associated economic impacts in the upstream supply chain, AGRANA formed a working group on sustainable sourcing. Its members come from all AGRANA business segments and, in 2014|15, will develop strategies for the future according to the degree of vertical integration of the respective sourcing model.

CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION
In the 2013|14 financial year the Group saw two internal mergers, and five additional companies were included in the accounts by proportionate consolidation.
Thus, the Vienna-based "Agrofrucht, Handel mit landwirtschaftlichen Produkten Gesellschaft m.b.H." was merged into AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, Vienna, while Frefrost SARL of Laouamra, Morocco, was merged into the Laouamra-based Dirafrost Maroc SARL.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT
World sugar market For the 2013|14 sugar marketing year ("SMY", October 2013 to September 2014), market research firm F. O. Licht's current forecast of world sugar supply and demand predicts production of 181.0 million tonnes (compared with 184.0 million tonnes in SMY 2012|13) and consumption of 175.8 million tonnes (SMY 2012|13: 172.3 million tonnes). This implies a further stabilisation in world sugar stocks at 76.2 million tonnes (SMY 2012|13: 72.6 million tonnes), or 43.3% (SMY 2012|13: 42.1%) of annual consumption.

Prices on sugar markets were volatile for much of the financial year. In the final months of the reporting period, a steady downward pressure on prices set in that culminated in a three-year low at the end of January 2014. Reports of drought-driven reduced production volumes in South America and a possible cutting of export subsidies in India subsequently brought the downtrend in prices to a halt. At the balance sheet date of 28 February 2014, the closing quotations on commodity exchanges were US$ 476 per tonne for white sugar and US$ 363 per tonne for raw sugar.

At the same time, for SMY 2013|14, the Commission set a total ceiling of 1.35 million tonnes for exports of European non-quota sugar (this corresponds to the export limit imposed by the World Trade Organisation, the WTO).
EU sugar policy In the talks to extend the Common Agricultural Policy to 2020, the European Parliament and the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council have corrected the European Commission's proposal to let the quota and minimum beet price regulations expire as early as the end of SMY 2014|15. Instead they have agreed on an extension to the end of SMY 2016|17 (30 September 2017).

Sugar exports While the international Ministerial Conference in Bali, Indonesia, from 3 to 6 December 2013 was not able to conclude the WTO-II negotiations (the "Doha Round") that have run since 2001, it did produce a partial solution: Of the total of 43 subjects on the Doha Development Agenda, at least the "trade facilitation" pillar was implemented, which reduces bureaucratic red tape as an obstacle to trade. The further schedule is not yet known.

associated dependence on agricultural crops and its commitment to social responsibility, AGRANA places emphasis on the protection of ecosystems and species diversity. Especially in the farm landscape, biodiversity is an important element of sustainability. Both in projects with contract growers and in its own core business of processing farm products, AGRANA therefore strives to protect local ecosystems and conserve biodiversity.

The settling ponds of the AGRANA sugar plant in Hohenau an der March, Austria, which was closed down in 2006, lie in an area of high diversity value identified under the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands (see glossary) and have been a popular destination for bird watchers for many years. On the former factory site, together with the AURING conservationist club, AGRANA provides a rare staging area for water birds, most notably waders.
At the sugar plant in Kaposvár, Hungary, a tank containing about 4,600 tonnes of vinasse broke at the end of September 2013. Vinasse is a by-product of the fermentation of molasses. It is free from toxins and is used as organic fertiliser, as an ingredient in livestock feed and as a raw material in the production of biogas. Through the immediate transfer of the remaining tank contents and by containing the escaped material, most of the vinasse was kept safely in place. However, 15 tonnes of vinasse flowed into the nearby Kapos river as a result of a broken retaining dam.
The responsible environmental and water authorities and the fire department immediately released large volumes of fresh water from two reservoirs into the Kapos river. At no time did the discharged vinasse present a threat to humans. However, it resulted in damage to the fish stocks in the river in the immediate vicinity of the plant. AGRANA is working with local fishing associations on a compensation solution for regeneration of the fish population.
Engagement in the upstream stages of the value chain In the 2012|13 financial year AGRANA had started the "Mont Blanc" project for efficiency improvement in beet production, with environmental aspects also considered. The objective of the project is to increase sugar yield per hectare by 10% to 20% (depending on current yields per hectare in each country) by the year 2017.

The project is being carried out in all countries where AGRANA contracts for sugar beet. Mont Blanc involves agricultural extension, with detailed consulting and education offered to farmers on everything from field preparation and planting of the seeds, through the whole growing season, all the way to harvesting. Prominent subjects include seeding methods, seed drill capacity, seeding timing, fertilising, herbicide and fungicide strategies and correct harvesting. In 2013, extension in Austria focused on beet seeding technology. This involved both analyses related to the seeding method used, and expert inspection and certification of equipment.
Technical information is made available to farmers through personal conversations, field visits, and communication channels such as AGRANA's Raw Material Information System site for beet and potato growers, the AGRANA trade magazine "Agrozucker/Agrostärke" (Agrosugar/Agrostarch), information leaflets and Facebook.
INVESTMENT
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA invested  43.2 million (prior year:  55.9 million) in new assets and asset replacement during the 2013|14 financial year. In Tulln, Austria, the laboratory building expansion of Zuckerforschung Tulln's research facility was completed as planned. In November 2013 in Kaposvár, Hungary, the new 60,000 tonne capacity silo for granulated sugar was inaugurated. To further improve sugar quality, beet thin-juice softening plants started operation at the Czech sites of Hrusovany and Opava. In Roman and Buzu, Romania, the packaging facilities were further modernised and, to ensure sugar quality, two silos were equipped with conditioning systems.

on the previous year's scale.

Especially positive was the rise in quantities sold to wholesalers and retailers, particularly in the Eastern European countries. Overall, despite the challenging environment, the Sugar operations were able to hold or even grow market positions. The situation in Hungary, where market prices continue to be manipulated by widespread VAT fraud, remains difficult.
In sales to the beverage and food industry, the agreements with local and international key accounts resulted in stable volumes. Volumes of non-quota sugar sold to customers in the chemical industry and exports to points outside the EU were largely in line with the prior year.
The previous year's high level of prices, however, could not be duplicated and this significantly hurt margins in the Sugar segment.
In the year under review, the sales volumes of AGRANA Zucker GmbH in Austria were slightly below the prior-year level. The market position was nevertheless maintained. Sales into the food and beverage industry were stable thanks to the intensive collaboration with major local and international customers.
In Hungary in 2013|14, AGRANA was able to increase sales volumes to retailers and industrial customers (by 8.5%) despite difficult market conditions. Because of a high VAT rate, many small importers still neglect to charge or pay value added tax, thus gaining a competitive advantage over AGRANA and driving down prices. To supply the Hungarian market as well as possible, the Group continued to refine imported raw sugar in Hungary. Quota sugar exports from Hungary fell sharply as a result of much lower amounts of sugar swaps and greater shipments to EU customers from Austria.

In Slovakia, the total volume of sugar sales in 2013|14 was in line with one year earlier. A drop in sales to the food industry (down 8.3%) was offset by a positive trend in sales to food retailers (up 13.0%). Owing to reduced availability, exports of surplus sugar and of quota sugar decreased significantly.
AGRANA again sold more sugar in Romania in 2013|14 (up 20.3%) than in the year before. The main contributing factors were significantly higher sales to retailers and stronger exports.
Within Bulgaria, intensive marketing in the year continued to drive up sales volume, by 20.6%. The growth occurred evenly in sales to industry and resellers.
In the Western Balkans region, sugar sales quantities grew further year-on-year (by 19.0%). This was driven primarily by a positive trend in reselling of purchased sugar.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS IN THE SUGAR SEGMENT
In December 2013 the European Commission complied with a judgment of the European Court of Justice to reimburse the European Sugar industry for wrongly collected so-called production levies. As a result, AGRANA received a refund of  4.7 million. This amount was recognised as exceptional income in the 2013|14 financial year.

The Starch segment consists of AGRANA Stärke GmbH, which holds the Austrian plants in Aschach (corn starch), Gmünd (potato starch) and Pischelsdorf (integrated wheat starch and bioethanol plants). The company also manages and coordinates the international starch and bioethanol holdings in Hungary and Romania.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
World grain supply and demand for the 2013|14 grain marketing year1, according to the International Grains Council, shows significantly higher production and demand than in the prior year. Global corn production, at 959 million tonnes, will exceed supply (by 27 million tonnes), as will wheat production at 708 million tonnes compared with demand of 691 million tonnes. Accordingly, both of these raw materials can be expected to see an increase in global stocks.
Consistent with the better supply on international commodity markets, futures prices declined in the course of the year. At the beginning of March 2014 the corn quotation on NYSE Euronext Liffe derivatives exchange in Paris was about  169 per tonne and that for wheat was around  201 per tonne, versus respective year-earlier prices of  227 and  248 per tonne.
The total isoglucose quota of the EU-28 is approximately 720,000 tonnes, of which HUNGRANA holds the largest single share at 250,000 tonnes.

Within this total, processing of freshly harvested, so-called wet corn accounted for approximately 200,000 tonnes by wet weight (prior year: 173,000 tonnes). The amount of specialty corn processed (waxy corn, organic corn, and Guaranteed Non-GMO corn) increased to about 62,000 tonnes (prior year: 59,000 tonnes).
Wheat starch At the new wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, which started operation in June 2013, a net total of about 66,500 tonnes of wheat was used in the 2013|14 financial year to produce wheat starch.

One raw material = four products + zero waste With the wheat starch factory commissioned in June 2013 on the site of the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, AGRANA has expanded its product portfolio from corn and potato starch to wheat starch. Locating the starch production immediately next to the bioethanol plant permits an important further advance in resource efficiency.
Through the close integration of the wheat starch plant and the existing bioethanol facility, the process grain is 100% utilised. Those raw material fractions not utilised in the production of wheat starch and of gluten are used to produce bioethanol and ActiProt®, the premium GMO-free protein feed.

In the 2013|14 financial year the Starch segment generated about 13 kg (prior year: 10 kg) of waste per tonne of core and by-products. The increase in the amount of waste compared to the year before can be attributed mainly to higher production volumes. The item "other" (disposal method) included above all organic process residues generated at the Romanian starch factory that are spread at the site to dry for future use as a soil conditioner in agriculture. Although this material will be reused, local law requires it to be reported as waste.

Biodiversity For the long-term preservation of biological diversity and the associated ability of the ecosystem to function, the sustainable use and management of natural resources are critically important. Through the shared "Business & Biodiversity" platform of the Lower Austrian regional government and Österreichischer Umweltdachverband (an Austrian umbrella organisation for environmental protection), business and conservation are joining forces to work more closely together for their mutual benefit.
In its business activity, AGRANA is dependent on the availability of agricultural raw materials and hence on the functioning of local ecosystems. In summer 2013, mindful of this reliance on nature, the Group together with Lower Austrian contract suppliers carried out the first physical project over this platform: an initiative for bat conservation in Austria's Waldviertel district. Thirty farmers who supply food potatoes to the AGRANA starch factory in Gmünd installed bat boxes on their farm buildings as additional summer quarters for crevice-nesting bat species, since cavities in trees and traditional entry points in buildings are increasingly being lost as nesting locations.
INVESTMENT
Investment in the Starch segment in 2013|14 was  41.0 million (prior year:  59.1 million) and largely flowed to the site in Pischelsdorf, Austria. At this location the wheat starch plant was completed with total project-related capital expenditure over several years of  70 million and with financial support of about  3.4 million from the federal government and the government of Lower Austria; an administra-

TREND REVERSAL ACHIEVED WITH THE RIGHT TOUCH
In the Fruit segment, a clear uptrend was noticeable in 2013|14. The key drivers of the improvement were the structural measures taken in our fruit preparations activities in Europe, and the volume growth in non-European markets. The successful integration and business performance of AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH, the joint venture formed in 2012|13, also contributed to the good results.

AGRANA J&F Holding GmbH is the holding company for the Fruit segment as a whole. The coordination and operational management of the fruit preparations activities are provided by the holding company AGRANA Fruit S.A.S., based in Mitry-Mory, France. Since the merger of AGRANA Juice and Ybbstaler, the holding company operating in the fruit juice concentrates business is AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH, based in Kröllendorf/Allhartsberg, Austria.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Worldwide the demand for fruit preparations for use in yoghurts, ice-cream and food services continues to grow by about 3% per year. A number of non-EU markets, where per-capita consumption is still relatively low, are growing vigorously.
For the United States, the latest market data from IRI1 show strong growth for fruit yoghurts both by volume (3%) and value (8%). In fact, US demand specifically for fruit preparations is growing even more strongly than this, as the product group of Greek yoghurts, which is burgeoning at a growth rate of 29%, has a comparatively higher average content of fruit preparations.
Other regions with strong growth rates of up to 10% remain Brazil, North Africa, Ukraine, China and Southeast Asia. Lower growth rates of around 3% are seen in highly developed markets (notably South Korea and Australia) and in countries where overall economic growth has slowed (Russia, Mexico and South Africa).
In the EU, demand for fruit preparations continues to ease by about 1.5% per year. This decline continues to be driven by lower consumer confidence over the macroeconomic situation and by a slight trend towards natural yoghurts without fruit ingredients. Positive exceptions are the relatively small Scandinavian markets, which are showing mild growth, and France (the second largest market after Germany), where the fruit yoghurt market is stabilising.
In the juice concentrate business, the trend towards fruit juice beverages with low juice content continues unbroken. For beverages high in fruit juice, consumption in Western Europe remains on a mild easing trend, with most of this decrease occurring in Germany. Prices for fruit juice concentrates in Europe have settled in at a low overall level as a result mainly of three factors: inventories carried over from the very good 2012 crop, average processing volumes in the most important European growing regions (Poland, Italy, and Hungary) in the 2013 processing season, and an above-average harvest in Turkey.

RAW MATERIALS, CROPS AND PRODUCTION
The financial year under review brought an improvement on raw material markets, thanks to a combination of moderate demand on fruit markets and trends in emerging market exchange rates. Generally, purchasing prices on average found a level slightly below that of the prior year. The prices for sugar, starch and liquid sugar, which are a major cost factor in fruit preparations ingredients, were significantly lower than in the year before.

AGRANA'S PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF SUSTAINABILITY
By sustainability, AGRANA means a harmonious balance of economic, environmental and social responsibility. In developing the Group-wide sustainability management system, AGRANA formulated three principles that sum up its concept of sustainability more concretely and reflect the six core subjects most significant for the Group.
At AGRANA we:  Utilise almost 100% of our raw materials and employ low-emission technologies
to protect the environment  Respect all our stakeholders and the communities where we operate  Engage in long-term partnerships
The essence of these three principles is also incorporated in AGRANA's mission statement. Beyond legal requirements and voluntary reporting commitments and standards, these principles are meant to serve management and employees as a practical and intuitive guide to daily sustainable action.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
Organisational boundaries of sustainability reporting The sustainability information integrated in this 2013|14 annual report which is considered material to AGRANA's business activities is marked with a green fingerprint. The content is selected and structured based on the questionnaire of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI version 3.1) and on the GRI's food processing sector supplement. For the first time, the performance figures assembled for the Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments include data for AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH, a joint venture firm created in the 2012|13 financial year by the merger of AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH and Ybbstaler Fruit Austria GmbH that is fully consolidated by AGRANA in the Fruit segment.
For organisational boundary reasons, the joint ventures that are proportionately consolidated in the financial statements of the AGRANA Group ­ i. e., the AGRANA-Studen group (in the Sugar segment) and the HUNGRANA group (in the Starch segment) ­ as well as companies not material for sustainability reporting purposes, such as INSTANTINA (in the Sugar segment), remain excluded from the scope of the data. In total, operations excluded from the sustainability data for 2013|14 represented revenue of  299.4 million and an average of 367 employees.
Content boundaries of sustainability reporting At the Group's 54 production sites worldwide, AGRANA's Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments use agricultural raw materials to make premium foods and many high-quality intermediate products both for the downstream food industry and for non-food applications. In 2012|13 AGRANA's cross-segment, cross-functional sustainability core team grouped the sustainability aspects that are material to the business activities into the following six subject areas:
 Environmental and social criteria in the sourcing of agricultural raw materials  Environmental and energy aspects of production  Labour practices and human rights of employees  Product responsibility and sustainable products  Compliance and business conduct  Social engagement

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT SUSTAINABILIT Y

57
To these six topics, AGRANA assigned the GRI indicators relevant for its business activities. The most relevant indicators are covered in this annual report (see GRI content index on page 167). The materiality of the individual indicators was determined based on stakeholder feedback received by the various business segments and functional departments. This materiality information was for the first time recorded in a structured manner Group-wide by the AGRANA sustainability core team in the 2012|13 financial year and the materiality of the indicators was confirmed in 2013|14.

TO NATURE'S GIFTS
Product innovation is vital to success in our highly competitive market environment. After a physical expansion of our research facility in Tulln, it will become the single, central new "AGRANA Research and Innovation Center", combining the Austrian research and development activities that until now have been geographically separated into those of the Sugar and Starch segments in Tulln and of the Fruit segment in Gleisdorf.

We are always trying out new ideas
and seeking innovative solutions.

Operating in a highly competitive market environment, it is vital for AGRANA to be a market trendsetter and differentiate itself from the competition through product innovations. In close partnership with customers, AGRANA's research and development (R&D) teams are always working on new recipes, specialty products and innovative applications for existing products, in a tribute also to the Group's strategic focus on lasting, sustainable success.
In the 2013|14 financial year AGRANA maintained two research and development facilities. The activities of Zuckerforschung Tulln Ges.m.b.H. (ZFT) in Tulln, Austria, ranged from agricultural R&D, to food, sugar, starch and bioethanol technology, all the way to microbiology and biotechnology projects. Meanwhile, the Centre of Innovation and Excellence in Gleisdorf, Austria, conducted the centralised research and development for the fruit preparations business. This facility was responsible for the development of products and production methods, in addition to longer-term R&D projects to provide AGRANA's international customers with innovative solutions in direct response to the needs of the market.
With the help of a physical expansion of the research site in Tulln, AGRANA's research and innovation activities at the existing two centres will soon be combined in this one location. From July 2014 the new AGRANA Research & Innovation Center (ARIC) with a staff of about 60 people will be the Group's central research and development institute. This merging of resources is expected not only to yield administrative synergies but is especially intended to promote the closer collaboration of the previously geographically separate groups of researchers. The complementarity between the knowledge and experience of both groups will generate advantages in cross-segment areas of research such as clean label, nutrition physiology, sweeteners and aromas. In this way, the growing number of projects that pertain to more than one AGRANA business segment is expected to be carried out much more simply and efficiently. This new AGRANA "research cluster" at the Tulln facility also makes for easy and close connectivity with relevant university institutions and their graduates.
SUGAR SEGMENT
Methods developed and operationally used by AGRANA in recent years for the objective detection of deteriorated beet (beet damaged by changes in weather conditions during storage) won international recognition at the 3rd general meeting of the ESST, the European Society for Sugar Technology. AGRANA's report on this subject received the Best Paper Award. With the methods described by AGRANA, such as image analysis and the detection of volatile organic compounds and of glucose produced during the natural breakdown of sucrose, beets that will be difficult to process can be identified well in advance and remedial measures taken early enough. This largely avoids disruptions of operations and reduces expenses for the necessary process additives.

In order to improve the microbiological quality of sugar products, a new project was launched last year around the detection of thermoacidophiles (bacteria-like, single-celled organisms) in the sugar manufacturing process. The project goal is to identify potential sources of infection and minimise the risk of sugar product contamination with thermoacidophiles.

Another research priority at ZFT in food starches was the study of the nutrition physiology of specialty starches as dietary fibre. For this purpose, together with the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, a preliminary stage to testing in humans is to be established using a porcine model. Two AGRANA specialty starches are already being studied by means of this test. A transglucosidated dextrin was developed that is suitable for the proxy to studies in humans.

In the new 2014|15 financial year, the previously begun activities are being continued, and with the improvement of the individual process building blocks, a solid foundation is to be laid for supporting the AGRANA plants and local developer teams. The right combinations of the optimised building blocks are to ensure made-to-measure product development.
In R&D for fruit juice concentrates, AGRANA worked on the optimisation of aroma yield and aroma quality in its production plants. A project to improve the utilisation and marketing of press cake, such as apple and blueberry pomace, in the form of by-products was successfully carried out. A patent was issued in Austria for the process for producing "apple flour", a valuable, low-calorie source of dietary fibre for use especially in the baking industry.
In 2014|15 the central research priority for AUSTRIA JUICE will be the further expansion of the development capabilities for beverage bases and aromas.
Special attention in this regard is placed on the development, and ultimately the marketing, of premium natural fruit flavourings known as FTNF ("from the named fruit") flavours. Other R&D objectives are the improvement of manufacturing processes for water phase flavours, and the evaluation of the technical feasibility of reducing critical herbicide use in the fruit juice supply chain by physical methods.

A GRIP ON SUSTAINABILITY IN THE
SUPPLY CHAIN
AGRANA's core business is the resource-saving, lowemission processing of agricultural raw materials. Depending on the particular sourcing model, we strive to also exert influence on the social and environmental criteria used in our agricultural supply chain. In the 2013|14 financial year this was practiced very successfully in a pilot project with long-standing Mexican contract suppliers of strawberries and blackberries.

AGRANA'S PEOPLE

68 We challenge our
people to excel and we support them with focused
training and development.

In the 2013|14 financial year the AGRANA Group as a whole employed an average of 8,778 people (prior year: 8,449). Of this total, 2,131 worked in Austria (prior year: 1,993) and 6,647 in other countries (prior year: 6,456). The average number of employees in each business segment was as follows:
 Sugar segment: 2,399 employees (prior year: 2,315)  Starch segment: 1,008 employees (prior year: 950)  Fruit segment: 5,371 employees (prior year: 5,184)
The average age of permanent employees1 on 28 February 2014 was 41 years, as in the prior year. Of the permanent employees, 28.9% (prior year: 28.4%) were women, and 60.1% of salaried staff had an academic degree (prior year: 57.7%).
The increase in staff numbers in the Sugar segment resulted partly from the fact that the employees of the AGRAGOLD companies were included for the first time. As well, the production operations of AGRANA Zucker GmbH required more staff than in the previous year. In the Starch segment, the growth of about 6% in the staff count was driven primarily by the start of operations of the new wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria. The higher number of people working in the Fruit segment was attributable both to the coming opening of the new US production facility in Lysander in New York state and a volume-induced greater need for seasonal workers, particularly at the plants in Mexico and Ukraine.
HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AGRANA's personnel strategy follows sustainable principles. It is defined by mutual respect ­ including respect for different cultures and religions ­ and seeks to encourage entrepreneurial thinking and action.
AGRANA's human resources management in 2013|14 continued to focus on the judicious support and development of employees as key factors for the Group's success in the future.
Additionally, the processes in HR administration were further harmonised and standardised, and information technology solutions were revised from the ground up to enhance the level of detail of, for instance, the monthly reporting while at the same time improving administrative

AGRANA's compensation policy is generally based on collective bargaining agreements. For its management, AGRANA maintains a global, objectively based compensation system consisting of a fixed (salary) element and a variable element. The fixed compensation is based on the job duties, market rates of pay and the need for internal fairness. The amount of variable pay is dependent on achievement of the respective corporate business targets and individual targets.
In the 2013|14 financial year, 6.7% (prior year: 6.0%) of all employees were covered by this incentive-enhanced compensation scheme.

AGRANA makes a particular point of encouraging and developing talent. In January 2014, twenty-two men and seven women completed what was already the third cycle of AGRANA Competencies Training (ACT), a two-year talent development curriculum for employees. The project presentation which concluded it showcased results that surpassed the already high expectations, such as regarding further marketing opportunities for residues from apple juice concentrate production. However, equally striking was the positive development in the participating employees themselves over the course of the programme. The results of the specific projects completed within ACT, as well as the intensive training of selected staff members, are doing their part to prepare AGRANA for the future.

STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
As in the previous years, AGRANA offered numerous trainings, in subject areas spanning both professional skills and personal development. Ongoing Group-wide programmes were continued to foster interaction between the segments, strengthen the Group's international integration and encourage broad horizons. Only this consistent effort can ensure the lasting success of these trainings and trainee programmes and ensure they add value for the Group and for employees.

In the year under review, AGRANA provided training to a total of 78 apprentices (prior year: 65) in Austria and Germany in preparation for careers as, among others, mechanical engineering technicians, electrical engineering technicians, plant electricians and process control technicians, metalworking technicians, chemical lab technicians, food technicians, mechatronics technicians, industrial sales representatives and computer technicians. The proportion of female apprentices was 10.3%.

In the 2013|14 financial year there were no fatal accidents in the workplace at the AGRANA Group1. In the 2013|14 financial year there were five accidents of AGRANA contractors. For organisational reasons, these are not included in the AGRANA workplace safety data such as the injury rate, lost day rate and absentee rate.

1 Non-permanent (i. e., fixed-term or temporary) and permanent employees within the GRI reporting boundaries (see page 56). 2 Injury rate = (total number of accidents5 ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 3 Lost day rate = (total number of lost days7 ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 4 Absentee rate = (total number of missed hours due to accident5 and sickness ÷ total paid hours worked6) × 200,000 5 In AGRANA's workplace safety data, injuries are counted as accidents if a scheduled work day is lost. Days are counted
as lost from the first scheduled work day missed after the accident (excluding accidents on the way to or from work). 6 Total paid hours worked are defined by AGRANA as contractual work hours plus paid overtime. 7 A work day is assumed to have eight hours.

DIVERSITY
For its core business of the industrial processing of agricultural raw materials into foods and high-quality intermediate products for the downstream food industry and for non-food applications, AGRANA regularly seeks employees with a vocational background or higher technical education. As the proportion of women with vocational training or technical academic degrees is relatively low in Austria and other countries, a "Daughters' Day" was again held in 2013 to raise girls' interest in the technical trades and professions.
A significant challenge on the career path is that of keeping work and family life in harmony. AGRANA already provides a company kindergarten, as well as a childcare service for children of staff in Vienna on days when schools close locally for a day, and on longweekend days falling between a public holiday and the weekend. Going a step further, on a pilot basis in summer 2014, the company is for the first time offering a week of childcare during the summer holidays for children of employees at the sugar plant in Tulln, Austria. During the pre-school and school holidays in Lower Austria, trained educators from the Lower Austria section of Hilfswerk, a care services organisation, will provide age-specific, rich and diverse programmes for children aged three to ten years, ranging from creative workshops to excursions and sports activities.

RISK MANAGEMENT
AND SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL

72

We accept and

risks and

avoid excessive

uncertainty.

The Management Board of the AGRANA Group recognises the importance of active risk management. The basic aim of such risk management is to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible and take appropriate measures to safeguard the profitability and continued existence of the Group.
The AGRANA Group uses integrated monitoring and reporting systems that permit regular assessment of the risk situation. For the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group, two mutually complementary control tools are in place:
 An enterprise-wide, operational planning and reporting system forms the basis for the monthly reporting to the appropriate decision-makers. Under this reporting process, a separate risk report is prepared for the Group and each business segment. Its focus is on risks and opportunities arising from changing market prices for the current and next financial year. Besides these ongoing reports, the risk managers from the different business areas regularly discuss with the Management Board the business situation and the use of risk mitigation measures.
 The aim of strategic risk management is to identify material individual risks and evaluate their implications for the overall profile of risks and opportunities. Twice every year, the medium- to long-term risks in the individual business areas are analysed by a designated risk management team together with the Group's central risk management function. The process involves risk identification and risk assessment by probability of occurrence and potential magnitude of risk/opportunity, the definition of early warning indicators and the taking of countermeasures. Also, the aggregate risk position of the AGRANA Group is determined for the current financial year using a Monte Carlo simulation. This allows a judgement to be made as to whether a combination or accumulation of individual risks could pose a threat to the ability to continue in business as a going concern. The results are reported to the Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
The business segments of the AGRANA Group have designated risk management representatives responsible for initiating loss-minimising measures as required, subject to Management Board approval.
RISK POLICY
AGRANA sees the responsible treatment of business opportunities and risks as an essential basis for purposeful, value-driven and sustainable business management. The Group's risk policy seeks to ensure risk-aware behaviour and stipulates clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and integrated internal controls.
Throughout the Group, risks may be assumed only if they arise from the core business of the AGRANA Group and it does not make economic sense to avoid, insure or hedge them. The policy is to minimise risks to the extent reasonably possible while achieving an appropriate balance of risks and returns. The assumption of risks outside the operating business is strictly prohibited.
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is responsible for the Group-wide coordination and implementation of risk management arrangements determined by the Management Board. The use of derivative financial instruments is permitted only for the purpose of hedging business transactions, not for speculative purposes. Use of derivatives is subject to regular reporting to the Management Board.

LEGAL RISKS

REGULATORY RISKS
Risks from sugar market regulation Sugar regime: The Council of European Union and the European Parliament reached agreement in October 2013 to let the EU sugar regime expire in September 2017. The quota system for sugar and isoglucose will thus end on 30 September 2017 and both products can then be manufactured and sold in any quantity.

AGRANA continually monitors possible changes in the legal setting that could lead to a risk situation, and takes anticipative action as appropriate. This applies particularly to food and environmental legislation.
There are currently no civil actions pending against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Free trade agreement: The free trade agreement currently being negotiated between the European Union and the United States could have economic impacts on AGRANA. As it currently stands, agricultural products (especially sugar and starch) are classified as sensitive products and are thus excluded from the talks. However, this may change in further rounds of negotiation that are to begin in 2015. Details of the agreement texts under negotiation are not yet publicly available.
As part of the risk management process, potential scenarios and their impacts are analysed and evaluated from an early stage. Current developments and their implications are also reported beginning on page 37 of this report, in the section on the Sugar segment.

As noted in previous annual reports, the Slovak competition authority opened investigations in the 2009|10 financial year into, among other entities, the local AGRANA sugar company. However, to date no further steps have been taken.
The antitrust case filed in 2010 by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, Mannheim, Germany, for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to Austria has thus far not brought a further ruling by the Cartel Court. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded.
FINANCIAL RISKS

AGRANA is subject to risks from movements in exchange rates, interest rates and product prices. The financing of the Group is largely provided centrally by the Treasury department, which regularly reports to the Management Board on the movement in and structure of the Group's net debt, on financial risks and the amounts and results of the hedging positions taken.

The Group's aggregate risk exposure was marked by continuing high volatility in selling prices and raw material purchasing prices, and on balance remained the same as in the prior year. At present there are no discernible risks to the AGRANA Group's ability to continue in business.

CAPITAL, SHARES, VOTING RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF CONTROL
(DISCLOSURES UNDER SEC TION 243A (1) AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE)
77
The share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG at the balance sheet date of 28 February 2014 was  103.2 million, divided into 14,202,040 voting ordinary no-par value bearer shares. There are no other classes of shares.
Z&S Zucker und Stärke Holding AG ("Z&S"), based in Vienna, is the majority shareholder, directly holding 86.2% of the share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Z&S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGRANA Zucker, Stärke und Frucht Holding AG, Vienna, in which Zucker-Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. ("ZBG"), Vienna, in turn holds 50% less one share (that share being held by AGRANA Zucker GmbH, a subsidiary of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG) and in which Südzucker AG Mannheim/ Ochsenfurt ("Südzucker"), Mannheim, Germany, holds the other 50%. The following five Viennabased entities are shareholders of ZBG: ,,ALMARA" Holding GmbH (a subsidiary of Raiffeisen-Holding Niederösterreich-Wien registrierte Genossenschaft mit beschränkter Haftung); Marchfelder Zuckerfabriken Gesellschaft m.b.H.; Estezet Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H.; Rübenproduzenten Beteiligungs GesmbH; and Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest Beteiligungs AG. Under a syndicate agreement between Südzucker and ZBG, the voting rights of the syndicate partners are combined in Z&S, there are restrictions on the transfer of shares, and the partners in the syndicate have certain mutual rights to nominate members of each other's management board and supervisory board. Thus, Johann Marihart has been nominated by ZBG and appointed as a member of the management board of Südzucker, and Thomas Kölbl has been nominated by Südzucker and appointed as a member of the management board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG.
Until 27 February 2014, M&G Investments, a subsidiary of London, UK-based financial services firm Prudential plc, held 15.6% of AGRANA's share capital. Z&S, which as the majority shareholder of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG had until then held 75.5% of the share capital, acquired an additional, direct interest of 10.7% from M&G Investments, giving Z&S a new total of 86.2% of the voting rights in AGRANA. Another 4.9% of AGRANA's shares were acquired directly by Südzucker, which thus increased its direct interest in AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG to about 6.5%. Of this total, the newly acquired stake of almost 5 percentage points is to be placed on the market again in order to increase the widely held (free float) portion of shares of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. The aim is to boost the liquidity of AGRANA shares and thus enhance their attractiveness for investors. On any shares within this stake of 4.9% that are not placed, Z&S holds a call option that can be exercised from 1 March 2015, with Südzucker as the counterparty.
No shareholder has special rights of control. Employees who are also shareholders of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG exercise their voting rights individually.
The Management Board does not have powers to issue or repurchase shares except to the extent provided by law.
The agreements pertaining to the Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) and credit lines (syndicated loan agreements) contain change of control clauses that grant the lenders an extraordinary right to call the loans.
With this exception, there are no significant agreements that take effect, change materially, or end, in the case of a change of control resulting from a takeover offer. No compensation agreements in the event of a public takeover offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.

OUTLOOK

78
The power to achieve continuing
success rests in our hands.

CHANGES RESULTING FROM USE OF EQUITY ACCOUNTING FROM 2014|15 FINANCIAL YEAR
The application of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) is mandatory from the new 2014|15 financial year. As a result, the companies of the HUNGRANA group (in the Starch segment) and of the Western Balkans group (in the Sugar segment) will no longer be proportionately consolidated in AGRANA's consolidated financial statements but instead will be accounted for using the equity method (details are provided in the notes from page 95). The transition to the equity method of accounting will have impacts particularly on the reporting of sales revenue, operating profit before exceptional items and operating profit after exceptional items.
The outlook for 2014|15 is already presented on the basis of using equity accounting to restate the 2013|14 comparative data, as shown in the following table.

m
Revenue Operating profit before exceptional items Share of results of associates Operating profit after exceptional items [EBIT]

2013|14 restated2
2,841.7 134.8 28.4 167.0

It should be noted that, as a result of the adoption of equity accounting referred to above, the focus of the earnings outlook is now on profit after exceptional items (EBIT). The reason is that under the new accounting standard, operating profit before exceptional items, which was the target parameter until now, no longer includes the HUNGRANA and Western Balkans groups and, in the future, would thus not fairly present the AGRANA Group's actual results.
As the Fruit segment is not affected by the new method of inclusion in the accounts, no IFRS 11 reconciliation is provided for this segment.

OUTLOOK FOR THE 2014|15 FINANCIAL YEAR
In view of the healthy balance sheet structure on 28 February 2014 and the well-diversified business model, AGRANA believes it is soundly positioned for the new financial year, but expects a slightly lower earnings trend.
At present, AGRANA expects a small decrease in Group revenue for the 2014|15 financial year as a result of a combination of somewhat lower average selling prices and a slight increase in sales volumes. The Group also foresees a mild decrease in operating profit after exceptional items (EBIT).

In the Starch segment, AGRANA is expecting a small, pricedriven revenue reduction for 2014|15. The new wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf will be fully operational all year and produce native wheat starch, wheat gluten and wheat bran. The resulting potential positive impact on sales volumes will probably not be able to make up for the price decline ­ especially in saccharification products and bioethanol ­ as a result of the high levels of supply on the market. Nonetheless, AGRANA expects EBIT in the Starch segment to come in slightly ahead of the year-earlier result.

1 Proportionate consolidation. 2 Equity accounting.
In the Sugar segment AGRANA expects a decline in revenue amid the continuing low selling prices for sugar. It is believed that, in the new 2014|15 financial year, the raw sugar refining volumes in the EU and Bosnia will see an increase. For the 2014|15 campaign year, AGRANA is planning on a similarly high acreage of beet fields as in the 2013|14 sugar marketing year. As the revenue reduction will only partly be offset by lower raw material costs, a further decrease in EBIT is projected.

The projection in the Fruit segment for the 2014|15 financial year is for sustained growth in revenue thanks to rising sales volumes. EBIT is also seen as rising. In fruit preparations, both revenue and EBIT are expected to increase. AGRANA thinks that volumes of fruit preparations sales will expand in all regions. Despite the start-up costs for the new US plant, it should be possible to raise EBIT earnings, thanks particularly to synergy effects in production costs and structural costs. In the fruit juice concentrate activities, a gentle easing trend in revenue is expected year-on-year. For efficiency improvement, a uniform shared enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is being implemented at all juice companies in Austria, Poland and Hungary to allow synergies to be fully mobilised. EBIT of AUSTRIA JUICE should be marginally below the 2013|14 result.

PLANNED INVESTMENT IN 2014|15
During 2014|15, total investment in the three segments, at about  96 million, will be in line with the rate of depreciation.
The investment planned for the Sugar segment is approximately  37 million. Most of this spending will target the areas of packaging and storage. In Tulln, Austria, a reconfiguration of the molasses desugaring plant is to be begun. In Kaposvár, Hungary, work will continue on the construction of the central packaging facility for Hungary. At three sites ­ in Hrusovany and Opava in the Czech Republic, and in Sere, Slovakia ­ a total of four beet pulp presses need to be replaced as a result of wear and aging technology after having been in use for decades. As well, the building expansion at the research facility in Tulln is being completed.
The investment budget for the Starch segment is approximately  11 million. At the plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, investment will flow to the expansion of DDGS1 storage and to the facilities for the unloading of ships. Capital spending in Gmünd, Austria, is to pay for boosting the performance of the MSD3 multi-stage spray dryer and replacing the existing automatic filter press. At the factories in Aschach, Austria, and Tndrei, Romania, various asset replacement and maintenance investment is planned.
The Fruit segment has the Group's highest budgeted investment for the year, at about  48 million. The main capital expenditure project in 2014|15 is the completion of the new US fruit preparations plant in Lysander, New York. Investment in Morocco is to focus on a warehouse expansion. Central projects in the fruit juice concentrate operations are asset replacement and maintenance investment, continuous improvement of product quality, and implementing the optimisation of the network of production sites in Austria.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

88

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG ("the Company") is the parent company of the AGRANA Group and has its registered office at Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen-Platz 1, A-1020 Vienna. The Company together with its subsidiaries constitutes an international group engaged mainly in the worldwide industrial processing of agricultural raw materials.
The consolidated financial statements of the AGRANA Group for 2013|14 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in effect at the balance sheet date and with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union.

1. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The segment reporting, which conforms with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8, distinguishes between three business segments ­ Sugar, Starch and Fruit ­ and thus follows the AGRANA Group's internal reporting structure.
The AGRANA Group has the three reportable segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit, which correspond to its strategic businesses. Each of the segments offers a different product portfolio and is managed separately in view of the different production technologies, raw material procurement and sales strategies. AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft ("AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG"), the Group's holding company, is considered part of the Sugar segment.
For each segment, there is internal monthly reporting to the Group's chief operating decision maker. Information on the results of the reportable segments is given below. Segment profitability is evaluated primarily on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items, which is a key performance indicator in every internal management report.

The revenue and asset data represent consolidated amounts. Inter-segment charges for products and services are based on comparable market prices.
Exceptional items consisted of income from reimbursement for excess amounts of production levy paid for the 2001|02 to 2005|06 sugar marketing years, and expenses for the closure of a fruit preparations plant in South Africa.
The items "segment assets" and "segment liabilities" match the allocation used in internal reporting.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

91

Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros (000) unless otherwise indicated. As a result of automated calculation, rounding errors may occur in totals of rounded amounts and percentages.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the principles of clarity, understandability and materiality were observed. In the presentation of the income statement, the nature of expense method was used. The separate financial statements of the fully consolidated companies represented in the consolidated financial statements are based on uniform accounting policies.

In addition to the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement and balance sheet, a statement of changes in equity is presented. The notes also include information on the business segments.

All IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that were effective at the time of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and applied by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG have been adopted by the European Commission for application in the EU.

The amendments to IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures) regarding expanded disclosures on instances of netting had no impacts. The newly effective IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) introduced a single, cohesive standard for the determination of fair value. The new standard led to expanded disclosures on financial instruments, particularly in interim reporting; there were no material impacts on the Group's fair value accounting and measurement.

The amended IAS 12 (Income Taxes), the newly effective IFRIC 20 (Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine) and the amendments to standards under the Annual Improvements Project 2009­2011 had no effects on the consolidated financial statements.

The impacts from the initial application of IAS 19 (Employee Benefits; Revised 2011) are presented later in this section. The amended IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) had been adopted early, at the beginning of the 2012|13 financial year.

The following standards and interpretations either have been adopted by the European Union and will become effective for the 2014|15 financial year or later, or have been issued by the IASB but not yet adopted by the EU. In the latter case, the effective year given in the table represents the expected time of adoption. AGRANA has not early-adopted any of the new or changed standards cited below.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

Expected impacts on AGRANA
The amendments, titled "Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19 `Employee Benefits')", relate to the recognition of contributions from employees or third parties where the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of employee service. It will be permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. No material impact on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows is expected.
The scope of IAS 28 is expanded to include investments in joint ventures (see explanations regarding IFRS 11).
The amendment provides clarifications on the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities. AGRANA does not expect any material impacts.
The amendments titled "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" clarify that the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit for which an impairment loss was recognised or reversed during the period must be disclosed. Additional disclosures are required if the recoverable amount was determined based on fair value less costs of disposal. These disclosures include the level of the fair value hierarchy and, in the case of Level 2 and Level 3 measurements, a description of the valuation technique, key assumptions, and (if a fair value technique was employed) the discount rate used. For the Group this is expected to lead to expanded disclosures.
The amendments published as "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" clarify that, under certain conditions, derivatives may remain designated as hedging instruments in an existing hedge relationship despite their novation. This is not expected to have a material impact.
The new IFRS 9 standard sets out the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets and liabilities. Work to update the issued standard has already begun. The categories and associated measurement benchmarks are being revised. The existing classification and measurement model of IAS 39 is to be eliminated. The new rules for hedge accounting were published in November 2013. They set out the future requirements for accounting for hedging positions. The key differences from the existing requirements under IAS 39 include the elimination of the thresholds of hedge effectiveness to be used in the retrospective test of effectiveness, in favour of documentation of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. A new effective date will be set by the IASB when the standard is complete. Only then is the standard to be endorsed by the European Union. AGRANA is reviewing the likely impacts on accounting and measurement. An expansion of disclosures is expected.
IFRS 10 replaces the guidelines in IAS 27 (Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements) and SIC 12 (Consolidation ­ Special Purpose Entities) on control and consolidation. IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that the same criteria will be applied to all companies in determining a relationship of control. Having control now means having exposure or rights to variable returns, and the ability to affect those returns through power over an investee. In November 2012 the IASB amended the standard in relation to investment entities; these amendments were adopted by the EU in November 2013. There are no impacts on AGRANA's consolidated financial statements.
The new standard defines two types of joint arrangements ­ joint operations and joint ventures. The existing option to account for jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation is removed. Partner entities in a joint venture (joint venturers) must now use the equity method of accounting. The accounting rules for parties to joint operations (joint operators) become consistent with the existing accounting treatment of jointly controlled assets and jointly controlled operations. In AGRANA's consolidated financial statements for the year under review, twelve companies are included by proportionate consolidation. Had IFRS 11 already been applied in 2013|14, the impact would have been as presented in a table later in this section.

RESTATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH IAS 8
IAS 19 (Employee Benefits, Revised 2011): The key revision to IAS 19 was that actuarial gains and losses must now be recognised in other comprehensive income; this change was early-adopted by AGRANA in the 2011|12 financial year under IAS 19 in its then current form. The accounting changes in the 2013|14 financial year relate to the correction of past service cost, with the effect of an increase in provisions for pensions and termination benefits. These changes were made retrospectively from the beginning of the 2012|13 financial year.
In the balance sheet at 28 February 2013, this restatement led to an increase of  310 thousand in pension and termination benefit provisions and an increase of  116 thousand in deferred tax assets. The net effect was a reduction of  207 thousand in consolidated shareholders' equity.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PREPARATION

Expected impacts on AGRANA
IFRS 12 sets out the required disclosures for entities that report in accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) and IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures). It will have the effect of expanding disclosures. In November 2012 the IASB amended the standard in relation to investment entities; these amendments were adopted by the EU in November 2013. The application of the standard will lead to expanded disclosures.
IFRS 14 permits entities that are first-time adopters of IFRS to continue to account for regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with their previous GAAP both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements. The standard is not relevant to AGRANA.
The improvements relate mainly to IFRS 2 (Definition of vesting conditions), IFRS 3 (Accounting for contingent consideration in a business combination), IFRS 8 (Aggregation of operating segments), IFRS 13 (Short-term receivables and payables), IAS 16 and IAS 38 (Revaluation method ­ proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation/amortisation) and IAS 24 (Key management personnel). The impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are being assessed.
The improvements relate mainly to IFRS 1 (meaning of effective IFRSs), IFRS 3 (scope of exception for joint ventures), IFRS 13 (scope of IFRS 13) and IAS 40 (clarification of the interrelationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40 when classifying property as investment property or as owner-occupied). The impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are being assessed.
IFRIC 21 provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government. Its scope does not cover income taxes (as defined in IAS 12), fines and other penalties. Its application to liabilities arising from emissions trading schemes is optional. The obligating event for the recognition of a liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. If the obligating event occurs over a period of time, the liability is recognised progressively. By contrast, if the obligation is triggered by reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised when that threshold is reached. The recognition requirements also apply to interim financial statements. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

95

The adjustments to the 2012|13 income statement reduced staff costs for 2012|13 by  39 thousand and increased profit for the period by  26 thousand. This resulted in an increase of  13 thousand in deferred tax liabilities. As non-cash items, none of the effects cited have an impact on the cash flow statement.
Impacts from the adoption of IFRS 11 in the subsequent financial year Through the application of IFRS 11, the companies of the HUNGRANA group and the Sugar segment's Western Balkans group will no longer be proportionately consolidated but instead included by the equity method of accounting. The transition date is 28 February 2013. This results in the following changes in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

3. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

97

The consolidated financial statements include by full consolidation all domestic and foreign companies controlled by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (i. e., all subsidiaries), except where the subsidiary's effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows is immaterial. Subsidiaries' accounts are consolidated from the time that control is acquired until control ceases.

Companies managed jointly with another entity (joint ventures) are included in the consolidated financial statements by proportionate consolidation based on the Group's equity interest in the joint venture.

At the balance sheet date, 64 (prior year: 66) companies besides the parent were fully consolidated in the Group financial statements and 12 (prior year: 7) companies were proportionately consolidated.

An overview of the fully and proportionately consolidated entities and other business interests is given beginning on page 151.

The number of companies that were fully or proportionately consolidated changed as follows in the 2013|14 financial year:

At 1 March 2013 Initial consolidation Merger At 28 February 2014

Full consolidation
66 0
(2) 64

Proportionate consolidation
7 5 0 12

Mergers The Vienna-based "Agrofrucht, Handel mit landwirtschaftlichen Produkten Gesellschaft m.b.H." was merged into AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, Vienna, while Frefrost SARL of Laouamra, Morocco, was merged into Dirafrost Maroc SARL, Laouamra, Morocco.

Initial proportionate consolidation of companies The newly consolidated entities were five AGRAGOLD sugar trading companies registered in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. These joint venture firms had been acquired by AGRANA in prior years as part of the investment in the Vienna-based STUDEN group, but for reasons of immateriality had not been consolidated. With the organisational conditions now in place for doing so, the five companies were proportionately consolidated for the first time with effect from 1 December 2013.
Within the financial year under review, during the period from 1 December 2013 to 28 February 2014 the AGRAGOLD companies contributed  1,676 thousand to Group revenue and reduced Group profit for the period by  233 thousand.

Joint ventures The information in the table below presents the Group's share of the aggregated results of the proportionately consolidated companies. The companies involved were the following joint ventures:

3.1. BALANCE SHEET DATE
The balance sheet date (reporting date) of the consolidated financial statements is the last day of February. Group companies with other reporting dates prepare interim financial statements at the Group reporting date.

4. CONSOLIDATION METHODS
 Acquisitions of companies that are fully or proportionately consolidated are accounted for using the purchase method, by allocating their acquisition cost to the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) at the time of acquisition. Where the acquisition cost exceeds the net fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the difference is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. Conversely, where the acquisition cost is less than the net fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this difference arising on initial consolidation (sometimes referred to as "negative goodwill") is recognised in income in the period of acquisition.
 Pursuant to IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. Instead, using the impairment-only approach, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and written down only in the event of impairment.
 All expenses, income, receivables, payables and provisions resulting from transactions between fully or proportionately consolidated companies are eliminated.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATION METHODS / CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 For assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included in non-current assets or in inventories, intercompany balances are eliminated unless immaterial.

5. CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 Financial statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euros in accordance with IAS 21. The functional currency of every Group company is its respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at middle rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Expenses and income are translated at annual average rates of exchange, with the exception of the currency translation gains and losses from the measurement of receivables and liabilities related to Group financing.

 Differences compared to prior-year amounts arising from the translation of balance sheet items at current balance sheet date exchange rates or arising from the use of average rates in translating expenses and income compared to the use of current balance sheet date rates are recognised outside profit or loss, directly in equity.

 Foreign currency monetary items are measured at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with currency translation gains and losses recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.

 In translating the financial statements of foreign Group companies, the following exchange rates were applied:


Argentina Australia Bosnia Brazil Bulgaria China Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Egypt Fiji Hungary Macedonia Mexico Morocco Poland Romania Russia Serbia South Africa South Korea Turkey USA Ukraine

6. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.1. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

 Purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill) are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of between 5 and 15 years. All intangible assets other than goodwill have a determinable useful life.

 Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Details on this impairment test are presented in the notes to the balance sheet.

 Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded separately from goodwill if they are separable by the definition in IAS 38 or if they result from a contractual or legal right and their fair value can be reliably measured.

 Product development costs are capitalised at cost if they can be accurately allocated to a product and if both the technical feasibility and the marketing of the new product are assured. In addition, the development work must be sufficiently likely to generate future cash inflows. Under IAS 38, research costs cannot be capitalised. They are charged directly to expense in the income statement.

 Items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of purchase and/or conversion, less straight-line depreciation and impairment losses. For the bioethanol plant in Austria, a unit-of-production method of depreciation was used in the financial year. Besides materials and labour costs, prorated overheads are capitalised in the conversion costs of internally generated assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of an asset that are incurred during the production period are capitalised in accordance with IAS 23. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period during which they are incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, unless they result in an expansion or material improvement of the asset concerned, in which case they are capitalised.

 Where rental agreements or leases transfer all material risks and rewards of ownership to the AGRANA Group (finance leases), the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset. The asset is initially measured at the lower of (i) its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and (ii) the present value of the future minimum rental or lease payments. This amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings.

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is generally based on the following useful lives:

Buildings Plant and machinery Office furniture and equipment

15 to 50 years 10 to 15 years
3 to 10 years

 Impairment losses are recognised, in accordance with IAS 36, if the recoverable amount of an asset has declined below its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.2. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE
 Government grants to reimburse the Group for costs are recognised as other operating income in the period in which the related costs are incurred, unless the grant is contingent on conditions that are not yet sufficiently likely to be met.
 Grants to support capital expenditure are deducted from the cost of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment beginning at the time of the binding award of the grant.
6.3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 The AGRANA Group distinguishes the following classes of financial instruments:
Financial assets ­ Securities, and investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies ­ Trade receivables ­ Other financial assets ­ Cash and cash equivalents
Financial liabilities ­ Bank loans and overdrafts, and other loans from non-Group entities ­ Borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group ­ Trade payables ­ Financial other payables
Derivative financial instruments ­ Interest-rate derivatives ­ Currency derivatives ­ Commodity derivatives
 Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are as a rule measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. If fair value cannot be reliably determined, they are recorded at cost. An impairment loss is recognised upon evidence of sustained impairment.
 Inasmuch as the Group has the intent and ability to hold fixed-maturity securities until maturity (these assets are referred to as "held-to-maturity"), they are measured at amortised cost. Any difference between their cost and redemption value is allocated over the total life of the security using the effective interest method. Securities "held for trading" are measured at market prices, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other securities (these assets are referred to as "available-for-sale") are measured at market prices, with changes in fair value recognised outside profit or loss (after deferred taxes) in a separate reserve item in equity. Only after the cumulative changes in fair value are realised by selling the security are they recognised in profit or loss.
 Financial assets are recognised at the settlement date.
 Where there is substantial evidence of impairment and the estimated recoverable amount of a non-current financial asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the period.

101

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2013|14

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

102

 Cash and cash equivalents are measured at their face amount, which represents their market value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and bank deposits having a remaining term to maturity of up to three months at the time of investment.
Derivative financial instruments  Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At inception of the derivative contract, derivatives are recognised at cost. Subsequently they are measured at market value at every balance sheet date. Changes in value are as a rule recognised in profit or loss. Where the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting under IAS 39 are met, unrealised fair value changes are recognised directly in equity.
 The market value of derivative financial instruments is determined on the basis of quoted market prices, information from banks or discounting-based valuation methods. The market value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the difference between the contract rate and the current forward rate.
Receivables  Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Non-interest-bearing receivables with a remaining maturity of more than one year are recognised at their present value using the effective interest method. For default risks or other risks contained in receivables, sufficient impairment provisions are individually allowed. The face amounts of the receivables net of necessary impairment provisions represent the fair values. Irrecoverable receivables are derecognised on an individual case-by-case basis. Impairment provisions are recorded in an allowance account. If the reasons for an impairment provision cease to apply, the impairment loss is reversed, to no more than the asset's historical cost.
 Foreign currency receivables are measured at middle rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
Payables  Borrowings are initially measured at their actual proceeds. Premiums, discounts or other differences between the proceeds and the repayment amount are realised over the term of the instrument by the effective interest method and recognised in net financial items (at amortised cost).
 Trade payables are initially measured (at inception of the liability) at the fair value of the goods or services received. Subsequently these payables are measured at amortised cost. Other payables not resulting from the receipt of goods or services are measured at their payable amount.
 Payables denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at middle rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.4. INVENTORIES
 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost of purchase and/or conversion and net selling price. The weighted average cost formula is used. In accordance with IAS 2, the conversion costs of unfinished and finished products include ­ in addition to directly attributable unit costs ­ reasonable proportions of the necessary material costs and production overheads inclusive of depreciation of manufacturing plant (based on the assumption of normal capacity utilisation) as well as production-related administrative costs. Financing costs are not taken into account. To the extent that inventories are at risk as a result of prolonged storage or reduced saleability, a write-down is recognised.

103

6.5. EMISSION ALLOWANCES
 Emission rights are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance) and IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets). Emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes of IAS 38 that, except as noted below, are to be classified as current assets. They are assigned a cost of zero. From the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances (one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide), a provision for CO2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income statement. The provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or any excess of their market value at the measurement date over their cost. CO2 emission allowances that have already been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in non-current assets.

6.6. IMPAIRMENT
 Assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are tested at every balance sheet date for evidence of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed for impairment annually at 31 August regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment.
 The impairment test involves determining the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's value in use and its net selling price. If the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement.
 An asset's value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the asset's continuing use and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The discount rate used in determining present value is a pre-tax market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned. Where no independent cash flows can be determined for the individual asset, value in use is determined on the basis of the next larger unit (the cash-generating unit) to which the asset belongs and for which independent cash flows can be identified.
 The net selling price of an asset is its fair value (the amount obtainable from its sale in a bargained transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties) less costs to sell.

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2013|14

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

104

 Where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated, the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill and equity-like securities classified as availablefor-sale) is recognised as income in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
6.7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
 The AGRANA Group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination benefits. Under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements, AGRANA has no further obligation after paying the agreed premium. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when they fall due, and are reported in staff costs. Contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same manner as those paid to defined contribution plans. As the Group has no payment obligations beyond making the contributions, no provision is maintained.
 The provisions for defined benefit pension, termination and long-service obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), based on actuarial valuations. This involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. In the case of a deficit, a provision is recorded; in the case of a surplus, an asset (other receivable) is recorded. The defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over the period during which the respective beneficiaries acquire the entitlement to these benefits.
 Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur, along with their effect on deferred taxes. Correspondingly, the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet. The changes in actuarial gains and losses recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.
 Effects from past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes are recognised immediately in profit or loss for the period.
 The calculation is based on extrapolated future trends in salaries, retirement benefits and employee turnover, as well as a discount rate of 3.5% (prior year: 3.5%).
 A portion of pension obligations was transferred to pension funds. The retirement benefit contributions to be paid are calculated so as to fully fund the retirement benefit obligation at the time of retirement. If a plan deficit occurs, there is an obligation to fund the shortfall. The Group also holds benefit insurance policies to secure its ability to meet obligations under pension and termination benefit plans. The individual assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. The qualifying insurance policies are also treated as plan assets and thus also reduce the present value of the obligation to its net level.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

6.8. OTHER PROVISIONS
 Other provisions are recognised where the following conditions are met: the AGRANA Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, the obligation is likely to lead to an outflow of resources, and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
 Provisions are measured at the amount representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the present value of the obligation determined on the basis of a market interest rate differs materially from its nominal amount, the present value of the obligation is used.
 The risks arising from contingent liabilities are covered by sufficient provisions.
6.9. DEFERRED TAXES
 Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base; on consolidation entries; and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised. Significant differences existed between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base for property, plant and equipment, inventories and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected to be utilised within five years.
 Deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method (under IAS 12), based on the pertinent national income tax rates. Consequently, with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation, deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the tax base, to the extent that deferred tax assets are likely to be realised.
 Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of legislation in force or enacted at the balance sheet date, in the amount expected to be payable. Future changes in tax rates are taken into account if the change in tax rate has already been enacted in law at the time of preparation of the financial statements.
 When income and expenses are recognised directly in equity, the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities are also taken directly to equity. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account company-specific forecasts of, for instance, the future earnings situation in the respective Group company.
 Deferred tax assets are classified as non-current assets; deferred tax liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority.
 The income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income, and the movement in deferred taxes.

6.10. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND COSTS
 Revenue from goods sold is recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have passed to the purchaser. Revenue from services provided is recognised to the extent that the services have been rendered by the balance sheet date.
 Operating expenses are recognised in the income statement upon use of the product or service or as incurred.
 Finance expenses comprise the interest expense, similar expenses and transaction costs on borrowings including finance leases; financing-related currency translation gains and losses; and financing-related hedging gains and losses.
 Income from financial investments represents interest, dividend and similar income realised from cash-equivalent investments and investments in other financial assets; gains and losses on the disposal of financial assets; and impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.
 Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised at the time of the decision to pay the dividend.
6.11. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS
 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company's management to make judgements and to act on assumptions about future developments. These judgements and assumptions can have a material effect on the recognition and measurement of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of other liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of income and expenses reported for the financial year.
 The following assumptions involve a not insignificant risk that they may lead to a material change in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year:
­ The impairment testing of goodwill (carrying amount at 28 February 2014:  230,314 thousand), other intangible assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2014:  17,449 thousand) and property, plant and equipment (carrying amount at 28 February 2014:  711,626 thousand) is based on forward-looking assumptions. The determination of the recoverable amounts for the purpose of the impairment review involves several assumptions, such as regarding future net cash flows and the discount rate. The net cash flows are the amounts in those five-year cash flow forecasts for the cash generating units that are most current at the time of preparation of the financial statements. The discount rate varies by industry, company risk level and specific market environment; in the financial year it ranged from 8.3% to 9.4% (prior year: 7.6% to 8.7%).
­ Had the WACC been 1 percentage point higher, no goodwill impairment would have required recognition in any of the segments.
­ Financial instruments for which no active market exists are reviewed for impairment by using alternative discounting-based valuation methods. The inputs used for the determination of fair value are based in part on assumptions concerning the future.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

­ The measurement of existing retirement and termination benefit obligations (carrying amount 28 February 2014:  56,796 thousand) involves assumptions regarding discount rate, age at retirement, life expectancy, employee turnover and future increases in pay and benefits.

­ The sensitivity analysis below is based on varying one assumption at a time with the other assumptions remaining unchanged from the original calculation. Potential correlation effects between assumptions are thus not taken into account. The changes in assumptions would have the following effects on the present values of the obligations stated in note 24a:

000
Change in actuarial assumptions Discount rate
+ 0.5 percentage points ­ 0.5 percentage points Wage and salary increase + 0.25 percentage points ­ 0.25 percentage points Pension increase + 0.25 percentage points ­ 0.25 percentage points Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by 1 year

­ The recognition of deferred tax assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2014:  30,084 thousand) is based on the assumption that sufficient tax income will be realised in the future to utilise tax loss carryforwards.
­ The off-balance sheet obligations from financial guarantees and from other contingent liabilities, and any reductions in these obligations, are regularly reviewed as to whether they require recognition in the balance sheet.
­ In determining the amount of other provisions (carrying amount at 28 February 2014: 50,083 thousand), management exercises judgement as to whether AGRANA is likely to incur an outflow of resources from the obligation concerned and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are measured at the amount of the likely outflow of resources.
 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The actual values may deviate from the assumptions and estimates made if the actual general conditions do not match the expectations held at the balance sheet date. Changes in estimates of assets, liabilities, income and expense are recognised in profit or loss as they become known, and the assumptions adjusted accordingly.

Net currency translation differences on financing activities amounted to a loss of  16,411 thousand (prior year: loss of  670 thousand). This represented the balance of a realised loss of  98 thousand (prior year: realised gain of  1,063 thousand) and an unrealised loss of  16,313 thousand (prior year: unrealised loss of  1,733 thousand). The loss was attributable largely to movements in exchange rates for the currencies of Ukraine, Romania, Argentina, Russia, South Africa and Brazil.

The nominal tax charge or credit is based on application of the standard Austrian corporation tax rate of 25%.
The Tax Reform Act of 2005 introduced a new concept for the taxation of company groups. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, the AGRANA Group established a group consisting of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as the group parent and the following group members: AGRANA Zucker GmbH, AGRANA Stärke GmbH, AGRANA Marketing- und Vertriebsservice Gesellschaft m.b.H., AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH, AGRANA J&F Holding GmbH, AGRANA Internationale Verwaltungsund Asset-Management GmbH, AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH, AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, INSTANTINA Nahrungsmittel Entwicklungs- und Produktionsgesellschaft m.b.H., AGRANA Juice Sales & Customer Service GmbH and AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH.
Deferred taxes are recognised on differences between carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of the individual companies in their home countries. Deferred taxes take into account carryforwards of unused tax losses.
In the interest of conservative planning, deferred taxes reflect carryforwards of tax losses only to the extent that sufficient taxable profit is likely to be earned over the next five years to utilise the deferred tax assets.  7,051 thousand (prior year:  8,377 thousand) of potential tax assets were not recognised. These related to cumulative unused tax loss carryforwards of  24,895 thousand (prior year:  37,919 thousand).
At the balance sheet date the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised directly in equity amounted to a net asset of  5,085 thousand (prior year:  4,063 thousand).
For temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities of  231,801 thousand (prior year:  253,877 thousand) were not recognised, as these gains are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period and these temporary differences are thus not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

8. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method and in accordance with IAS 7. The statement traces the movements in the AGRANA Group's cash and cash equivalents arising from operating, investing and financing activities.
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, represent cash on hand, cheques and bank deposits. They do not include current bank borrowings or securities classified as current assets.
The effects of business acquisitions are stated in the item "purchases of businesses".
Currency translation differences, with the exception of those relating to cash and cash equivalents, are already eliminated within the corresponding items in the balance sheet.
8.1. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was  196,237 thousand (prior year:  256,310 thousand), or 6.45% of revenue (prior year: 8.36%). The item "other non-cash expenses and income" consisted of, among other items, the unrealised foreign currency translation losses reflected in net financial items, with a positive effect of  16,313 thousand in this part of the cash flow statement (prior year: translation losses with a positive impact of  1,733 thousand); a positive effect of  4,299 thousand from deferred taxes (prior year: negative effect of  6,581 thousand); a negative impact of  12,043 thousand from non-cash current taxes (prior year: positive effect of  2,927 thousand); the negative effect of the non-cash net exceptional items income of  3,944 thousand (prior year: positive effect from a net exceptional items expense of  19,077 thousand from reorganisation and the fraud case in Mexico). After changes in working capital, net cash from operating activities was  283,241 thousand (prior year:  204,756 thousand).
There were no restrictions on the use of items of cash and cash equivalents.
8.2. CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES
In the financial year,  131,050 thousand was required to fund the investing activities (prior year:  136,884 thousand). Outflows from purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets declined to  138,181 thousand (prior year:  148,973 thousand). Proceeds from disposal of non-current assets were  3,685 thousand (prior year:  2,275 thousand).

 The additions of  2,701 thousand of non-goodwill intangible assets related primarily to software.
 The goodwill of  2,380 thousand associated with changes in the scope of consolidation relates to the first-time inclusion of the AGRAGOLD companies.
 Intangible assets consist largely of goodwill, capitalised in accordance with IFRS 3, that resulted from the acquisition of companies beginning in the 1995|96 financial year. Intangibles also include acquired customer relationships, software, patents and similar rights, as well as non-current prepayments. and similar rights.
 Of the total carrying amount of goodwill, the Sugar segment accounted for  23,764 thousand (prior year:  21,384 thousand), the Starch segment for  2,090 thousand (prior year:  2,090 thousand) and the Fruit segment for  204,460 thousand (prior year:  204,460 thousand).
 To satisfy the provisions of IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36 and to allow the calculation of any impairment of goodwill, AGRANA has defined its cash-generating units to match its internal reporting structure. The cash-generating units in the AGRANA Group are the Sugar segment, Starch segment and Fruit segment, consistent with the internal management accounting and reporting processes. All goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units.
 To test for impairment, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by allocating to it the corresponding assets and liabilities, inclusive of attributable goodwill and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount inclusive of goodwill. The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and the present value of future cash flows expected from an asset.
 In testing for impairment, AGRANA uses a Discounted-Cash-flow method to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units. The determination of expected cash flows from each cash-generating unit is based on business plans that are validated and approved by Supervisory Board committees and have a planning horizon of five years. Projections beyond a five-year horizon are based on the assumption of a constant, inflation-induced growth rate of 1.5% per year (assumption in the prior year: 0.75%). The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) derived from the AGRANA Group's capital costs is calculated at 9.4% (prior year: 8.2%) for the Fruit segment, at 8.9% (prior year: 8.7%) for the Starch segment and at 8.3% (prior year: 7.6%) for the Sugar segment.

Note (17)

 The quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis. The insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan. Projections of value in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends. Value in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for the regional markets.
 All goodwill reported in the consolidated financial statements was shown to be free of impairment. A comparison of the carrying amounts of the CGUs with the respective value in use shows the following excess of value in use over carrying amount:  165 million for the Fruit segment (prior year:  205 million);  634 million for the Starch segment (prior year:  543 million); and  96 million for the Sugar segment (prior year:  254 million).
 The goodwill is not tax-deductible.
 No other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives required recognition at the balance sheet date.

The carrying amount of those inventories measured at fair value less costs to sell was  55,490 thousand for inventories on which a write-down was recognised and  53,621 thousand for inventories on which a remeasurement gain was recognised.

A write-down of  12,891 thousand was recognised on inventories (prior year:  8,939 thousand).

9.7. SECURITIES
Securities held as current assets had a carrying amount of  146 thousand (prior year:  1,198 thousand) and consisted mainly of floating rate debt securities held as a liquidity reserve.

9.8. EQUITY
 The Company had share capital of  103,210,250 at the balance sheet date, consisting of 14,202,040 ordinary voting bearer shares without par value. All shares were fully paid.
 The movements in the Group's equity are presented on pages 86 and 87.
 The capital reserves ("share premium and other capital reserves") consist of share premium (i. e., additional paid-in capital) and of reserves resulting from the reorganisation of companies. The capital reserves remained unchanged in the 2013|14 financial year. Retained earnings consist of the available-for-sale reserve, the cash flow hedge reserve, the effects of consolidation-related foreign currency translation, and accumulated profits/losses.
 In February 2014, AGRANA Stärke GmbH increased its ownership interest in AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH from 74.9% to 100%. The difference of  10,811 thousand between the purchase price paid and the carrying amount of the acquired net assets was offset against retained earnings.

Disclosures on capital management A key goal of equity management is the maintenance of sufficient equity resources to safeguard the Company's continuing existence as a going concern and ensure continuity of dividends. Equity bore the following relationship to total capital:

000
Total equity Total assets Equity ratio

1,192,733 2,452,064
48.6%

1,211,889 2,578,364
47.0%

Capital management at AGRANA means the management of equity and of net debt. By optimising these two measures, the Company seeks to achieve the best possible shareholder returns. In addition to the equity ratio, the most important control variable is the gearing ratio (net debt divided by total equity). The total cost of equity and debt capital employed and the risks associated with the different types of capital are continuously monitored.

a) Provisions for retirement and termination benefit obligations

Provisions for retirement and termination benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19, using the projected unit credit method and taking into account future trends on an actuarial basis. For both the retirement and termination benefit obligations, the plans are defined benefit plans.

The present values of the obligations, and the associated plan assets where applicable, were determined based on the following actuarial parameters:

%
Expected rate of wage and salary increases Austria/Europe Mexico/USA/South Korea
Expected trend of pension increases Austria Mexico
Discount rate Austria/Europe/USA Mexico/South Korea

2.00

2.00

4.00

0.00

3.50 8.00/4.20

3.50 6.75/­

A discount rate of 3.50% (prior year: 3.50%) was used in almost all cases in the determination of the provisions for pensions and termination benefits. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds with a duration matching the average weighted duration of the obligations.

The measurement process also involves other company-specific actuarial assumptions, such as the staff turnover rate. The current mortality tables recognised in the respective country are used as the biometric basis for the calculations ­ in Austria, this is the version of the computation tables by Pagler & Pagler specific to salaried employees ("AVÖ 2008-P-Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung").

The rate of return on plan assets depends on the strategic portfolio structure of the pension fund and of the insurance policies that are held to secure plan benefits.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

Defined benefit plans

Pension plans in the AGRANA Group are based largely on direct defined benefit commitments. The amounts of the pension benefits are usually determined by length of service and pensionable pay. Termination benefit plans exist mainly as a result of legal requirements or of obligations under collective agreements and the benefits represent one-time, lump sum payments. The amount of the termination benefits typically depends on final pay and length of service.

The provision in the balance sheet (the net liability) for pensions and termination benefits in the AGRANA Group represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets:

In connection with defined benefit pension commitments, the AGRANA Group's major plans are the following:

 AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has direct defined benefit commitments in respect of Management Board members for retirement, disability and survivor pensions based on a fixed percentage of a pension assessment base. All pension benefit obligations are transferred to and administered by an external pension fund. The present value of the obligation was  12,637 thousand (prior year:  10,685 thousand) and the plan assets amounted to  8,697 thousand (prior year:  7,399 thousand). Further detail is provided in the section "Related party disclosures" in these notes.

 In addition, there were direct defined benefit commitments, including survivor benefits, in respect of retired former employees of AGRANA Zucker GmbH in the amount of  20,805 thousand (prior year:  23,081 thousand), of AGRANA Stärke GmbH in the amount of  2,638 thousand (prior year:  2,762 thousand) and of AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH in the amount of  186 thousand (prior year:  127 thousand). The present value of the obligation of AGRANA Juice Holding GmbH is offset by plan assets in the form of pension risk transfer insurance of  170 thousand.

 At AGRANA Fruit Austria GmbH there are pension commitments in respect of active employees for retirement, disability and survivor benefits with a contractual (in some cases length-of-servicedependent) fixed benefit amount, and direct obligations in respect of retired former employees, including survivor benefits. The present value of these obligations was  786 thousand (prior year:  934 thousand) and there were plan assets in the form of pension insurance of  406 thousand.

 In Mexico there is a contractual obligation in respect of a defined set of recipients in the event of retirement or early retirement to pay a fixed percentage of a specified pensionable pay base in monthly instalments for a period of ten years. Alternatively, the recipient may choose a lump sum payment. The present value of this obligation was  470 thousand (prior year:  562 thousand), with plan assets in the form of pension insurance of  96 thousand (prior year:  106 thousand).

The AGRANA Group's has the following main termination benefit plans:
 The termination benefit plans most significant in amount exist in Austria and France. The plans represent legislated commitments to pay a lumpsum benefit on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) and in the event of retirement or death. The amount of

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

the benefit depends on final pay and length of service. Termination benefit obligations in Austria and France are funded solely by provisions, in the amount of  27,262 thousand (prior year:  27,202 thousand).

 In Russia and Ukraine there are termination benefit commitments (either legislated or based on company-wide agreements) that are minor in amount. These are payable as a lump sum on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) or on retirement. The benefit amount depends on final pay and length of service. These commitments in the amount of  117 thousand (prior year:  136 thousand) are covered solely by provisions.

 The termination benefit arrangements in the USA consist of contractual commitments in respect of a defined set of recipients, while the commitments in Mexico are legislated obligations to all permanent and full-time employees. In Mexico the termination benefit is paid if the employment relationship is terminated after 15 years or more of service, at retirement or in the event of disability or death. It takes the form of a lump sum in an amount that is based on final salary and length of service. In the USA, the benefit is paid on termination of employment and is based on final salary and length of service. In Mexico, plan assets of  21 thousand (prior year:  23 thousand) offset the present value of the obligation of  104 thousand (prior year:  188 thousand). In the USA, the commitments of  672 thousand (prior year:  696 thousand) are funded solely by provisions.

 The termination benefit plan for South Korea was included in the Group accounts for the first time in the 2013|14 financial year, with a present value of the obligation of  1,098 thousand and with plan assets of  589 thousand.

The termination benefit provisions showed the following movement:

The expense for the unwinding of discount on benefits accrued in prior years, less the return on plan assets, is included within net financial items. The current service cost is included in staff costs. The actual return on plan assets was  391 thousand (prior year:  427 thousand).
The change in actuarial gains and losses of the pension and termination benefit provisions, which is recognised directly in equity, was a reduction of  341 thousand (prior year: increase of  6,706 thousand). The change resulted primarily from experience adjustments concerning factors such as expected retirement age, wage and salary growth rates and assumed employee turnover rates. As of 28 February 2014, cumulative actuarial gains and losses of  20,662 thousand (prior year:  19,915 thousand) had been offset against retained earnings, not taking into account deferred taxes.
The experience adjustments reflect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. Such differences arise, especially, from actual rates of wage and salary increases, changes in pension benefits, employee turnover and biometric variables such as disability and mortality.

Composition of plan assets The plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension benefit insurance policies. The fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide, at all times, full coverage of the payment obligations arising from the respective benefit plans. The plan assets include neither financial instruments issued by the Group nor owner-occupied property.

1 The prior-year data were restated in accordance with IAS 8. Further information is provided from page 94.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

At the balance sheet date the plan assets were invested in the following asset categories:

Fixed income securities Equity securities Real estate Other

28 Feb 2014 28 Feb 2013

Risks Defined benefit plans are associated with various risks for the AGRANA Group. Besides general actuarial risks such as discount rate risk and longevity risk, these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial assumptions such as rates of wage and salary growth, pension benefit trends, retirement age and employee turnover (early departures). Risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks, credit risks and investment risks. Other risks lie in exchange rate fluctuation and changes in inflation rates.
The rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is less than the discount rate used, the respective net liability increases. The net liability is particularly strongly influenced by the discount rate, with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability. A further decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in defined benefit liabilities that can only be offset to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets.
Potential inflation risks that may lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations lie, indirectly, in inflation-driven salary growth during active service and in inflation-induced pension benefit increases.

Duration and future payments The average weighted duration of the present value of the pension obligations at 28 February 2014 was 9.97 years (prior year: 9.45 years) and that of the termination benefit obligations was 9.46 years (prior year: 8.75 years).

 1,007 thousand (prior year:  665 thousand) of contributions are expected to be paid into the plan assets in the subsequent reporting period.

The amounts of pension and termination benefit payments in the next ten years are expected to be as follows:

Trade payables included obligations to beet growers of  116,423 thousand (prior year:  122,787 thousand).
Financial other payables included, among other items, liabilities to employees, payroll liabilities, and liabilities from derivatives. Also included in this item were the claims of the beet growers to refunds from the European Union for excess amounts of production levies collected in the 2001|02 to 2005|06 sugar marketing years. The reimbursement in full by the EU will be made to the sugar industry no later than September 2014. The industry will in turn pass the beet growers' refund through to the growers. Financial other payables also included the deferred consideration from the acquisition by AGRANA Stärke GmbH of the remaining shares of AGRANA Bioethanol GmbH.

10.1. INVESTMENT AND CREDIT TRANSACTIONS (NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS)
To cover its overall funding needs, the AGRANA Group, in addition to its self-financing capability, has access to syndicated credit lines and bilateral credit lines from banks.
Financial instruments are generally procured centrally and distributed Group-wide. The principal aims of obtaining financing are to achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value, safeguard the Group's credit quality and ensure its liquidity.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, the AGRANA Group in the course of its dayto-day financial management uses conventional investments (demand deposits, time deposits and securities) and borrowings (in the form of overdrafts, short-term funds and fixed rate loans).

1 The prior-year data were restated in accordance with IAS 8. Further information is provided from page 94.

Bank loans and overdrafts, other loans from non-Group entities (excluding finance lease obligations) and amounts due to affiliated companies of the Südzucker group amounted to  659,592 thousand (prior year:  734,407 thousand) and carried interest at an average rate of 2.36% (prior year: 2.63%). They are measured at repayable amounts. In the case of bank debt denominated in foreign currencies, nominal values are translated into euros by applying the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Fair values may therefore increase or decrease from the prior-period values, depending on movements in exchange rates.
The fixed interest portion of bank loans and overdrafts and amounts due to affiliated companies was  241,634 thousand (prior year:  284,982 thousand). The fair values (i. e., market values) of the variable rate bank loans and overdrafts are equivalent to their carrying amounts. At the balance sheet date,  687 thousand (prior year:  702 thousand) of bank loans and overdrafts were secured by mortgage liens and  7,900 thousand (prior year:  7.900 thousand) were secured by other liens.
In the course of its day-to-day financial management, the Group invests in demand deposits and time deposits. Cash and cash equivalents, at  144,484 thousand, were closely in line with the prior-year level. In addition, securities in the amount of  146 thousand (prior year:  1,198 thousand) were held as current assets; these were categorised as held-for-trading.

10.2. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
To hedge part of the risks arising from its operating activities (risks due to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and raw material prices), the AGRANA Group to a limited extent uses derivative financial instruments. AGRANA employs derivatives largely to hedge the following exposures:
 Interest rate risks from money market rates, arising mainly from liquidity fluctuation typical during campaigns or from existing or planned floating rate borrowings.

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2013|14

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

 Currency risks, which may arise primarily from the purchase and sale of products in US dollars and Eastern European currencies and from finance in foreign currencies.

 Market price risks, arising especially from changes in commodity prices for sugar in the world market, energy and grain prices, and selling prices for sugar and ethanol.

The Group employs only conventional derivatives for which there is a sufficiently liquid market (for example, interest rate swaps, interest rate options, caps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options or commodity futures). The use of these instruments is governed by Group policies under the Group's risk management system. These policies prohibit the speculative use of derivative financial instruments, set ceilings appropriate to the underlying transactions, define authorisation procedures, minimise credit risks, and specify internal reporting rules and the organisational separation of risk-taking and risk oversight. Adherence to these standards and the proper processing and valuation of transactions are regularly monitored by an internal department whose independence is ensured by organisational separation from risk origination.

The notional principal amounts and the fair values of the derivative financial instruments held

by the AGRANA Group were as follows:

The currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year; the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to ten years.

The notional principal amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges, translated into euros.

The fair value of a derivative is the amount which the AGRANA Group would have to pay or would receive at the balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position. As the hedging transactions involve only standardised, fungible financial instruments, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices.

Fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially recognised directly in equity. Only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of cash flow hedges at 28 February 2014 was a liability of  3,255 thousand (prior year: liability of  368 thousand).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in profit or loss. The hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for the Juice activities, and to hedge sales contracts in the Sugar segment.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available at the balance sheet date and of the methods and assumptions outlined below.
The non-current assets item "investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies", and the securities held as non-current and as current assets, include available-for-sale securities. These are measured at current securities exchange prices or market value.
Other investees as well as those securities for which fair value could not be determined due to a lack of market prices in absence of active markets, are measured at cost. These are primarily shares of unlisted companies where the shares were not measured by the discounted cash flow method because cash flows could not be reliably determined. For these shares it is assumed that the fair values are equivalent to the carrying amounts.
As a result of the short maturities of the trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents, their fair values are assumed to be equivalent to their carrying amounts.
The positive and negative fair values of interest rate, currency and commodity derivatives relate partly to cash flow hedges. For the interest rate hedges, the fair values are determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on the basis of reference rates, taking into account forward premiums or discounts. The fair values of interest rate and commodity derivatives are obtained from the bank confirmations as at the balance sheet date. The fair values of currency derivatives represent the difference between the forward rates determined by AGRANA at the balance sheet date and the hedged exchange rates. The interest rates and exchange rates used for the determination of the forward rates are based on the reference rates published by the ECB or the national central banks. In some cases, as a result of differences in interest rates, the fair values determined by the Group may differ to an insignificant extent from the fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations.
For trade payables and current other financial liabilities, it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the fair values equal the carrying amounts.
The table below shows how the fair values were determined, broken down by category of financial instrument. The fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based on quoted market data:

The three levels were defined as follows:
 Level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices quoted for the exact instrument on an active market (i. e., these prices are used without adjustment or change in composition).
 In Level 2, the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market for similar assets or liabilities, or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on observable market data.
 Level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

140

The fair value of Level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the underlying currencies' interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity. The mark-to-market price is determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction. The input factors for this are the reference rates of the ECB (daily fixing) or selected national central banks, and the daily EURIBOR and LIBOR/IBOR quotes.
For Level 2 interest rate derivatives, the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity. The fair value is obtained from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions.

10.4. RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE AGRANA GROUP
The AGRANA Group is exposed to market price risks through changes in exchange rates, interest rates and security prices. In the Group's operating activities, price risks arise largely from the costs of raw materials (mainly sugar beet, sugar purchased in the world market, grains, potatoes, and fruit) and energy, and from selling prices of sugar, starch, ethanol and fruit products. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risks, associated especially with trade receivables.
AGRANA uses an integrated system for the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group. The Group's proven approach to risk management is guided by the aim of balancing risks and returns. The Group's risk culture is characterised by risk-aware behaviour, clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and the implementation of internal control systems.

AGRANA BETEILIGUNGS-AG 2013|14

AGRANA AT A GLANCE | GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | STATEMENT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD | OTHER INFORMATION

142

AGRANA regards the responsible management of business risks and opportunities as an important part of sustainable, value-driven corporate governance. Risk management thus forms an integral part of the entire planning, management and reporting process and is directed by the Management Board. The parent company and all subsidiaries employ risk management systems that are tailored to their respective operating activity. The systems' purpose is the methodical identification, assessment, control and documenting of risks.
In a three-pronged approach, risk management at the AGRANA Group is based on risk control at the operational level, on strategic control of Group companies by the Group, and on an internal monitoring system delivered by the Group's internal audit department. In addition, emerging trends that could develop into threats to the viability of the AGRANA Group as a going concern are identified and analysed at an early stage and continually re-evaluated as part of the risk management process.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of an economic loss as a result of a counterparty's failure to honour its payment obligations. Credit risk includes both the risk of a deterioration in customers' or other counterparties' credit quality, and the risk of their immediate default.
The trade receivables of the AGRANA Group are largely with the food, chemical and retail industries. Credit risk in respect of trade receivables is managed on the basis of internal standards and guidelines. Thus, a credit analysis is generally conducted for new customers. The Group also uses credit insurance and security such as bank guarantees.
For the residual risk from trade receivables, the Group establishes provisions for impairment. The maximum exposure from trade receivables is equivalent to the carrying amount of the trade receivables. The carrying amounts of past due and of impaired trade receivables are set out in note 19.
The maximum exposure of  484,131 thousand (prior year:  501,668 thousand) to credit risk consisted of the carrying amounts of all receivables and other current assets plus contingent liabilities, and was equivalent to the carrying amount of these instruments. AGRANA does not consider the actual credit risk to be material.
AGRANA maintains business relationships with many large international industrial customers having excellent credit ratings.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that a company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due or in sufficient measure.
The AGRANA Group generates liquidity with its business operations and from external financing. The funds are used to fund working capital, investment and business acquisitions.
In order to ensure the Group's solvency at all times and safeguard its financial flexibility, a liquidity reserve is maintained in the form of credit lines and, to the extent necessary, of cash.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, both short-term and long-term finance is raised in the course of day-to-day financial management.
The following maturity profile shows the effects of the cash outflows from liabilities as at 28 February 2014 on the Group's liquidity situation. All cash outflows are undiscounted.

The undiscounted cash outflows as presented are based on the assumption that repayment of liabilities is applied to the earliest maturity date. Interest payments on floating rate financial instruments are determined by reference to the most recent prevailing rates.

At the end of the year under review there were no projected cash flows from derivatives used for cash flow hedging. At the end of the prior year, the projected cash flows from derivatives were as follows:

Currency risk

The Group's international business operations expose AGRANA to foreign exchange risks from

financing and financial investment as well as from trade receivables and trade payables. Since the

2011|12 financial year, to measure and control these risks, the AGRANA Group uses Value-at-Risk

based on the variance-covariance approach at a 95% confidence level. This involves the measure-

ment of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the correlations

between them. The result is stated as the diversified VaR from currencies and is analysed by bor-

rowings and operating business:

Most of the Group's foreign exchange risk arises in the operating business, when revenue is generated in a different currency than are the related costs.

In the Sugar segment, Group companies based in the European Union whose local currency is not the euro are exposed to sugar-regime-induced foreign exchange risk between the euro and their respective local currency, as the beet prices for a given campaign are set in euros EU-wide. The subsidiaries in Romania and Bosnia-Herzegovina are subject to additional currency risk from raw sugar purchases in US dollars

In the Starch segment, foreign exchange risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the Fruit segment, foreign exchange risks arise when revenue and materials costs are in foreign currency rather than local currency. In addition, risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

For active hedging of risks, the AGRANA Group mainly uses forward foreign exchange contracts. In the financial year under review, forward foreign exchange contracts were employed to hedge revenue, purchasing commitments and foreign currency borrowings totalling a gross  292,809 thousand (prior year:  374,850 thousand) against exchange rate fluctuation. The following currencies were hedged:

Interest rate risk The AGRANA Group is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in the euro zone.
Beginning in the year under review, risks from potential changes in interest rates are reported on an "at risk" basis. AGRANA distinguishes between Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) for variable rate borrowings and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for changes in market interest rates on fixed rate borrowings.
CFaR: An increase in interest rates would cause an increase in funding costs from variable rate borrowings. The CFaR analysis is based on the volatilities of the individual funding currencies and the correlations between them.
VaR: The analysis examines the implied risk from a decrease in interest rates, as existing fixed rate borrowings would continue to incur interest costs at a constant rate instead of following the market trend. The different maturities of fixed interest borrowings are taken into account through weighted present values and a potential change in variable interest rates under the modified duration approach. The CFaR and VaR from borrowings were as follows:

Net position of variable interest borrowings Cash-Flow-at-Risk diversified

The floating rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. To hedge against this risk, interest rate swaps were entered into for a portion of the borrowings, thus achieving fixed interest rates on this portion.

Commodity price risk AGRANA's business activities expose it to market price risk from purchases of commodities and the sale of finished products (ethanol). This is particularly true in the production of bioethanol, where the most important cost factors by far are the prices of the main inputs, corn and wheat. To a lesser but still significant extent, the Sugar segment has exposure to the purchase prices of raw sugar.

At the balance sheet date the Group had open commodity derivative contracts to purchase 508 tonnes of raw sugar in Eastern Europe (prior year: 4,064 tonnes), to sell 77,800 tonnes of white sugar (prior year: 23,500 tonnes), to purchase 90,200 tonnes of wheat for the Austrian bioethanol production facility (prior year: 55,100 tonnes), to sell 2,252 tonnes of gasoline (prior year: 26,960 tonnes), and to purchase 35,400 tonnes of corn (prior year: 7,500). These positions represented an aggregate contract amount of  53,087 thousand (prior year:  43,606 thousand) and, based on the underlying closing prices, had a negative fair value of  571 thousand (prior year:  345 thousand).

A change in the underlying raw material prices of plus or minus 10% would result in the following changes in the value of these commodity derivative positions:

Legal risks AGRANA continually monitors possible changes in the legal setting that could lead to a risk situation, and takes proactive measures as appropriate. This applies particularly to food and environmental legislation.
There are currently no civil actions pending against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As noted in previous annual reports, in the 2009|10 financial year the Slovak competition authority opened antitrust investigations into, among others, the local AGRANA sugar company. However, to date no further steps have been taken.
The antitrust case filed in 2010 by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, Mannheim, Germany, for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to Austria has thus far not brought a further ruling by the Cartel Court. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded.

REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of AGRANA BeteiligungsAktiengesellschaft, Vienna, for the year from 1 March 2013 to 28 February 2014. These consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 28 February 2014, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the fiscal year ending on 28 February 2014 and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and for the Accounting System The Company's management is responsible for the group accounting system and for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor's Responsibility and Description of Type and Scope of the Statutory Audit Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in Austria and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Those standards require that we comply with professional guidelines and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

GLOSSARY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TERMS

A
ActiProt®: AGRANA's own brand of high-protein animal feed. This form of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is a by-product of bioethanol production from cereals, obtained by drying the mash (the residue from distillation). The DDGS is pelleted and marketed as a non-perishable feedstuff. With its high protein content of at least 30% and its valuable energy content, DDGS is a sought-after feed for livestock, particularly dairy animals. In the AGRANA Group this co-product is generated in the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, which typically processes corn, wheat, triticale and molasses. Like all other products marketed by AGRANA, ActiProt® is GMO-free.
Apple pomace: Apple pomace is the spent apple pulp left after juice extraction. It is high in residual sugar and in pectin, and low in protein. In the course of the production of apple juice concentrate from fresh, ripe apples, AGRANA has developed a proprietary process which, compared with conventional apple pomace, creates a product with improved sensory characteristics and reduced bitter content.
ATX: The ATX (Austrian Traded Index) is a real-time price index developed by the Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener Börse) that covers the blue-chip segment of the Austrian stock market as represented by the approximately 20 most liquid shares traded on Wiener Börse. The index composition is determined on the basis of companies' market capitalisation (the price per share multiplied by the number of shares). The influence of a given ATX stock on the index thus depends on the number and price of the company's shares. The ATX also serves as the underlying for futures and options quoted in euros on the Exchange. The starting value of the ATX on 2 January 1991 was 1,000 points.
B
Bioethanol: Bioethanol is a fuel manufactured by the fermentation of carbohydrate-containing biomass (renewable carbon sources). It has a minimum alcohol content of 99% by volume and contains effectively no water. In Europe, for climate reasons, bioethanol is produced mainly from starch-containing grain crops or from sugar beet. Unlike fossil fuels, bioethanol is CO2 neutral, and its physical properties differ from those of petrol. Its use as a petrol substitute in more or less undiluted form (in so-called high blends) therefore requires modifications to engines. For low blends (such as E10), engine modification is not needed.

Biogas: Biogas contains methane as a combustible component, which is manufactured through the zymosis of biomass in biogas facilities and is used for the generation of bioenergy. Biogas can be acquired from fermentable recycling material that contains biomass, such as sewage sludge, biowaste or food waste, liquid and solid farmyard manure, or also from energy crops that have been planted specifically for this purpose, i.e., renewable raw materials.
C
Campaign: The processing period for agricultural raw materials that have a limited storage life.
Cane sugar: Sugar produced from sugar cane. Chemically identical to beet sugar.
Corn starch: Starch produced from corn (maize), used especially as an ingredient in foods (such as puddings), but also in industrial applications, such as in paper products and cosmetics.
CO2 (carbon dioxide): Regarded today as the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is a gas consisting of carbon and oxygen. It is colourless and odourless and makes up less than 1% of the air we breathe. Carbon dioxide is produced in the combustion of substances containing carbon, and during respiration.
CO2 equivalent: To make the greenhouse effect of different greenhouse gases comparable and calculable, their global warming potential is used. It indicates the contribution of a gas to the heating of the earth's atmosphere by assigning an equivalent volume of CO2. The greenhouse effect per kilogram of a given gas is expressed as a multiple ("equivalent factor") of the greenhouse effect of one kilogram of carbon dioxide.
Customs duties: Also known as import duties or customs tariffs, these help to protect domestic products against cheap imports from non-EU countries (thus providing tariff protection). The basic import duty for sugar is a fixed amount. In addition, a special safeguard provision provides for a higher tariff when sugar imports exceed a certain quantity.

D

EU sugar regime: See sugar regime.

Deficit countries/markets/regions: Countries, markets or regions that consume more sugar than they produce and which therefore cover their needs through sugar imports. In Europe, in connection with the surrendering of quotas under the EU sugar regime, this concerns countries such as Ireland, Italy and Portugal, as well as Hungary and Romania.

Exports of sugar to non-EU countries: The licences necessary for these sugar exports are distributed by the EU to sugar producers through a tender process.
F

E
Emission: Generally signifies the release of noxious substances such as pollutants or greenhouse gases into the environment. A typical example are car exhaust fumes.
Enzymes: Enzymes are protein molecules acting as catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. For example, enzymes break up starch into dextrose molecules. They thus play an important role in fermentation. See fermentation.
Ethanol: Ethanol is a form of alcohol and is a clear, flammable liquid. It is also known as pure alcohol, grain alcohol or drinking alcohol, and is found in drinks such as wine and beer. In recent years, ethanol has acquired great importance outside the beverage industry as a biofuel referred to as bioethanol. See bioethanol.
EU Biofuels Directive: The so-called Biofuels Directive of the European Parliament and European Council dated 26 March 2009 regulates the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels (for example, wind and solar energy, geothermal and hydropower) in the transport sector. The Directive specifies the percentage of renewable fuels within total fuel consumption, but does not prescribe how these targets must be reached (blending of biogenic with fossil fuels, or use of alternative fuels). Under the Directive, fuels defined as biogenic include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biomethanol, biodimethyl ether, bio-ETBE, bio-MTBE, synthetic biofuels and pure plant oils.
EU energy allocation method: In life cycle analysis, greenhouse gas emissions can be allocated to bioethanol and its by-products using the so-called substitution method or the energy allocation method. The substitution method is suitable for political analyses under the specifications of the EU. The energy allocation method is to be used for regulatory purposes as well as for calculating emissions of individual producers and fuels.

Fermentation: In the context of biotechnology, fermentation (zymosis) means the conversion of biological material through the addition of enzymes (known as "ferment") or in the presence of bacterial, fungal or cell cultures.
F. O. Licht: A leading private-sector source of analysis on the global markets for sugar, ethanol, molasses, feed additives, biofuels, coffee and tea, F. O. Licht publishes a wide range of print reports and organises conferences for the sugar and ethanol industries.
FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency): The Austrian Research Promotion Agency, or FFG (Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft) is the national funding agency for industrial research and development in Austria. The FFG was established in 2004 and is wholly owned by the Austrian government.
Fruit juice concentrate: Forming the basis for fruit juice drinks, fruit juice concentrates are sold into the fruit juice and beverage industry. The same quantity of water carefully removed from the pressed fruit juice is later added to the concentrate again to create the end product for consumption. The result is high-quality juice with 100% fruit content.
Fruit preparations: Sometimes referred to as fruit ingredients. High-quality fruit is prepared in liquid or piece form and thermally preserved for further processing, especially for use by the dairy, ice-cream and bakery industries.
G
Gluten: Gluten is a mix of substances, including proteins, that occurs in cereal seeds. When flour is mixed with water, it is gluten that makes the resulting dough rubbery and elastic. Gluten is crucial to the baking properties of flour.
GMO: Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering.

OTHER INFORMATION GLOSSARY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TERMS

I
IGC (International Grains Council): The International Grains Council is an intergovernmental organisation concerned with grains trade. Since 1995 the London-based IGC also administers the Grains Trade Convention, an international agreement. The IGC Secretariat provides both administrative support to the Council, and services to the Food Aid Committee established under the Food Aid Convention of 1999. The IGC's grain market studies are widely used in sector and market research.
Industrial sugar: See non-quota sugar.
ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation): The International Organisation for Standardisation (widely known as ISO) is the leading international association of national standard-setting bodies and develops international standards in all areas but electricity and electronics, which are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and telecommunication, which is the province of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Together, these three organisations form the World Standards Cooperation, or WSC.
Isoglucose: Isoglucose, a liquid, is a sweetener based on starch that has been converted to sugar. At a fructose content of 42%, it has the same sweetness as sugar and is therefore used as a sugar substitute. The fructose content can be raised to as much as 55% through further process stages. Isoglucose is manufactured from grains, especially corn.

Minimum price for sugar beet: The EU sugar regime sets a minimum price for quota beets specific to a certain delivery stage and quality standard. For other delivery terms or quality levels, price adjustments are made.
Modified starch: Modified starches are obtained by physical, enzymatic or chemical processes and are starch products that meet higher technological requirements. Important properties remain intact after modification. Modified starches are used in the food industry and in industrial applications where they are superior to natural starch in qualities such as stability against heat and acidity, shear strength, and freezing and thawing properties. Modified starches used as food additives must be declared as such if they are chemically changed. Otherwise ­ if modified physically (through heat or pressure) or enzymatically ­ they are considered food ingredients and have no E number.
N
Native starch: See starch.
Non-quota sugar: Under the EU sugar regime, non-quota sugar is sugar that exceeds the production quota. This can be marketed as industrial (non-food) sugar for use primarily in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry (e. g., to produce yeast, citric acid and vitamins), or can be exported into non-EU countries or carried over to the next sugar marketing year.
P

M
Marketing year: See sugar marketing year. See marketing year for grains.
Marketing year for grains: This period runs from July to June of the following year.
Molasses: Sweet, dark-brown by-product of sugar manufacturing, with the consistency of syrup. It still contains about 50% sugar, which cannot be further crystallised. Molasses is used predominantly in the manufacture of yeast and alcohol, and as a cattle feed supplement.

Prime Market: A subsegment of the "equity market.at" market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Prime Market comprises the shares of companies admitted to listing in the Official Market or Second Regulated Market and meeting the special additional requirements for admission to the Prime Market. These securities are traded via the Xetra trading system using the Continuous Trading procedure, in conjunction with auctions.
Production levy: The production levy for sugar quotas is  12 per tonne. From the 2007|08 sugar marketing year, up to one-half of the levy can be paid by the sugar beet farmers. For isoglucose, the amount of the levy is 50% of that for sugar. The production levy is an administrative tax paid to the EU.

Production quota: See sugar quota.

Q
Quota: See sugar quota.
Quota sugar: The amount of sugar produced and marketed in the course of a sugar marketing year within the allotted production quota.
Quota sugar beets: The amount of sugar beet necessary to fully utilise the production quota for sugar.
R
"Ramsar Convention" on wetlands: The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) ­ called the "Ramsar Convention" ­ is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments of its member countries to maintain the ecological character of their Wetlands of International Importance and to plan for the "wise", or sustainable use, of all of the wetlands in their territories.
Raw sugar: Raw sugar is a semi-finished form of cane sugar (or of beet sugar) in which the sugar crystals are not yet completely freed from the adhering non-sugar materials, which give it its brown colour.
Reference price: The reference price set in the EU sugar regime for EU quota sugar is used to find the minimum prices for sugar beets and does not have any direct effect on the market price, which is determined by supply and demand.
Refining: The term "refining" in its general sense refers to a technical process for the cleaning, processing, separation or concentration of raw materials. In the case of sugar, it means the de-coloration of brown raw sugar (from sugar cane or sugar beet) through repeated recrystallisation.
S
Starch: Starch is an organic compound and one of the most important energy storage materials in plant cells. In our latitudes, starch is mainly acquired from corn, wheat or potatoes. To extract starch, the starch-containing parts of the plants are milled to a small size and the starch is washed out. Through filtration and centrifugation steps, the starch is extracted. After the final stage of drying, native starch emerges from the process as a white powder.

Starch corn (starch maize): Starch corn, also known as soft corn, is one of the oldest corn varieties. It is well suited for eating directly, as it can be ground easily due to its floury nutritive tissue. Starch corn is an important industrial raw material.
Sugar: In Europe, sugar is produced from sugar beet. In sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world, sugar cane is the main raw material for sugar production. The term "sugar" in general usage typically refers to granulated sugar, i.e., sucrose. However, there are several other types of sugar, including glucose, fructose and lactose, among others. All are part of the carbohydrate food group.
Sugar beet: Sugar beet is an agricultural crop grown almost exclusively for sugar production. The sugar beet plant consists of the leaves and a large, fleshy root. The root stores sucrose, which is extracted in the sugar factory.
Sugar marketing year (SMY): The sugar marketing year of the European Union begins on 1 October and ends on 30 September of the following year. This definition applies for all regulations of the EU sugar market.
Sugar production: In sugar production from sugar beet, raw juice is extracted from the sugar beet slices. The juice is then cleaned in several stages and eventually thickened until sugar crystallises from it. Through repeated recrystallisation, the sugar is purified to produce clean, white crystals. These crystals have a sucrose content of very close to 100%. That makes sugar an extremely pure food product with an almost unlimited shelf life.
Sugar quota: Under the EU sugar regime, a production quota for sugar and isoglucose is set for every EU member state that produces sugar. Each national quota is apportioned among the respective country's sugar-producing companies as their individual production quota. This restricts production volumes and minimises surpluses.
Sugar regime: The European Union's regulatory framework existing since 1968 for sugar quotas and tariffs serves to regulate the EU common market for sugar and ensure intraEU sugar production.

T
Triticale: As a hybrid grain resulting from the crossing of wheat and rye, triticale combines the characteristics of both these grains in terms of flavour and composition. Thanks to its higher starch content, triticale is also used as an energy crop for the production of bioethanol.
W
West Balkan Agreement: Since autumn 2000 the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia may import limited quantities of duty-free sugar (among other products) into the EU. The EU has since then concluded corresponding free trade agreements with Croatia and Serbia.
Wet corn (wet maize): Freshly harvested corn is also referred to as wet corn.
White sugar: Also called granulated or table sugar, white sugar is produced by crystallisation and centrifugation.
WTO (World Trade Organisation): In the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation, its currently 157 member states negotiate the liberalisation of world trade.

Forward-looking statements This annual report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions and estimates made by the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Although these assumptions, plans and projections represent the Management Board's current intentions and best knowledge, a large number of internal and external factors may cause actual future developments and results to differ materially from these assumptions and estimates. Some examples of such factors are, without limitation: negotiations concerning world trade agreements; changes in the overall economic environment, especially in macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; EU sugar policy; consumer behaviour; and public policy related to food and energy. AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG does not guarantee in any way that the actual future developments and actual future results achieved will match the assumptions and estimates expressed or made in this annual report, and does not accept any liability in the event that assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect.
As a result of the standard round-half-up convention used in rounding individual amounts and percentages, this report may contain minor, immaterial rounding errors.
No liability is assumed for misprints, typographical or similar errors.
The English translation of the AGRANA Annual Report is solely for readers' convenience and is not definitive. In the event of discrepancy or dispute, only the German-language version shall govern.
