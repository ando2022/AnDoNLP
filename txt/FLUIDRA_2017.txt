7 INTEGRATED REPORT

The year 2017 has marked a turning point in the history of the company in every way. As the company's performance in all of its markets has been so exceptional, Fluidra has managed to fulfil all the targets set out in the 2018 Strategic Plan one and a half years ahead of schedule.

Solid control of working capital, together with the excellent pro-account results, have allowed the company to reduce its net financial debt (NFD), which at the end of 2017 stood at EUR 145.7 million, bringing the adjusted NFD/EBITDA ratio down to 1.4x, below the 1.8x of 2016.

Organic growth was solid and consistent throughout the year. Sales in practically all markets have reported double-digit growth, demonstrating the improvement in efficiency experienced by the company. Fluidra, with its policy of focusing on gaining penetration, has increased its market share in practically all markets.
At the same time, 2017 was the year in which Fluidra laid the foundations for the company's future, with the announced merger agreement between Fluidra and Zodiac. Ten years after the IPO, we started a new project that opens up a new world of opportunities in our businesses and makes Fluidra a global leader.
From the shareholders'point of view, it was an outstanding year in terms of creating value. The share price reflected the good results and the good news, rising 173% in the year as a whole.
l Annual financial statements
Fluidra's sales at year-end 2017 stood at EUR 781.4 million, 9.6% higher than in 2016. The good performance in Spain, France, Australia and other mature markets, along with our restructuring efforts, strong financial discipline and a solid balance sheet enabled us to close this financial year with EBITDA growth of 15.2%, reaching EUR 99 million, which represented a 12.7% EBITDA margin on sales, higher than that of 2016 (12.1%). If we adjust EBITDA for the expenses associated with the merger process and the long-term incentive plan for executives, this amounts to EUR 105.3 million, 22.4% higher than the previous year.
The company's net profit amounted to EUR 31.1 million, an increase of 29% compared to the previous year.
At balance sheet level, an excellent job has been done in managing all items comprising net working capital. At year-end 2017, it stood at EUR 197.3 million (7.2% more than that of the previous year), making a net working capital over sales ratio of 25.2%. Free cash flow generation to the income statement was EUR 34.1 million.

We believe that the best indicator of shareholder value creation is the return on capital employed (ROCE). Thanks to our improved use of our assets and the improvement in the income statement, the ROCE on adjusted EBITA stood at 16.3% compared to 12% from the previous year.
l Exceptional share price performance
2017 was definitely an excellent year. Markets welcomed our strong performance throughout the year. All in all, completing our 2018 Strategic Plan one year ahead of schedule, the investments made throughout the year and the growth of our business in mature markets led to a 173% increase in Fluidra's value in the markets, with the closing price in 2017 at EUR 11.81 per share, while share liquidity increased alongside trading growth.
l Investment in growth and innovation
In 2017, the company made two strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding and consolidating markets.
In July we acquired Piscine Laghetto, an Italian manufacturer, based in Cremona, in the Lombardy region of Italy, and internationally known for its design and high-end above ground swimming pools. The deal was instrumented through the purchase of 90%, which was the culmination of a pre-agreement begun twelve months before in the form of a co-branding agreement for the supply of filters and pumps, between Laghetto and Fluidra's AstralPool.
In the same summer, Fluidra acquired 80% of the capital of the Belgian start-up, Riiot Labs, creator of an innovative technology for remote monitoring of the state of the pool water through any mobile device. This technology is called "Blue Connect" and it has won several awards in the sector. This deal extends the relationship that had begun a few months earlier with a distribution agreement for France, Spain and Benelux, characterised by the immediate success of this smart device. In fact, this device is set to become one of the most important monitoring for maintenance swimming pool apps.

"The market performance and our excellent execution of the strategy charted have enabled us to complete all the objectives of the 2018 Strategic Plan a year and a half earlier than initially planned"

With our innovative bent, we took part in the Imagine Silicon Valley 2017 project to encourage disruptive innovation in the world of swimming pools. The "Fluid Reality" prototype, a mixed reality experience for swimming pool environments, was developed in the Imagine project. It consists of hardware with a goggles/helmet format, for digital games in and out of the water, connectivity between devices and parental control.
We have also inaugurated four new cash and carry stores in Italy, France, Portugal and Mexico so that customers have more direct contact with professional pool fitters in the area. We have invested in a new 12,500 m2 warehouse to consolidate and expand the facilities of Sacopa, a plastic injection plant in northern Catalonia, to be able to deliver on growth and improve efficiency.
Thanks to the efforts of our commercial pool consultancy division, we have been awarded two important projects on the Asian continent. One is Kazakhstan-Expo 2017 in Astana: a project for the design, installation and commissioning of a spectacular fountain that includes a surface area of 1,523 m² with walking and recreational areas for visitors, including a water show with a surface area of 2,630 m² equipped with all types of jets (rockets, mist, dance, vertical jets and fire) to create a unique show. The other is the Marina Bay Resort in the Philippines: a contract worth EUR 5.6 million for the design and construction of three commercial swimming pools, five individual villas, different spa units and water games.
Before being awarded these contracts, we also made successful bids for other important projects that we completed in 2017 in the Asian market: the installation of the swimming pools for the World University Championships, which took place in Taipei (Taiwan) last August, and the construction of the swimming pools for the 2018 Asian Games, which will be held in Jakarta (Indonesia) in summer.

l Merger with Zodiac
Internationalisation has always been one of the mainstays of Fluidra, a leading international company except in the United States.
We have strived for many years to become a global leader and benchmark in our sector and we have analysed the different options more or less intensively. In Zodiac we have found an ideal partner. The announced deal is unique from the strategic and industrial logic standpoint, and the complementarity of the two companies' businesses in terms of geographical coverage, product portfolio and brands is truly outstanding.
Zodiac is a leading global manufacturer of residential pool equipment and other solutions for the pool industry, with a strong presence in the United States. We have a very good reason to carry out this deal: the US has 8 million swimming pools installed (almost half the world share), making it the largest replacement market in the world, and Fluidra currently has a niche presence. Now, with the announced merger with Zodiac, the US market will become the main market for the new Fluidra. Another compelling reason is the fact that the two companies are so complementary in terms of geography and product portfolio.
The merger will create a new Fluidra with sales of approximately EUR 1,300 million, an EBITDA of EUR 210 million and a ROCE on EBITA of 10.3% (pro-forma data at the end of 2017). Synergies amount to EUR 35 million in cost savings from 2020 onwards.
The post-merger company will have a NFD/EBITDA level of around 3.8x, levels that are rare in our group. Over the next two years, our major undertaking and priority objective will be to gradually bring down net debt levels.

Together, the two companies offer exceptional value: a balanced geographical position that does not depend on a single market, synergies, creating a company which is twice as large and which is much more visible to the capital markets.
The founding families of Fluidra will now hold 29%, while Rhône Capital (current shareholder of Zodiac), which has a two-year agreement to remain in the company, will hold 42% of the voting rights. The Board of Directors will be composed of a total of 12 members: 4 independent directors, 4 appointed by the founding families and 4 by Rhône. A clearly balanced and equal Board of Directors.
When the merger becomes effective, Fluidra will maintain its global headquarters in Sabadell (Barcelona). As the Executive Chairman of Fluidra, I will assume the position of Executive Chairman of the post-merger company, while Bruce Brooks, currently CEO of Zodiac, will be the CEO. Xavier Tintoré will continue as the CFO of the new Fluidra.

especially on promoting music. During this year, the KAG-25 project was presented. The aim of this project is to restore a 25-hectare farm in southern Senegal to turn it into a profitable farm by improved water usage and by providing agricultural training to 2,000 children and young people.
I would also like to reiterate once again our commitment to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the basis for our ethics and social responsibility, and our involvement with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDOs), especially those related to sustainable water management.
l Strategy for the future
In 2018, we will take a firm step towards conquering all the relevant markets across the globe, and will also be focused on executing the merger between Zodiac and Fluidra.
Our strategy is still one of creating value:

l Our commitments to society and the environment

· Quickening growth in the United States, while offering a
broader product portfolio.

We are constantly improving our commitment to society and the environment. Water is our raison d'être, and thus we strive to develop products and projects that offer sustainable, efficient and avant-garde solutions to our customers, in a global environment where water management, a precious and vital asset for man and nature, is becoming increasingly important.
This commitment is reflected in our CSR Master Plan 2017-2020, which establishes two general objectives: to position ourselves as a leading company in the creation of sustainable value and to meet the requirements established in international stock market indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. More specifically, the plan has 32 goals, 54 actions and 60 actions to be carried out during the period set. All the actions defined in the Plan are built around Fluidra's stakeholders as a reference point in the development of CSR. In 2017, 67% of the planning for the year was completed, although it must be borne in mind that some of the actions were affected by the merger project with Zodiac.

· Penetration into all markets and implementation of "Best
Practices".
· Continuous improvement, with the merger, of efficiency
and profitability ratios.
Lastly, I would like to thank the entire human team of our company, which is the main reason why we are able to fulfil our objectives.
We want to be a global group offering sustainable and efficient pool solutions and applications. A leading company in the Pool & Wellness sector worldwide. Water is our world and our future.
Once again, I would like to thank you for the confidence that you have placed in Fluidra.

Value Chain

Fluidra's business model vertically integrates R&D&i, production, logistics, marketing and services. This model has the advantages of diversifying risks, optimising resources and creating significant entry barriers to competitors.

R&D&i
Research, development and innovation are part of the fundamental pillars of Fluidra's strategy: consolidating a culture of innovation is part of the path to becoming a leader in its sector. To this end, it has the support of the Innovation Committee, which is responsible for establishing the strategy, validating all projects relating to products that are carried out in the 16 Fluidra Centres of Excellence and technical centres, and defining the corporate Guidelines which are intended to help steer all Centres in the process of product development. A total of 119 people spend on average 56% of their time working on product R&D.

Production
Fluidra has its own industrial infrastructure. Its 31 production centres, which employ around 1,900 people, are located in the main Group markets and work on different technologies that enable the manufacture of full ranges, under different brands, for all business units.
In addition, Fluidra's production centres offer their services to customers outside the group and manufacture products or full ranges under clients' brands.

In southern Europe, the logistic model is based on regional branches (cash and carry) with stock only for those items with higher turnover, and deliverability in short periods of time for the other items. The company has an innovative automated logistics operator with a surface area of 55,000 m2 and a capacity to dispatch 150,000 pallets annually and carry out 20,000 daily box collections.

Although stakeholders are not actively involved in preparing this report, the company has regular bilateral contacts with them, as mentioned above, to find out their needs and expectations in order to be able to assess and address them in the future. [G4-26, G4-27]
In addition to the aforementioned stakeholders, the company maintains constant and stable relations with other groups that are also important to the Group, such as:

The opinion poll on the company's
Integrated Report is a cross-
channel for all stakeholders.

· Domestic and international analysts and investors, through
participation in roadshows, conferences and meetings.

· The media, through regular mailings of news (press
releases), meetings and interviews.
· Business schools, through the development of case
studies on Fluidra.
· he academic world in general, by receiving visits by groups
of students from different countries that are interested in Fluidra's track-record.

· Public administrations and official bodies: Fluidra takes
part as a member in Sustainability and Environment Committees, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Prosecutors of the Chamber of Commerce of Barcelona, and it is also actively involved in the meetings on Administrative Simplification of the Regional Government of Catalonia.

· End users, through the AstralPool website with an online
pool-configuration simulator. Simulations for calculating energy savings can be performed thanks to this tool by selecting different parameters such as: country, climate, swimming pool measures, etc.

The opinion poll on the company's Integrated Report is a cross-channel for all stakeholders. Although the participation was low in the 2016 edition, stakeholder feedback was of satisfaction or complete satisfaction with the report, its structure and content.

External perception
In response to the 2017 Report, which analyses the quality of information and of the reporting of those companies listed on the Spanish continuous market, Fluidra has consolidated its position amongst the top places in the ranking on the assessment of its reports.
Fluidra has the best score from the IGBM companies that do not belong to the Ibex-35. It is back in the eighth place it had at the end of the 2016 edition and is also the only non-Ibex-35 company in the top ten of the ranking.

4.1
[G4-4, G4-13]

Market environment

Overall economic outlook depends on how a number of different factors unfold. One of the most important is the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which may trigger a gradual reduction in global liquidity and less support for future capital flows to emerging economies. The IMF's forecast for global GDP growth in 2018 is 3.9%, with developed economies growing at an average rate of 2.3% and emerging and developing economies at 4.9%.
Commodity prices will play a decisive role in countries'trade relations. The oil price now appears to have stabilised after the collapse a few years ago, and after OPEC's announcement last November that it was extending production cuts until the end of 2018. The vast majority of commodities prices, such as iron, will be shaped by the economic performance of China, the world's leading importer. Steel and aluminium are another matter, as President Trump has proposed high tariffs on the imports of these two commodities.

Positive performance in Spain
Judging by consensus forecasts, the expansionary trend begun in 2013 should continue, while employment will continue to grow at a good pace, and there will be further correction in the main macroeconomic imbalances: private agents will continue to deleverage, the public deficit will fall below 3% and a current account surplus will be maintained with the rest of the world. The leading indicators confirm the good progress of the Spanish economy despite political uncertainty in Catalonia: an increase in Social Security registrations and in private consumption, the latter apparent in several indicators, such as the vehicle registrations and the signing of mortgages. In this context, the IMF expects Spain's GDP growth to stand at 2.4% for 2018.

Political labyrinth in Europe
European stock markets have been buoyed by increased confidence and good economic data in 2017, against a background of gradual normalisation of monetary policy by the European Central Bank. Recent elections in Germany and France boosted pro-EU options but also saw a sharp increase in the far right, creating uncertainty about the capacity of the Franco-German axis to carry out the necessary reforms in the Eurozone. Further uncertainty was added after the Italian elections, where results

paint a complicated picture for the country's governance. Brexit will once again be a central issue on the European agenda due to the intense negotiations that will take place this year to reach the cut-off date of March 2019.

consumption and a possible reform that will guarantee the country's fiscal sustainability. However, its growth might be hampered by the persistent weakness of investment and political instability.

Trump's first year
Donald Trump's first year at the helm of the White House has been marked by the approval of the tax reform, the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement and constant protectionist threats. The US has also achieved good macroeconomic data and stock markets have continued their upward trend.

Question marks hang over Mexico due to the presidential elections and the renegotiation of NAFTA. The IMF estimates Mexican will grow 2.3% in 2018, three tenths more than the estimate for 2017 at the close of this report.
China is in the process of orderly deleveraging, with tighter control over shadow banking and the real estate market, and a less expansionary fiscal policy. Against this background, China's GDP growth for 2018 is expected to be 6.5% - the lowest in more than 25 years - and is expected to lead to lower global demand for commodities.

In 2018, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue to raise interest rates as it did last if economic conditions continue to brighten. The strong global growth, the depreciation of the dollar, expectations about the sustainability of oil prices and the slight improvement in the construction sector should drive investment. Conversely, more gradual labour market developments and higher inflation point to a slowing in private consumption. Furthermore, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the future construction of Mexico/US border may also trigger greater market volatility.

Pool sector
Overall, the sector is expected to grow steadily. By the end of 2017 there were nearly 16 million swimming pools installed worldwide. Over the last ten years, the number has grown at a rate of 2% p.a., guaranteeing a profitable recurrent business. With the housing boom, new pool installations have risen by 15% in Europe and 10% in North America, although the new construction peak of 2007 has not yet been reached.

Brazilian recovery and Chinese slowdown
Low interest rates, coupled with rising commodity prices, low volatility and a weaker dollar has created a positive environment for emerging countries. Brazil is set to become the new economic driver of Latin America. With Brazilian GDP estimated to grow by 1.9% in 2018 (having shrunk over the last few years), it has once again won over investors thanks to stimulating

North America is by far the most important region for the pool industry, as it accounts for 54% of the pool equipment market share. It is followed by Europe with 29%, while the rest of the world together accounts for 17%.
Fluidra estimates that growth of the sector will be gradual and constant, a scenario in which new, albeit moderate, construction work will continue to grow in the recurring business, most of which (75%) will be based on the existing pool inventory. The company estimates that 70% of the business is related with the maintenance and care of the pool inventory and the remaining 30% with new construction.

New panorama: merger with Zodiac

On 20 February 2018, Fluidra's shareholders approved the merger with Zodiac Pool Solutions at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The post-merger company, which will keep the Fluidra name and will be listed on the Spanish stock exchange as before, will have more than 5,500 professionals, cover more than 45 countries (the United States will be the largest of its markets) and report sales of EUR 1,300 million, with combined EBITDA of EUR 210 million.
Fluidra will issue 83 million shares which will be fully subscribed by the current shareholders of Zodiac, Rhône Capital, to carry out the deal. This means that once the merger is completed, the company will have the following structure: 42% will belong to Rhône Capital, 29% will be in the hands of the founding families and the remaining 29% of the capital will be free float. In early 2018, Fluidra concluded a total refinancing arrangement for the two companies, which will come into force once the merger is finalised.

Fluidra is already working to ensure that the merger process is carried out efficiently and so that the synergies from the two companies, which have complementary products and territorial presence, with very little overlap, can be harnessed as soon as possible.
The new Fluidra will have two growth drivers: organic revenues and the recurrent business underpinned by geographical diversification and the market environment.
Cost synergies for 2020 are estimated at around EUR 35 million, with non-recurrent costs of around EUR 30 million. These synergies would be in the following areas: production consolidation, supply opportunities, optimisation of logistics operations, reduction of indirect operating expenses, integration of regional sales and savings in support processes, and corporate consolidation.

Head of Tax, Legal and Compliance

Fluidra's governing bodies are the General Shareholders' Meeting and the Board of Directors which, in turn, have established the following Governance Committees: Appointments and Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Delegate Committee.
The Articles of Association, Regulations (of the General Meeting and the Board), and other internal rules and procedures make up the regulatory body that governs Fluidra's corporate governance system. The company ensures compliance with the recommendations and international best practices regarding governance, which is why it continuously reviews and updates its rules and regulations.
Fluidra adopts and publishes the Annual Corporate Governance Report which is governed by the recommendations on corporate governance of listed companies. This document has been available on the corporate website since its adoption.
In addition to the governing bodies described above, Fluidra has a governance structure for the management of the company which consists of the Corporate Committee, in charge of the Group's day-today business, and the G30, an expanded executive committee with the presence of all geography area managers, the production centre and the cross-sectional corporate function.
The General Business Manager and the Corporate General Manager attend all Board meetings, and channel and convey any issues that may be identified as relevant to the Group to that body.

In the Board of Directors meeting of 21 January 2016, Dispur, S.L. was appointed as a company Director; represented on the Board by Ms. Eulàlia Planes Corts.
On 18 December 2017, Dispur, S.L., through its individual representative, tendered its resignation as a member of the Company's Board of Directors with effect from, and subject to, the entry in the commercial register corresponding to Fluidra's registered office of the merger deed by absorption of Piscine Luxembourg Holdings 2 S.à r.l.

Directors' performance review
In accordance with the provisions contained in article 14 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Appointments and Compensation Committee is to assess the skills, expertise and experience required of candidates to join the Board and will therefore define the roles and capabilities required to fill each vacancy. Moreover, it will determine the appropriate work conditions in terms of time and workload for them to carry out their duties.
The information on the assessment of directors during 2017 is available in the Annual Corporate Governance Report for that financial year in sections C.1.19, C.1.20 and C.1.20bis. Directors are assessed annually by means of a survey and selfassessment, combined with external evaluations every three years. The assessment form is currently being redefined to incorporate environmental and social aspects. Likewise, with the aim of enhancing directors'knowledge of environmental and social matters, the Company is analysing formulas for them to be effectively implemented. [G4-43, G4-44]

Remuneration policy
[G4-51, G4-52, G4-53] The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors consists of a fixed annual remuneration and an allowance for attending Board of Directors meetings. There is also an additional remuneration for those Directors who are part of any of the Board Committees, namely the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Appointments and Compensation Committee.
The maximum remuneration amount that Fluidra can provide its Directors for such items is determined by the General Shareholders' Meeting, under the condition that the amount is a reflection of their actual professional performance and of the market benchmark.
In compliance with the international recommendations of Good Corporate Governance (proxy advisors), in 2012 it was decided to dissociate the remuneration of the Board from the performance of the organisation through variable remuneration, so there is currently no variable concept in the remuneration structure of the Board, except the Executive Chairman, who, together with his management team, have part of their remuneration linked to various economic performance indicators, and also to the strategic management objectives of company.
(For additional information see p. 23 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors)
Annually, the Annual Report on remuneration of directors is subjected to a vote of the General Shareholders' Meeting; this report includes information about the remuneration policy of the Company for the current year and for future years, a comprehensive summary on how the remuneration policy was applied during the previous financial year and the breakdown of the individual remunerations earned by each of the directors.
In the last General Shareholders' Meeting held on 3 May 2017, the item on the agenda concerning the advisory vote of the aforementioned Annual Report on remuneration of directors (Item 4) was adopted with 74,663,399 votes in favour, that is, 97.4660% of the votes.
In 2017, the wage gap between the highest paid member in the group (Executive Chairman) and the average of the workforce in Spain, as the most significant country, was a ratio of 15x. Salary increases in the group are established annually on the basis of the performance evaluation of the people, the average salary increase of the staff being 1.6 times higher than the salary increase of the person who receives the highest salary.

5 . 3 Code of ethics
[G4-56, G4-57, G4-58, G4-HR3, G4-HR8, G4-HR12, G4-SO5]
There are two pillars which support ethical management in the organisation of Fluidra group: the Code of Ethics, entitled People Values, and the Code of Ethics for Suppliers. The first inspires and defines the day to day c onduct of all employees of Fluidra and the second works as guidelines for social responsibility and sustainability in the supply chain.
People Values
The Code of Ethics is a reflection of the values and principles that should guide the conduct of all companies which belong to the Fluidra group. The Code of Ethics was created by Fluidra in 2008 and was last updated in 2015.
Its implementation is binding on all persons and directors of the Fluidra Group, regardless of the position or role they hold (including administrative bodies, managerial positions and other supervisory bodies), ensuring a responsible ethical behaviour and compliance with the law.
The Code of Ethics does not replace or abrogate the existing legislation in each country or at the international level, whether in terms of administrative, civil, criminal, labour or commercial law, or the internal company regulations or binding collective agreements.
Fluidra encourages all its members to consult with their supervisors, or with the Committee set up to promote the use of the Code of Ethics or through the Confidential Channel, on any situation in which they may have questions about whether their own actions or that of third parties could infringe the ethical principles established.

So that the `People Values' Code of Ethics is not just a mere declaration of intent, there are several mechanisms that disseminate, promote and ensure its implementation and enforcement, namely: the Ethics Committee, the Confidential Channel, a training activity and a disciplinary system when failing to comply with the law and ethical principles.
Ethics Committee
The Ethics Committee consists of the Human Resources, Internal Audit and Legal divisions. The Ethics Committee receives, examines and responds to inquiries, complaints or allegations raised by employees, customers, suppliers or others. All requests or communications regarding incidents are handled with confidentiality and respect for all parties involved.
The Ethics Committee reports to the Audit Committee, the governing body reporting directly to the Board of Directors.
Confidential Channel
[G4-57, G4-58]
The Confidential Channel is available on the corporate website, at Fluidra's intranet in the Living Fluidra section and by email at peoplevalues@fluidra.com, which is available to all employees, customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. Through an online form or via email they can make inquires, ask for advice or report an incident.
All communications are handled confidentially and care is taken when making any decision always respecting the people involved.
In 2017, ten queries were recorded through this channel. Once examined and evaluated, they did not lead to complaints on human rights violations, corruption or discrimination. [G4-HR3. G4-HR12, G4-SO5]
There have not been any cases of violation of the rights of indigenous peoples.

Training
Fluidra conveys its `People Values' Code of Ethics to all employees through a compulsory online training course, or attending training sessions where a physical copy of the document is handed out. The aim of this courses is to inform all employees about Fluidra's values and reflect on the importance of ethical standards that will help them in the development of their daily activities.

Suppliers' Code of Ethics
The actions of suppliers and providers of materials operating outside the scope of the group's internal control are monitored by Fluidra. To this end, Fluidra has implemented a Supplier Code of Ethics since 2011 which is specific to its supply chain.
The provisions of this Code are present in the approval process of new suppliers; their membership is automatically implemented by the general clauses in all corporate agreements.
For those cases where there is no explicit agreement, an informative clause in the ordering system was included in 2015. In addition, a specific section containing the Ethics has been created on Fluidra's website. Thus, any supplier can check it at any time, even before starting a commercial relationship with Fluidra.
Fluidra is aware that in addition to the commitment made by suppliers, it is necessary to implement control measures. In this sense, Fluidra is working to establish during next year protocols for action and appropriate follow-up to the high variability and types of providers.

Compliance
Fluidra has spent several years developing a Corporate Compliance Programme whose main objective is to generate an ethical culture within the company and prevent any violation of the law, especially any such which may be classified under the Criminal Code or under applicable law at any given time and place.
Furthermore, the Corporate Compliance Programme contains the roles appearing in the Ethical Framework section of this report, with some other important roles worth noting:
l Compliance Coordinating Committee: This committee is made up of the General Business Manager and by Human Resources, Internal Audit, and Legal Counsel representatives. Its main functions are: (I) to ensure that the Compliance Programme is properly developed, (ii) to promote the development of policy standards and procedures, (iii) to collaborate on any necessary research to support the Ethics Committee.
l Policies, rules and procedures: It refers to the regulatory body that defines and specifies the lines of conduct to be taken by employees of Fluidra Group. The group is developing new policies, rules or procedures that apply to all workers. A section on the intranet called "Policies and Procedures" has also been created. It contains all regulations that employees must follow.
l Training plan: Fluidra is developing a training plan to ensure that all employees are given sufficient training in all areas applicable to them, especially in relation to those areas where there is a greater risk that crimes may be committed.
Programme implementation
Fluidra has developed an implementation plan of the Corporate Compliance Programme in the different group companies. The implementation is being performed gradually, in stages and levels. During 2017, the implementation plan began in Spain, Australia, the United States, France and the United Kingdom.
External validation
In September 2016, an external auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers) issued an expert report certifying that Fluidra S.A. has a reasonable control environment to prevent crimes which imply criminal liability to the legal person. In other words, Fluidra is certified by its Corporate Compliance programme.

[G4-14, G4-44, G4-45, G4-46, G4-47, G4-50]

The efficient management of potential risks is essential for proper development, achieving objectives and the future plan of any company. Fluidra, as an international industrial group, understands that corporate risk management is one of the cornerstones of its business.
Corporate risk management falls to the Audit Committee as an advisory body and as representative of the Board of Directors.
The Risk Management System works in a comprehensive and continuous manner, consolidating such management through subsidiaries, geographical areas and supplementing it with corporate support areas. It includes the identification, analysis, assessment ­ both by activity and by the current environment ­, controls and associated mitigation plans.

Fluidra, as an international industrial group, understands that corporate risk management
is one of the cornerstones of its
business

The duties of the Audit Committee regarding Risk Management include:

· Identifying the different types of risk (strategic, operational, financial, legal,
reputational and accidental), including ­among financial and economic risks­
contingent liabilities and other off-balance risks.

· Identifying the measures in place to mitigate the impact of identified risks,
should they materialise.

· Verifying and monitoring the Corporate Risk Map as a tool to identify, manage
and follow up on risks with significant impact on the Group's objectives.

The different risks are identified and assessed based on an analysis of the events that may trigger them. The assessment is performed using metrics that calculate likelihood and impact. Existing controls are put in place in order to mitigate such risks and any additional necessary action plans are implemented if the above controls are deemed insufficient. Through this process, which is conducted annually and coordinated by Internal Audit, the Company's Risk Map may be outlined. The map provides the most significant risks, along with the main variations from the previous year, which are then presented to the Audit Committee for discussion and approval. [G4-50]

The scale of severity and the scale of likelihood are defined according to qualitative

and quantitative criteria. Once critical risks are identified and reassessed, the Company's senior management officers devise specific measures, appointing those in charge of their implementation as well as the time frames allocated, so as to mitigate the risks'impact and likelihood, while reviewing the current controls in place on such risks.
The analysis of risks, controls and measures to mitigate their impact and likelihood is presented annually to the Audit Committee for supervision and approval. Subsequently, the Audit Committee reports the above to the Board of Directors.

Risks that materialised in 2017
[G4-50]
Failure to meet expectations in the U.S. market
In 2011, Fluidra acquired the Aqua group, a leading company in the world of robotic pool-cleaners with presence in the US and Israeli market. Growth forecasts and penetration in the US market have not reached the levels initially expected. Likewise, the value in use of the cash-generating unit resulting from the acquisition of Aqua group does not cover the value of the net assets and goodwill assigned, so an impairment in the Goodwill resulting from the purchase ensued reducing it to EUR 4 million.

Risks arising from political instability in Catalonia
Despite the political situation in Catalonia, Fluidra in Spain posted double-digit growth in 2017. The company continues to monitor the political and economic situation in order to act and take the most appropriate decisions.

Monitoring of and response plans for Fluidra's main risks.
Development of new products Continuous analysis of sales of new strategic products and its comparison with that of competitors based on monitoring tools for market research, analysis of statistical databases by market and by product type. Conducting comparative studies to set themselves apart from the competition and updating the assessment dossiers of products with the information obtained. Specific action plans aimed at ensuring the adaptation of production capabilities to anticipate levels of demand for these new products.
Financial risks Financial risks, such as exposure to exchange rate or interest rate risk, are monitored on an ongoing basis and specific policies for action are proposed.
Credit risks The Fluidra Group has a highly diversified portfolio of domestic and international clients, in which there is not one top customer that represents a significant percentage of the turnover of the year, so credit risk is also mitigated.
Technological risks Given the activities carried out by the various business units of Fluidra, protecting technology and development is key to maintaining its competitive edge. To this end, the company has criteria and development policies in place together with legal protocols that ensure protection.
Subsidiaries management risk Fluidra is certain that bolstering and standardising the procedures and internal controls in the Group's subsidiaries is the way forward for early detection and eradication of irregularities in the management of subsidiaries.

Implementation of new business activities Continuous assessment of new activities and organisation by Fluidra, which add more value to the group, culminated in 2017 with signing of the merger agreement between Fluidra and Zodiac. As the company knows that any new activity involves an intrinsic risk, it has hired the services of specialised external consultants who have advised on the purchasing process. Fluidra has set up the necessary controls to mitigate the risk associated with the development and integration of any new activity.
Human capital risks Fluidra group companies have a variable remuneration policy linked to professional development and the achievement of personal goals so as to be able to identify and reward its best employees. The parent company has the "Confidential Channel" reporting channel created by the Audit Committee under the collegial management of the corporate management of Human Resources, Internal Audit and the Legal department, so that any employee of the group can file a complaint about issues related to internal control, accounting or auditing. The company has an Internal Code of Conduct in place for matters relating to the stock market.
Risks relating to processes These risks are managed and monitored centrally by the Management and Control Department and verified by the Internal Audit Department. The processes of obtaining the consolidated economic and financial information are developed centrally and under corporate criteria, with the Financial Statement, both consolidated and individual, from the corresponding subsidiary, verified by external auditors.
Climatology The company's risk map includes what is called climatological or meteorological risk, i.e. the possible economic losses derived from adverse movements in certain climatic variables at both a global and local level in any of the regions or countries where Fluidra operates. The company currently covers this risk through its geographical diversification of the business, increasing the portfolio of products for adverse weather conditions and research and development of low water consumption products. Day in, day out, Fluidra strives to develop products to save water, electricity and chemicals, as well as products and services so that swimming pool installations can be managed at any time during the year and in any meteorological situation.

With the aim of coordinating and leading the group's social responsibility areas, Fluidra provides itself with strategic and operational management tools as a basic part of the integration of CSR into the group's value chain. The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Fluidra Group is the strategic management body in which the objectives and lines of social responsibility to be followed in the organisation are developed.
This Committee acts as a cross-sectional element and driver of the policies and actions of corporate responsibility, responsible for channelling from the governing bodies to the base, and vice versa, everything that may affect the relationships with its stakeholders. [G4-37]
This committee is represented within the Corporate Committee by the Corporate General Manager. The liaising with the Group's daily operations is carried out by the Human Resources and CSR Department. All the members of the Committee are involved in the drafting of the Integrated Report, approval and follow-up of its verification, as well as other duties. [G4-48, G4-49, G4-50]
Occasionally, the CSR Committee invites the heads of the different stakeholders to its meetings so they may communicate the latest news and developments in the activities entrusted to it. This helps the cross-sectionality and awareness of CSR in the value chain of the group.
In 2017, Nuria Mirabent joined the CSR Committee as a corporate officer and promoter of health and safety policies and environmental management processes (HSE Manager).

Economic performance
Fluidra's revenue at the end of 2017 was EUR 781 million, an increase of 9.6% on the previous year. Business performance was consistently good across all geographical areas. There was almost double-digit growth in Europe as a whole, after adjusting for divestments and currency effects: in Spain, sales rose by 9.1% following the adjustment for divestments; Southern Europe, with the acquisitions of Sibo and Piscine Laghetto, grew by 10.7% on a like-for-like basis; Northern and Central Europe performed positively as a result of Sibo's contribution to the German and Dutch markets, while Eastern Europe posted 21% growth after currency adjustments, driven by good results in Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia. There was healthy growth in Asia and Australia, growing by 8.9%, largely due to the commercial pool business. Results for the rest of the world were also excellent, with an increase of 10.9%, largely due to the contributions of the Latin American and US markets.

By business areas, there was a good performance in Residential Swimming Pool, where sales rose 10.4% (a key figure as this business area accounts for 57.5% of the group's turnover), and also the 16.8% growth in Commercial Swimming Pools, thanks to the excellent performance in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. Water Treatment performed strongly again, with fresh double-digit growth (11.1%), as did the Fluid Handling business (12.5%), which benefited from the incorporation of Sibo. The Industrial business area, which accounts for 3.3% of sales, grew by

19.5% while Irrigation and Domestic Water Treatment, which accounts for 3.7% of turnover, was down by 27.3% due to the change in the scope of consolidation due to the sale of ATH the previous year.
EBITDA in 2017 reached EUR 99 million, 15.2% higher than the previous year, thanks to higher volumes and positive operating leverage. Net profit grew by 29% to EUR 31.1 million due to the improvement in EBITDA and the lower tax rate, which offset higher financial costs.

Net Financial Debt (NFD) fell 7% to EUR 145.7 million.

Financial situation
Net financial debt (NFD) fell again, this time by 7.0% to EUR 145.7 million, compared to EUR 156.6 million in 2016. The NFD/EBITDA ratio at the end of the 2017 year was 1.4x, below the target limit of 2-2.5x, and below even the 1.8x reached in 2016, thanks to the good performance of free cash flow in a year of strong sales growth.
Fluidra's main source of financing is bank borrowings. In 2015, the company signed a new syndicated financing agreement worth EUR 210 million, with a duration of 5 years. The deal consisted of a loan tranche worth EUR 155 million, with an average life of 4.125 years and a revolving credit facility of EUR 55 million, for 5 years. This agreement made it possible to cancel a previous loan and reduced financial costs by over 50%. At year-end 2017, the outstanding capital on the loan tranche was EUR 126.4 million.
In 2017, only one of the group's companies obtained EUR 3,845 in capital grants and no tax incentives have been applied [G4-EC4].

Swimming Pool and Wellness

Residential swimming pools

The residential swimming pool business is the Group's most important segment and it accounts for 57.5% of sales. In recent years, Fluidra has focused its efforts on developing the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) which has already been used in other areas: the sensorisation and connectivity of various household items (electrical appliances, lighting, heating, watering, etc.).) for more efficient and personalized management by users through smart devices (computer, smartphone...) and remotely. The swimming pool sector is an ideal environment to develop IoT, as it has a number of advantages which are popular with both individuals and professionals.

l Elite Connect

Fluidra currently has six types of solutions, ranging from simple and accessible ones, designed for any kind of pool, to high-end ones for highly automated pools.
l Blue Check
The simplest method, designed for the end user to use an app on his mobile device to check the water quality values of their swimming pool through an application and the use of water test strips, in addition to receiving advice on water care.
l Blue Connect

Smart electrolysis of the high range of saline electrolysis, with the option of connecting to the internet. Can be used to consult all water readings and remote electrolysis management.
l Fluidra Connect & GO
Automated pool solution based on a box to which different pool and garden products can be easily connected. With Connect & GO, the user can easily manage the colour of the lights, change the temperature of the heat pump and control everything remotely at any time. It has an application for professionals and can be configured in four steps.

A smart pool analyser that includes a 4-in-1 sensor ready to float in the water. The senso itself has connectivity and an application alerts the user to problems detected in the water.
l Blue Connect Plus
An advanced version, ready to be installed in the pool pipe and with access to a platform for professionals to monitor, on a single screen, different Blue Connect parameters.

l Fluidra Connect more NN products
Fluidra Connect is a tool created for pool professionals which they can use to remotely manage installations (adjust filtration times, control water consumption, detect leaks, receive alarms, etc.). There is also an end-user application with interactive pool and water quality control features. This solution is intended to be used in conjunction with water treatment products and compatible (NN) heat pumps for an optimal user experience.

Commercial Pool

This business area, which is also known as public swimming pools, accounts for 12.2% of the company's sales. Customers and users of these types of pools are concerned mainly with water quality and energy efficiency, in terms of their present and future needs.

Energy efficiency has become an increasingly important factor to contain costs in sports facilities and complexes, where the energy consumption of swimming pools is one of the highest overheads. To this end, Fluidra offers maintenance professionals various energy efficiency solutions, such as

Water quality is the most basic indicator for installations and maintenance staff, and is the most important factor in terms of measuring the end customer's satisfaction. With this concern in mind, Fluidra has gone further in the search for solutions until it developed the Freepool2 technology. With this system, fewer chemicals are used to purify water, bringing down water usage; users also like it is because the pools smell less of chlorine and do not irritate the skin so much.

· Kivu pump: which reduces energy consumption by up
to 60%.
· Pro-Chlore saline chlorinator: reduces water consumption
by up to 66%.
· UltraViolet Heliox UV: reduces water consumption.
· The Airpool+ dehumidifier: reduces energy consumption
thanks to its heat recovery system.

Engineering projects
In 2017 Fluidra completed two important projects within the commercial swimming pool area: the swimming pools for the 2018 Asian Games, which will take place in Jakarta (Indonesia) this year, and the 29th Summer University of Taipei (Taiwan), which was held in August 2017. In both cases, Fluidra provided engineering solutions for important sports facilities in projects valued at five and four million respectively, which included the design, supply and installation of competition, diving and warm-up pools.
In this same sector, and also in the Asian market, the group won a project for Kazakhstan's 2017 Expo-Expo in Astana (design, installation, installation); and another for Marina Bay Resort in the Philippines, a EUR 5.6 million contract for the design and construction of three large public swimming pools, plus five individual villas, along with spas and jet circuits.

Irrigation and household water treatment
Fluidra complements its Pool & Wellness core business with the provision of services, simultaneously in many cases, in the field of landscape irrigation as the facilities can be next to each other. In this field, Fluidra works with its own brand, Cepex, which has all the products necessary for residential installations, and also distributes well-known international brands.
Fluidra offers a full range of products consisting of sprinklers, diffusers, valves, pipes, filters, and so on, in addition to dripirrigation and micro-irrigation systems used where water use is to be kept to a minimum. Electro valves and controllers to manage irrigation and flow control are essential tools for sustainable water usage.
Water treatment continues to be brought closer to the pool channel in the Idrania brand, now that the divestment from ATH has been completed.
The fountain business, with the Puralia brand, has maintained its customer base, with priority given to the offices channel.

"Investors are increasingly interested in Fluidra, in fact we are reaching out to analysts and managers in countries with which we have not had contact until now"

Cristina del Castillo
Head of Investor and Shareholder Relations

In 2017, Fluidra's share price recorded the second best performance of all Spanish stock market. The year began with the consolidation of year-end 2016 levels, but with a clear upward trend and growing volumes. A number of milestones in the early part of the year consolidated these levels and in late June the share price regained the level of EUR 6.5 at which the company had appeared on the stock exchange ten years earlier. Since then, the share price has continued to grow rapidly and to reach record highs, supported by high volumes of securities, underscoring the market's interest in the company.
2017 marked a generalised recovery in world stock markets, especially in the US, with double-digit growth and where the political tensions generated by the Trump Administration weighed less than economic strength. In Spain, the Ibex-35 ended the year in a positive light despite the political, economic and social turmoil affecting Spain - although it has hardly affected Fluidra.
Against this backdrop, the share price performed very well throughout the year, with no notable ups and downs, showing great strength and with a higher volume of securities than ever before. When Banc de Sabadell, Fluidra's traditional shareholder of reference, sold its shareholding and its entire position in the company - in the first quarter of the year, the market was not spooked at all, in fact it saw it

as an ideal opportunity to buy and increase positions. More and more investors have been drawn to the company by the company's quarterly results and corporate news (such as the divestment of ATH and the acquisitions of Piscine Laghetto and Riiot Labs). This year, the company fulfilled the objectives set out in the 2018 Strategic Plan a year and a half ahead of schedule, a fact which met by strong approval by investors and financial analysts, and which shows Fluidra's enormous potential and its commitment to shareholders.
Its announcement in mid-November that it was going to

merge with the US company Zodiac, also raised a lot of interest in investors. In the days leading up to the merger announcement, the share price was around 9, and after the announcement it shot up to over EUR 11. Analysts and investors alike approve strongly of the deal, and betted that it would make Fluidra more profitable, bringing the share price to all-time highs in late 2017.
At year-end, the price of Fluidra's shares stood at EUR 11.81 per share, which represents a cumulative rise for of 173% in the year. The volume of securities traded during 2017 was 112% higher than the volume traded in 2016.

Shareholding structure
At the end of 2017, the Board of Directors controlled 50.21% of the total share capital of the company.
The remaining 49.79% is free float on the stock market.

In 2017, the rate of structural rotation (permanent staff ), including amortised and unamortised redundancies, stood at 8.4%, 4 points higher than the last year, showing that although the company is growing in terms of employment, it has fallen slightly in the countries analysed in the report. 17.1% of the new employees were over 45 years of age.
As for the minimum periods of notice for operational changes, there is no specific agreement with workers thus current legislation is applicable in each centre. [G4-LA4]

The management policy by salary level, which helps improve internal equity and wage external competitiveness for remuneration matters, continued to be implemented. For yet another year, the minimum wage of newly recruited staff stood at around 30% above the minimum wage set for Spain in 2017, using as reference the lowest salary at Fluidra's Spanish companies that represent most companies included in report.

The company shows the utmost respect for the rights of workers and enables freedom of association and representation activities in all its centres. In 2017, 70.2% of the workforce of the coverage was covered by a collective agreement. Companies without an agreement are international companies where there is no regulation in this regard and where employees have not promoted collective bargaining initiatives. Even so, no risk situation whatsoever was detected in this regard. [G4-11, G4-HR4].

In 2017, the company continued to deploy the modules developed in Cornerstone and has also implemented the "connect" module and developed a new intranet for employees to have all the information in a single access point.
Currently, almost 100% of the employees are included in the tool and managers have an easy way to manage and develop their teams. Employees can also carry out their training online, keep track of their entire file, manage their annual objectives, carry out their One 2 One and carry out various actions throughout their career at Fluidra to promote their professional development.

In 2017, 691 courses were conducted for a total of 2,031 employees, with an average ratio of 11 hours per employee. A total of 22,279 hours were spent on training. [G4-LA9,

Corporate training
Fluidra, with its FluidrAcademy school, aims to make the workplace not only a place to go to work but also a space where employees can develop both professionally and personally. Every year, the company invests time and money in organising transversal training programmes to improve knowledge and at the same time share experiences between people from the different companies in the group.

Managerial skills programme
In 2017, a Management Skills working group was set up and a new programme for managers was launched, focusing exclusively on the industrial area, where a pilot group was also set up. The result has been very positive and, in 2018, more industrial groups will be set up.

Occupational Health and Safety

The health and safety of Fluidra's employees is a priority for the company. The Group companies' policies on quality, safety and the environment place particular emphasis on the prevention of occupational hazards. To reinforce these aspects, in 2017 the area was strengthened with a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Corporate Management position, with the aim of spearheading Health and Safety policies and aligning the entire organisation with a common objective:
Fluidra safeguards its employees' health and safety:

-- take part in observation and training programmes (e.g. mandatory local safety training, driver safety training and behavioural safety programme);
-- report unsafe acts and conditions that pose a safety hazard.
· Employees are expected to keep an eye out for their
colleagues and to warn them of any unsafe behaviour.

· It promotes programs to maintain and improve our
employees' health and well-being, for example, by providing smoke-free workplaces around the world.
· It encourages employees to take advantage of voluntary
health programs and to adopt healthy types of behaviour, such as:
-- exercising regularly
-- choosing healthy food,
-- taking part in medical check-ups,
· Offering employees safe working conditions and striving to
protect them from potential health hazards. Before performing potentially hazardous tasks, a process and workplace risk assessment and analysis must be performed.
· Management is responsible for facilitating risk assessments
and developing protective measures in cooperation with employees. They must know the local safety requirements, respect them and comply with them. For example:
-- use appropriate personal protective equipment when necessary;

In 2017, a meeting was held with the group's HSE professionals. This meeting, which will be held annually, allows for the creation of a network of HSE people who will share criteria, lessons learned and exchange experiences facilitating the optimisation of the group's resources in the field of HSE.
Throughout the year, participating companies developed different training methods in safety and prevention. While commercial and corporate service companies have placed more focus on prevention of risks in offices and firefighting, training, industrial companies' training has revolved around issues more specific to their commercial activity, namely courses on safety in freight transport, safety in the use of raised platforms, safety for work at heights and the use of electric pallet trucks, emergency planning, first aid, as well as conducting health and safety campaigns on their premises. In addition, an information and prevention policy whereby the results on accident monitoring and on internal safety inspections are notified through information boards has been implemented.
Each Group company in Spain has its own Risk Prevention Plan which provides regular risk assessments suited to its activity and job positions, and provides the necessary training to all staff, both internal and external.

-- comply with alarms and safety warning signs;

Equality, diversity and work/life balance
[G4-LA3, G4-LA12, G4-LA13]

Prevention plans are usually rolled out through an external prevention service which is implemented by the Prevention Coordinators and Delegates and the Health and Safety Committees of each company. Thus, proper detection and control of risks as well as compliance with prevention plans and monitoring of the corrective measures being implemented are ensured.
During 2017, emergency drills were carried out with the participation of 791 people, as well as internal training on prevention for 1,003 workers and first aid for 176 people.
As for the staff relocated abroad, although the international mobility policy does not make specific reference to risks, diseases and serious accident training, it provides information and advice on these issues in a specific and direct manner.

Fluidra has an equality and diversity policy that contains the objectives, principles and responsibilities at the corporate level. In addition, each company adapts the general guidelines to its specific reality and to its own processes and regulations. These policies ensure equal treatment between men and women, with no salary differences between employees who perform the same functions and according to categories and positions.
Fluidra seeks to help its employees achieve work-life balance within a positive work environment and it does so by implementing measures tailored to the organisation's and the staff's needs.

Communication channels
To ensure that employees have fluid communication with the company, Fluidra offers them different channels:
· The "Confidential Channel" is available on the website
and on the LivingFluidra portal, which is accessible to all employees. Employees can make inquiries, ask for advice or report an incident through an online form. All communications are handled confidentially and care is taken when making any decision always respecting the people involved.
· `Living Fluidra'is a platform which presents global news
about different areas of the company.
· Fluidra employees have suggestions boxes in the diffe-
rent companies where they can leave their proposals on how to improve certain aspects of the company.
· Information boards, placed in high-visibility loca-
tions within the companies, provide the workers with succinct and accurate information about specific company news.
· "Town hall meetings" are an informal event where the
President and Chief Executive Officer present quarterly results to headquarters staff.
· "Coffee with Management" is a series of breakfast
meetings held three or four times a year between the President and groups of employees to exchange information in a relaxed atmosphere.
In 2017, 10 queries were received through the Confidential Channel. [G4-LA16]

2017 employeefocused activities
All Fluidra professionals have creative, social and sporting interests that the company seeks to promote through various activities and initiatives, which in 2017 took the form of:
Imagine Silicon Valley Competition launched in May to present ideas in the field of pool connectivity. The winner had the opportunity to turn their idea into reality by working for a month in San Francisco (California, USA), with some of the best experts in disruptive innovation. The other nine finalists took part in the Fluidra Innovation Week in September, an intense week in different inspiring places in Barcelona, dedicated to the development of different ideas. Their projects were presented in the Start-Up Village by 4YFN area of the Swimming Pool & Wellness show in Barcelona (more information in the Innovation section).

Innovation policy
Innovation is one of the core activities of Fluidra's strategy. The company is clearly focused on developing products and solutions that satisfy market needs with a clear focus on efficiency, both in the use of materials and in energy consumption. One good example is the development of the new Victoria Plus Silent VS variable speed pumps, which are capable of achieving energy savings of 85% compared to a conventional pump of the same category. Similarly, the new LED pool spotlights (PAR56 V1 and DC PAR56 V1) developed in 2017, achieve energy savings of 90% compared to a conventional 300W spotlight. [G4-EN7]
To do this, Fluidra has an R&D structure consisting of 16 Centres of Excellence and Technical Centres located in 9 countries: Spain, France, Belgium, the United States, Israel, Australia, China, South Africa and Brazil, with an approach on technological specialisation, coordinated from Central Services R&D&i located in Polinyà (Barcelona). A total of 119 people spend on average 56% of their time working on product R&D. This year a new centre was added in Belgium, Riiot

Strategic R&D Plan
During 2017, different activities have been carried out to implement the Strategic R&D Plan developed during 2016, which will culminate in 2020 with a more integrated, much more efficient and effective organisation.

Labs, which specialises in developing connectable solutions and data analysis.
In 2017, Fluidra invested 0.9% of total sales in R&D&i.
Innovation Committee
The Innovation Committee is the body responsible for establishing Fluidra's innovation strategy and for defining the corporate guidelines whose objective is to serve as a guide for all CoEs in the product development process. A second level involves the Product Committees coordinating R&D&i for each of the CoEs. The multidisciplinary approach of these committees is essential to ensure that the actions undertaken by the CoEs are aligned with the needs of Fluidra.

The key structure of the new organisation is the Hubs or R&D Activity Centres. These Hubs act as R&D reference centres for a given technology or product family. The Hub is responsible for coordinating all the R&D activities carried out by Fluidra with this technology or product family. This new organisation allows us to better coordinate the different product development initiatives in a more simplified way, minimising possible redundancies, providing a much more global and strategic vision, more focused on the customer and the business.
The different Product Managers carry out an essential task by identifying needs on the different markets, thus providing guidance for and prioritising the activities to be carried out by the Hubs. Hence the close relationship between the areas of Marketing and R&D, to ensure innovation focused on meeting customer needs.

Innovation model

· Fluid Handling Hub (located in Cepex) · Lighting Hub (Located in Sacopa) · Pumping Hub (Located in Metalast) · Filtration Hub (Located in Poltank) · Advanced Disinfection Hub (located at Idegis)

Fluidra's innovation model uses technological and market exploration to identify challenges and opportunities for innovation. Creativity and the generation of ideas enable opportunities in terms of knowledge which is protected or in specific projects that move on to the development stage, to finally be transformed into products and/or solutions that meet customers' needs. Monitoring the performance of products in the market is, in turn, an important source of information that feeds the different phases of the model.

· Internet of Things Hub (located in Polinyà HQ)
Throughout 2018, the defined Hubs will begin to be consolidated and the most suitable organisation for the rest of the technologies and product families will be defined.

In 2016, Fluidra began to roll out a new corporate tool to manage new product development processes. In 2017, seven centres used this tool: Sacopa, Cepex, Metalast, Fluidra Industry France, Inquide Poltank and Polinya HQ. Deployment to the other companies will continue throughout 2018. We will use this software to consolidate and standardise the innovation process in a transversal way for the whole organisation. It will also ensure that product development activities are fully aligned with market needs and the company strategy.

Activities and workshops

There have been many activities aimed at promoting innovation in 2017. Some of the most important were:

The second leg of the project was launched in the latter half of 2017. Students of the training cycles aimed to develop the three winning ideas of the previous stage to turn them into solutions or products.

Silicon Valley Big Challenge Fluidra launched an in house competition in May to gather new disruptive ideas within the scope of pool connectivity and digitalisation: Silicon Valley Big Challenge. The winner, Marc Tarradas (Sacopa), had the privilege of participating in the Imagine Silicon Valley program http://imagine.cc/ silicon-valley/2017, an annual event that takes place in one of the most innovative environments in the world: Silicon Valley (California, USA).

Completion of the first stage of "Inventem el Futur de les Piscines" (Let's Invent the Future of Swimming Pools) by the "Creativació" Foundatio This project promotes creativity and innovation in primary
and secondary school students, who come up with solutions
to answer Fluidra's challenge about what pools will look like
in the future. The prize for the three winning teams was a
cheque for EUR 800 to provide the school with spaces to
encourage creativity. The 3 winning schools were:

· Fanals d'Aro School, (Platja d'Aro, Girona), "Econatural
Pool": ecological swimming pool that reuses rainwater.
· Sagrat Cor School, (Sarrià, Barcelona), "Musical Pool":
a sensitive stimulation project, ideal for people with disabilities.

Throughout July, Fluidra's team* , led by Marc, had material resources and the best experts at its disposal to develop its idea. The result was Fluid Reality, a solution that allows you to enjoy the pool through the use of mixed virtual reality, creating an environment of games, education and sport for both children and adults.

· Sagrada Familia School (Barcelona), "Tecno Piscina": inte-
ractive swimming pool to play and live unique experiences.En la segunda mitad de 2017 se inició la segunda etapa del proyecto, en la que los alumnos de ciclos formativos tienen como objetivo desarrollar las tres ideas ganadoras de la etapa anterior para concretarlas en soluciones o productos.
* Fluidra's team, in addition to Marc Tarradas, was made up of Jan Carbonell (Strategy Consultant for Opentrends) and Ernesto Gamiz (business analyst for Everis in Mexico).

Technology

In 2017 Fluidra has actively participated through different forums and events in the promotion of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the swimming pool sector. This promotion has been based on the concept of connecting users, pools and equipment. Any user, any pool and any equipment.
Fluidra also took part in the:
3rd IoT Stars Edition Event for Internet of things companies that was held during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Ten companies, including Fluidra with its Fluidra Connect solution, presented their projects to a top-level jury at the Antiga Fàbrica Estrella Damm in Barcelona in February 2017. https://livingfluidra. fluidra.com/internet-of-pools-tecnologia-destacada-iotstars-mwc-17/]

Fluidra 2017 Sustainable Filtration
Fluidra I+D submitted a request for public aid for Hubs for industrial research and experimental development. These Hubs are financed by the European Union's ERDF fund and are mainly used to support industrial research projects.
It presented a project called SOSTPOOL, Investigation of innovative and sustainable processes of filtration of pool water to obtain excellent water quality. In late 2017, Fluidra received confirmation that it had been awarded the aid and was approved to start the project. It is scheduled for completion in November 2019 and is expected to provide a boost to the development of new innovative pool filtration products.
During the last year, work has continued on filtration devices. The aim was to find more efficient filtering devices than those currently on the market, and which could also reduce energy and water consumption in swimming pools. One of the consequences of this work is the improvements made to filter glass, which allows Fluidra to offer a product with better performance. These improvements have been validated by the IFTS (reference centre in filtration technology) according to the UNE 16713 standard.
Additive Manufacturing
As a continuation of the Additive Manufacturing project initiated in 2016 (an Industrial Post-graduate Students programme in conjunction with the UPC's CIM Foundation and with the support of the Department of Economics and Knowledge of the Generalitat de Catalunya), during 2017, new case studies have been conducted using the latest additive manufacturing technologies. The results indicate a better approach to the concept of production with additive manufacturing technologies of existing references at Fluidra. This has allowed us to create a methodology to objectively determine which parts are optimal for manufacture using additive manufacturing technologies. The ultimate goal is to optimise manufacturing and operational costs as well as delivery times.

Intellectual Property (IP) protection
Corporate R&D&i coordinates technological monitoring, management and protection of the portfolio of intangible assets (patents, designs and trademarks), and training for the different Centres of Excellence on issues concerning the protection of such intangible assets throughout the value chain.
Fluidra has implemented a series of internal processes for the development and launch of new products. They include a review of the potential risks of infringement of third-party rights at various stages of development, and also allow for the detection and subsequent protection of inventions. The company also regularly monitors the specific technologies of interest to the group and its main competitors to detect any possible applications for protection that may be relevant to the development of future products or services, as well as to initiate action if a threat to any of the group's intangible assets is detected. Regular meetings are held to review inventions and products, as well as to monitor protection by third parties, for technologies with intense industrial property development. Fluidra also has various internal processes such as creation and alignment of policies so that group policies are aligned to the legal changes regarding trade secret regulations.
The Trademark Committee, which consists of the heads of marketing, communication and intellectual property, meets once a month to discuss the strategy for the group's trademarks, optimising the current portfolio and other issues related to trademarks and domains.
In 2017, Fluidra had no record of nor had it been notified of any prohibition on the marketing of its products in certain markets. Nor has it any record of the products sold being questioned by stakeholders or which have been the subject of public debate. [G4-PR6]

Customer training
Ongoing customer training is one of the keys to Fluidra's success, and each year it organises more than 150 training days on five continents. It provides training which is not only related to the group's own product and business, but is also focused on promoting knowledge of key areas for the success of professional customers: how to be effective in social media, how to boost online business or how to restructure your physical store to have impact on the final customer.

Factory tours 2017
Fluidra never forgets the fact that it is not only a distributor but also a manufacturer. Accordingly, the company arranges visits to the main production units with a twofold purpose: to show the production capacity of the facilities and to improve their knowledge about Fluidra products thanks to the participation of factory experts in the provision of training. In 2017, over 15 tours were carried out, lasting from 2 to 3 days, attended by more than 200 customers in 20 countries around the world.
In addition to purely educational initiatives, Fluidra promotes activities to enter into contact with relevant industry partners such as meetings, fairs, incentive trips, events or specific campaigns to launch new products.
Loyalty programmes
In order to reward loyalty, programmes to encourage the acquisition of Fluidra products have been ramped up, especially those aimed at sustainable use. These programmes - which include the Official Partner Programme (Astralpool), Aquaspecialist, Duty (CTX) and Alliance in Australia - receive advertising support on POS and access to exclusive products.
In general, customers who are registered with a loyalty plan register an annual growth of more than 6% in their business.

"Fluidra is currently the business partner with the highest sensitivity to technological innovation and commitment towards searching for products that meet the end customer's new requirements. Its training proposals not only focus on new products, but also on new consumer trends and available technologies to improve professional sales. They are very helpful for companies like us that have decided to invest and revamp

In 2017, Fluidra has placed a special focus on the online channel by developing a loyalty programme for customers who operate in this market. The @-Partner plan aims to create a network of Fluidra customers who will be the industry reference for the online channel. The company provides them with advertising support, visibility on the astralpool.comwebsite and a brand developed for them.
Boosting e-commerce
In an industrial company like Fluidra, with a clear focus on sales, the digital business (eCommerce) is the main lever in the digital transformation process.
The Digital Business Unit was created in 2017 in order for the company to have a holistic strategic vision. This unit manages the development, operation and expansion of all the digital revenue channels such as eCommerce platforms for customers, the management of accounts on international marketplaces such as Amazon, as well as the exploration of new business models linked to Internet of Pools products such as "Fluidra Connect" and "Blue Connect", the latter as a result of the acquisition of Belgian Startup Riiot Labs.
In 2017, as well as creating the business unit, the technological foundations have been laid to enable a better shopping experience for customers, and greater scalability. Important improvements were the migration of all the group's digital business assets to the cloud through Amazon Web Services, and the consolidation of a single product database that can be used to ensure that the information provided to professional customers is updated regardless of the interface used for the search (an eCommerce store, a branded website, etc.).
As an example of the power of product information centralisation, the AstralPool product page has been revampedl http://www.astralpool.com. The new site features enhanced browsing on multiple screens such as computer, tablet and mobile screens that gives access to all the information related to the products of the brand, as well as the different configuration tools that help customers to select the product that best suits the needs of the installation.
Under this omnichannels approach, the company has reinforced eCommerce platforms already in operation in various countries, and improved navigability for visiting customers, leading to greater conversion and sales.
The growth in both value and volume at Amazon has been significant during 2017, especially the work carried out in North America with the distribution of cleaning robots, as well as the deployment of the GRE catalogue in Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Germany.

Fluidra PRO Platform
Five years ago Fluidra developed a B2B online shopping platform with the aim of improving customer service. In 2017, the store was updated to incorporate new information technology and for improved user experience. During the year, the Fluidra PRO platform processed almost 20,000 orders, with a turnover of approximately EUR 7 million.
Social media
The digital sector has become crucial in recent years, in fact now it is the most direct mean of communication, interaction and information for consumers, customers, investors and the public interested in the company. Fluidra has a presence on the main social media. The objective and target depend on the social network and the company that manages it. In other words, commercial delegations generate content for their clients firmly focused on selling, while the company's corporate accounts share information of general interest aimed at journalists, investors, workers, etc.

Quality and service
[G4-PR1, G4-PR2]

"The sharp increase in demand has slightly affected our service indicators, but we still managed to exceed our complaint reduction target"

Eva Samper Quality Director

Fluidra conceives of quality as a global whole, not just as product quality. Thus it strives to transform the customer's expectations into a requirement and, once established, to have the entire chain necessary to achieve the final product or service that meets this requirement. To achieve this objective, we need to have system and methods that allow us to work on the quality of each of the links in this chain. Quality is integrated and always focused on continuously improving the product, the system and our attitude.
The pillars of any company are customer satisfaction and sustainable growth, and quality is a concept that contributes to both. At Fluidra, customer satisfaction is measured by reducing customer complaints and increasing service quality, and this has a positive impact on reducing non-quality costs.
In financial year 2017, the priority objective of the quality area was to establish common working methods through joint work and to issue procedures, as well as the Fluidra Quality Diagnosis, as a tool for improving company systems and reducing quality complaints.

The target proposed for 2017 had been to bring down customer complaints by 10% against the previous year. At year-end, customer lines complaints had been reduced by 11% against the previous year, as shown in the chart below.
None of the complaints received referred to non-compliance of the products due to their impact on people's health and safety, so no improvement evaluations were carried out in 2017, as they were not considered necessary. [G4-PR1,
G4-PR2]

The most representative indicators of service quality are:
1 . OTD (On Time Delivery) (%): This is the percentage of order lines delivered on time and confirmed to the customer. In 2017 it fell by 2%, bringing Fluidra's annual average to 95%.
2 . Availability (%): This is the percentage of order lines, with enough stock to serve 100% of the quantity requested at the time of order entry. In 2017 it fell by 2%, reaching an annual average of 93%.

Fluidra has several indicators of the level of service it offers its customers throughout an extensive distribution network, which monitor sales orders from their entry into the system to their delivery to the customer. In recent years, Fluidra has implemented a series of continuous improvement programmes in its supply chain processes that have led to very positive results in customer service.

3 . Average delivery time (Days): Time elapsing between the entry of the order line and delivery to the customer. In 2017 it increased by 0.6 days, leaving the company with an annual average of 2.8 days.

However, the 2017 indicators show a slight decrease in service due to the dramatic surge in demand (13% more than in 2016), and during the first half of the year this increase was 19%.

Carlos Picola Year review
Head of Procurement
and future challenges
[G4-12] 2017 was globally characterised by an increased purchase volume of around 10%, slightly below the business growth of the group. The year was shaped by high price levels for quoted commodities (oil, gas, metals), which affected the price levels of many raw materials. Electricity and gas prices followed an upward trend. Especially in the first few months of the year, energy prices were at record levels in Spain. These high price levels gradually regained momentum, although in the year as a whole prices ended up being higher than in 2016. The global economy is growing strongly, so it remains to be seen when this upward trend will end.

High oil and metals prices were favourable to increases in derivatives product costs, particularly resins (ABS, PP, PE), engines and steel, with a few supply shocks. Because of the compulsory conversion to membrane technology of chlorine-alkali plants in December 2017, several chlorine and soda plants closed throughout Europe. This situation has led to a shortage and a very high price increase for this family of products and all their derivatives.
The Chinese government's environmental and energy policy has prompted significant restrictions on production in China. In fact, the chemicals family has been one of those hit hardest, with very significant price increases, as well as a very marked supply shortage, which continues over time and is expected to continue throughout 2018.
The euro also gradually strengthened against the dollar during the year, especially in the second half of the year, although this will be more clearly factored into purchases in 2018.
After launching the mandatory Tender for our electricity supply, our usual supplier of green energy type A, certified by the National Commission of Markets and Competition, has continued to be the best positioned, ensuring the supply of 100% renewable sources until the end of 2020 in the current 57 consumption points in Spain.
Another important point is fleet management, where the group's policy, coupled with the constant renewal of more efficient vehicles, has led to greater quality and less pollution in Fluidra's mobility.
We are currently carrying out a fleet usage study so as to be able to analyse habits and routes in greater depth, and to develop a future plan for the replacement of vehicles with other hybrids or electric vehicles wherever possible.

Purchase and approval policy
During 2017, the new Procurement policy was approved, disseminated and implemented, in line with the undertakings of honesty and integrity that define the group. It sets out the criteria for competitive concurrence and approval of suppliers, which have to comply with Fluidra's Supplier Code and respect the physical and social environment of the organisation.
Supply chain results
[G4-12, G4-13]
Fluidra has a varied and complex distribution of supplier, with a procurement volume of close to EUR 490 million, and 11,300 supplier and creditor accounts active in 2017. The procurement volume for the operating accounts is distributed in a way that is inversely proportional between suppliers of raw materials and service providers (close to 70-30).
The distribution of purchases by volume shows a significant concentration of suppliers and creditors in the over one million purchase segment with 0.8% of the operating accounts and 40% of the total turnover. However, 93% of suppliers and creditors are in the purchasing range below EUR 100,000 with 19% of turnover.
In an internationalised group like Fluidra, purchases in different countries to satisfy local and group demands are a very important aspect of daily operations. Given the close relationship and knowledge of our suppliers, around 40% of the group's purchases are carried out in Spain. The rest are imported products or products used in the same productive areas where they are manufactured. Thus, the purchase impact for local suppliers is significant, avoiding unnecessary movements of goods, while promoting the local economy.

It is important to note that the volume of purchases from China is strongly affected by the purchase of chemicals, as China is the only manufacturer of many of these products in the world. In the other countries, a balance is

maintained between suppliers and purchase volume. Given the geographical location of the companies in the Fluidra group, the criterion is for local purchases to be considered as procurement made within the country in which the company is located. Under this criterion, 70% of purchases are made from local suppliers. [G 4 - EC 9 ]

Under international procurement, and in line with the distribution of countries, the use of local currencies is one of the important management aspects of the group. The euro remains the currency of choice, although the US dollar also has an important impact in that purchases in China are made in this currency.

Fluidra is sensitive to the sustainability of its supply chain, where the Supplier Ethical Code http://www.fluidra. com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Código-Ético-paraproveedores_ES.pdf is a fundamental part of its policy of social responsibility in the supply of raw materials and services. It is compulsory to accept the code in all contracts and orders, through general clauses in all corporate contracts and automatic orders of the system, and it is also present in the approval process. The Code is inspired by the United Nations Global Compact, advocating human rights and fighting corruption are both essential and paramount.

Supplier assessment

[G4-LA14, G4-LA15, G4-HR10, G4-HR11, G4-EN32, G4-EN33]
The criticality of suppliers is determined by their purchase volume and degree of involvement in the business. In this respect, all suppliers of materials and services with purchasing volumes above EUR 500,000 are considered critical and must therefore be assessed regarding their ethical, social and environmental behaviour. In 2017, the group of critical suppliers accounted for nearly 60% of total purchases.

Percentage of turnover
Critical suppliers
50.7%

Over the last two years, Fluidra has rolled out a systematic process of social risk assessment for suppliers categorised as critical for the company. In this regard, Fluidra is moving towards new forms of evaluation that will allow it to deepen its knowledge and understanding of its suppliers' risks.
In 2017, continuing with the evaluation process initiated in previous years, 100% of the suppliers considered critical have been reached with a purchase volume of 50% of the total in 2016.
Based on the effective evaluations carried out, we can determine that there is no high social risk in our critical suppliers, although 9% of them need specific attention and help in their social, environmental and compliance performance, although this does not entail a serious problem of violation of rights. [G 4 - L A 1 4 , G 4 - L A 1 5 , G 4 - H R 1 0,
G4-HR11]
Progress has been made in the degree of satisfaction with regard to labour practices in the supply chain, rising from 7% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2017.
The same level of satisfaction about the treatment of Human Rights of the previous year is maintained.
This year 2017 "Compliance" has been included in supplier assessment, as anti-corruption and regulatory compliance policies. The degree of satisfaction is also correct, although in 2% of the evaluations there is no active policy of regulatory compliance.

Other suppliers 49.3%
Regarding the environmental assessment of Fluidra's suppliers, there is an analysis procedure in place on 100% of suppliers over a three-year cycle in all production plants through the implementation of ISO14001 and EMAS environmental certificates. Such procedures set monitoring and compliance references in environmental matters of suppliers, establishing mechanisms for a possible operational veto of the provider in case of serious breach of the environmental legislation. In 2017, 328 suppliers have been evaluated, 2% of which were found to have deficiencies in the identification of the environmental aspects of the activity, lack of objectives and targets, and in the documentation of operations control. They were all sent a letter of communication and a request to remedy the deficiencies. [G4-EN32, G4-EN33]
Based on the evaluations carried out, no suppliers with a significant risk of child exploitation have been identified, nor organisations that violate workers' rights to collective bargaining, nor have any episodes of forced labour been identified. [G4-HR4, G4-HR5, G4-HR6]

7 INTEGRATED REPORT

In 2017, the Environmental Management Committee was set up to develop the Master Plan established by the CSR Committee at group level and to reinforce environmental criteria. During the meetings of this committee, the environmental data and the actions planned in the group companies are reviewed on a quarterly basis.

Energy efficiency, energy consumption and energy-efficient products

In 2017, the first meeting with the group's Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) professionals took place. This meeting, which will be held annually, allows criteria to be aligned, explanations of lessons learned and to exchange experiences to help optimise the group's resources in the field of HSE.
Environmental objectives are defined at corporate level, although each Group company has responsibility based on the significant environmental aspects such as the ISO 14001 or EMAS standard, with the Group's general guidelines used as a blueprint. The persons with the highest degree of responsibility are the managers or directors of each of the companies who are operationally delegated to the corresponding health safety and environmental managers.
There have been no environmental complaints in 2017, nor were there in previous years - either through formal mechanisms or through informal communication mechanisms. [G4-EN34]
In 2017 production in the Group's companies increased substantially, prompting an increase in some consumption indicators (energy, raw materials, etc.). Nevertheless, in total figures it can be observed how the environmental policies implemented are taking effect, maintaining the emissions and waste indicators in similar numbers to those of the previous year, helping to meet the objectives set in Fluidra's environmental policy.

Part of Fluidra's power supply comes from renewable sources. Most of the group's energy comes from green energy, which helps to bring down the carbon footprint. [G4-EN19]
The increase in electricity consumption in 2017 was 13.6%, due to the increase in production and the extension of the report's coverage. There has been an increase of 18.9% in consumption of diesel fuel for production and commercial vehicles, due to the aforementioned causes of production and coverage. Lastly, in terms of energy consumption, natural gas consumption fell by 10.2% compared to the previous year. [G4-EN3, G4-EN6, G4-EN19]
One of Fluidra's commitments to the environment is to optimise the consumption of resources and, to this end, to promote energy efficiency among the group's companies.
During 2017, the following energy efficiency actions were carried out [G4-EN6]:
· Acquisition of energy-efficient equipment and machi-
nery: energy-efficient injection machines (one machine in Cepex, three new machines in Sacopa and one in Prelast), a servomotor press (Prelast, SA) and two items of free-cooling refrigeration equipment (Cepex) where an energy saving of 25% was achieved in refrigeration since deployment.

In 2017, the range of companies in the group that have reported their data for this report has been expanded, in accordance with Fluidra's commitment to increasing the transparency and reliability of the data reported.

· Installation of energy-efficient lighting by replacing fluo-
rescent lights and projectors by LED lighting (Sacopa, Cepex, S.A.U Metalast, Trace Logistics) and use of natural light (Fluidra Portugal, LDA). A 57% reduction in installed wattages has been achieved in the case of Trace Logistics.

· Implementation of energy control system through analy-
sers (Metalast, Cepex).

· Staff awareness campaigns in order to make everybody
aware of the need to use energy efficiently and reduce
consumption (Idegis, Cepex, Sacopa, Metalast).

· Promoting the use of good environmental practices:
always turning off lights and air cooling systems when the rooms are not in use and at the end of the day, the use of centralised systems or thermostats that allow users to set the temperature thus reducing energy consumption and preventing unnecessary consumption, turning off screens and computers at the end of the day. A global corporate campaign has been conducted within the group and individual campaigns have been conducted in the following companies: Cepex, Fluidra, S.A.U, Metalast, Poltank, Sacopa, Talleres del Agua and Fluidra Portugal. (.

CEPEX Injector- at Cepex Centre, SAU in Granollers

· In relation to energy-efficient products, companies like
AstralPool, Fluidra Australia PTY, Ltd. focus on developing and selling energy-efficient products (for example Viron Pumps). Sacopa, with Ignialight, engages in the manufacture of lighting for fountains, street lighting, industrial architectural lighting and sports facilities that facilitate energy efficiency.
· Sacopa, through the app FESEDIT, encourages the use of
shared transport between workers reducing the use of private transport.

Energy intensity
[G4-EN3, G4-EN5, G4-EN6] In 2017, the total energy consumed within the coverage of the report was 243,140 gigajoules, an increase of 9.4% over the previous year, as a result of the increase in coverage. Energy intensity with respect to raw material consumption (PM) was 3.92 Gj/tMP, representing a decrease of 9.8%. However, given the increase in the number of companies covered, energy intensity per person has increased by 5.5% over the previous year with 45.90 Gj/person.
Emission of air pollutants
The Fluidra Group companies do not release significant amounts of substances into the atmosphere which may be harmful to the ozone layer as part of their activities. However, they are measured and managed as a preventive and control measure.
This report shows that in 2017, despite the increase in production and the increase in the number of spectrum companies, emissions data remained stable. However, in the area of volatile components (VOCs), when incorporating this year for the first time the data of the polyester company in the USA, there has been a significant increase. [G4-EN20,
G4-EN21]

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) 0.0%

Inquide's plant performs monitoring and control of emissions through direct measurement. The data obtained from VOCs are obtained through mass balance and correspond mostly to styrene (C8H8) from the polyester resin transformation process. Substances emitted in production processes do not affect the ozone layer according to Regulation (EC) 1005/2009. Only HCFC's cooling gases are likely to affect the ozone layer and no leakage was detected in 2017.

Logistics in Fluidra companies centres around the Group's warehouse, in which measures for the optimisation of transport are taken using full loads and efficiently managing shipments to customers. This has made it possible to reduce mileage by 20.1% in 2017. [G4-EN30]

Intensity of CO2 emissions
[G4-EN18]
The intensity of CO2 emissions in 2017 compared to the consumption of raw materials increased slightly by 0.2% to 449.60 kgCO2/tMP. In contrast, emissions per person have decreased from the previous year by 13.7% to 6.17 tCO2/person.
The main steps taken to reduce GHG emissions were as follows:
· Use of the Trace Logistics Group's logistics warehouse by all companies to
concentrate truckload shipments, optimising the number of shipments and reducing emissions.
· Replacing face-to-face meetings and training with videoconferences and online
software to avoid the need for domestic and international travel.

Minimisation of packaging waste
Fluidra is aware of the waste generated by the packaging of its products: paper, cardboard and plastic. They are packed in grouped and palletised cardboard boxes or, depending on the product, in plastic or metal containers which are packed in accordance with the established packing instructions. Due to environmental legislation demands, some companies must submit waste reduction plans on packaging to the regional authority's competent body. The following measures, inter alia, have been implemented to minimise this environmental impact:
· Reduction of the amount of single-use packaging waste on the market, increa-
sing the proportion of recyclable packaging in relation to non-recyclable ones and using ­as far as possible­ recycled materials and containers whose physical properties or characteristics provide for recovery and recycling.
· Reusable plastic boxes replacing cardboard boxes and internal transport of
components between warehouses.
· Reuse of wooden pallets of raw materials for internal use.
· Reuse of cardboard boxes that are received with equipment from suppliers and
customers which are used to pack and ship.
· Reduction of the packaging size.
· Increasing the number of boxes per pallet in the shipments of some items.
· Segregation of light packaging to reduce banal waste.
Water consumption
Fluidra's mission is to bolster society's development and progress through sustainable use of water in its leisure, domestic and industrial applications. The group is especially concerned about saving water and despite the fact that overall consumption is not high and that processes do not require a large amount of water, companies carry out consumption controls for detecting and repairing leaks in the network and misuse or unnecessary use caused by poor practices. Fluidra also raises awareness among its staff of the importance of its proper use.
In 2017, 112,160 m3 were consumed, an increase of 7% over the previous year, due to the two factors initially mentioned: the increase in production and the increased scope of this reporting. The reduction in reused water is due to the shutdown., for several months, of the production activities of one of the plants.

Optimisation of natural resources: consumption of materials
[G4-EN1, G4-EN2] Fluidra aims to reduce the wastage of raw materials, avoiding their exploitation, optimising consumption and minimising waste and disposals, applying best environmental practices, from design, procurement and production.
In 2017, with the increase in production and the incorporation of more Group companies into the scope of this report, consumption of plastic and other materials increased, although there was a 3.2% decrease in chemical materials. This was due to the optimisation of logistics and the review of stocks, the application of mitigation measures, and lastly, the decline in manufacturing of products that are made of this material.

Environmental protection

Fluidra Group companies are located in industrial estates or urban areas outside natural areas of special protection. For this reason, biodiversity is protected only through conservation of native species in neighbouring gardens of the perimeter of the facility.
Minimisation of wastewater
[G4-EN22] Black water is mostly discharged directly to the public network, although some Group companies incorporate them into their production processes.
The following actions taken during the year are worth highlighting:

absence of public sewers in the area. The remaining wastewater in Monzón generated from production processes is managed internally as waste, and deposited in storage reservoirs for natural evaporation.
· Metalast has a physical-chemical water treatment system
to treat processed waters. This year Metalast has incorporated a tank to regulate flow rate and inlet concentrations in the plant. All the Group's other production companies have closed water circuits that allow for reuse and savings.
In 2017, 7% more was discharged in comparison to 2016, due to leaks in the group's companies that were inconsequential or did not affect biodiversity because they were processed water. Wastewater discharges comply with environmental legislation. [G4-EN24, G4-EN26]

· Inquide, in Monzón (Huesca, Spain) has a biological
treatment plant where grey water is treated. This system
discharges treated water through filtration wells in the

Optimising the management and treatment of waste
[G4-EN23, G4-EN25]
The waste generated is sorted and treated in compliance with current legislation. Its management is aimed at reducing, reusing and recycling both at origin and through authorised processing companies and as a by-product. Of the waste generated by Fluidra in 2017, 40% was hazardous waste and the remaining 60% non-hazardous waste.
In 2017, workplaces managed, by recovery at source, recovery and management of the by-product, 80% of the waste generated, while 20% was managed by treatment or disposal. In 2016, it was managed by management at source, recovery and management of the by-product, 76.9% of the waste generated, while 23.1% was managed by treatment or disposal. There has been greater internal management of waste (via recovery, recycling or reuse), despite the increase in production.
Fluidra Group companies do not transport or treat waste internationally classified as hazardous, in compliance with Annexes I, II, III, and VIII of the Basel Convention; all treatment or transportation that may result from such waste is performed in the country.

· Environmental awareness campaigns have been carried
out in the different Group companies. A campaign was also launched at corporate level with tips on promoting environmental awareness and to raise staff awareness about good environmental practices, such as energy consumption, waste management, responsible water consumption, etc. This campaign was held on the same day as World Energy Saving Day.

· In the process of improving the control of emissions,
Inquide has invested in neutralising gases by scrubber
(gas cleaning) and improved aspirations.

· High level indicators have been defined to collect envi-

Environmental objectives 2018
In 2017, the Master Plan (2017-2020) was drafted with environmental objectives to progressively implement ISO 14001 management systems and to deploy the environmental policy in our group.
· ISO 14001: 2004 certified companies will begin to adapt their management systems to be certified
according to the new ISO 14001: 2015 before September 2018.
· Quarterly high-level environmental indicators will be implemented, compulsory for all Group companies;
these indicators will be used to carry out regular monitoring and faster detection of potential problems and the allocation of the necessary resources to solve them.
· Fluidra's responsibility towards the environment leads the group to adopt commitments to work towards
its protection: to strive to use natural resources responsibly and to minimise the environmental impact of its activities and the negative effect of its products throughout their entire life cycle. This includes maximising energy efficiency in operations as part of the overall climate change objectives, as well as using sustainable material and green chemistry, where feasible, in research, development and manufacturing activities. These commitments extend to employees, who must help to minimise the environmental impact in their daily work, including applying the hierarchy of waste prevention measures (avoid, reduce, recycle and reuse all materials).

Examples of respectful habits and practices for employees
Energy efficiency
· Employees should always consider the most efficient use of energy and look for oppor-
tunities to reduce energy consumption in their workplace. This includes turning off lights and laboratory or office equipment when not in use.
· Quality and facility managers should consider the most efficient use of energy within
acceptable ranges of regulatory or compliance standards.
· Review projects for energy efficiency and renewable energy use. Give priority to inves-
tment projects for the improvement of energy efficiency, which are amortised over their lifetime.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
· Minimise travel, wherever possible, and choose video or teleconferencing options,
where available and provided they are acceptable to the business.
· The sales team must choose cars that have better fuel efficiency and drive them safely
and ecologically to save fuel and minimise CO2 emissions.
· Reducing our emissions and optimising logistics of shipments in order to minimise the
environmental impact of our activities, products or services.
Waste recycling and reduction
· Avoid producing waste and using recycling options, provided that local recycling
systems are in place. Take the environment into account before printing working papers.
· Process developers must incorporate techniques to reduce and recycle materials.
· Production employees must look for opportunities to reduce the intermediates and
active ingredients in wastewater discharges.
Efficient water usage
· Always consider the best use of water and identify possibilities to reduce its use in the
workplace.
· Using water sustainably, making responsible use of water within our facilities by preven-
ting leaks and optimising reuse processes. Immediate repair of leaks should they occur.

Tax contribution and commitment

"Fluidra's contribution to the societies in which it is present is implemented, among other things, through the responsible payment of its taxes"

Fiscal commitment

Andrés Botella
Head of Tax, Legal and Compliance

Fluidra permanently upholds its commitment to good governance, transparency and integrity, which, together with the creation of value for shareholders and investors, are part of its management and business ethos. Compliance with the current tax legislation at any time and place is one of the principles underlying the corporate responsibility of the Fluidra group.
Fluidra has defined a tax strategy that includes, among its objectives, compliance with current tax legislation, adopting a reasonable interpretation of it in accordance with administrative doctrine and case law, and taking as a basis the principles of transparency, mutual trust, good faith and loyalty. Likewise, the company's objectives are: not to use artificial structures outside the company's own activity for the sole purpose of reducing the tax burden, not to operate in jurisdictions considered tax havens for purposes other than the normal development of Fluidra's business operations and not to carry out transactions between controlled entities that aim to erode tax bases and artificially transfer profits to low-tax territories.
The company keeps the Board of Directors regularly apprised of the tax policies applied.

Tax contributions

[G4-EC1]

Fluidra's business activity generates wealth in the areas where it has a presence, both through its own impact on local economies and tax contributions. Fluidra is aware of the importance of its contributions to the local economy and therefore maintains a strict policy in terms of tax contributions in the countries where it operates.
Fluidra's tax contributions in 2017 amounted to EUR 44.4 million in direct taxes. That amount includes the expense for corporate income tax accrued in 2016 and the payment of employer social security contributions.

The breakdown of the overall amount by geographic area shows that Fluidra contributed 62.5% of the total direct tax contribution in Spain, 19.5% in France, 3.5% in Holland, 3.3% in Italy, 3.2% in Austria, 2.4% in the UK, 2.1% in Australia, 1.2% in Portugal, 0.9% in the United States, 0.6% in Belgium, 0.5% in Israel and 0.2% in South Africa. Fluidra pays these taxes directly to the public bodies of the aforementioned countries.
The business activity that Fluidra carries out in these regions generates significant revenue for the countries'treasury. The total indirect taxes channelled by Fluidra for the different tax authorities in 2017 amounted to EUR 59.2 million.

Fundació Fluidra
"Our project in Senegal reminds us all of the importance of taking care of water to ensure our lives. For the Fluidra Foundation, giving the most vulnerable people on the planet access to water is a priority"

Joan Planes
President of Fluidra Foundation

The Fluidra Foundation was created in 2016 to better focus corporate social responsibility initiatives and achieve greater impact. Chaired by Joan Planes, Fluidra's founder and honorary president, this institution selects and optimises the aid and sponsorships in which the group participates, as well as promoting its own actions in line with its commitments:
· Social commitment: projects aimed at accessibility, awareness and
education on water use.
· Cultural commitment: to disseminate music as a tool for personal
growth and to promote personal dignity.
The Fluidra Foundation supports projects related to water access for disadvantaged groups and promotes culture, specifically music. In 2017 this effort materialised in the presentation of the KAG-25 project.
This initiative was developed together with the Association of Solidarity Education and the P.A. Schools in West Africa to rehabilitate a 25-hectare farm in southern Senegal and turn it into a profitable horticultural farm. The project will last four years, and in that time the Foundation will help to improve the infrastructure of the Karang Agricultural School by installing sustainable irrigation and power generation systems. This initiative was presented as part of the Fluidra Foundation's Corporate Concert, held in October at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.

Fluidra Accelera

Xavi Servat
Director of Fluidra Accelera

"With our business acceleration initiative, we are contributing to boosting innovation and renewing the business fabric in our environment"

It is a tool through which Fluidra invests in innovation on sustainable solutions in the use of water, presenting the selected projects to other co-investors, and contributing with its experience in the development of products, markets and sales channels.

Fetures 1 ) It's industrial: We accelerate industrialization projects, where we bring our best experience.
2 ) It is intensive: Both in the strategy or initial planning, as in the subsequent monitoring until its success in the markets.
3 ) It is limited: To a certain selection of projects at once (10 max). Three (3) new projects every year on a recurring basis.
4 ) It is extensive: For the important involvement of own mentors with many years of proven experience, and oriented to try to achieve
success.
Mission Introduce innovation outside the water sector and its sustainable use, complementing the efforts and achievements of the R & D department. We understand that innovation facilitates us
to operate with an added value product.

Way Investment in cash () and in the contribution of own acceleration services, such as strategy, industrialization, internationalization, as well as close financial management. We understand that industrial investment implies a lower risk compared to other sectors and a longer maturing period.
Participation Fluidra Accelera initially invests as a minority partner, seeking other co-investors to participate in the capital together with entrepreneurs. The percentage of shareholder participation that takes ranges between 15 and 20% after round of investment.
Lifespan The acceleration of an industrial process requires longer periods than other sectors. The acceleration process itself oscillates between 9 months and one year. The period of permanence as an accelerator is up to 5 years.

[G4-6, G4-22, G4-23, G4-28, G4-29, G4-30, G4-48]

Expanded coverage of the production centers of USA, the Netherlands, Israel and South Africa

This annual report covers the business activity of Fluidra in 2017 and has been drafted and structured according to the IR framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). For reporting on non-financial aspects, the drafting guide of the Sustainability Report Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) version 4 has been followed, in line with the Exhaustive criteria.
Following the GRI principles in determining quality, this report presents balanced and transparent information, although comparability with previous reports is affected by the incorporation of new companies in the coverage of information which may, in some cases, distort such comparability.
Fluidra's materiality matrix was determined in the previous year's report (2016), and in this year its composition and content were unchanged. [G4-48]
Fluidra is responsible for the reliability of the data reported by external and independent verification, and makes available to stakeholders contact details in order to answer any questions and requests for information.
In line with the plan, this report extends the previous GRI coverage by adding production sites in the United States, Holland, Israel and South Africa. Although financial data are consolidated for the entire group, non-financial information, in many respects, corresponds to the consolidation of companies covered in the report, in fact it covers companies which together make up 79% of the group's consolidated revenue. Notably, increasing coverage and the fact that Aplicaciones Técnicas del Agua (ATH) is not covered, directly affects the comparability of the report compared to data from previous years. In these circumstances, some aspects, such as tax contribution data, workforce data and environmental indicators, have been reformulated to maintain consistency and comparability.
The following table identifies all companies consolidated in the financial statements, Non-financial data consolidation companies (human resources, environment...) are marked with a yes in the coverage column of the table. [G4-22, G4-23]

Materiality study

[G4-18, G4-19, G4-20, G4-21]

Fluidra's materiality study was carried out in depth in 2016, and the same structure and analysis was maintained for 2017. The process consisted of a round of random surveys to shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and associations in the social field: a total of 500 were sent with a response rate of 28%. From the score of those issues that the stakeholders identified as highly relevant, along with the corporate valuation of the material aspects for the Fluidra Group, a threshold of 50 points was established to determine the material aspects reflected in the Materiality Table next to the score matrix of the issues analysed.

· Companies in the plastics sector · Companies in the chemical sector · Companies in the metals sector · Companies in the glass sector · Product and technology assembly companies · Commercial companies

· Transport logistics companies

Fluidra is a multinational business group integrated both vertically and horizontally, a key feature which adds complexity when defining the materiality of the group. From the perspective of vertical integration, we define groups of companies based on:
· Production companies, whose aim is the manufacture of
finished products from raw materials.

· Management services companies
All this means that Fluidra's materiality must be approached from an integral and heuristic point of view.
Based on the data collected from stakeholders in the latest study (2016), Fluidra's materiality matrix is shown in the following graph.

· Commercial and logistic companies, which specialise
in distribution and placing the finished product on the
market.

· Service and management companies, which support
Group companies and, in some cases, other companies
outside the scope of Fluidra.

If the perspective is changed to horizontal integration, Fluidra's companies are defined according to their sector of activity:
