Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Ladies and Gentlemen,
In 2018, the Polish economy confirmed its growing role in Europe ­ with GDP up by more than 5%, we were one of the fastest-developing economies in the European Union. Nevertheless, last year was certainly a difficult period for businesses operating in the gas and oil sectors. The prices of raw materials remained high for most of the year, which undoubtedly benefitted upstream companies, such as the PGNiG Group. However, we should also take into account the multitude of factors which, from the perspective of management tasks, proved to be a major challenge. I am referring here to fluctuations in commodity prices, the progressing decoupling of gas prices from oil prices, a rapid expansion of the LNG market, and important decisions concerning the energy sector, made both at the national level (including adoption of the National Energy and Climate Plan for 2021­2030) and on the international arena.

Given these developments, the PGNiG Management Board once again proved extremely effective, as confirmed not only by the record high profit delivered in 2018, but also by a number of key initiatives supporting the PGNiG Group Strategy for 2017­2022 (extended until 2026), approved in March 2017.
Effective supervision over the progress in the strategy implementation was also among the priorities of the PGNiG Supervisory Board in 2018. Last year, the PGNiG Management Board made a number of crucial decisions to diversify gas supply sources, including the execution of long-term contracts for LNG imports from American partners, or the acquisition of the Tommeliten Alpha licence on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The effects of initiatives geared towards increasing Poland's energy security and improving the PGNiG Group's terms of trade will be felt in the coming years and appreciated by our stakeholders.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

As Chairman of the PGNiG Supervisory Board I am proud that for the third consecutive time PGNiG secured a top spot in the `Transparent Company of the Year' competition organised by the Institute of Accountancy and Taxes and the Gazeta Gieldy Parkiet daily.
The Supervisory Board's activities are strongly focused on the information policy and corporate governance ­ each Member of the Supervisory Board knows that these are fundamental issues for every company which is mature and open to dialogue. Fulfilment of disclosure requirements has long ceased to be a mere regulatory burden for us. On the contrary, we perceive it as a great opportunity for the Group's development, for example because it strengthens our image as a trusted trading partner and increases security, making us better placed to successfully compete on the challenging commodity market. I would like to assure you that maintaining a high degree of transparency and compliance with regulations will remain a top priority for

the PGNiG Supervisory Board in 2019. Without doing so, it would be hardly possible for the Company to expand its operations in any business segment in the long term.
The beginning of 2019 and the lack of macroeconomic stability seen on the gas and oil markets show that the PGNiG Management Board and the Group employees have a period of hard work ahead. Further improvement of processes will not only enable delivery of sound operating and financial performance in the short term, but will also make it possible to remain optimistic about the Company's development in 5, 10, or 15 years' time. On behalf of the PGNiG Supervisory Board, I can say that we are ready for that. We will continue to support all promising solutions which, when materialised, may increase the PGNiG Group's value and improve Poland's energy security.
Respectfully yours,
Bartlomiej Nowak Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Letter from the President of the Management Board

Dear Shareholders, Customers and Trading Partners,
We invite you to read the Report of the PGNiG Group for 2018.
It covers a period during which we worked hard to deliver on our Strategy, which defines our objectives and ambitions for 2017-2022. We take pride in the Group's accomplishments in 2018, in particular in its success in increasing hydrocarbon reserves and diversifying natural gas supplies to Poland.
In 2018, the PGNiG Group's EBITDA rose 8% year on year. We also recorded the highest revenue in our history, amounting to more than PLN 41bn. In terms of market capitalisation, at the end of 2018 PGNiG was the third largest company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
High oil and gas prices during most of 2018 helped us deliver strong EBITDA in the Upstream segment, while high costs of gas imports led to an EBITDA loss in the Trading segment. What is important, despite a more than 7% reduction in the Distribution Tariff

rates, performance of the Distribution segment remained solid.
In the Generation segment, high electricity prices helped offset rising coal prices and slightly increased tariff rates for sales and distribution of heat.
In the second half of 2018, we signed contracts with leading US LNG suppliers, thereby securing annual natural gas deliveries of at least 10 bcm (regasified) after 2022.
As a result, we effected a long-awaited change in the Group's gas imports structure. This was a major milestone for our business ­ not only have we considerably improved pricing terms for gas imports, but we are also becoming a major player on the internal market for LNG, which many experts believe will predominate in global natural gas trading in the future.
In 2018, the Exploration and Production segment was particularly successful in keeping domestic output levels unchanged, largely on

10

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

the back of increased production from existing fields and revitalisation of old wells, e.g. in the Przemyl field. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, we acquired a significant interest in the Tommeliten Alpha field from Equinor Energy AS, thus completing another M&A objective set in the Group's strategy. According to our estimates, at peak production the field will add more than 0.5 bcm to our natural gas production volumes. The newly acquired asset is of key importance, especially in the context of the Group's diversification strategy, which is largely based on the Baltic Pipe pipeline, to be completed in 2022.
A noteworthy accomplishment of the Distribution segment was the increased pace of connecting new customers. In October 2018, we announced a programme of gas network roll-out to new areas in Poland, whose target is to ensure that by 2022 approximately 90% of the country have access to the national gas grid. The project was launched in late 2018.
In 2018, we completed and handed over a new multi-fuel unit at the Zofiówka CHP plant, thus consolidating our position on the heat and electricity market in Upper Silesia. We are also continuing work to construct a new CCGT unit at the era CHP plant. We are satisfied with the progress made on large infrastructure projects, which have a direct bearing on the Group's ability to attain its strategic objectives in the power sector.
As part of our CSR efforts, we are promoting natural gas as an environment-friendly fuel.

We engage in activities to combat smog ­ we are aware that air pollution in Poland is primarily caused by `low emissions' or flue gas generated mainly from out-of-date coal-fired boilers, which is why we offer our customers an opportunity to replace their old systems for modern gas boilers. We also work with local governments, encouraging them to rely on gas-powered buses for public transport. Our activities in this area are prompting more and more municipalities to switch to environment-friendly and cost-effective vehicles.
In line with our Strategy, in 2019 we will focus on measures to diversify gas supply sources and increase our reserves both in Poland and abroad. We also intend to ramp up our activities in new markets, including the UAE, where in December 2018 we acquired a hydrocarbon exploration, appraisal and production licence. We do not give up on innovative R&D projects. Our goal is large-scale implementation of revolutionary projects, such as Geo-Metan, which not only improve the safety of miners and help reduce methane emissions but also contribute to growth of our gas output in Poland.
To conclude, I would like to extend my thanks to the Management Board and Supervisory Board of PGNiG as well as our entire team for their trust and hard work in 2018.
Kind regards,
Piotr Woniak President of the PGNiG Management Board

The largest equity interests in PGNiG were held by funds managing the largest portfolios of future pensions, including Nationale-Nederlanden (NN), Aviva and PZU Zlota Jesie. The share of open-end pension funds in the PGNiG shareholder base rose 6.3pp from the IPO, when it accounted for 3.5% of the share capital (valued at PLN 711m). Pension funds are typically long-term investors whose equity portfo-

lios are characterised by low turnover, especially with respect to large dividend-paying companies. They have a stabilising effect on the Company's shareholding structure, while limiting its free float, which can translate into lower trading volumes. In the case of PGNiG shares, the daily trading volume averaged PLN 24.2m in 2018 (2017: PLN 21.7m).

In 2018, PGNiG shares outperformed the main indices of the WSE. The annual rate of return on the Company shares for the year, excluding dividends, was positive, at 10%. Over that time, the broad market index WIG and the blue-chip index WIG20, which includes PGNiG, yielded negative rates of return of -9% and -7%, respectively. The PGNiG share price movements ranged between -13% (the lowest closing price of PLN 5.32 on July 20th 2018) and +14% (the highest closing price of PLN 7.00 on December 7th 2018) from the 2018 average closing price (PLN 6.12). To compare, fluctuations of the WIG20 index ranged between -9% (the lowest value of 2,082.77 points on October 26th 2018) and +15% (the highest value of 2,630.37 points on January 23rd 2018).

Material market variables, analysed on an ongoing basis by investors in PGNiG shares, include market prices of crude oil and natural gas, which are produced and traded by the Group. · In the first quarter of 2018, the price of
a month ahead contract for Brent crude rose from USD 66.57/bbl on January 2nd to USD 70.27/bbl on March 29th. The trend continued over the next two quarters to peak on October 3rd, when the price of Brent crude reached USD 86.29/bbl. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the price of Brent crude fell sharply, until it reached its annual low of USD 50.47/bbl on December 24th; · The price of gas on the PPX was on an upward trend for the first three quar-

16

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

ters of 2018, when the spot price rose from PLN 80.80/MWh on January 1st to PLN 120.99 on September 30th 2018. At the end of February and beginning of March, the price of gas on the PPX skyrocketed for a short time to over PLN 200/MWh. In the fourth quarter of the year, the trend reversed and the price of gas on the PPX fell from PLN 115.69/ MWh on October 1st to PLN 92.42/MWh on December 31st. In the first quarter of 2018, the price of PGNiG shares followed the movements of WIG20. In that period, the PGNiG shares and WIG20 delivered identical rates of return of -10%. Corporate and market developments of significance for stock exchange investors buying and selling PGNiG shares over that time included the President of URE's decision of January 25th to reduce the prices and rates of network fees under the Distribution Tariff, and conclusion of transmission contracts between PGNiG and the gas transmission system operators in Poland and Denmark, i.e. GAZ-SYSTEM and Energinet, on January 19th and January 29th, respectively, as part of the 2017 Open Season procedure of the Baltic Pipe project. In the second quarter, the PGNiG shares slightly outperformed WIG20. Their rate of return was positive at +1% in the period, while WIG20 yielded a negative rate of return of -3% at the quarter end. On May 28th, the PGNiG Management Board recommended to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of PLN 0.15 per share, i.e. PLN 0.05 below the consensus, be paid to the shareholders. A month later, on June 26th, PGNiG entered into preliminary long-term contracts with Port Arthur LNG, LLC and Venture Global LNG, Inc. for the purchase of liquefied natural gas from the US. On June 30th, the Arbitration Institute in Stockholm issued a partial award favourable to PGNiG in the arbitration proceedings against PAO

Gazprom and OOO Gazprom Export concerning the price of gas under the Yamal contract.
The beginning of the third quarter 2018 saw a strong weakening of the PGNiG stock price relative to WIG20, but the Company made up lost ground in September 2018. Eventually, the rate of return on PGNiG shares in the third quarter was higher than that of WIG20 (13% vs 7%). The key event for the share price in the period was the announcement by PGNiG on July 20th of the Annual General Meeting's decision not to pay dividend from the 2017 net profit. Other events key for PGNiG in the third quarter included the decision of the President of URE of July 26th 2018 to increase the gas fuel price under the Retail Tariff, and the PGNiG Management Board's request to the Extraordinary General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association so as to enable the Company to pay interim dividend for 2018.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the PGNiG stock yielded a rate of return of 7%, markedly outperforming the WIG20 index, which came in at -0.4%. In early December, the Company stock price hit an all-time high. On December 7th, the shares were priced at PLN 7.0 the highest level recorded during the Company's more than 13 years on the WSE. The price hikes took place around the time when the Deutsche Boerse Group announced, on December 4th, that the Company would be included in the Stoxx 600 index as of December 24th. Other events of key importance to PGNiG in the fourth quarter included the announcement of the execution of final long-term LNG supply contracts with Venture Global LNG, Inc. and Port Arthur LNG, LLC on October 16th and December 19th, respectively, as well as the purchase of the Tommeliten Alpha field and hydrocarbon exploration, appraisal and production rights in Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates. More than a month

earlier, on October 29th, the PGNiG Management Board decided to pay interim dividend of PLN 0.07 per share from the profit earned in 2018. The dividend was paid on December 3rd 2018.
On December 28th 2018 (the last trading day in the year), the PGNiG stock price closed at PLN 6.91. The price was nearly 132% above the issue price of 2005 and

81% above the closing price on the first day of listing. Factoring in the dividends of PLN 1.73 per share paid in 2005­2018, investors who acquired PGNiG shares at the closing price on the first listing date and held them until the end of 2018 saw a profit of 127%.

The website features current and periodic reports, information on the Group's strategy, PGNiG's investor presentations, with a brief and accessible summary of the PGNiG Group's operations, as well

as the telephone and email contact details of the PGNiG Investor Relations Division. Investors

Wholesale trade

In pursuit of its strategic objective to increase gas sales volumes, in 2018 PGNiG entered into a number of contracts to sell gas to customers in Poland, and extended its cooperation with strategic customers it already had. The Company also signed contracts with new customers from the steel and metallurgy industry, including CMC Poland Sp. z o.o. and continued to export gas to Ukrainian market.
In 2018, the largest amounts of gas in Poland were sold to industrial customers. The largest Polish customers in this category include Grupa Azoty SA and its subsidiaries, PKN Orlen SA and its subsidiaries, Grupa Lotos SA, Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA, Arcelor Mittal Poland SA, and KGHM Polska Mied SA.
In 2018, sales on the Polish Power Exchange (PPX) accounted for the largest portion (30%) of the PGNiG Group's total gas sales. The volume of gas sold by PGNiG on the PPX in 2018 increased by approximately 0.8 TWh year on year.
Business-to-business sales policy In the B2B market in 2018, PGNiG OD continued its strategy to expand the gas fuel portfolio and improve its margin management. PGNiG OD is a gas supplier with the most extensive portfolio of gaseous fuels, tailored to the

diverse needs of individual segments of business customers. To the customers interested in the fixed price guarantee (for the duration of the contract), the following mass products were offered: Low Price All the Time, Flexible Price, Constant Savings for Business, Business Online and Certain Price. Larger customers had the ability to flexibly determine contract terms (payment terms, delivery periods) in the fixed price formula (based on individual valuation) or by tying their price with gas prices at the Polish Power Exchange (indexed product, tranche product or a mix of the two).
Sales of LNG and CNG
In the area of LNG, PGNiG OD focuses on industrial customers whose energy demand cannot be met due to gas infrastructure constraints in terms of physical availability and capacity limits. PGNiG OD provides bunkering services as a separate business segment, supplying LNG to power marine vessels. The key customers of the CNG segment are public transport companies (ca. 70% of all customers), which rolled out their fleets of CNG buses when excise duty was suspended and CNG transport became economically viable. The remaining share comprises customers

25

in the utility vehicle market (ca. 15%) and retail customers (ca. 15%).
PGNiG's offer for individual clients
In 2018, the company launched a number of promotional campaigns, which stimulated customers' interest in its offering and increased added value for customers. Some of the campaigns were: · `Automatic Promotion' ­ as a means to
mitigate the competition, for the BW1-BW4 tariff groups an automatic promotion was introduced, which temporarily reduced the selling price (for the first quarter of 2018) without the need for customers to sign any documents; · `Low Price All the Time, 2nd and 3rd Edition' ­ ensuring protection against fluctuations in gas prices; · `Subsidy of up to PLN 3,000' (1st and 2nd edition), offering financial support to consumers who plan to switch from solid fuel to gas fuel in their heating systems; · `Gazek ­ Keeping Your Home Safe', in which insurance products (insurance of home appliances and consumer electronics as well as assistance insurance) were added to the offering; · `Switch to Gas', where PGNiG joined forces with local authorities to actively reduce smog by offering people easier access to environmentally-friendly gas fuel; · `PGNiG Debt of Gratitude' (including the edition dedicated to miners who went on strike at the Wujek mine) ­ helping PGNiG OD customers with the Warsaw Uprising or Wujek Mine Defender veteran status to pay for gas. Thanks to the scheme, around 145 thousand new accounts in tariff groups 1­4 were added to the retail customer base in 2018.

Customer satisfaction
The companies providing services to retail customers at the PGNiG Group, including PGNiG OD and PSG, constantly improve the quality of service and develop online sales channels and modern tools of communication with customers via websites prepared in a mobile version and adapted to the needs of the disabled and elderly.
At the same time, efforts are made to increase customer awareness on the energy market in the context of market liberalisation and fair competition. Handbooks explaining the matters have been prepared and `Informed Customer' campaigns are under way. The campaigns are targeted at natural gas and electricity consumers, as a response to signals about some traders' activities that have certain characteristics of unfair competition. The aim is to warn PGNiG's customers against dishonest competitor vendors who want to pass for PGNiG employees, and to educate customers about their consumer rights.
In addition, on September 19th 2018, PSG and the PGNiG Foundation launched a nationwide educational campaign under the slogan `Natural gas - reliable and safe'. Its main objective is to disseminate knowledge about natural gas and to raise awareness of how to use gas-fuelled appliances at home responsibly.
On top of the activities discussed above, it also important to mention the implementation of the MIGAM sign language system at the PGNiG Customer Service Offices. The MIGAM system enables the hearing impaired to establish a video connection with a sign language interpreter from a web browser, a mobile application or any other device that has a camera.
Committed to supporting Group-wide efforts to tackle the problem of air pollution (smog) affecting local communities in Poland, PGNiG OD has launched a sales programme entitled `Subsidised Furnace Replacement'.

* Data for 2016 as restated in line with the reclassification of the PGNiG Group's activities in 2017, when some of the employees were transferred from the Trade and Storage segment to the Other Activities segment.

As at December 31st 2018, the PGNiG Group employed 24,763 staff, 69 (0.3%) more than as at December 31st 2017.
In the Exploration and Production segment, a drop in employment was recorded. Relative to December 31st 2017, the number of employees fell by 151 (or 2%), which was mainly attributable to 109 headcount

reduction at Geofizyka Toru (11% of its total headcount) following completion of certain operations that required contingent staffing, a standard practice at the company due to the nature of its business. Relative to December 31st 2017, headcount at the Distribution Segment went up by 428 (or 4%). The increase in employ-

28

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

ment resulted mainly from the acquisition of a spun-off business of PGNiG Technologie SA by Polsk Spólk Gazownictwa Sp. z o.o. As part of the merger, PSG established a new Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Branch in Krosno, which hired 278 former PGNiG Technologie employees. The remaining increase was a consequence of defining new business needs and investment processes at PSG, as well as implementing an age management policy that ensures optimal age of staff and an appropriately high level of qualifications.
Relative to December 31st 2017, the number of employees in the Other Activities segment decreased by 326 (or 18%) due to a number of changes in individual companies of the segment. Key developments affecting the segment's headcount include: · 302 headcount reduction at PGNiG Tech-
nologie (56% of its total headcount), chiefly due to the completion of the `Krosno Technology' project in 2018. As

part of the project, a section of the company's business was spun off and transferred to PSG together with 278 staff in compliance with Art. 231 of the Polish Labour Code. Furthermore, as part of the `New Records' project, PGNiG Serwis took over 11 employees; · workforce restructuring at Geovita SA, as a result of which 42 employees (or 18%) were made redundant. The reduction in headcount was achieved primarily through the expiry of fixed-term contracts; · recruitment of 48 new personnel by PGNiG Serwis (20% of its total headcount) mainly to keep up with the development of its services, in particular security services, and meet the requirements of the `New Records' project, carried out in partnership with PGNiG Technologie; · transfer by the PGNIG Head Office of 27 employees from field ICT units to PGNiG OD, the Trade and Storage segment.

The amount of an MBO bonus depends on the quality and progress in the achievement of allocated objectives; · Discretionary periodic bonus, which covers the remaining employees and is granted on a quarterly basis, based on discretionary assessment of an employee's performance by their superior; · Discretionary task bonus, earmarked for employees excelling in their work for the Company (a special account placed at the disposal of the PGNiG Management Board); · Discretionary project bonus, earmarked for employees who have been involved in the execution of project work; the bonus amount depends on the quality and progress in the execution of specific projects.

33

An element supporting the incentive scheme is also the miner's titles and industry badges as well as related financial rewards given on the

occasion of the Miners' Day. The titles and badges are awarded for long service as well as for special merits and achievements at work.

Employee Pension Plan
Each employee, who has continuously worked for the Company for at least three months, may voluntarily join The Employee Pension Plan. Basic contributions amounting to 7% of employee's gross remuneration are financed by the employer.

Employee development
As the PGNiG Group's subsidiaries are engaged in a wide range of business activities, it is up to each of them to determine the type and extent of their staff training. The training management system in place is a vital tool in developing the competencies of our human resources. Our employees are given opportunities to improve their professional qualifications through a range of postgra-

duate university programmes, industry conferences, seminars and symposia, and also through occupational training.
Depending on their respective responsibilities and individual needs, employees can participate in a variety of training courses covering all aspects of a modern business, including risk management, legal environment analysis and customer service.

Occupational health and safety
The PGNiG Group companies manage the areas of quality, environmental protection as well as occupational health and safety on the basis of the Group-wide QHSE. The QHSE Policy defines the goals and directions of the Group companies' activities in those areas and embodies their commitment to ensuring that products and services satisfy relevant quality requirements, building positive relations with customers, operating in compliance with applicable laws, and continuously enhancing the effectiveness of the quality, environmental protection, and OHS management systems. It is also the Company's commitment to take pro-active measures to prevent injuries and occupational diseases as well as environmental damage.
The PGNiG Group performs its tasks on a systemic basis, in accordance with the best standards defined in the international ISO 9001:2015,14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 standards, taking account of good industry practice.
All employees have access to OHS training and extensive medical care. Each

employee has been instructed about the occupational risk level at their workplace. The training courses are conducted regularly, their frequency depending on the job and related risks. Increasing the level of safety is also the subject of annual meetings organised by the Company's Head Office, devoted to OHS conditions and experience sharing, and attended by representatives of external bodies, such as the National Labour Inspectorate.
PGNiG builds a safe work culture among employees, which translates into their appropriate behaviour, attitudes and actions. Measures are undertaken aimed at continuous improvement of safety of all persons staying on the Company's premises, including visitors.
Work safety metrics Safety-related activities are monitored continuously by way of: · proactive monitoring, which consists in
monitoring the effective implementation of procedures and measures designed to eliminate or minimise risks,

36

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

defined at the planning phase. Its purpose is to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures; · reactive monitoring, which provides information on loss events (accidents, failures and occupational diseases) and facilitates drawing appropriate conclusions and improving OHS management. It is a post-event preventive measure, designed to eliminate similar loss events in the future. All accidents, events and conditions which are related to the Group's operations and which result in a loss or could potentially result in a loss are required to be reported. This applies to the operations of both the PGNiG branches and the PGNiG Group companies, as well as contractors and suppliers carrying out work for the PGNiG Group.

Number of accidents at work at the PGNiG Group In the PGNiG Group, the number of accidents at work fell by 3.4% in relation to 2017. The number of persons who were injured in accidents at work decreased by 0.5%. The following tables present detailed information on the accidents that occurred at the PGNiG Group and other OHS issues.

For more on PGNiG Group Sustainable Development Strategy for 2017­ 2022 see p. 65.

In PGNiG, we believe that long-term business relations and market success require operations that create value for the Company, the Group and all of its stakeholders.
Social Communication and investment dialogue
Local communities are an important stakeholder for us. As part of our strategic approach to managing relations with this group of stakeholders, we respond to the real needs and expectations of individual communities, and we support their economic growth.
Effective cooperation with social and business partners based on the principles of partnership and dialogue is one of the foundations of Sustainable development strategy and Group's social responsibility. The strategic goal is to conduct a dialogue with local communities in accordance with the best standards developed in the industry and within the PGNiG Group.
Good neighbor PGNiG makes every effort to identify a given community's current needs and expectations. Before launching operations in a location, we meet with the local authorities to explain the purpose and scope of works related to the planned investment. We have a highly customized approach to every community ­ depending on the place of conducting works or negotiations, we set the action plan in consultation with local authorities. In our

communication, we rely on social dialogue as a way of communication that allows our stakeholders to understand our activities. PGNiG builds good neighborly relations also through sponsoring activities in the place of conducting works.
Our employees are a very important part of local communities where they play the role of PGNiG's informal ambassadors. It is their direct contacts and involvement in local initiatives, membership in the employee councils and trade unions has a direct impact on our image and contributes to the development of a given community.
Social activity
PGNiG Ignacy Lukasiewicz Foundation The Group conducts its charity activities mainly through the PGNiG Ignacy Lukasiewicz Foundation. The Foundation's principal mission is to support projects designed to preserve and develop national heritage and culture, as well as promote knowledge and education in the field of fundamental/technical sciences and sports. The Foundation also seeks to promote the history of Poland, build national identity and commemorate Polish heroes.
The Foundation's activity is based on cooperation with programme partners and implementation of its own projects, which helps it reach those who most need support, irrespective of where they are in Poland.

40

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

In 2018, the PGNiG Foundation focused on three proprietary programmes: `To Be Like Ignacy', `We Warm Up Polish Hearts' and `Air without Rubbish'.
,,By jak Ignacy"(`To Be Like Ignacy') The programme promotes science among primary school pupils, giving them an opportunity to learn about the patron of the Ignacy Lukasiewicz Foundation and other distinguished Polish scientists. The main element of the programme is a website featuring an interactive comic strip and educational videos showing scientific experiments.

As part of the programme, the Foundation holds a competition called `Ignacy's School of Science'. As at the end of 2018, more than 1,250 schools from all over Poland enrolled in its third edition. The competition judges will select 16 schools (one from each province) which find the most interesting way to organise and document the work of a specially set up science club and prepare a project. To assist teachers in running such clubs, the Foundation prepared lesson plans for 0-3 and 4-6 forms. The number of schools participating in the project's previous edition was over 650.

A few facts about Ignacy Lukasiewicz

· He was the first to distill kerosene from crude oil and use it for lighting.
· Inventor of the kerosene lamp. · Creator of oil and refining industry. · Co-founder and longstanding director of the
first oil field in Bóbrka. · Independence activist, philanthropist, commu-
nity worker, creator of the concept of social care in oil industry. · Recipient of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, papal chamberlain, member of the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria.
41

,,Rozgrzewamy Polskie Serca" (`We Warm Up Polish Hearts') As part of the programme, the Foundation supports educational and film making projects, initiatives to aid war veterans, and a variety of cultural activities. The Foundation supports the memory of so-called Cursed Soldiers, heroes of the anti-communist underground. In March 2018, the first pilgrimage of Cursed Soldiers, initiated by the Foundation, arrived at the Jasna Góra Monastery.
The programme also features the `Debt of Gratitude' project run in association with PGNiG Obrót Detaliczny. In addition to Warsaw Uprising veterans, the project also supports miners who went on the historical strike at the Wujek coal mine. Polish heroes receive direct financial support of up to PLN 900 a year to pay their gas bills, which in many cases fully covers the charge.
In 2018, as part of the `We Warm Up Polish Hearts' project, support was also extended to the Foundation for Civic Space and Social Affairs in connection with its `Recovering Forgotten History' programme that has been run for many years with the aim of correcting the content of

historical books and publications issued around the world and devoted to the history of Poland and Central and Eastern Europe.
,,Powietrze bez mieci" (`Air without Rubbish') The Foundation joined in efforts to tackle the problem of smog in Poland and launched, at the end of 2017, together with the PGNiG companies, the `Air without Rubbish' educational programme. One arm of the programme was a campaign to raise Poles' awareness of smog through advertising, social media and a website. The other arm were two competitions carried out in 2018 ­ one where residents could vote to win a science playground for construction in their area, and the other, addressed to children from primary school forms 1 to 3, was where pupils could win equipment for a biology laboratory. Teachers conducted a series of lessons about smog and presented a special report based on these lessons. In 2018, over 170 municipalities and nearly 1,000 schools entered the programme.

42

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Other activities of the Foundation Another initiative of the Foundation was the establishment of an Educational Apiary - Energy from Honey. The project combines environmental protection with education, as educational workshops on bees and urban beekeeping are held there in spring and summer. The apiary, set up in 2017, currently numbers 24 hives.
A financial donation was made to the Ignacy Lukasiewicz Museum of Oil and Gas Industry Foundation in Bóbrka to support the museum's activities. Being one of its main sponsors, PGNiG supports the cradle of the oil industry - the oldest petroleum production site, as well as the heritage of the magnificent Polish inventor and philanthropist Ignacy Lukasiewicz.
Scholarships The `We Encourage Learning' scholarship programme was launched in 2009 by PGNiG TERMIKA SA to support the most talented third- and fourth-grade students of secondary schools. In 2018, the PGNiG Ignacy Lukasiewicz Foundation granted ten one-off scholarships: three for third-grade students of an energy technician class, four for fourth-grade stu-

dents of an energy technician class, and three for fourth-grade students of an electrical technician class.
The Foundation also funded scholarships for children of tragically deceased employees of the PGNiG Group. Currently, the number of the Foundation's scholarship holders is 13.
Other CSR activities Other projects carried out in 2018 in pursuit of the Sustainable development strategy included: · Health Day ­ the second edition of a pro-
gramme of preventive medical examinations for employees of the PGNiG Head Office, including free cardiology and cancer tests and anti-stress workshops. In 2018, the campaign covered 300 people; · A Drop of Energy ­ in 2018, the PGNiG Head Office held two blood donation sessions, and in autumn the Company participated in the national blood donation session of the energy industry `A Drop of Energy for Independent Poland'. Moreover, blood donation sessions for employees were also organised by the PGNiG Branches in Zielona Góra and

43

Sanok, along with other Group companies; · `Oil Miner in School and Kindergarten'
­ a volunteer educational project in which employees of the PGNiG Zielona Góra Branch and PGNiG Geology and Hydrocarbon Production Branch are involved. The aim is to promote the profession of an oil miner through structured presentations in schools and kindergartens during dedicated events or St. Barbara's Day, the patron saint of miners, falling on December 4th. In 2018, over 160 volunteer miners visited 243 schools and kindergartens, having met with more than 18 thousand children.
Gas Industry Museum The Gas Industry Museum in Warsaw, located on the premises of the Wola Gas Works, which today houses the headquarters of PGNiG, is one of the most prominent examples of industrial architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2018, the museum was visited by nearly four thousand people, including more than 30 school groups taking part in museums classes, 20 groups of children and teenagers under the Summer and Winter in the City programme, and more than 20 organised groups of adults (including senior students of the University of the Third Age and tourist groups). The museum also participated in the Long Night of Museums, attracting more than 900 people to its historical space during a single evening.
In addition, in 2018, conceptual work was initiated on the modernization of the Museum to open it to a wider group of visitors and to present exhibits and topics related to ,,Gasworks in Wola" or the history of PGNiG and the gas industry in a modern manner, in accordance with the latest museum and exhibition trends.
RESPECT Index In 2018, PGNiG passed its twelfth successful assessment for inclusion in the index of socially responsible companies. Since the very inception of RESPECT Index, PGNiG has been a member of this elite group of socially responsible compa-

nies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Eessential condition for inclusion in the
index is social responsibility towards the environment, local communities and employees, which is assessed through a survey reviewed by Deloitte, the project auditor.
Social capital in numbers In 2018, over 75 thousand primary and secondary school students and more than 500 university students were direct recipients or beneficiaries of CSR projects run by the PGNiG Ignacy Lukasiewicz Foundation and other PGNiG Group entities (including, in particular, PGNiG, PGNiG OD, TERMIKA and PSG). In 2018, the PGNiG Group companies and the PGNiG Foundation provided support to over 400 initiatives and events, compared with over 300 in 2017.
Sponsorship
For many years, PGNiG has been involved in sponsorship activities leading to the development of social capital, with sport, culture and education as the three focal areas of the Group's sponsorship activity. In 2018, particular importance was also attached to the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Poland's independence.
Sports sponsorship Sports sponsorship of is an important part of PGNiG's marketing efforts. For many years, the organisation's comprehensive support has focused on one professional sports discipline ­ handball, which is based on strategic thinking, unlocking the players' potential and dynamic action, which perfectly reflects the Company's nature.
In 2018, PGNiG supported the following initiatives: · The Polish Handball Association ­ PGNiG has
been the strategic sponsor of Polish handball since 2010. Currently, support is provided to senior and junior national women's and men's teams. In addition, celebrations of

44

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Environment

The PGNiG Group strives to minimise its negative environmental footprint and adopts pro-environmental measures in its key business areas.
Environmental management system at the PGNiG Group
PGNiG's environmental management is carried out as part of the integrated Quality, Environment and OHS Management (QHSE) System, implemented in 2016 along with the QHSE Policy applied consistently across the Group.
In the document, the Company's Management Board declared that all operations would be carried out with due consideration to meeting the quality requirements for our products and services, fostering good customer relations, mitigating our environmental impacts, and preventing injuries and occupational diseases.
The QHSE Management System is based on international ISO standards: 9001:2015, 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007, taking into account good HSE practices applying to exploration for and production and tankless storage of hydrocarbons, as well as to the processing and transmission of natural gas, which makes the system highly effective.
One of the key requirements set out in ISO 14001 is to identify any emissions to the environment, referred to as environmental aspects.

A special system is applied to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions from the EU ETS-covered installations. Emissions are monitored based on the adopted monitoring plans, which are subject to approval under CO2 emission allowance decisions.
Land restoration and surveying of non-productive assets
In 2018, a procedure was carried out to update the assessment of the condition of the surface on the properties classified as non-production assets, and tests were commenced in 24 locations.
On the properties located in Barlinek and Szprotawa, new tests were performed and the possibility of applying the biological method of remediation was evaluated. However, the type of soil and the hydrological conditions found on site made the effective application of that method impossible, and new options for the remediation process were identified.
Furthermore, the Company also monitored the soil and water environment of the reclaimed landfill site in Zabrze-Biskupice.
Well decommissioning
In 2018, wells were drilled and decommissioned in the following locations in Poland: Kotlin, Sonina and Chmielnik, all of them being exploration wells.

46

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

In addition, one test well in Goszczanów was also decommissioned. The wells were abandoned since no industrial hydrocarbon flow was obtained, or due to the purely exploratory nature of the work. In 2018, a decision was made to abandon 96 wells drilled in previous years in the in the Lubuskie, Wielkopolskie, Pomorskie, Malopolskie and Podkarpackie provinces.
Underground Gas Storage Facilities
In recent years, environmental monitoring was carried out in and around the Mogilno CGSF and Kosakowo CGSF. The aim was to identify possible impacts related to the discharge of salt brine into the Puck Bay in the case of the Kosakowo CGSF and operation of the onshore part of the facility in the case of the Kosakowo CGSF and Mogilno CGSF.

Results of the environmental monitoring indicate that activities consisting in the construction and operation of underground gas storage facilities have no adverse effects on individual components of the natural environment.
In 2018, Gas Storage Poland Sp. z o.o. adopted the Policy for an integrated quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management system at GSP, under which the company committed to implement measures based on the principles of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, and to continuously improve its integrated quality, environmental and OHS management system compliant with the ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2017 standards.

Non-renewable resources are the main materials used in the production of electricity and heat at the PGNiG Group. Coal is used to produce electricity and heat mainly in the PGNiG TERMIKA Group's CHP plants, while natural gas is used in the other companies for heating buildings, in heat and electricity production (including for electricity production in cogeneration and trigeneration) as well as in industrial pro-

cesses as a fuel for oil heaters in desulfurization and desalination, fuel for boilers, gas compression engines, gas turbines, and post-combustion of waste gases.
In 2018, PGNiG's gas consumption rose due to its flaring in the course of extraction activities. Most of the companies try to reduce gas consumption by modernising their heating installations.

In 2018, the majority of the PGNiG Group companies consumed mainly energy generated internally on the basis of non-renewable resources. The other Group members have signed contracts with energy companies. The volume of energy used is correlated with the Group's growth. The PGNiG Group implements pro-environmental solutions, such as cogeneration and trigeneration plants owned and operated by some of the companies, and photovoltaic systems. At Norway-based PUN all of the energy consumed is generated by zero-emission hydroelectric power plants.
Reduction of energy consumption and energy requirements of products and services
As part of its Energy Management System, the PGNiG Group strives to reduce its energy consumption and lower the energy requirements of products and services. Construction of a CCGT unit at the era CHP Plant was a major energy efficiency project in 2018.
Individual energy efficiency projects pursued at PGNiG are aligned with the process of acquiring energy efficiency certificates (the `white certifi-

cates'). Those projects include, inter alia, energy recovery in industrial processes (the Odolanów Nitrogen Rejection Unit), also through installing or upgrading systems converting industrial waste gases into electricity or heat, which should generate energy savings estimated at over 300,000 MWh annually.
Efforts made by PGNiG Group companies also contribute to overall energy efficiency improvement by reducing the amount of energy consumed by individuals, legal entities and unincorporated organisational units. It is an effect of the rising awareness of the importance of sustainable use of energy, driven by educational campaigns and information disseminated through the Internet, for instance at: http://pgnig.pl/dla-domu/ poradnik/jak-oszczedzac-energie.
Moreover, the PGNiG Group launched a project to roll out energy management systems across the Group.

Currently, 18 installations of the PGNiG Group are covered by the EU ETS. In 2018, the volume of carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 6,284,707 Mg and was slightly lower than in previous years (down 1%). As free allowances of CO2 emission rights decrease year by year, there is a need to purchase additional emission rights.

Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
The PGNiG Group has been steadily reducing the amount of pollutants generated by transportation, combustion processes in heat sources, fuel reloading and industrial processes (gas combustion at flares, gas venting, emissions from compressor stations and compressors). The methods of reducing emissions of pollutants into the air include using gas as a low-emission fuel, monitoring fuel consumption, reducing the energy

potential gas leakages.In 2018, air emissions of pollutants other than CO and CO2 were mostly on decline as a result of using more advanced coal combustion technologies.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities, gas distribution, and modernisation, maintenance and repair works of the PGNiG Group generate air pollutants such as gases (SO2, NOx, CO, CO2, CH4), particulate matter, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, acids, heavy metals, metallic and non-metallic elements. Methane emissions were down year on year in 2018 thanks to on-going efforts taken to identify and eliminate

Implementation
of the Geo-Metan project
It assumes a reduction of CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. The idea of the project is the extraction of methane before the exploitation of hard coal, which in the end is supposed to result in lower methane emission during hard coal mining. In addition, methane can be effectively used by PGNiG as an unconventional source of natural gas.

Applied standards, methodologies and assumptions
Wastewater generated by the PGNiG Group companies is discharged into the sewage system, surface water or soil based on the water permits obtained. Domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged into the sewage system. Rainwater from plant premises and access roads is discharged into the municipal sewage system, as well as into surface water and soil. The PGNiG TERMIKA Group companies account for a large share in the volume of generated wastewater as they use water for cooling purposes.
Water recycled and reused
At PGNiG TERMIKA, the largest stream of water is used to cool production units. The Siekierki and era CHP Plants have an open cooling system, where water is discharged back to the river after absorption of heat. The cooling water recirculated back to the river is classified as wastewater in accordance with the Water Law, although it should be noted that the only `pollutant' in cooling water is the added heat load.
At the Siekierki CHP Plant, water used for cooling is drawn from and returned to the Vistula, while the era CHP Plant draws water either from the Vistula or the era Canal and discharges cooling water to the era Canal.

Water used for cooling Siekierki CHP Plant era CHP Plant

2018 132,467,701 19,238,912

In addition to cooling, CHP plants use water to fill up the heating network and steam circulation system without returning it to water bodies; however, it is no longer raw water as in the case of cooling. The water used to fill up both the heating and steam circulation systems must reach specified parameters and is therefore prepared in water pre-treatment stations. Effluents produced in the process are subsequently treated at in-house industrial wastewater treatment plants.
On the other hand, Exalo Drilling SA uses recycled water to drill wells. Such water is used to produce the company's key products and services.

Drilling mud,
which is a liquid used to drill boreholes. During drilling, mud is used to clean the well bottom and to flush drill cuttings to the surface. It is also used to cool the drill bit and remove any drill cutting deposited on it. After drilling, mud is transported to special treatment stations and is either recycled or disposed of (if recycling is no longer an option).

Spills
In 2018, eighteen spills to the environment were reported, including one leakage of diesel oil from a tanker and two spills of hydraulic oil (330 litres in total). Fifteen spills were caused by network leakage.
Waste by type and disposal method
The production of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is unavoidable in activities related to production and processing of crude oil and natural gas. However, deployment of latest technologies and use of environmentally-friendly materials and products help minimise the volume of generated waste.

Effective waste management strives to reuse waste. To that end, waste is first selectively collected and then recovered to produce recycled materials ready for reuse. Hazardous waste which must be disposed of is handed over to licensed waste collection companies for subsequent disposal, as PGNiG is not authorised to transport such waste. The amount of waste generated in a given period depends on the volume of exploration and production work and the type of investments and upgrade projects carried out by Group companies.
Waste collection companies are verified for compliance with applicable laws in terms of holding relevant waste management authorisations, with priority given to rational use of natural resources and sustainable management of waste.

As regards municipal waste, in accordance with the current regulations it is collected by municipalities or by designated entities entered in the register of regulated business activities or performing the function of municipal organisational units, subject to relevant agreements.
In 2018, all the PGNiG Group companies reported decreases in the volumes of genera-

ted waste, an effect mainly of the introduction of new technologies and use of environment-friendly materials and products. The PGNiG Group companies also run programmes raising the awareness of the need to sort waste. The other waste is recycled by specialised external operators.

In 2018, the PGNiG Group reported a year-on-year rise in environmental protection expenditure. Projects carried out during the year included modernisation of boiler houses and thermo-modernisation of buildings, which directly contributes to air protection. Expenditure was also incurred on water protection and waste management.
The PGNiG TERMIKA Group companies planned their environmental expenditure to reach PLN 1,445.6 in 2019­2021, in view of the entry into force of stricter environmental requirements resulting from the BAT Conclusions. A major part of that amount is earmarked for the construction of new genera-

tion units (CCGT unit, two gas-fired peak-load boiler houses at the era CHPP, and construction of new sources at the Pruszków CHPP) to replace the obsolete ones which do not comply with BAT requirements. The planned investments in existing sources will be made mainly to construct equipment reducing pollutant emissions (NOx reduction, desulfurisation and particle collection solutions) to the levels compliant with BAT.

58

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

The operations of the PGNiG Group largely depend on external factors which also pose challenges for the Group. Those factors include:
1. Developments in the global fuel and energy markets, including depressed oil prices, gas price volatility and rapid expansion of the LNG market In 2018, changes taking place in the Polish gas market were accompanied by price rises elsewhere in Europe, with gas prices on European markets becoming increasingly detached from prices of oil products in recent years. Oil prices fell towards the end of 2018, with serious implications for the PGNiG Group, as this is bound to reduce the cost of gas under long-term contracts and make imports more attractive on the one hand, but on the other hand this will adversely affect the economics of foreign upstream projects with reserves dominated by oil, leading to a lower value of the Exploration and Production segment's foreign operations.
LNG infrastructure ­ both export capacities (liquefaction plants, mainly in North America and Australia) and import capacities ­ has been expanding rapidly around the world in recent years. Earlier predictions of an LNG glut proved wrong as LNG demand saw strong growth in Asia, notably in China. However, the abundant supply helped to

level out differences in LNG prices between the North Atlantic region and Far East markets. Prices in Asia remain relatively higher, reflecting additional freight costs that would need to be incurred to bring LNG cargoes to Asia. As a global LNG market player, PGNiG will be able to optimise its long-term gas portfolio and secure additional gas supplies to Poland in the short term to address spikes in demand or exploit price opportunities (optimisation of gas supplies from other directions).
2. Need to change the mix of imported gas sources The PGNiG Group's portfolio of gas supply sources is designed to fully cover demand from the Group's customers and is mainly comprised of long-term import contracts (the Yamal and Qatar contracts). In 2018, the Group pursued its strategy to diversify import sources, raising the share of gas sourced from suppliers west and south of Poland (based on market prices of gas at relevant gas hubs) and LNG (spot deliveries and new long-term contracts for LNG from the United States), while reducing the share of gas supplies from countries east of Poland.
As the Yamal contract expires after 2022, the PGNiG Group is actively looking for alternative sources of natural gas supplies to Poland, including in countries north of

59

Poland (via the planned Baltic Pipe). Seeking to optimally utilise the LNG Terminal, in 2018 PGNiG also added to its portfolio new contracts with American partners for the gas supply to Poland from 2022 onwards.

3. Policy and regulatory changes Significant changes are taking place in the PGNiG Group's regulatory environment, particularly with respect to taxation of hydrocarbon production, the exchange sale requirement, and uncertainty surrounding the support model for gas-fired cogeneration, all of which may adversely affect the each Group's segment revenues.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

PGNiG Group Strategy for 2017-2022

In response to the changing internal and external environment, the Group developed the new PGNiG Group Strategy for 2017-2022 with an Outlook until 2026, which was approved by the PGNiG Supervisory Board on March 13th 2017.
The key external developments reflected in the Strategy were of macroeconomic nature (e.g. falling prices of crude oil and natural gas), but they also included other factors, such as the rapidly accelerating competition growth on the Polish gas market, the need to diversify gas imports from 2022 onwards, and changes in the regulatory environment (gradual withdrawal of the tariff regime, unpredictable future of the support mechanism for power generation beyond 2018). Following analyses, the key macroeconomic assumptions underlying further strategic forecasts were updated, including those related to gas, oil and electricity prices. New strategic objectives and ambitions for the Group until 2022 were formulated.
A major internal change associated with the adoption of the new Strategy was the implementation of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodology, which enables the balancing of the Group's financial, operating and development objectives based on four key BSC `perspectives' (finances, customers, processes, and resources and growth). The result is a new way of defining main strategic objectives, where targets and ambitions are set at

the Group level and then cascaded down to the Group's key business areas.
The pursuit of sustainable development as the Group's priority will be driven by parallel investments in riskier business areas yielding relatively high rates of return (upstream) and in regulated areas offering considerable safety of the investments (gas distribution, power and heat generation).
The PGNiG Group has embarked on an ambitious capital investment programme that is to lay the foundations for long-term and stable value growth.

61

Targets and ambitions for 2017-2022

PGNiG Group Sustainable Development Strategy for 2017­2022

Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development initiatives are taken on the basis of the PGNiG Group Sustainable Development Strategy for 2017­2022 (the CSR Strategy), which supports and supplements the business objectives defined in the PGNiG Group Strategy for 2017­2022.
The awareness of our environmental impact and responsibility for energy security, rooted in the Group's value system, are the cornerstone of the CSR Strategy. The priorities of the CSR Strategy are presented below.
National energy security
The PGNiG Group's business directly affects Poland's energy security, which ­ in the context of sustainable development ­ is reflected in our objective of providing customers with access to natural gas, electricity and heat, based on diversified sources and directions of natural gas supplies. This objective is understood as continuous pursuit by the PGNiG Group of development in the area of natural gas and crude oil production and gas storage, as well as ensuring diversified sources of supply for customers. In this context, the importance of the key business projects involving gas exploration and production or procurement, diversification of sources and directions of natural gas supplies or the day-to-day business of electricity and heat generation pursued

by the PGNiG TERMIKA Group companies, can be seen.
Environmental protection
The business activities carried out by the PGNiG Group companies have an effect on the environment. Taking into account the contemporary challenges of environmental protection, related to the depletion of natural resources and possible contamination of individual elements of the environment, PGNiG makes an effort to minimize the negative impact. Support in achieving these goals is the development of technical standards for the implementation of works based on applicable legal requirements, as well as industry good practices, prevention of environmental damage in the exploration and extraction of deposits, analysis of environmental risks, monitoring the impact of activities on the environment. PGNiG also uses technologies that reduce the negative impact on the environment and maintains management systems, within which it pursues environmental goals and objectives, striving to increase environmental efficiency.
The challenge in this area is also the close cooperation and control of compliance with the environmental requirements set for contractors, cooperation with state administration bodies, local governments and the local community. In addition, efforts are underway to

65

improve energy efficiency, such as the implementation and maintenance of an energy management system.
Local society
The nature and scale of the PGNiG Group's operations and the presence of its exploration, production, storage and distribution infrastructure in the lives of local communities make the Group deeply committed to building partnering relations with its social environment, local governments, suppliers and contractors, with the ultimate goal of pursing joint objectives. The PGNiG Group creates opportunities for cooperation and builds understanding for mutual relations and interdependencies with individual stakeholder groups.
Development of the offer and customer satisfaction
Care for the customers and their satisfaction is one of the key areas of focus for the PGNiG Group companies. Retaining the existing customers and ensuring their satisfaction, as well as acquiring new ones, is possible thanks to the implementation of projects designed to ensure professional and friendly customer service and tailoring the offering to diverse needs. The planned initiatives under this strategic direction are also related to building a transparent and credible brand.
Care for employee safety and development
Building mutual relations and conducting open dialogue with trading partners in order to continuously enhance the safety of employees, persons staying on the PGNiG Group's premises and the local communities as well as successful efforts to constantly and permanently improve occupational health and safety are among PGNIG's principal commitments set out

in the QHSE Policy, implemented through the Group's health and safety management system.
Innovation for development
The PGNiG Group is looking for new technology solutions and supports the work and development of innovators. Investment in innovation and modern solutions increase the efficiency of operations, contribute to the growth of the PGNiG Group's business potential and help minimise the adverse impact of the Group's operations on the environment. Innovation based on the foundation of knowledge, education and R&D activities can trigger the growth of an organisation. One of the PGNiG Group's priorities is to further develop cooperation with the world of science, as well as to support and initiate the development of start-ups and of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The value system as a basis for action
As a responsible organisation, PGNiG aims to maintain ethical standards and to consciously follow them in its business activities. In 2018, the ethics programme management was reorganised and is currently governed by the PGNiG Group's Compliance Policy.
The persons responsible for ethics and compliance at the PGNiG Group are the first points of contact for employees in the event of a breach of ethical standards, applicable laws, customary market norms, industry standards or good market practice. In the event of any doubts, employees may contact such ethics and compliance officers and receive relevant explanations.
At the PGNiG level, ethical conduct is within the remit of the Ethics and Compliance Coordinator, who is responsible for reviewing the breaches of ethical standards reported by staff and decides whether to investigate such breaches or refer them to the PGNiG Group

66

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Ethics Committee. At the Group level, PGNiG has appointed the Ethics Committee and Ethics Officer.
The Company has in place a Code of Ethics, complemented by other internal regulations such as the PGNiG Group Compliance Policy and the recently adopted Transparency Policy for Managers, setting out the core values and benchmarks for conduct of both employees and managers.
The PGNiG Code of Ethics consists of the Statement of Values and the Ethical Standards Code. The Statement of Values sets out the moral principles and ethical ideals to foster development of an ethical environment and mutual trust at PGNiG. The Ethical Standards Code spells out specific rules of conduct for PGNiG employees, which are in line with declared corporate values and best industry practices from around the world.
As stipulated in the ethics programme, the presented values and ethical principles must be fully upheld by every PGNiG employee in the course of their professional duties. The Code allows the Group companies to further improve their best practices and ethical standards based on their own judgement, in accordance with the specific nature of relevant market sectors, conditions in which they operate in various countries, and prior experience.
The PGNiG Group has appointed 11 persons to act as ethics and compliance coordinators, supported by the Ethics Committee and Ethics Officer at the PGNiG Group level.
The PGNiG Group Ethics Officer, together with the Ethics and Compliance Coordinator at PGNiG and the Compliance Department at PGNiG, promoted knowledge of internal ethics-related regulations in newsletters and official releases, as well as in an internal magazine for employees.

The PGNiG Group provided training in ethics-related regulations for ethics and compliance coordinators at individual Group companies. Additionally, such coordinators organised ethics training for employees, managers and directors. At the PGNiG Group, more than 1,000 employees, mostly managers and new employees, participated in training related to ethical conduct.
No breaches of ethics were reported at PGNiG; the same applies to most Group companies which have appointed their own ethics coordinators. At PSG, a PGNiG Group company with the highest headcount, 18 incidents were reported in 2018. In accordance with the applicable policies and the Code of Ethics, the reported incidents were examined directly by ethics managers or by the appointed Ethics Committees, depending on the nature and scope of reported issues.
Human rights and ethics
Human rights aspects are taken into account in the Codes of Ethics and the Group's procedures for preventing workplace harassment and discrimination, which are founded, in particular, on the principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland: · the principle of legal equality and prohi-
bition of discrimination (Art. 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland); · the principle of gender equality (Art. 33); · freedom of religion and belief (Art. 53­54); · the right to privacy (Art. 47); and · the right to protection of personal data (Art. 51).

Increasing hydrocarbon reserves Hydrocarbon exploration in Poland is planned to be intensified in 2017­2022, to maintain the high rate of new discoveries. The 2016 breakthrough in exploration efficiency led to a surge in newly discovered hydrocarbon reserves (increase of approximately

35 mboe in 2016 vs approximately 16 mboe in 2015). In 2017­2022, the gross annual growth in Polish hydrocarbon reserves (including production) is expected to continue at a rate close to the 2016 levels, ranging from approximately 27 mboe to 34 mboe annually. PGNiG Group's ambition is

70

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

to reverse the negative trend observed in 2010­2015, when the Group's total hydrocarbon base decreased by around 2% on average per year.
Given the limited capacity for growth in discoveries of new hydrocarbon reserves and little prospects of finding unconventional reserves in Poland, the Group is also looking for ways to increase its hydrocarbon reserves and step up production abroad. The Group remains committed to carrying out production projects which will yield equity gas on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, in order to transport the gas to Poland directly.
Increase annual hydrocarbon production volumes Another of the segment's strategic objectives is to increase the volume of annual hydrocarbon production from approximately 39 mboe in 2017 to close to 55 mboe in 2022 (+15.9 mboe, CAGR 6%) by keeping up the annual output in Poland at 30­33 mboe and considerably stepping up production abroad, i.e. in Pakistan and Norway, to 22 mboe annually.
To achieve that, the following measures have been taken: · in Poland: increasing output from produ-
cing fields; · abroad:
· participation in licence award procedures in priority regions/countries;
· execution of M&A projects in priority regions/countries;
· implementation of an accelerated field development programme in the licence areas.
Increasing profitability of exploration and production operations It is the segment's strategically-motivated ambition to considerably reduce unit exploration costs in Poland. Exploration efforts are to be focused on projects offering the highest potential for commercial success. In addition,

the average time for appraisal and development of deposits is assumed to be shortened.
Trade and Storage
Wholesale: Diversification of gas supply sources The PGNiG Group's position has been adversely affected by the long-term contract for gas supplies to Poland, concluded in the past (the Yamal contract). As the contract is nearing expiry in 2022, the Group seeks to ensure real diversification of gas supplies. In this respect, the Group's key activities include: · Supporting the construction of the Nor-
wegian Corridor ­ the Group's strategic objective is to build a mix of gas supply sources that would be available via the Norwegian Corridor, to enable gas imports from new directions and at market prices, thus ensuring flexibility of the gas supply portfolio beyond 2022; · Enhancement of LNG trading and logistic capabilities on the global market ­ improvement of these capabilities will help the PGNiG Group create a more flexible gas supply portfolio beyond 2022 as it will be able to swiftly balance its gas imports. To this end, PGNiG has signed long-term contracts for supply of liquefied natural gas to Poland, which are to be performed after 2022. Looking further ahead, efforts will continue to develop the Group's capabilities and strengthen its presence on the global LNG market; · Expanding the resource base in Poland and abroad ­ by developing and maintaining high gas production in Poland and investigating potential for acquiring gas from new directions with a view to strengthening the Company's competitive position beyond 2022.

71

Wholesale: Wholesale of natural gas In 2018, PGNiG's sales of natural gas totalled almost 190 TWh. The Group is aspiring to further increase its natural gas trading volumes in Poland and on international markets. As a matter of strategy and supported by PST's experience and capabilities, the Group will continue working towards expanding its foothold in other gas and electricity trading markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The Group intends to continue its efforts aimed at strengthening its presence in Ukraine, one of the most promising markets in the region.
Retail: Maintaining the market position and improving operational efficiency in retail trade During the term of the PGNiG Group Strategy, the overriding strategic objective of PGNiG OD will be to improve the efficiency of retail sales of gas while maintaining the total volume of retail sales at around 67-70 TWh/year.
In 2018, PGNiG OD continued to pursue the objectives of maintaining its market position and improving operational efficiency. Thus, maintaining an attractive portfolio of products and services, whether dedicated to large business customers (B2B) or the mass consumer market (B2C), as well as effective sales and customer service, remained crucial.
Storage: Increasing available storage capacities In its storage business, the PGNiG Group focuses on securing the availability of storage capacities in keeping with actual demand, and further improving the efficiency of its storage operations. Given the growing pace of gas market deregulation in Poland, the legal framework concerning the maintenance of emergency (mandatory) gas stocks is expected to be amended as

of 2021. At the same time, relevant analyses have shown that the strong growth in demand for gas is set to continue, which will translate into increased demand for storage services related to commercial needs and emergency stock keeping obligations. The key objective remains to successfully complete the investment projects currently in progress (Kosakowo UGSF). Once the projects are completed, Poland's total capacity to store high-methane gas will be approximately 3.1 bcm.
Distribution
Accelerate the rate of connecting new customers The strategy provides for significant acceleration of development of the distribution system and for increasing the rate of connecting new customers to the grid. One of the key strategic objectives of the distribution business is to increase the pace of connecting new customers to the distribution network from about 47,000 new connections in 2017 to about 55,000 new connections a year in 2022 (up 8,000 or ca. 17%).
This, however, will not be possible without optimisation of the related processes (shortening the time to approve and construct new connections), improvements in customer service, and deployment of remote channels.
Increase gas distribution volumes The higher rate of connecting new premises to the gas network will enable PSG to increase the volume of natural gas distributed, from the 2017 target of approximately 10.6 bcm to approximately 12.3 bcm in 2022 (an increase of about +1.7 bcm, or 16%).
The increase in the volume of distributed gas will be achieved by connecting new customers to the existing distribution network, expanding the distribution

72

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

73

network into unserved areas, and delivering gas to customers lacking access to the gas transmission and distribution network through roll-out of local gas delivery solutions.
Given the growing supply of LNG on the Polish market, PSG plans to build local distribution networks which would not be connected to the national gas system, but instead will be fed with LNG (off-grid distribution networks). Another driver of increase in the volume of distributed natural gas will be the growing problem of smog blanketing many Polish cities and towns, and local governments' initiatives for air quality improvement through, inter alia, promoting conversion to low carbon fuels, including gas.
Generation
Increase power and heat sales volumes The PGNiG Group's strategy for the generation business is to expand its share in the

heat generation and distribution market. On April 28th, 2016, PGNiG TERMIKA
purchased shares in the companies that subsequently merged to from PGNiG TERMIKA EP. These acquisitions helped the PGNiG Group to expand into the prospective heat markets of Upper Silesia. Around PGNiG TERMIKA, the Group is building a strong group of companies offering significant growth potential that will create value for the entire Group.
In terms of electricity and heat generation, the Group's strategic ambition is to increase the volume of electricity and heat sales from approximately 15 TWh in 2017 to around 18 TWh in 2022.
The achievement of strategic objectives of the Generation segment will be possible thanks mainly to the completion of strategic upgrade and development projects at the existing PGNiG TERMIKA generation facilities, including the new CCGT unit at the era CHPP. Furthermore, PGNiG TERMIKA

intends to intensify its efforts in search of acquisition targets in the heat distribution and heat and electricity generation business, and to improve its operational efficiency through process optimisation.
In the period covered by the strategy, PGNiG TERMIKA will also complete the construction of a CCGT unit at the Stalowa Wola CHPP, a project executed jointly with TAURON Wytwarzanie SA.
Additionally, the PGNiG Group is seeking to increase its electricity and heat output at PGNiG TERMIKA EP, for instance by starting up a new unit at the Zofiówka CHPP in November 2018. The PGNiG Group wants to continue developing PGNiG TERMIKA EP through further acquisitions of local heating systems, primarily in Upper Silesia.
The current market and regulatory environment as well as tariffs provide favourable conditions for the growth of Poland's heating market. The regulated nature of the business guarantees stable rates of return.

The entry into force in 2018­2019 of new capacity market regulations and regulations promoting high-efficiency cogeneration will also support the development of new electric capacities, in particular high-efficiency gas-fired cogeneration units.
Other segments
Effective business model, development of R&D&I and CSR This area will strive to build an efficient organisational and management model across the highly complex structure of the PGNiG Group. Its three main aspirations are to increase the PGNiG Group's growth potential in research, development and innovation, improve the Group's operational efficiency, and enhance the Group's image.

PGNiG's role in ensuring energy security

Introduction
Inherent in the PGNiG Group's responsible growth are measures geared towards ensuring Poland's energy security.
From PGNiG's perspective, the factors of key importance to ensuring energy security, out of those highlighted by the Ministry of Energy, include: · The degree of diversification of natural
gas sources and directions of supply to Poland; · The volume of domestic natural gas production; · The level and availability of natural gas storage capacities in Poland. It is estimated that by 2030 the demand for natural gas in Poland will grow by over 30% relative to 2015. It will be driven, in particular, by the expanding market for CNG and LNG fuels used by vehicles, and the associated development of distribution and supply infrastructure, which will follow that growth trend. Another major indicator of the upcoming increase in demand for natural gas is the construction of new gas-fired power generating units.
Diversification of natural gas supply sources and directions
The PGNiG Group is the principal importer of natural gas to Poland. A considerable por-

tion of gas supplies still comes from countries east of Poland, but this share is gradually shrinking, mainly due to growing volumes of LNG imported from other countries, including the USA, Qatar and Norway. The President Lech Kaczyski LNG Terminal in winoujcie, being a key element of Poland's gas infrastructure which will further support diversification of gas supply sources, is of crucial importance both for Poland and the entire CEE region. Its current regasification capacities are fully utilised by the PGNiG Group, which clearly demonstrates the Group's leading role in diversifying the supply sources of energy commodities.
In addition to the winoujcie LNG terminal, both existing and planned cross-border gas pipelines operated by GAZ-SYSTEM, as well as the Baltic Pipe project implemented by Polish and Danish TSOs, are important infrastructural elements which will contribute to further diversification of Poland's gas supply sources.
Domestic natural gas production
PGNiG holds several dozen licences for exploration for and appraisal of hydrocarbon deposits in Poland, as well as over 200 hydrocarbon production licences, which positions the PGNiG Group as the leader of the country's crude oil and natural gas production.

76

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Exploration and production activities abroad
The Group's long-standing efforts in this area contribute to diversification of supply sources of energy commodities to its home country. The access to resources located outside of Poland is considered an important driver of further diversification of supplies, especially in the context of the Baltic Pipe project which is aimed at building a new gas supply corridor on the European market from North Sea fields.
Volume and availability of natural gas storage capacities
The PGNiG Group currently operates seven underground high-methane gas storage facilities linked to the gas transmission system, as well as two nitrogen-rich gas storage facilities. As part of the `UGSF working capacity development programme', the Group also takes steps to increase its gas storage capacities. The UGSF's target capacity, as set out by the Ministry of Energy, is expected to reach approximately 4 bcm in 2030.

Gas supplier of last resort
Pursuant to Minister of Energy's Regulation (Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1814), in 2018 PGNiG Obrót Detaliczny was designated to act as the supplier of last resort for end users of gas, in particular those connected to the PSG's or OGP Gaz-System's network, in the event that their current supplier discontinues gas supplies through its own fault. In such a case, the DSO or TSO, acting for and on behalf of the customer, will enter into a relevant agreement with the supplier of last resort in order to guarantee uninterrupted gas supplies to end users. The customer is be notified of such agreement by PGNiG within 30 days.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

One of the goals set in the PGNiG Group's Strategy for the Corporate Centre is to step up innovation by effective implementation of R&D and innovation projects. Within the PGNiG organisational structure, these tasks fall within the remit of the Innovation and Business Development Department, which oversees activities in the area of innovation (solution identification, development, implementation/commercialisation) and energy efficiency, as well as the Research and Development Department, which is responsible for managing R&D projects and intellectual property rights and for collaboration with scientific and research centres.
Research and development As a result of the efforts undertaken by the Research and Development Department, PGNiG received 99 proposals of research and development projects highly suitable for the needs of the PGNiG Group. Most of the proposals were from universities and research institutes (50 R&D proposals from 20 different entities, totalling PLN 99.6m) and the National Centre for Research and Development's INGA programme (34 proposals from 35 different entities/consortia for about PLN 226m in total). In 2018, PGNiG concluded 19 new contracts for R&D work worth PLN 9.7m, most of which pertained to Exploration and Production. Under the INGA programme, seven projects were selected for funding worth a total of

PLN 65.4m (with about PLN 32.5m provided by the NCRD). In 2018, other PGNiG Group companies carried out 20 research and development projects for a total amount of PLN 4.1m.
As part of the efforts to identify R&D areas with the largest business potential for the PGNiG Group, an updated set of areas for development was prepared under the Foresight R&D 2018 project, to help formulate the PGNiG Group's long-term strategy and to meet the Group's current R&D needs. The R&D Intellectual Property Protection Model was also developed to improve security in intellectual property transfers and to strengthen sources of revenue relying on such transfers.
A series of research and development activities related to hydrogen technology as a potential new business line were also launched. A programme of R&D work that would enable the Group to enter this segment is being developed.

Market and regulatory environment

Gas market
Polish gas market The PGNiG Group plays a key role on the Polish gas market, being responsible for preserving Poland's energy security. To this end, it takes measures necessary to satisfy the steadily growing demand for gas fuel. The PGNiG Group ensures gas supply diversification by developing domestic deposits and sourcing gas from abroad as the largest importer and supplier of natural gas in Poland. Gas is transported to Poland via an extensive transmission network, with LNG-derived gas additionally fed into

the network since 2016. The Company delivers gas to end users through the distribution networks. The national gas system is complete with gas fuel storage facilities, used to cover seasonal and daily shortages of gas fuel. In gas trading, the key role is played by the Polish Power Exchange where PGNiG has been the Gas Market Maker since November 2013.

Management of the transmission network and transport of natural gas via the national transmission network to deliver it to distribution grids and end users connected directly to the transmission system is the responsibility of GAZ-SYSTEM, a state-owned company. The existing transmission network comprises two operationally interlinked systems, the Transit Gas Pipeline System and the National Transmission System (high-methane gas [E group] and nitrogen-rich gas [Lw subgroup]). As at the end of 2018, the length of Poland's gas transmission network totalled over 10.7 thousand km. The volume of gas fuel transmitted through

the network amounted to 17.2 bcm in 2018 (measured as high-methane gas equivalent).
In December 2017, the General Meeting of GAZ-SYSTEM approved the National Ten-Year Growth Plan for 2018-2027. The planned infrastructure projects are primarily designed to meet the current and future demand for natural gas from domestic customers while ensuring uninterrupted gas supplies.

Gas flow 2018 saw decreasing volumes of gas fuel imported to Poland which reached 162.80 TWh (down by 4.2 TWh, or approximately 2.5%), with a 7% decline in gas imported from east of Poland and an 18% decrease in gas imports from the EU year on year. The majority of imported gas (approximately 61% of total flows) originated from countries east of Poland. According to ENTSOG's data, the largest flows were recorded at Drozdovitse. As regards imports from the west, the largest flows were recorded at the Mallnow point.
In 2018, gas deliveries by sea to the LNG Terminal were continued, which resulted in a 58% increase in the volume of gas regasi-

fied at the LNG Terminal compared to 2017. The volumes of gas previously supplied over onshore pipelines were partly replaced by the volumes supplied under the new long-term LNG contract with Qatargas and increased volumes of LNG spot purchases.

LNG in Poland At present, the LNG Terminal can handle annual gas imports of 5 bcm (after regasification). In 2017, PGNiG increased its reservation from 65% to 100% of the terminal's regasification capacity. The relevant contract is valid until January 1st 2035. Since 2018, Polskie LNG SA has been engaged in a project to expand the LNG Terminal. The project includes four tasks: construction of additional regasification units, a third LNG storage tank, LNG handling facilities for loading gas onto railway tank cars, and an additional wharf. After its planned expansion, the terminal's annual capacity should be increased to 7.5 bcm in the coming years.
The terminal is able to receive LNG tankers not larger than Q-Flex, whose maximum capacity (depending on the vessel) ranges from 210 to 218 thousand cubic metres of LNG (approximately 130 mcm of high-methane gas after regasification).
The end product of gas regasification is fed into the national transmission grid via the Goleniów gas compression station. LNG is also transported by tankers to regasification plants and stations located throughout Poland. Also, the volume of fuel delivered to end users in the

form of liquefied natural gas (small-scale LNG) is growing steadily.
PGNiG considers LNG deliveries as a means to ensure gas supply security and diversification. In 2018, PGNiG received a total of 18 LNG shipments under the long-term contracts with Qatargas. The volume of LNG imports from Qatar amounted to 1.65m tonnes, i.e. approximately 25.1 TWh or 2.29 bcm of natural gas after regasification. In 2018, PGNiG purchased gas under four spot contracts and its volume totalled 0.25m tonnes, i.e. approximately 3.7 TWh or 0.34 bcm of natural gas after regasification. The spot deliveries were sourced from Norway and the US, and were arranged in cooperation with the LNG trading office in London. In June 2018, PGNiG also received an LNG shipment under a medium-term contract with Centrica.
Over 2018, PGNiG imported 23 shipments of LNG via the LNG Terminal, with a total volume of 1.96m tonnes, i.e. approximately 29.8 TWh or 2.71 bcm of natural gas after regasification.

89

Distribution system Distribution services are provided by one major distribution system operator (Polska Spólka Gazownictwa) and several dozen smaller local operators whose networks are connected to the system operated by PSG or GAZ-SYSTEM.
Gas storage PGNiG owns 9 underground gas storage facilities in Poland. The average daily withdrawal of gas from Polish UGSFs over the withdrawal period amounted to 134 GWh in 2018, up 14% on the previous year. In the summer of

2018, gas was injected into storage at an average rate of 119 GWh/day, down 12 GWh/day on 2017.
Polish Power Exchange PGNiG is the leader of gas trading on the PPX. According to PPX data, in 2018 the total gas trading volume was 143.3 TWh, of which 119.6 TWh was traded on the commodity futures market (RTT). This means that almost 83% of gas trades in 2018 were executed under contracts with maturities of a year, season (summer, winter), quarter, month, and week.

In Europe, the air temperature in winter was often lower than the seasonal standard, which boosted the demand for gas used for heating purposes. The temperature in the second half of February was as much as 12oC below the average. The higher demand caused a surge in gas prices in late February and early March, the elevated price levels continuing into April.
In Q2 2018, gas prices were growing steadily. At the beginning of June, the Dutch Minister of Economy announced that production from Groningen, Europe's largest gas field, was to be reduced to 12 bcm on average per year starting from 2020, although ­ as declared earlier ­ that target was originally expected to be achieved in 2022. At present, gas volumes produced from the field amount to 19.4 bcm per year.
In Q3 2018, low supply of LNG was among the strongest factors affecting gas prices in Europe. Asia's growing demand and rising prices of gas in the region prompted LNG exporters to redirect some of their supplies from Europe to Asia. In addition, at the end of winter the volumes of gas held in storage in most Western European countries were very low. As a result, the gas injection rates in summer were much higher than the year before, which reduced the supply of gas on the continent. The growing prices of coal and carbon dioxide emission allowan-

ces led to higher gas consumption in the power generation sector. In September, the average price of gas on TTF was EUR 27.65/ MWh. In the same month, there were also unexpected disruptions in gas supplies from the Gullfaks and Asgard fields in Norway.
The fourth quarter saw a decline in gas prices on the European market, as they followed the falling prices of other energy carriers, namely crude oil and coal. The trade dispute between the United States and China had an added adverse impact on commodity markets. High gas inventory levels in Asia significantly reduced the region's demand for LNG supplies. In consequence, large volumes of LNG were sold in Europe.
In 2018, the total volume of gas imported to Europe via pipelines was 3,463 TWh, of which 49% (1,697 TWh) originated from Russia. The share of Russian imports was close to the 2017 level. Norway emerged as the second largest supplier of gas to Europe, providing 876 TWh (80 bcm), or 25% of total imports. The share of gas imports from Norwegian deposits fell 1pp. Volumes of gas imported from North Africa totalled 412 TWh (37.5 bcm). LNG deliveries to Europe amounted to 462 TWh.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Gas inventory levels At the end of 2018, Polish gas storage facilities were filled to approximately 70% of capacity, down 8pp on the end of the previous year. In other European countries, the levels of gas storage increased, most notably in the UK, up 23% year on year.
Progress in implementing infrastructural projects on the European gas market
The Baltic Pipe The Baltic Pipe project is a strategic infrastructure project aimed at creating a new gas supply corridor on the European market. It is to enable the transmission of gas directly from deposits located in Norway to markets in Denmark and Poland, as well as to consumers in the neighbouring countries. The annual transmission capacity of the Baltic Pipe will reach up to 10 bcm to Poland and up to 3 bcm to Denmark and Sweden.
In January 2018, PGNiG signed transmission agreements with GAZ-SYSTEM and Energinet, and on November 30th 2018 GAZ-SYSTEM and Energinet made final investment decisions, implementation of which is a precondition for launching the provision of gas transmission services via the Baltic Pipe. The positive investment decisions having been made by both GAZ-SYSTEM and Energinet means that the

companies committed to building the gas pipeline as part of the Baltic Pipe project.
Outlook for gas market According to analysts, the price of natural gas in Europe will be gradually falling in the coming years due to the oversupply of LNG on the global market. This situation will be caused by increased production of shale gas in North America and Australia and launch of new units for liquefying natural gas, which will enhance competitiveness on the LNG market. The strongest growth in demand for LNG will be seen in Asia, although its rate will be slower than in 2017­2018. Europe, with its growing demand, will continue to be a balancing market for global LNG supplies.
Crude oil market
In early 2018, the prices of crude oil continued to grow at rates similar to those recorded in H2 2017. Key factors contributing to the steady price increase included the honouring of the output reduction deal by OPEC members and countries cooperating with the organisation, including Russia. Some of the oil producers even reduced their output below the agreed levels.

In the first quarter of 2018, there was a short-lasting slump in oil prices attributable to sharply rising numbers of producing wells in the United States. In March, however, the oil price rebounded to continue the upward trajectory in response to, among others distressing news from Libya where local militia broke into the production facilities zone in Sharara, one of the largest oil fields in the country.
In the second quarter, the price of crude oil continued to rise, pushed by lower crude production in Venezuela. Globally lower oil supply encouraged producers in North America to increase their output. In May, production in the United States (10.73m bbl/d) came close to the output volumes recorded by the global leader ­ Russia (11m bbl/day), causing a drop in oil prices at the end of May and beginning of June, in particular of the benchmark WTI grade.

The third quarter in the oil market was marked by growing risk of insufficient global supply. On the other hand, the Chinese-American trade war raised investor concerns over the economic slowdown and faltering global oil demand.
At the beginning of Q4 2018, crude oil prices reached their all-year high. In early October, a month-ahead Brent crude contract was worth USD 86.29/bbl. Then, in response to the exemption of eight countries from US sanctions banning the import of crude from Iran, the prices started to fall sharply. The threat of insufficient oil supply on the global market waned, which was soon reflected in the price of the commodity dropping 24% in November. At their meeting in December, OPEC members and countries cooperating with OPEC agreed to cut oil output in 2019 by 1.2m bbl/day.

Outlook for crude oil market
At the beginning of January 2019, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) revised downwards its 2019 Brent crude price forecast by about 0.8%, to USD 60.52/bbl and maintained its projections with respect to WTI of USD 54.19/bbl. EIA explained that the downward revision of the Brent crude price forecast was attributable to the planned record-high output in the US, expected to reach an average of 12.07m bbl/d in 2019.
In a longer term, the oil prices may grow. 2020 is the year of entry into force of the most recent regulations by the International Maritime Organization, imposing restrictions on fuels used in marine vessels, including those carrying crude oil.
Moreover, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) analysts, the oil prices may rise in the coming years driven by growing demand. The main sectors in which demand is expected to grow include production of plastics and petrochemicals in developing countries.
Regulatory environment
Regulatory environment in Poland
Energy Law The Energy Law is the main legal act governing the operation of the energy sector. In particular, it specifies the rules of development of the national energy policy, matters concerning the supply and use of fuels, energy and heat, and lays downs rules of operation applicable to energy companies. The Energy Law also defines the bodies competent for matters of fuel and energy management.
As at December 31st 2018, the PGNiG Group held the following licences granted by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (URE) under the Energy Law:

· four licences to trade in gas fuels (PGNiG, PGNiG OD, PST, PST Europe Sales);
· two licences to trade in natural gas with foreign partners (PGNiG, PST);
· four licences to produce electricity (PGNiG, PGNiG TERMIKA, PGNiG TERMIKA EP, PSG Inwestycje Sp. z o.o.);
· four licences to trade in electricity (PGNiG, PGNiG OD, PGNiG TERMIKA, PGNiG TERMIKA EP);
· two licences to produce heat (PGNiG TERMIKA, PGNiG TERMIKA EP);
· one licence to trade in heat (PGNiG TERMIKA EP);
· two licences to transmit heat (PGNiG TERMIKA, PGNiG TERMIKA EP);
· two licences to liquefy natural gas and regasify LNG at LNG regasification plants (PGNiG, PSG);
· one licence to store gas fuel in storage facilities (GSP);
· one licence to distribute gas fuels (PSG); · one licence to distribute electricity (PGNiG
TERMIKA EP).

EIA - U.S. Energy Information Administration.
International Energy Agency (IEA) - an international organization based in Paris, affiliated to the OECD. Its purpose is to prevent interruptions in crude oil supplies

In 2018, a number of amendments were introduced to the Energy Law, all of them of high relevance to the functioning of Poland's natural gas and electricity markets.

The Energy Law of April 10th 1997 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2018, item 755 as amended).

95

Act on Mandatory Stocks Act on Mandatory Stocks lays down the rules of creating and maintaining emergency stocks of natural gas, and procedures for monitoring and proper enforcement of the act. The act also sets out the rules to be followed in the event of threat to Poland's energy security.
Energy Efficiency Act The Energy Efficiency Act establishes an energy efficiency obligation scheme which implements into the Polish legal system the provisions of Directive 2012/27/ EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC. According to these laws, entities covered by the statutory obligation are required to reach final energy savings of 1.5% per year. The Energy Efficiency Act indicates two principal ways to fulfil this obligation: · to implement a project or projects desi-
gned to improve end users' energy efficiency; · to obtain an energy efficiency certificate and to submit the certificate to the President of URE for redemption. The act provides for the option to fulfil the obligation by paying a substitution fee. In principle, though, it may not be higher than 30% of the 2016 obligation, 20% of the 2017 obligation and 10% of the 2018 obligation. The act significantly increases the substitution fee and provides for its annual indexation. It also imposes an obligation to conduct an energy efficiency audit every four years.

Capacity Market Act The Capacity Market Act defines the organisation of the capacity market and sets out the rules of provision of the service consisting in remaining on standby to supply electricity to the power system. The act aims to ensure the security of electricity supplies to end users by establishing a dedicated support system. Following the entry into force of the Capacity Market Act, both PGNiG and PGNiG TERMIKA will generate additional revenue.
In 2018, the Capacity Market Act was amended following the adoption of the Act on the Promotion of Electricity from High-Efficiency Cogeneration. The amendments clarified mutual relations between the support systems.

The Act on Stocks of Crude Oil, Petroleum Products and Natural Gas, and on Rules to be Followed in the Event of Threat to National Fuel Security or Disruptions on the Petroleum Market of February 16th 2007 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2017, item 1210, as amended)

Act on the Promotion of Electricity from High-Efficiency Cogeneration The Act on the Promotion of Electricity from High-Efficiency Cogeneration sets out a framework for the provision of support for electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration units and provision of guarantees of origin for such electricity. The mechanism of support for electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration (based on certificates of origin) expired at the end of 2018. As of the beginning of 2019, a new mechanism is in place to encourage the construction of new cogeneration units and to maintain electricity generation from existing high-efficiency cogeneration sources, which would not be able to operate without such support due to a financial gap in operating expenses. The support will only be available for units for which carbon dioxide emissions intensity does not exceed 450 kg/MWh of generated energy (electricity and heat jointly).

The Energy Efficiency Act of May 20th 2016 (Journal of Laws of 2016, item 831).
Capacity Market Act of 8 December 2017 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2018, Item 9).

Act on Special Hydrocarbon Tax of July 25th 2014 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2016, item 979).
The Council of Ministers' Regulation of April 24th 2017 on the minimum level of diversification of foreign sources of gas supplies (Journal of Laws of 2017, item 902).

Act on Special Hydrocarbon Tax The Act on Special Hydrocarbon Tax (SHT) stipulates a special tax regime, where the tax base is the surplus of revenue generated from hydrocarbon extraction activities in a given year over the eligible expense incurred in the tax year.
The obligation to pay the tax arises on revenue generated from January 1st 2020 onwards, with the proviso that the record-keeping obligations related to SHT and obligations to submit SHT filings to the relevant tax authorities are to be fulfilled as of January 1st 2016.
In December 2018, a draft Act Repealing the SHT Act and Amending Certain Other Acts was published on the Government Legislation Centre's website, aimed at repealing the SHT and accelerating the levy of taxes on the production of certain minerals. The proposed repeal of a special hydrocarbon tax is a positive news for PGNiG Group, whereas acceleration of the application of a mineral extraction tax would mean an additional tax burden for the Group since 2019.
Geological and Mining Law The Geological and Mining Law specifies, among other things, the rules of licensing the exploration for and extraction of minerals as well as the terms and conditions for performing geological work, extraction of minerals from deposits, storage of waste matter in rock mass (including in worked-out caverns), protection of mineral deposits, underground waters and other components of the environment in connection with geological works and extraction of minerals.
Since 2016, in accordance with the amended Geological and Mining Law, a single licence is granted for exploration, appraisal, and extraction of hydrocarbons. The grant of such combined licence is only possible in tender proceedings carried out ex officio. It should be pointed out that in 2017 the

Minister of Environment announced the tender procedure for combined licence grant with respect to eight out of the ten areas. In 2018, 16 areas were put out to tender in two rounds.
In June 2018, the Geological and Mining Law was amended to introduce material changes to the hydrocarbon licensing system. Under the amended law, a business entity may apply for an open door licence for the exploration for and appraisal of hydrocarbon deposits while under the previous regime, licences were granted exclusively for areas designated by the government. It is now also possible to apply for another conversion of a hydrocarbon exploration and appraisal licence into a combined exploration, appraisal, and production licence by the end of 2018; and the obligation to provide security in case of non-performance or improper performance of the conditions specified in the licence has been waived.
National Commodity Policy In 2018, the Minister of Environment announced draft assumptions for the National Commodity Policy. The document will be the basis for further work on the National Commodity Policy that may be undertaken and continued by representatives of all ministries, businesses operating in the sectors concerned, scientific institutions and social groups. The adoption of the National Commodity Policy will lead to a number of legislative changes that will affect the terms on which licensed activities are conducted in Poland.
Diversification Regulation Regulation `Diversification Regulation ` prescribes the maximum share of gas that may be imported from a single country of origin in the total volume of gas imported in a given year. For 2017-2022, the maximum share is 70%, and for 2023-2026 ­ 33%.

98

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

System Regulation The Regulation on specific conditions for the operation of the gas system specifies the rules of operation of the gas system set forth in the Energy Law. In particular, it lays down the rules and conditions for applying for grid connection, procedure for trading in gas fuel and ability to provide services in the gas system, including the manner of handling complaints, balancing and transmission constraints management; it also outlines the terms of cooperation between market participants.
According to the Minister of Energy's Regulation of January 10th 2017 equipment and installations used for gas fuel transmission may be only connected to gas transmission networks with a diameter of DN 1,300 or higher. The regulation has also raised the capacity threshold for customers authorised to be connected to the transmission network from 5,000 to 45,000 cm/h, thus expanding the operating reach of distribution companies and stabilising the gas fuel transmission and distribution market.
The Regulation of the Minister of Energy of September 21st 2018 amending the Regulation on specific conditions for the operation of the gas system introduced the institution of an emergency supplier which would be responsible for the supply of gas to an end user if their contractual supplier ceases to supply gas for reasons attributable to such contractual supplier.
Tariff Regulation Tariff Regulation sets out the principles for determining tariffs for gas fuels, in particular the calculation of prices and rates, as well as the rules of settlements between market participants. Currently, the prices of natural gas sold to households are regulated.
In 2018, PGNiG Obrót Detaliczny held gas fuel trading tariff, Gas Storage Poland applied gas storage services tariffs, whereas

PSG applied gas distribution services tariffs and liquefied natural gas services tariffs.
In Generation segment, their own tariffs held: PGNiG TERMIKA (for heat generated) and PGNiG TERMINKA EP (for heat generated and electricity distribution services).
European regulatory environment

Regulation of the Minister of Economy of March 15th 2018 on specific conditions for the operation of the gas system (Journal of Laws of 2018, item 640).

Third Energy Package In 2018, the Third Energy Package continued to be the all-inclusive framework governing the European energy (gas and electricity) market. The Package included five acts of law drawn up by EU institutions in 2009.
The objective of the Package is to boost competition on the European energy market and create the internal energy market based on mechanisms such as ownership unbundling, organisation of cooperation between regulators and energy companies (ACER, ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G), or introduction of network codes.
Directive on the Promotion of Clean and Energy Efficient Road Transport Vehicles Directive on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles, referred to as the Clean Vehicles Directive, complements the EU's horizontal legislation on public contracts award. The directive requires that ­ when awarding public contracts ­ lifetime energy and environmental impacts, including energy consumption, be taken into account when purchasing road transport vehicles, which is to promote and stimulate the market for clean and energy-efficient vehicles, reduce emissions of CO2 and of other pollutants as well as improve energy efficiency.

Regulation (EU) No. 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 20th 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply.

SoS Regulation SoS Regulation entered into force on November 1st 2017. Its purpose is to prevent disruptions in the supply of natural gas to the Member States, or to mitigate their impact if they occur.
In 2018, work was under way to harmonise the Polish legislation and procedures in place within the PGNiG Group with the requirements of the SoS Regulation.

Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/460 of 16 March 2017 establishing a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas

TAR NC Regulation The purpose of Commission Regulation (EU) is to reduce discrepancies between tariff models applied in individual Member States. Legislative work carried out by the European Commission, aiming to unify the tariff structures in the EU, is designed to facilitate cross-border trade conducted by participants of the European gas market.

Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/459 of 16 March 2017 establishing a network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems and repealing Regulation (EU) No 984/2013

NC CAM Regulation NC CAM Regulation is to promote the building of correctly operating interconnected transmission network systems, which would provide the foundation for further development of the EU internal energy market through harmonisation of mechanisms that ensure transparent and non-discriminatory terms of transmission capacity allocation.
The provisions of the NC CAM Regulation apply to interconnections between Member States. In order to ensure that all parties can gain access to interconnector transmission capacities on equal and non-discriminatory terms, the allocation of capacity is made through auctions organised by transmission system operators, at which intraday, daily, monthly, quarterly and annual products are offered.

EU ETS The EU Emission Trading Scheme imposes the obligation to account for CO2 emissions and regulates the allocation of free emis-

sion allowances for heat and electricity. Under the ETS Directive, emitters of greenhouse gases (including CO2) are obliged to account for their emissions by surrendering their CO2 emission allowances by April 30th each year for the preceding year. If the number of emission allowances is too small, the excess emissions penalty of EUR 100 per tonne of CO2 is imposed, and the operator must acquire and surrender the necessary number of emission allowances.
In 2018, work was continued on the Innovation Fund ("IF"), aimed to support the RES technologies, energy storage and capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The IF, in accordance with the adopted revision of the EU ETS Directive, would be supported by EU ETS emission allowances. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, the European Commission submitted a draft delegated act establishing the IF.
At the same time, work was under way on a draft list of sectors exposed to carbon leakage. Inclusion of the natural gas production sector in the list would mean additional emission allowances. Public consultation is being conducted by the European Commission, expected to last until the end of January 2019.
Regulatory risk
Elimination of administrative price control
In connection with the ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU of September 10th 2015 on the system of regulated gas fuel prices, changes to the regulations on administrative price control were required. PGNiG expressed its opinion that liberalised gas prices were the key element of the overall gas market liberalisation. At the same time, the Company emphasised that the process must be conducted in such a manner as to guarantee billing continuity in contracts

100

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

with customers, as the inability to guarantee continuity of billing is a risk to the Company's business.
Obligation to diversify gas imports
The Council of Ministers' Regulation of April 24th 2017 on the minimum level of diversification of foreign sources of gas supplies prescribes the maximum share of gas imported from a single country in total gas imports in a given year. In 2017­2022, the share may not exceed 70%.
Upholding of the decision to exempt the OPAL pipeline from the Third Energy Package regime
Pursuant to two decisions issued under Article 36 of Directive 2009/73 of July 13th 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/54 /EC, Opal Gastransport GmbH, the operator of the OPAL pipeline, benefits from the exemption from the need to grant third-party access to transmission capacity. The infrastructure is used by Gazprom, which has access to 50% (under the decision of 2009) and in fact 100% (under the decision of 2016) of the OPAL pipeline's capacity. As a result of the recent exemption from the third-party access (TPA) rule, Gazprom is able to transmit approximately 55 bcm of natural gas annually to the European Union, bypassing the traditional supply routes (the Yamal and Bratstvo gas pipelines).
The exemption decisions adopted by the European Commission and the German regulator Bundesnetzagentur in 2016 allow the Russian gas major to implement its long-term strategy of preventing the development of supply diversification projects in Central and Eastern Europe and thus make the region dependent on Russian gas. In

view of these facts, PGNiG, PST, the Polish government and Naftohaz (a Ukrainian gas trading company) filed complaints against the decision of the European Commission to the General Court of the European Union.
On December 14th 2017, one of the complaints filed by PST was found inadmissible due to formal reasons. A decision to the same effect was served on March 21st 2018 with respect to the complaint filed by PGNIG. Two appeals were submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union against the decision of December 14th 2017 concerning PST's complaint.. As regards PGNiG, an appeal was lodged on May 24th 2018. It should be noted that the General Court has not yet issued any ruling concerning the subject matter of any of the proceedings.

Lower amount of EU funding allocated to gas projects

Work is currently under way on a new text of the ERDF Regulation. The draft proposed by the European Commission provided for, among other things, the exclusion of projects related to transport of gas, processing and burning of fossil fuels. The exclusion of the natural gas industry, particularly in the area of distribution, would pose a significant risk to the PGNiG Group and its ambitious plans for gas network rollout in Poland.
Winter package (electricity) ­ Clean energy for all Europeans Some provisions of the legislative proposals included in the `Clean energy for all Europeans' package pose a significant threat to the PGNiG Group's operations. First of all, the introduction of an emission limit (at the currently proposed level of 550g of CO2 per 1 kWh generated) as a criterion for participation of an installation in the capacity mar-

Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the European Regional Development Fund and on specific provisions concerning the Investment for growth and jobs goal and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006

101

ket may constitute a legislative barrier for the PGNiG Group's CHP plants to enter this market.
Another source of risk is the proposed introduction of binding targets for Member States regarding the share of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency and individual trajectories to achieve these targets.
New EU legislative package for the natural gas market
The new European Commission (to be appointed by the newly elected European Parliament in 2019) is likely to commence legislative work on a new European regulatory framework for the natural gas market (the Fourth Package). Several reports by external consultants are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2019, which are to help identify the potential direction for the new gas sector regulatory framework.
The key risk in this area lies in potential failure to recognise the regional specificities and adoption of EU law that would adversely impact the development of the gas sector in Poland.
Draft amendment to Directive 2009/73
The proposed amendment to Directive 2009/73 announced in the third quarter of 2017 is aimed at confirming the applicability of the directive to the infrastructure associated with imports to the European Union, extending as far as the limits of the EU's jurisdiction, understood as the limit of territorial seas and exclusive economic zones of Member States. The directive addresses the demands made by some entities operating on the internal market in natural gas, including PGNiG, according to which it is necessary to define the limits of applicability of EU laws. Under the existing legal regula-

tions this is unclear, which disrupts the operation of the internal market in natural gas and adversely affects the integration of Member States.
Non-compliance risk
PGNiG has an organisationally and functionally separated Compliance unit. In line with the compliance risk management model, each area at risk of non-compliance was assigned a dedicated compliance risk area manager (leader), who is in charge of ensuring that compliance standards are met.
Compliance risks (risks of breaching compliance standards) may arise in various areas and may materialise: · immediately as fines, damages, com-
pensation or other liabilities the Company may be required to pay; · as damage to the Company's image, which could also have its financial implications; · in the Company's operations and as a factor affecting the value for stakeholders, including shareholders.

The segment's revenue rose by PLN 1,553m, to PLN 7,671m, which represents a 25% increase on 2017. At the end of 2018, the Exploration and Production segment's operating profit was PLN 3,956m, up PLN 1,154m year on year. EBITDA came in at PLN 5,019m, up PLN 1,154m year on year.
Compared with 2017, the segment's gas production increased by 9 mcm of high-methane gas equivalent. Lower output in Poland (down by 31 mcm) and Norway (down by 10 mcm) was offset by higher production of nitrogen-rich gas in Pakistan (by 50 mcm, measured as high-methane gas equivalent). In 2018, crude oil sales rose by 140 thousand tonnes year on year, including by 26 thousand tonnes in Poland, and by 114 thousand tonnes in Norway, mainly on increased production from Skarv and Gina Krog fields.
The segment's operating expenses increased by PLN 401m (12%) year on year, mainly due to higher costs of dry wells and seismic surveys written off (up by PLN 287m year on year), employee benefits (up by PLN 72m year on year) and transmission services (up by PLN 64m year on year).
Domestic operations
Licences in Poland As at January 1st 2018, PGNiG held 48 licences: 22 licences for exploration for and appraisal of crude oil and natural gas deposits, 1 suspended licence (as the conversion procedure was not completed and the licence expired after the relevant applica-

tion was filed with the licensing authority) and 25 combined (exploration, appraisal and production) licences. As at December 31st 2018, PGNiG held 47 licences: 20 licences for exploration for and appraisal of oil and gas deposits and 27 combined licences (one licence was relinquished).
As at December 31st 2018, PGNiG held a total of 203 production licences in Poland. In 2018, PGNiG was awarded two new production licences (Zbszy and Dzików Stary), 34 licences were amended, and 12 were discontinued.
Work performed Throughout 2018, PGNiG was involved in crude oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal projects in the Carpathian Mountains, Carpathian Foothills, Sudetian Monocline, and Polish Lowlands, both on its own and jointly with partners. Out of the 36 boreholes drilled in 2018, the target depth was reached by 32, including: four research, nine exploration, 13 appraisal and six production wells.
As at the end of 2018, formation test results were obtained from 21 boreholes (one research, nine exploration, five appraisal and six production wells). The 21 wells with known formation test results included: 17 positive and three dry wells (all of which were exploration wells without a commercial flow of hydrocarbons that were abandoned) and one research well (abandoned ­ due to its research nature, the well is not subject to reservoir classification).

In 2018 the E&P segment recorded operating profit in the amount of as much as PLN 3,956 million.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Sales of key products The main products sold by the segment are crude oil, high-methane gas and nitrogen-rich gas. Other products, obtained in the process of crude refining, include crude condensate, sulfur, and propane-butane. Some of the produced nitrogen-rich gas is further treated into high-methane gas at the Odolanów and Grodzisk Wielkopolski nitrogen rejection units. Apart from high-methane gas, the cryogenic processing of nitrogen-rich gas yields such products as LNG, gaseous and liquid helium, and liquid nitrogen. Part of the natural gas extracted in Poland is sold directly from gas fields to non-PGNiG Group customers, and also within the PGNiG Group. Natural gas extracted and not sold in the upstream segment is transferred for sale to the Trade and Storage segment.
Rail deliveries of crude oil (65% of sales) were made to the refinery of the LOTOS Group in Gdask and to Orlen Poludnie's Trzebinia Production Plant (the ORLEN Group). In 2018, crude oil was also delivered by road to Orlen Poludnie's Jedlicze Production Plant (5% of sales), and via the PERN pipeline - to TOTSA TOTAL Oil Trading SA (30% of sales). Crude oil is sold at market prices.
Seismic surveys, drilling and well services In 2018, the Geology and Hydrocarbon Production Branch of PGNiG acquired 470.78 km of 2D seismic data and 1,049.60 km2 of 3D seismic data. PGNiG Group companies provide seismic survey, well and drilling services both for other Group members and to external customers.
Underground gas storage facilities PGNiG's Exploration and Production segment's gas system includes two storage facilities for L group gas (Daszewo UGSF and Bonikowo UGSF), whose main role is to regu-

late the operation of the nitrogen-rich gas system and store gas from nitrogen-rich gas production facilities.

Exploration, appraisal and extraction of coal bed methane In 2018, as part of the second phase (research and demonstration) of the Geo-Metan project involving exploration for, appraisal and extraction of coal bed methane, detailed criteria were determined for selecting drilling sites for pre-mining coal bed methane extraction, addressed to three mining companies: Jastrzbska Spólka Wglowa SA (JSW), PGG, and Tauron Wydobycie SA. The partners provided PGNiG with a list of mines meeting those criteria. Geological and mining information as well as formal and legal data were gathered and analysed during working meetings to select the mines for further work under the project. As a result, three locations were selected: the Budryk Hard Coal Mine (JSW), the Ruda Ruch Bielszowice Hard Coal Mine (PGG) and the Brzeszcze Mining Plant (Tauron Wydobycie). In 2018, contract negotiations were commenced.
Regardless of the status of the above projects, it wasdecided to start a preparing a plan of geological operations within the licence area which ­ in line with current assumptions ­ is to cover milowice, an undeveloped hard coal deposit with associated gas. The area covered by the requested licence is now being delineated.
As part of the work performed on the Gilowice-1 and Gilowice 2H wells and in the Midzyrzecze licence area, in 2018 a set of downhole pumps were installed at the Gilowice-1 well, and a pumping operation began. After PGNiG obtained a licence for exploration for and appraisal of coal bed deposits and for extraction of methane in the Midzyrzecze area, in 2018 the Gilowice-3K and Gilowice-4H wells were dril-

led (connected by intersection). Hydraulic fracturing operations were performed in the Gilowice-4H well and work to prepare the well for the pumping set commenced. In early 2019, pumping operations are planned to commence in both wells (Gilowice-3K and Gilowice-4H). In 2018, in the Midzyrzecze licence area the drilling of the Midzyrzecze-4 well was also completed. The well has been temporarily secured and is awaiting further work.

Norway PGNiG UN holds interests in exploration and production licences on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the Norwegian Sea, in the North Sea, and in the Barents Sea. Jointly with partners, the company has been extracting hydrocarbons from the Skarv, Morvin, Vilje, Vale and Gina Krog fields and working on the development of the Ærfugl (formerly Snadd) and Skogul (formerly Storklakken) fields. Additionally, PGNiG UN is preparing to develop the Tommeliten Alpha deposit, acquired in 2018, and is considering the development of the Fogelberg discovery. In the other licence areas, the company is engaged in exploration projects.
The company's main asset is the Skarv field, which has been developed using a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. Since 2017, PGNiG UN has been extracting hydrocarbons from the Gina Krog field, which was developed using a new production platform in the North Sea. The other fields (Morvin, Vilje and Vale) comprise a group of wells connected to the existing production infrastructure.
In 2018, the company produced a total of 527 thousand tonnes of crude oil with other fractions (measured as tonnes of crude oil equivalent) and 538 mcm of natural gas from the Skarv, Morvin, Vilje, Vale,

and Gina Krog fields. The output was higher than planned, chiefly on the back of better-than-expected production from the Skarv, Morvin, Vilje and Gina Krog fields. A factor negatively affecting production volumes was a maintenance shutdown on the Vale field. In 2018, PGNiG and its partners continued to develop the Gina Krog field, which mainly included the drilling of successive production wells.
In 2018, PGNiG UN recorded an increase in its Norwegian reserves, from 83 mboe at the beginning of the year to 142 mboe at the end of 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to the acquisition of an interest in the PL044 licence, covering the Tommeliten Alpha discovery (the agreement, signed in October 2018, provides for the purchase of a 30% interest in the PL044 licence from Equinor Energy AS, resulting in a 42.38% interest in the Tommeliten Alpha field). The purchase price of the interest was approximately USD 220m, with January 1st 2018 marking the contractual transaction date.
In 2018, PGNiG UN and its partners continued to develop the Ærfugl and Skogul fields, with production launch scheduled for 2020. Development of the Ærfugl gas field means the fulfilment of strategic objectives by significantly increasing the production of natural gas to be supplied to Poland via Denmark through a new gas link called the Norwegian corridor. Both investment projects will be financed with funds generated in the course of PGNiG's operations in Norway.
In 2018, an APA 2017 round (Awards in Pre-defined Areas) was concluded, with PGNiG UN awarded interests in two exploration licences.
In early 2019, an APA 2018 round was concluded, with PGNiG UN awarded interests in three new exploration licences: · a 40% interest (as the operator) in the
PL838B licence area in the Norwegian

Sea; the other interest holders are: Aker BP (a 30% interest) and DEA (a 30% interest); · a 50% interest (as the operator) in the PL1017 licence area in the Norwegian Sea; the remaining 50% interest was acquired by Equinor; · a 35% interest (as a partner) in the PL1009 licence area in the Norwegian Sea; the remaining 65% interest was acquired by ConocoPhilips. Under the PL1009 licence, an exploration well will be drilled within two years. In addition, as the PL838B and PL1009 licence areas are located close to the Skarv field, PGNiG UN will be able to draw on its own oil and gas exploration experience in the region. The licences awarded to PGNiG UN during the last two APA licensing rounds have significant gas potential, which fits in with plans envisaging gas imports from Norway to Poland. The licence areas are located close to existing production and

pipeline infrastructure, which will make project work much simpler and faster.
Jointly with its partners, PGNiG UN also continued work in other exploration licence areas. Among other work, the potential of the PL839, PL850, and PL887 licence areas was evaluated. The exploration licence partners carry out necessary geological and geophysical surveys to precisely estimate the potential of the licence areas. After that period, drill-or-drop decisions are made.
Based on the results of geological surveys and economic analyses, PGNiG UN and its partners decided to relinquish the PL856 licence in 2018.
PGNiG UN holds a diversified portfolio of production and exploration licences. As at December 31st 2018, PGNiG UN held interests in 21 exploration and production licences, including as the operator of two licences.

Producing fields The Skarv field was brought on stream in December 2012. Currently it is developed with 16 wells connected to five subsea templates, which can support a further seven wells, adding much flexibility to the Skarv operations going forward. The Skarv FPSO has a long useful life and can be an attractive production

and transport hub for future discoveries in the region. Reserves: 20.9 mboe, including 12.4 mboe of natural gas and 8.5 mboe of crude oil and NGL.
The Gina Krog field is an oil and gas field brought on stream in June 2017 with five wells. Subsequent wells will continue to be drilled in

2019 in order to increase production capacity. Running simultaneous production and drilling operations helps optimise project financing. The field development plan provides for the construction of a new platform and for the deployment of an FSO unit with a capacity of 850,000 bbl for crude storage. Next, oil is transported by tankers for transshipment, while raw natural gas is transmitted to the Sleipner platform. Processed gas is pumped into the Gassled pipeline, while condensate and NGL are transported to the Kårstø plant in Norway. Reserves: 14.8 mboe, including 6.6 mboe of natural gas and 8.2 mboe of crude oil and NGL.

The Vale field is a gas and condensate field discovered in the North Sea in 1991. Despite the downtime seen in 2018, output from the Vale field is expected to rise in the coming years as a result of recent investments made in the Heimdal platform. Reserves: 1.3 mboe, including 0.7 mboe of natural gas and 0.6 mboe of crude oil.
The Morvin field was discovered in the Norwegian Sea in 2001. Oil is produced through two subsea templates. The field is tied back to the Åsgard B platform. Reserves: 1.2 mboe, including 0.4 mboe of natural gas and 0.8 mboe of crude oil and NGL.

The Vilje field is located in the central part of the North Sea, close to the Alvheim and Heimdal facilities. The field is developed with three subsea wells linked by pipeline to the Alvheim FPSO vessel. Oil reserves: 3.7 mboe.

Fields under development Tommeliten Alpha is a gas and condensate field located in the North Sea in the immediate vicinity of the Ekofisk field. Its reserves are likely to prove higher than confirmed to date, while the PL044 licence offers considerable potential

115

for further exploration work. According to the current schedule, first oil is expected in 2024. Reserves: 54.1 mboe, including 36.1 mboe of natural gas and 18 mboe of crude oil and NGL.
Ærfugl is a gas and condensate field discovered in the Skarv licence area. Six more wells are to be tied back to the Skarv FPSO and existing transport infrastructure. Production from the new installations is to start in 2020. Reserves: 30.5 mboe, including 21.4 mboe of natural gas and 9.1 mboe of crude oil and NGL.
Skogul is on oil field situated in the North Sea near the Vilje field. The development plan assumes drilling one well connected to the subsea installation on the Vilje field, and then using the existing infrastructure, including the Alvheim FPSO platform. Drilling and completion of a production well is scheduled for 2019. Reserves: 3.2 mboe, including 0.3 mboe of natural gas and 2.9 mboe of crude oil.
Prospects being explored/appraised Fogelberg is a condensate and gas prospect located in the Norwegian Sea, north-east of the Morvin field. The Island Innovator semi-submersible rig was used to drill an appraisal well in the prospect in order to construct a contingent sidetrack and perform production tests. As at the end of 2018, data from the appraisal well was still being reviewed, and various field development scenarios were being considered. The data obtained from the appraisal well will help identify the recoverable reserves of natural gas and condensate with a greater degree of accuracy. Reserves (preliminary data): 12.2 mboe, including 8.8 mboe of natural gas and 3.4 mboe of crude oil and NGL.
Sales of hydrocarbons Crude oil is sold directly from the fields to Shell International Trading and Shipping Company Ltd (crude from the Skarv, Vilje, Vale and Gina

Krog fields) and to TOTSA Total Oil Trading SA (from the Morvin field). All fields except for Vilje also produce associated gas, which is transferred via gas pipelines mainly to Germany, where it is offtaken by PST.
Pakistan PGNiG is engaged in exploration work in Pakistan under an agreement for hydrocarbon exploration and production in the Kirthar licence area executed between PGNiG and the government of Pakistan on May 18th 2005. The work is conducted jointly with Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL), with production and expenses shared pro rata to the parties' interests in the licence: PGNiG (operator) ­ 70%, PPL ­ 30%. Exploration activities within the licence area have resulted in the discovery of two gas deposits - Rehman and Rizq.
Natural (nitrogen-rich) gas reserves attributable to PGNiG: 6.96 bcm (35.7 mboe) in Rehman field and 2.44 bcm (13.7 mboe) in the Rizq field.
Gas from the Rehman and Rizq fields is produced via facilities located in the Rehman field. PGNiG's share in the production from the Rehman and Rizq fields, carried out using seven wells in 2018, amounted to 200 mcm of gas (measured as high-methane gas equivalent). The Rizq-2 and Rehman-4 wells were brought on stream in February and May 2018, respectively. In February and September 2018, PGNiG also completed drilling work on the Rehman-4 and Roshan-1 wells, respectively. Currently, the drilling of the Rehman-5 well is being continued (well spudded in September 2018), and equipment is being moved in and rigged up for the drilling of the Rehman-6 and Rizq-3 wells.
United Arab Emirates In December 2018, PGNiG's bid for the acquisition of hydrocarbon exploration, appraisal and production rights in onshore block 5

116

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was selected. Following the selection of its bid, the Company acquired a 90% interest in the block. Agreements between PGNiG and the Ras Al Khaimah Petroleum Authority and RAK GAS LLC were signed in January 2019.
Libya Due to mounting safety issues in Libya in early H2 2014, PGNiG UNA gave notice of a force majeure to the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and started to scale back its field operations in the country.
Iran PGNiG decided to cancel its operations in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2018.
Geological services and seismic surveys In 2018, Geofizyka Toru, a PGNiG Group company, carried out the following tasks: · seismic data acquisition in: Poland, Cro-
atia, Bulgaria, Myanmar, Egypt, Tunisia, Colombia, and Ukraine; · seismic data processing and interpretation in: Poland, France, India, Pakistan and Colombia. The foreign markets where EXALO was most active in 2018 were Pakistan, Kazachstan, and Ukraine.

Capital expenditures in 2018
In 2018, PGNiG's capital expenditure in the Exploration and Production segment amounted to PLN 989m, 14% more than in 2017. The key exploration projects (in terms of allocated CAPEX) in 2018 included: drilling of the Pniewy 5KH appraisal well (PLN 30.5m), the Krobielewko 8 appraisal well (PLN 25.6m) and fracturing and formation tests in the Kramarzówka 2H well (PLN 35m). PGNiG's expenditure on exploration activities in Poland and abroad totalled PLN 764m.
Capital expenditure made in 2018 in Pakistan totalled PLN 94m, and was 6% lower than in 2017. Capital expenditure made in 2018 in Norway reached PLN 302m (net of acquisitions). Work continued to drill additional production wells in the Gina Krog field, with a view to optimising the project financing. In 2018, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved development plans for the Ærfugl i Skogul fields. Production from these fields is scheduled to commence in 2020. In line with its strategic objectives, PGNiG UN completed a major transaction consisting in the acquisition of interest in the Tommeliten Alpha field from Equinor. The field is currently under development.

Risks

Resource discoveries and estimates Poland Norway
The main risk inherent in exploration activities is the risk of failure to discover hydrocarbons, i.e. exploration risk. This means that not all identified leads and prospects actually have deposits of hydrocarbons which can qualify as an accumulation. The existence of a hydrocarbon accumulation depends on the occurrence of a number of geological conditions. In addition, the actual quantity and quality of accumulated hydrocarbons may differ from estimates. If the results of successful exploration in the form of new reserves do not balance production from existing fields, the recoverable reserves in the PGNiG Group's fields will gradually decrease as the production continues.

Tight gas - natural gas trapped in isolated pores of low permeability rocks such as sandstones or carbonates.

Exploration for unconventional deposits of gas
Poland A risk associated with exploration for unconventional gas in Poland relates to the lack of proved reserves of tight gas and reserves in unconventional Miocene formations. Exploration for shale gas has now been closed, and the experience gained from such projects will

allow PGNiG to minimise risks associated with exploration for tight gas. Even if the existence of in-place tight gas resources is confirmed, production may prove uneconomic due to insufficient recovery rates and high investment expenditure necessary to drill wells and construct production facilities.
Competition Poland
Both in Poland and abroad there is a risk of competition from other companies seeking licences for exploration and appraisal of hydrocarbon deposits, although it should be noted that this risk has significantly diminished in the Polish market over the past year. Certain competitors of PGNiG, especially those active globally, enjoy strong market positions and have greater financial resources than those available to the Group. Thus, it is probable that such companies would submit their bids in tender procedures and be able to acquire promising licences, offering better terms than PGNiG could offer given its financial and human resources. This competitive advantage of oil majors is particularly important on the international market.
Delayed work Poland Norway
Under the applicable Polish laws and regulations, the process of obtaining a licence for exploration and appraisal of crude oil and natural gas reserves lasts from one to one and a half years. In foreign markets such procedures may even take up to two years from the time the winning bid is awarded until the actual contract is ratified. Prior to the commencement of field work, the Company is also required to make a number of arrangements, for instance to obtain legal permits and approvals for entering the area, and to meet the environmental protection requirements and, in some cases, requirements related to

118

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

the protection of archaeological sites. It is also required to hold tenders to select a contractor. All this delays the execution of an agreement with a contractor by another few months. Frequently the waiting time for customs clearance of imported equipment is very long. All these factors create the risk of delays in the start of exploration work.
Safety, environmental protection and health regulations
Poland Norway The need to ensure compliance with environmental laws in Poland and abroad may significantly increase the PGNiG Group's operating expenses. Currently, the Group incurs significant capital expenditure and costs to ensure compliance of its operations with the ever more complex and stringent regulations concerning safety and health at work, as well as environmental protection. Offshore upstream operations carry a significant risk of environmen-

tal pollution resulting from oil spills. The risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, and field operators have implemented a number of barriers and technical solutions to mitigate the risk.
Cost of exploration Poland
Capital intensity of an exploration project depends on prices of energy and materials. Cost of exploratory work is especially sensitive to steel prices, which are passed onto prices of casing pipes and production tubing used in drilling. An increase in prices of energy and materials translates into higher costs of exploratory work. Profitability of foreign exploration projects also depends to a significant extent on prices of oil derivative products and on exchange rates.

119

Unforeseen events and emergencies Poland Norway
Hydrocarbon deposits developed by the PGNiG Group are usually located at great depths, which involves extremely high pressures and, in many cases, the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Consequently, the risk of hydrocarbon blowout or leakage is very high, which in turn may pose a threat to people (employees and local population), the natural environment and production equipment.
Legislative changes Poland Norwegia
In some countries, exploration and production activities may be hindered by frequent and unexpected changes in legislation, which may give rise to particularly serious risks in countries with authoritarian regimes. The risk is low in Norway, given the country's stable legal regime governing the oil industry operations.
Political and economic situation Grupa PGNiG
Some countries where the PGNiG Group is conducting exploration are threatened by armed conflicts and terrorist attacks, which may lead to limitation, suspension or even discontinuation of such activities.
The PGNiG Group's operations are also exposed to the risk of social or political unrest in some regions. Changes of governments may result in withholding issuance of petroleum licences. Those countries are also at risk of internal conflicts and civil unrest due to poverty and demographic issues. If these risks materialise, the Company's operations may be limited, suspended or discontinued.

Development prospects
In 2019, PGNiG plans to produce in Poland 3.9 bcm of natural gas (measured as high-methane gas equivalent), and 0.8m tonnes of crude oil and condensate.
The plans for 2019 in Poland include development and tie-in of 53 wells, development of 7 fields and modernisation and extension of exsisting installations.
Together with the Polish Geological Institute - National Research Institute, PGNiG will continue the research project into the application of the fracturing technology to extract coal bed methane in Gilowice. Thanks to this technology, in the future PGNiG will be able to increase its domestic production capacity. Coal bed methane may be an important element of national energy security based on production of hydrocarbons from domestic resources, while mine demethanization will improve the work safety of miners and contribute to reducing emissions of methane, an aggressive greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.
On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, PGNiG UN, as a project partner, will continue to produce hydrocarbons from the Skarv, Morvin, Vilje, Vale, and Gina Krog fields and will proceed with the development of the Snadd and Gina Krog fields. The company will also work towards ensuring stable, predictable and long-term gas supplies to Poland. These efforts will include analysis of infrastructure scenarios for transmission of Norwegian gas to Poland, but also potential acquisitions of gas fields in Norway. At the beginning of 2019, the number of licences in which PGNiG UN holds interests will increase to 24 following the awards in the most recent APA 2018 licensing round.
PGNiG UN intends to continue acquiring interests in new licence areas by participating in annual APA and in regular licensing rounds. The company may seek to acquire new licence

120

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

areas through farm-in (purchase of interests from other companies) or farm-down (exchange of interests with other companies) arrangements. In the future, PGNiG UN may participate, as a partner, in drilling projects within the Arctic Zone, in connection, among other things, with its holding of an interest in the PL 850 licence area in the Barents Sea.
As regards Pakistan, plans for 2019 include completion of drilling and then testing and bringing on stream of the Rehman-5 production well, in parallel with the spudding of the Rehman-6 and Rizq-3 production wells, which will require mobilising a second drilling rig. In 2019, PGNiG is also planning to start drilling the Rehman-7 and Rizq-4 wells. In parallel with the drilling campaign, work will be carried out to

expand the capacity of the production infrastructure and consecutively tie in new wells for commercial production. In 2019, the Rizq3, Rehman-5 and Rehman-6 wells are scheduled to come on stream. With respect to continuing exploration work, the Pakistan Branch is also planning to complete some seismic data acquisitions commenced in 2018, namely the 3D seismic survey over the W1 prospect and the 2D seismic survey over the W2 prospect.
As regards seismic services, work planned for 2019 includes 2D and 3D seismic data acquisitions in Poland (mainly for PGNiG) and abroad, including in Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Egypt, Mozambique, Hungary and Ukraine.

2018

In 2018, the Trade and Storage segment reported an operating loss of PLN -1,037m, a further deterioration (by PLN 397m) on 2017. At the EBITDA level, the segment recorded a loss of PLN -848m, PLN 413m further into the negative territory compared with 2017, when the Group generated an EBITDA of PLN -435m. The segment's revenue reached PLN 31,704m, up by PLN 5,165m (after the presentation changes made to ensure compliance with IFRS 15) year on year.
In 2018, there was a significant increase in the segment's operating expenses, which went up by PLN 5,561m (or 20%) to PLN 32,741m. The segment's poorer performance was attributable to the effect of a 30% year-on-year increase in market prices of hydrocarbons on gas procurement cost. At the end of 2018, the stocks of PGNiG's gas held in underground high-methane gas storage facilities stood at approximately 2.3 bcm, close to the level recorded at the end of 2017.
Operations in 2018
Trade in Poland In Poland, where the PGNiG Group is the largest natural gas supplier, the Trade and Storage segment sells natural gas produced from domestic fields as well as imported gas. On August 1st 2014, the structure of the PGNiG Group changed: retail operations were sepa-

rated from the wholesale gas business, the latter remaining with PGNiG. Retail sales and customer service was transferred to PGNiG OD, a new company.
Wholesale market - PGNiG
Gas imports In 2018, PGNiG purchased natural gas mainly under the long-term agreements and contracts specified below: · Contract with OOO Gazprom Export for
sale of natural gas to the Republic of Poland, dated September 25th 1996, effective until 2022 (the Yamal contract); · Contract with Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) for sale of liquefied natural gas, dated June 29th 2009, effective until 2034 (the Qatar contract), and supplementary agreement to the long-term agreement of March 2017 (effective from beginning of 2018 to June 2034). PGNiG also received gas under medium- and short-term contracts for grid deliveries and LNG supply (e.g. the five-year contract which entered into force in 2018 for nine liquefied natural gas shipments from Centrica LNG Company Limited).

In 2018, the imported gas volume was 13.5 bcm. Gas purchases from sources east of Poland fell by 0.7 bcm compared with 2017. LNG deliveries increased significantly, from 1.7bcm in 2017 to 2.7 bcm 2018.

In 2018, PGNiG took further steps to diversify its gas supply sources and build a gas acquisition portfolio: · on September 28th 2018, two firm long-
-term contracts for supply of liquefied natural gas were signed with Venture Global Calcasieu Pass, LLC, and Venture Global Plaquemines LNG, LLC. Each contract provides for the purchase by PGNiG of approximately 1 million tonnes of LNG (i.e. approximately 1.35 bcm of natural gas after regasification) annually for 20 years. The deliveries may be further traded by the Company on international markets

and will be made on a free-on-board basis; · on November 8th 2018, a firm long-term
contract was concluded for supply of liquefied natural gas from Cheniere Marketing International, LLP. The contract provides for the purchase of LNG by the Company and its deliveries to the LNG Terminal in winoujcie, and was made for a period of 24 years. The supplies will be made on a Delivered Ex-Ship basis. Under the contract, PGNiG will purchase ca. 0.73 bcm of gas after regasification in the entire period between 2019 and 2022, and approximately 39 bcm of gas after regasification in

126

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

the entire period between 2023 and 2042; · on December 19th 2018, a firm long-term
contract was concluded for supply of liquefied natural gas from Port Arthur LNG, LLC, a subsidiary of Sempra LNG & Midstream, LLC. The contract provides for the purchase by PGNiG of approximately 2m tonnes of LNG (i.e. approximately 2.7 bcm of natural gas after regasification) annually for 20 years. LNG supplied under the contract may be sold by PGNiG on international markets and will be delivered on a free-on-board basis from the Port Arthur production facility in Jefferson County, Texas, which is currently under construction and is planned to be completed in 2023 at the earliest.
Renegotiation of price terms under the contract with OOO Gazprom Export PGNiG continued its efforts to change the price terms under the Yamal contract as part of a procedure formally launched on November 1st 2014. On June 29th 2018, the Arbitration Institute issued a partial award in the arbitration proceedings instigated by PGNiG against PAO Gazprom and OOO Gazprom Export. In the partial award, issued on an ad hoc basis, the Arbitration Institute: · Found that in November 2014 PGNiG had
filed a valid and effective request to rene-

gotiate the contract price; · Confirmed the satisfaction of the condition
set forth in the Yamal contract which entitled PGNiG to demand a reduction of the contract price for the gas supplied by Gazprom under the Yamal contract, thus confirming that, in principle, PGNiG's request to determine a new, lower contract price was justified; and · Found, contrary to Gazprom's claims, that PGNiG had the right to change the contract price within the limits of the claim, also declaring that PGNiG's initial demand regarding the new price formula was too far-reaching; the Court also decided ad hoc that the new contract price would be determined later on in the proceedings. Under the Yamal contract, the new contract price determined ad hoc by the Arbitration Institute should apply with retroactive effect as of November 1st 2014. On October 1st 2018, Gazprom filed a complaint with the Stockholm Court of Appeals seeking reversal of the partial award issued by the Arbitration Institute. Notwithstanding the continuing arbitration proceedings, on November 1st 2017, PGNiG submitted another notice to PAO Gazprom/OOO Gazprom Export requesting renegotiation of the price terms of gas supplies.

LNG supplies In 2018, PGNiG received 23 LNG shipments totalling approximately 2m tonnes of LNG, which corresponds to approximately 29.8 TWh or 2.7 bcm of natural gas after regasification.
As a result of execution of the supplementary agreement with Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited, the total volume of LNG that PGNiG may receive under the long-term contracts with Qatargas rose to 2m tonnes (equivalent to about 2.7 bcm of gas after regasification) in 2018, and to 2.17m tonnes per year (equivalent to about 2.9 bcm of grid gas) in 2019­2020. In 2018, PGNiG received 18 LNG shipments under the long-term contracts with Qatargas. The volume of LNG imported from Qatar was 1.65m tonnes, or 25.1 TWh of natural gas after regasification.
In June 2018, the Arctic Voyager tanker arrived at the winoujcie terminal, delivering nearly 140 kcm of LNG purchased by PGNiG under the contract with Centrica LNG Company Limited. In the following years of the contract term (2019-2022), eight more LNG shipments will be delivered to Poland.
The PGNiG Group continues to purchase LNG under spot contracts through its trading office opened in London in February 2017. In 2018, four shipments of LNG purchased on the basis of spot contracts arrived in Poland: each tanker delivered approximately 140 kcm of LNG, equivalent to more than 80 mcm of gas after regasification.
Sale of gas by PGNiG Customers buy gas from PGNiG at market prices, in line with the formulas and mechanisms set out in the agreements concluded with them. In 2018, the largest amounts of gas in Poland were sold to industrial customers. The largest Polish customers in this category include Grupa Azoty SA, PKN Orlen SA, Grupa Lotos SA, Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA, Arcelor Mittal Poland SA, and KGHM Polska Mied SA.

In 2018, sales on the Polish Power Exchange (PPX) accounted for the largest portion of the PGNiG Group's total gas sales. The volume of gas sold by PGNiG on the PPX in 2018 increased by approximately 0.8 TWh year on year. To meet the obligation to sell 55% of the gas fed into the national transmission system through the exchange market, PGNiG has adopted a pricing policy covering all natural gas-linked instruments on the PPX, allowing it to offer natural gas to other market participants at prices corresponding to those on deregulated wholesale, exchange and OTC markets in Western and Northern Europe.
Competition In Poland, PGNiG competes with a number of companies selling natural gas to industrial customers. Despite this strong activity on the part of the competitors, in 2018 PGNiG was successful in its efforts to win and retain customers, securing its market position as a natural gas supplier. In 2018, PGNiG's sales of high-methane grid gas in Poland amounted to 172.5 TWh, having grown by 3% on 2017, from 167.4 TWh.
Gas exports - PGNiG In 2018, PGNiG continued to sell natural gas to the Ukrainian market. In October 2018, PGNiG and ERU Trading signed a contract to supply gas to Ukrtransgaz, the Ukrainian transmission network and gas storage facility operator. The contract provides for the supply of more than 200 mcm of natural gas in the period from October 2018 to May 1st 2019. In September 2018, PGNiG signed also another contract with Ukrtransgaz to use its underground gas storage facilities in Ukraine.
Sale of electricity On the electricity market, PGNiG is engaged primarily in wholesale trading. Total sales of electricity to trading companies and on the Polish Power Exchange accounted for more

128

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

than 85% of total electricity sales in 2018. Total trading volume in 2018 was over 6.8 TWh.
In 2018, PGNiG was engaged in wholesale trading in electricity and related products in Poland and Germany. In Poland, the Company traded on the OTC market and on the PPX. In Germany, the Company traded in spot contracts on the European Power Exchange as part of cross-border electricity trading. PGNiG also provided services under a commercial balancing agreement to PGNiG OD, PGNiG TERMIKA, and companies in the PGNiG TERMIKA Group. PST traded in electricity on the German market as part of exchange (EEX) and OTC transactions.
Capacity market Following auctions organised by Polskie Sieci Energetyczne in 2018 (related to the implementation of the capacity market and the capacity obligation), PGNiG entered into the following contracts: · the power plant at the Wierzchowice UGSF,
annual contracts for supples in 2021-2023 (net capacity of 17 MW); · Radoszyn-Lubiatów-Polcko generating units, annual contracts for supples in 2021-2023 (net capacity of 4.5 MW).
Retail market ­ PGNiG OD The focus of PGNiG OD's business is sale of natural gas (high-methane and nitrogen-rich gas), electricity, compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Gas purchase High-methane gas is procured from three main sources: (1) the PPX, (2) under a contract with PGNiG for delivery of gas to a virtual trading point in the transmission network operated by GAZ-SYSTEM, and (3) under a contract with PGNiG for delivery of gas to a physical trading point in Slubice. LNG is purchased under a bilateral agreement with PGNiG.

The largest share in the global volume of high-methane gas purchases was attributable to transactions on the PPX.
Given changes on the retail gas fuel market and the MIFID II requirements, the Contracts Policy was adapted to the current market conditions and contracts with customers exempt from the tariff approval requirement were separated. The remaining gas volumes covered by special price offers are hedged according to the level of utilisation of the price offers, to mitigate the risk that gas procurement costs would not correspond with current wholesale prices.
TGE - Polish Power Exchange
The largest share in the global volume of high-methane gas purchases by PGNiG OD was attributable to transactions on the PPX.
Sales of gas PGNiG OD's customer base includes consumers and non-consumers. Group 1-4 retail customers purchase gas used mainly for cooking and for water and home heating, as well as in shop-floor processes. Business customers buy gas both for the purposes of their industrial processes and for heating.
Sale of LNG and CNG The pricing policy for both LNG supplies and regasified LNG supplies uses prices obtained at the LNG Terminal in winoujcie, based on the natural gas prices quoted on the Polish Power Exchange. In total, PGNiG OD made 361 LNG deliveries with a volume in excess of 6,000 tonnes in 2018 (to off-grid regasification stations).
PGNiG continued with the process of defining a market price for CNG charged to its strategic customers by pegging it to wholesale prices of diesel oil or gas prices quoted on

the Polish Power Exchange, taking into account the volume of gas taken. The volume of CNG sold in 2018 by PGNiG OD totalled about 16 mcm.
Competition According to the Energy Regulatory Office (URE), approximately 54,000 customers switched suppliers in 2018, compared with approximately 58,000 in 2017. Rivals in the B2B and B2C segments compete chiefly by offering competitive gas prices and dual-fuel bundles, as well as by cross selling products and services.
Listed below are PGNiG's most active competitors operating directly on the Polish market. · B2B: PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA,
Fortum Holdings, Hermes Energy Group SA, HANDEN Sp. z o.o. and CEZ Trade Polska Sp. z o.o.; · B2C: Fortum Marketing and Sales Polska SA, ENERGA-OBRÓT SA, Hermes Energy Group SA, Tauron Group; · LNG market: Duon Dystrybucja Sp. z o.o., Novatek Polska Sp. z o.o., Krio-Gaz S.C., Barter Sp. z o.o., BEST Systemy Grzewcze Sp. z o.o., Blue Line Engineering SA, Blue Gaz sp. z o.o., LNG Silesia Sp. z o.o., G.EN. GAZ ENERGIA Sp. z o.o., UNIMOT System Sp. z o.o., Gaspol SA.
Emergency gas supplies In accordance with the Minister of Energy's Regulation of September 21st 2018, PGNiG OD was designated as an emergency supplier to end users of gas. Since September 12th 2018, customers acquired by PGNiG OD through the emergency supplies process have been billed according to tariff rates applied by PGNiG OD (consumers) and the Gas for Business price list (non-consumers).

Sale of electricity PGNiG OD's customer base includes consumers and non-consumers who have concluded comprehensive service contracts for the supply of electricity or contracts for the sale of electricity. As at the end of 2018, PGNiG OD's base of customers on dual fuel (electricity and gas) plans comprised consumer accounts (91%) and non-consumer accounts (9%).
Trade abroad Through PGNiG Supply and Trading GmbH (wholesale) and PST Europe Sales GmbH (retail sale), the PGNiG Group is also developing its natural gas business (both wholesale and sales to end users) in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.
Exchange and OTC wholesale trading PST is an active player on organised markets (exchanges) and in OTC trading. It trades with over 100 counterparties under EFET or similar standardised contracts. PST operates in Germany and its neighbouring countries: Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and the UK (NBP). The company also reached operational readiness in France and Poland, where it commenced active trading operations in October 2018. PST is also registered as a forwarding operator in Denmark, Slovakia and, since 2018, in Hungary.
In 2018, PST launched trading operations in new products: it commenced trading in futures contracts for Brent crude on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Furthermore, PST was registered with ICE Futures U.S. in order to secure LNG supplies, and it is a market maker on the PEGAS exchange for the GASPOOL gas hub market area.
In 2018, PST and PST Sales GmbH sold a total of 64.3 TWh of pipeline-delivered gas, 4.7 TWh of LNG, 5.0 TWh of electricity and 0.5 TWh of crude oil in exchange and OTC transactions.

Retail sales In 2015, PST separated its sales operations, which have since been carried out through its subsidiary PST ES, which sells gas and electricity to end users in Germany and Austria on a retail basis. Target customers include small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and households with standard consumption profiles.
As at December 31st 2018, PST Group's customer base comprised ca. 44,000 accounts (close to the level recorded as at December 31st 2017). In 2018, PST signed roughly 20,000 new contracts, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2018 and the following years confirmed under about 43% of them.
Trading highlights PST's key contracts effective in 2018 included a contract for the provision of a ticketing service with respect to the maintenance of mandatory gas stocks of 576 GWh (with PGNiG) and a contract for the management of Austrian gas storage capacities (a working volume of 17 GWh) signed in order to optimise peaks in gas demand from end users in the winter season. Under its current contracts, PST supplies natural gas to PGNiG on the Polish-German and Polish-Czech borders, ensuring diversification of supply sources. PST also has in place a contract with PGNiG UN for the purchase of gas produced from the Norwegian Skarv field as of 2013, Vale and Morvin fields as of 2015, and Gina Krog field as of July 2017.
Storage The Trade and Storage segment uses for its own needs the working capacities of the Wierzchowice, Husów, Strachocina, Swarzów and Brzenica underground gas storage facilities, as well as the Mogilno and Kosakowo underground cavern facilities. A part of the working capacity of the Mogilno facility which was made available to GAZ-SYSTEM is not a storage facility within the meaning of the Polish Energy Law. The capacities of gas storage facilities are

managed by GSP, conducting activities in the following two core areas: · Regulated activities comprising the pro-
vision of gas fuel storage services at storage facilities owned by PGNiG, as well as operation of the Mogilno and Kosakowo underground gas storage caverns; · Non-regulated activities comprising the provision of services related to design, construction and extension of underground gas storage facilities. Short-term peak fluctuations in demand for natural gas are balanced by supplies from the Mogilno and Kosakowo facilities, where gas is stored in worked-out salt caverns. The capacities of the Wierzchowice, Husów, Strachocina, Swarzów and Brzenica UGSFs are used to balance out changes in demand for natural gas in the summer and winter seasons, to meet the obligations under take-or-pay import contracts, to ensure the continuity and security of natural gas supplies, and to meet the obligations under gas supply contracts with customers. GSP, in its capacity of the storage system operator, provides gas fuel storage services (USUM) to storage facility users under standardised procedures. GSP's services are provided using the following Storage Facilities (SF) and Groups of Storage Facilities (GSF): · Kawerna GSF (comprising the Mogilno CGSF and Kosakowo CGSF, located in worked-out salt caverns); · Sanok GSF (comprising the Husów UGSF, Strachocina UGSF, Swarzów UGSF and Brzenica UGSF, located in partly depleted gas reservoirs); · Wierzchowice SF (comprising Wierzchowice UGSF); · As at December 31st 2018, GSP had provided a total of 32,174 long-term storage capacity packages, including 12,677 packages of services provided on a firm basis and 19,497 packages on an interruptible basis.

132

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Ticketing service ­ PGNiG For the gas year 2018/2019, PGNiG has concluded contracts with 13 energy companies obliged to maintain emergency stocks of natural gas. The total volume of gas stocks maintained by PGNiG for other entities is over 385 GWh (approximately 34 mcm). PGNiG maintains gas stocks for the above entities, on a contract basis, in storage facilities managed by GSP, in which PGNiG previously leased appropriate storage capacities and injected gas.
Third-party access (TPA) storage capacities As at December 31st 2018, the PGNiG Group's underground gas storage working capacities totalled 2,985.35 mcm of high-methane gas, of which 2,942.85 mcm was made available on a TPA basis or to the Gas Transmission System Operator GAZ-SYSTEM under a long-term contract.
Capital expenditures in 2018
In 2018, at the Kosakowo CGSF, further work to construct five Cluster B chambers together with the necessary technical infrastructure and land development was under way. On January 10th 2019, three Cluster B storage chambers (K-6, K-8 and K-9) were handed over to PGNiG. In December 2018, GSP applied to the President of URE for an amendment of the licence to the effect that the working storage capacity of the Kosakowo CGSF is increased by that additional capacity. K-7 and K-10 chambers are expected to be placed in service in September 2021. Upon completion of the project, the Kosakowo CGSF's working capacity will reach approximately 300 mcm.
As regards the implementation of the contract to construct the Kosakowo CGSF, an application to amend the licence held by the Kosakowo CGSF was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of the Environment in 2017. The amendment to the licence covers the construction of ten storage chambers grouped in two

C and D clusters of five chambers each, along with gas pipelines and process pipelines (the procedure was pending in 2018).

Risks
Administrative regulation of natural gas prices and deregulation of Polish gas market
Gas trading on the exchange market has been excluded from the tariff regime. Prices of gas paid by end users have also been gradually liberalised as the process of deregulation advances. The first customer groups in respect of which the tariff requirement will be disapplied are wholesale and business customers. As regards gas trading on the Polish Power Exchange or direct sales to customers at prices similar to those quoted on the exchange, there is a risk that revenues from such sales will be lower than gas procurement costs due to the growing disconnect between the market prices of gas and of petroleum products, to which gas prices under the long-term import contracts continue to be linked. As a consequence, revenue is subject to forecasting risk. Inaccurate estimates of costs (particularly the cost of gas purchase) may result in a risk of miscalculation of selling prices and charges, which may adversely affect financial results.
Dependence of PGNiG OD's revenue on tariffs approved by the President of URE is the key factor affecting the company's regulated business. Tariffs are crucial to the company's ability to generate revenue that would cover its reasonable costs and deliver a return on the capital employed. Currently, a significant portion of that revenue depends on the selling prices of gas fuel and is regulated. Inaccurate estimates of demand for gas (affecting the accuracy of projected purchase volumes) and changes in prices of gas purchased on the Polish Power Exchange, which cannot be accurately projected, may have an adverse effect on the financial performance of PGNiG OD.

Disruptions in gas supplies from countries east of Poland
In 2018, there were no disruptions in gas supplies from across Poland's eastern border. However, given the continuing political instability in Ukraine, there is a risk of limitation in gas supply.
Take-or-pay gas supply contracts
PGNiG is a party to long-term take-or-pay contracts for gas supply to Poland, and takes care to duly discharge its obligations under those contracts. Assuming that PGNiG's customer portfolio remains unchanged, the volume of gas imports specified in the take-or-pay contracts will allow the Company to optimise its gas purchases under long-term and spot contracts, including for LNG. If PGNiG loses its market share, there is a risk that the Company would be forced to look for new ways to utilise the surplus volumes of gas in its portfolio.
Competition
Competitors seek to increase gas fuel sales by offering competitive prices of the fuel or dual fuel (gas and electricity) deals. A noteworthy development is also the growing activity of large energy companies on the Polish natural gas market.
Given the prevailing trend in supplier switch numbers (according to URE data), the number of people switching energy suppliers should increase in the coming years.
Development prospects
Development prospects in Poland Import strategy In the long term, PGNiG will focus on the performance of its obligations under long-term contracts with respect to the minimum offtake volumes (Yamal contract) and contrac-

ted volumes of LNG. If an unforeseen increase in demand occurs, the Company will purchase natural gas under short-term contracts from the neighbouring countries or on the LNG market, wherever more favourable prices are available. The planned extension of the LNG terminal ­ to 7.5 bcm of natural gas per year at the first stage, and then to 10 bcm annually ­ will make it possible to bring greater volumes of LNG to Poland.
Following the investment decisions by the Polish and Danish transmission operators, which would mean that the joint Baltic Pipe project is approved, PGNiG will be able to win contracts for the supply of gas from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (from its own deposits and imported).
Retail sales In 2018, PGNiG OD intends to further enhance its product offering and improve customer satisfaction by focusing on continuous improvement and streamlining of customer service, and by building new and developing the existing customer access channels. In addition, to fight off growing competition, PGNiG OD will continue efforts which are aimed at keeping up the natural gas sales volumes by offering customers dedicated discount plans, including tailor-made plans and purchases of natural gas within purchasing groups.
PGNiG OD's key growth objectives in the area of gas sales will focus on maximising margins on a stable volume portfolio, managing the risk of losing high-margin customers, and expanding the offering and improving availability of CNG and LNG services. Launch of products with significant business potential, including insurance and assistance packages for retail customers, will play an important role in enhancing PGNiG OD's product portfolio in 2019. Other services under partnership agreements with third parties are also being considered.

Due to the complex situation on the electricity retail market, the product structure will need to be adjusted to the new legal regulations (in particular the Act Amending the Excise Tax Act and Certain Other Acts). In 2019, a complete restructuring of PGNiG OD's electricity sale offering will be prepared, to be launched in Q1 2020.
Development of PST's capabilities As part of developing PST's capabilities, a portion of the PGNiG customer base will be migrated in 2019. Thus, PST will strengthen its operations in Poland, offering natural gas and electricity to wholesale and retail customers.
Business development in the CNG and LNG segments Key development directions for the PGNiG Group in the CNG and LNG segments: · Small LNG Regasification Facilities for
businesses ­ construction of LNG stations to serve business customers (based on a one customer ­ one station model) if the expected consumption volume and profile guarantees economic viability of the project; · LNG bunkering ­ activity in the market of LNG supply for use by ships, including submission of an application for EU co-financing under the Connecting Europe Facility; · CNG stations for municipal transport ­ selective approach to customers, maintaining the existing stations, and new projects subject to economic viability. As part of its operations on the LNG and CNG markets, PGNiG OD also plans to expand LNG supplies for the food industry, prepare business proposals and make deliveries for distributed generation and heat plants, as well as provide solutions for agricultural production.

Storage PGNiG will strive to develop the ticketing service. With respect to expansion of the Kosakowo CGSF, GSP will continue the work to construct K-7 and K-10 chambers. In the Mogilno CGSF, a project to upgrade and reconstruct the pressure reduction and metering station for fuel gas is planned to be launched.
GSP's CAPEX plan for 2019­2021 also provides for replacement and development projects (involving IT and safety systems).
Development prospects abroad In 2019, PGNiG will continue to sell gas on the Ukrainian market in cooperation with its Ukrainian partner ERU Trading. The Company's business in Ukraine will also be affected by the outcome of negotiations between GAZ-SYSTEM and Ukrtransgaz concerning expansion of the transmission network connections between Poland and Ukraine.
PST intends to further expand its business of selling electricity and gas to end users and wholesale customers in Western Europe in 2019. As part of its trading activity, besides being an active player in OTC and exchange markets, PST intends to develop a business model based on cooperation with municipal entities as well as trading companies, by offering them standard and structured trading and balancing products.
The PGNiG Group will also continue to work on building its capabilities and strengthening its presence in the global LNG market. As a result of its operations on the LNG market, PST started trading in new merchandise (crude oil, diesel oil) and with new markets (Henry Hub) in order to hedge potential LNG transactions and generate margin on its own transactions.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

In 2018, the Distribution segment's operating profit fell by 7% year on year to PLN 1,458m, while EBITDA came in at PLN 2,385m, down by PLN 108m year on year. The segment's revenue from sales decreased by PLN 10m, while revenue from distribution services dropped by PLN 181m (after the presentation changes made to ensure compliance with IFRS 15), i.e. by 4% year on year. On the other hand, the PLN 72m lower year-on-year net income from expenses of system balancing increased the segment revenue.
The volume of distributed gas rose by 102 mcm, or 1%, year on year. The segment's operating expenses in 2018 went up by PLN 100m, or 3%, year on year, mainly due to 34% higher other services and 2% higher employee benefits year on year.
Operations in 2018
The mission of PSG as the Distribution System Operator is to provide gas fuel distribu-

tion services to all gas fuel consumers and traders (while ensuring that all of them receive equal treatment) on the basis of distribution agreements. In 2018, PSG executed three distribution agreements and two Interoperator Distribution Agreements. Throughout the year, about 61,000 customers changed their gas suppliers.
PSG took steps which in 2018 resulted in the execution of more than 88,500 connection agreements, providing for 97,600 new connections to the gas grid. In 2018, PSG planned to build more than 51,000 new connections. By the end of 2018, nearly 179,000 decisions defining the terms of connection were issued (up 19% year on year) and 60,750 service lines with a total length of 616.2 km were built.
In 2018, 31 new municipalities were connected to the gas grid. Thus, the geographical coverage in terms of the number of municipalities connected reached 60.94% (1,510 out of 2,478).

As at December 31st 2018, PSG had a multi-branch organisational structure, comprising the Support Branch in Warsaw, the Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Branch in Krosno, and 17 Gas Distribution Branches. PSG's branches operate within the administrative borders of the respective provinces. Ultimately, there will be 172 local gas utilities and 59 service points operating within the branches.

An important factor affecting the performance of PSG's operator obligations in 2018 was the conclusion of comprehensive gas supply contracts with an emergency supplier on behalf of and for about 57,000 end users, following the termination of gas fuel supply by Energetyczne Centrum SA and Energia dla Firm SA to customers connected to the distribution network.

Capital expenditures in 2018
In order to ensure the improvement and maintenance of the technical condition of gas pipelines and to guarantee their operational safety, PSG is constantly investing to upgrade its network assets. In 2018, approximately PLN 553m was spent on the redevelopment and

modernisation of the gas network, including more than PLN 201m on the replacement and verification of gas meters and metering systems.
In 2018, about 60 business and investment projects were implemented, including a number of projects designed to support the delivery of the PGNiG Group Strategy for 2017­ 2022, with a view to deploying new technology and organisational solutions in customer service, meter reading and billing of distribution services. The new solutions will improve process handling efficiency, enable uniform process reporting and monitoring across the Company, facilitate introduction of changes into business processes and improve information flow.
As a distributor of environmentally-friendly fuel, PSG additionally takes a range of measures promoting the prevention of smog

142

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

and air pollution. In 2017, a number of environmental initiatives were launched, which were implemented in 2018 (often in cooperation with local governments). These include: · Aktywizacja nieczynnych przylczy (Acti-
vation of inactive connections) ­ a project aimed at mobilising customers who have inactive gas connections, especially in areas with a high level of low-stack emissions (smog); · Przylcz si, liczy si kady oddech (Connect, because every breath matters) ­ an education and promotion project intended to raise the awareness of the risks to human health presented by air pollution and to promote gas fuel as an environmentally-friendly alternative to solid fuels; · Proste przylcze (Simple connection) ­ a project aimed at reducing the duration of the connection process. In 2018, PSG continued its efforts to secure financing under the EU 2014­2020 financial framework. As part of Measure 7.1. ­ Development of intelligent storage, transmission and distribution systems, Priority axis VII ­ Improvement of energy security, PSG entered into agreements with the Oil and Gas Institute ­ National Research Institute, providing for co-financing of investment projects. The expected total cost of eight projects for which the co-financing agreements were executed in 2017­2018 exceeds PLN 498m (the amount of subsidies will be in excess of PLN 220m). The total length of the distribution pipelines to be built or modernised as part of the projects is 431 km. In 2018, PSG continued efforts aimed at intensifying its research and development work with a view to enhancing its innovativeness. It partnered with various scientific and research institutions in Poland to identify potential innovative projects for PSG.

Risks
Limited market development in terms of supplying the distribution network
Limitations at the entry points to the distribution system result from the limitations of the supply network and the insufficient capacity of gas stations. Consequently, the possibility of connecting new customers and gas network roll-out may be limited. In addition, end users may switch to direct or substitute competitors.

Risk materiality level: low medium high
Probability that the risk will materialise:
low medium high
Yoy change in the risk level:
increase no change decrease

Risk associated with direct competition

The activity of companies involved in the construction and/or operation of distribution networks and regasification plants limits the PGNiG Group's development opportunities and reduces the profitability of the constructed networks.

Risk associated with lack of long-term regulatory policy

The risk is related to the lack of URE's approval for freezing tariff prices. If the risk materialises, it may bring about reductions in tariff rates and difficulties in having each subsequent tariff approved. A protection against materialisation of this risk is the development of a regulatory and econometric model, subsequently agreed with URE.

Claims raised by property owners

The risk arises from failure to secure a permanent legal title to property at the stage of project execution and property owners' higher awareness of the related legal aspects. The consequences of materialisation of the risk include excessive (above market prices) claims made by property owners, increase in litiga-

143

tion, litigation costs, claims for removal or alteration of infrastructure, as well as provisions and claims related to extra-contractual use of property.
Sources of gas supply for the distribution system
The limited throughput capacity of the transmission network operated by GAZ-SYSTEM results in a significant delay in the extension of distribution infrastructure by PSG. The risk may affect the pace at which new customers are connected to the PSG network and the volume of distributed gas.
Substitution
The substitution risk is associated with a potential lower cost of using alternative fuels and with unavailability or insufficient capacity of the gas network. In the context of alternative solid fuels, the difference relative to the cost of gas fuel has markedly shrunk, something that potential consumers do not always realise.
Lower amount of EU funds allocated for financing gas distribution projects
This risk may result from fund allocation priorities set by the institutions responsible for distribution of EU funding. Unfavourable fund allocation may result in unavailability of financing for submitted projects or in low efficiency of such projects.
Development prospects
PSG intends to carry out tasks related to the construction of gas networks, connection of new customers, network upgrades, as well as initiatives contributing to the development of the gas market and the gas distribution system, including:

· Addition of transmission network exit points;
· Development of gas distribution at PSG based on the LNG technology ­ building of LNG regasification stations, both to feed micro gas grids and to support the roll-out of local gas delivery solutions (including acquisition projects). Under the `Programme for accelerating investment in Poland's gas network by PSG in 2018­2022', the company has identified the possibility of opening a total of 77 LNG regasification stations;
· Identification of opportunities for agricultural biogas plants to feed the distribution network.
PSG will continue to carry out tasks under the `Programme for accelerating investment in Poland's gas network in 2018­2022'. These will include 9 tasks designed to eliminate transmission limitations. Further, the company plans to continue work on 44 tasks under the strategic investment programme, while carrying out routine activities involving gas network expansion, connection of new customers in Poland, and upgrade of the existing network infrastructure.

The segment's operating profit for 2018 came in at PLN 316m, down by PLN 109m year on year. EBITDA was reported at PLN 788m, down by PLN 55m, or 7%, year on year. The segment's revenue was PLN 2,387m, having increased by PLN 136m on 2017.
The segment's performance was driven by higher average temperatures in 2018 compared with 2017, which translated into a nearly 5% year-on-year decline in the volumes of heat sold. The segment also produced 4.0 TWh of electricity, up 2% year on year, thanks mainly to contribution from the Zofiówka CHP plant, which was commissioned in the second half of the year. The segment's expenses rose 13% year on year, to PLN 2,071m, chiefly on higher prices of coal (up PLN 139m) and electricity for trading (up PLN 40m).
Operations in 2018
In 2018, PGNiG TERMIKA supplied heat to two municipal networks: the Warsaw heating network, owned by Veolia Energia Warszawa SA, and its own heating network, covering Pruszków, Piastów, and Michalowice. The company also used Veolia's network to supply heat to its own end customers, based on a transmission contract (these customers are billed on different terms as they are classified in PGNiG TERMIKA's separate tariff group ­ `OKW').
The thermal power generated by the company in 2018 met the requirements set out in the annual schedule agreed with Veolia Energia Warszawa SA. In July 2018, a new multi-year contract for heat supply from PGNiG TERMIKA generation facilities was signed between PGNiG TERMIKA and Veolia Energia Warszawa SA, effective from May 14th 2018 to August 31st 2028. The sale and supply of heat by PGNiG TERMIKA will be effected through the Warsaw heating

network (the estimated network coverage is approximately 70% of total heat demand in Warsaw).
In 2018, in line with the investment plan, a contract for the construction of a CCGT unit and peak-load boiler house at the era CHPP was being performed, and investment programmes were launched to upgrade the Pruszków CHPP and Kawczyn HP.
Capacity market
In 2018 the capacity obligation was rolled out to the market. It requires that a capacity market unit remains ready to deliver a certain volume of electric power to the power system and that it actually delivers a certain volume of electric power in a period of emergency. In 2018, as a result of three main auctions held by Polskie Sieci Energetyczne, PGNiG TERMIKA and PGNiG TERMIKA EP entered into the following capacity contracts: · CCGT unit at the era CHPP 2: A 17-year
delivery contract for 2021­2037 (net capacity of 433 MW); · Units No. 7 and No. 8 at the Siekierki CHPP: annual delivery contracts for 2021­2023 (total net capacity of 140 MW); · Moszczenica CHPP unit: annual delivery contract for 2021­2023 (net capacity of 7 MW); · Czstochowa-Wodzislaw CHPP unit: annual delivery contract for 2021­2023 (net capacity of 1.2 MW). Furthermore, the Stalowa Wola CHPP (a combined cycle unit project implemented by PGNiG TERMIKA and Tauron Polska Energia SA) signed a 7-year delivery contract for 2021­2027 (net capacity of 386 MW).

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Capital expenditures in 2018
In order to meet the more stringent emission requirements the generating assets are being gradually modernised. In 2018, the capital expenditure of the PGNiG TERMIKA Group amounted to PLN 605m.
In 2018, major investment projects included: · Construction of a ca. 450 MW CCGT unit
at the era CHPP (era CCGT) ­ a contract for unit delivery and erection as part of the project was performed in 2018. Foundations were laid for the main components, i.e. the electrical building, main structures for the recovery boiler and the gas turbine house. Additionally, the lower frame of the gas turbine, gas turbine stator and an overhead crane in the main building were installed. Work is currently under way to install recovery boiler modules, among others. Capital expenditure on the project is estimated at PLN 1.6bn; · Construction of a ca. 450 MW CCGT unit at the Stalowa Wola CHPP (ECSW) ­ the EPCM service was provided during 2018. In 2018, tendering procedures were also carried out, resulting in contracts to complete the construction work and deliver the CCGT unit control system, among other things. In March 2018, a loan agreement was signed with Bank BGK, with the involvement of PGNiG, to complete the construction of the CCGT unit. Capital expenditure on the project is estimated at PLN 1.4bn; · Construction of a ca. 70 MWe fluidised bed unit at the Zofiówka CHPP ­ in October 2018, PGNiG TERMIKA EP put the unit in service. The project is at the closing stage now ­ pending approval of the as-built documentation and drafting of the final project report. Capital expenditure on the project until the end of 2018: PLN 585m;

· Construction of a peak-load boiler house at the era CHPP ­ In the second half of 2018, a building permit was obtained, and demolition works and utility rerouting were completed to release space for the site;
· Upgrading of the Pruszków CHPP ­ in 2018, a concept was prepared for the adaptation of the Pruszków CHPP to operations beyond 2022, and the final scenario of tasks to be executed in 2019­2022 was selected, including the construction of two coal-fired boilers, an oil-fired boiler house (with a light oil tank) and gas engines with a total capacity of up to 12 MWe;
· Projects aimed at bringing the generation units in line with BAT (Best Available Technique) ­ the objective is to expand the flue gas treatment system at PGNiG TERMIKA EP branches to achieve conformity with the extent and level of flue gas treatment required by the BAT Conclusions for existing units in order to maintain and sell energy utilities. The projects will be implemented at three sites: the Zofiówka Branch, ory Branch, and Racibórz Branch.
The PGNiG TERMIKA Group is actively involved in innovation programmes. In 2018, it was engaged in project evaluations under the INGA initiative implemented by PGNiG, GAZ-SYSTEM and NCRD, and analysed options for growing the share of renewable technologies in cooperation with Honeywell. Additionally, PGNiG TERMIKA Group companies are involved in a range of R&D activities in collaboration with other PGNiG Group companies.

Risks
Acquired CO2 emission allowances
The Company purchases CO2 emission allowances in quantities representing the difference between actual emissions and the emissions covered by free allowances it receives. The policy governing the purchase of CO2 emission allowances at PGNiG TERMIKA allows, to some extent, for offsetting the effect of the purchase cost on profit or loss against revenue from the wholesale of electricity, whose price is partly correlated with the price of allowances.

Fuel prices

PGNiG TERMIKA uses coal (as its core fuel) and biomass. The rising cost of these fuels had a negligible effect on costs incurred in 2018 as the Company used fuels purchased under earlier contracts. Matching the timing of electricity and certificate sales to the timing of fuel purchases permits to partly mitigate the adverse impact of rising fuel prices on financial performance.

Coal procurement and supply
Coal is purchased mostly under contracts executed in advance to ensure that strategic coal stocks are maintained above the level required by the Regulation of the Minister of the Economy. In addition, coal transport services are purchased in accordance with the Public Procurement Law and in good time before the delivery is due. Any deterioration in contract performance by the BAT's trading partners may lead to non-compliance with the emergency stocks obligation.
Adapting to BAT requirements
With installations adapted to meet the requirements expressly stated in the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), the next step will be to ensure compliance with emission limits imposed under the decision establishing the BAT Conclusions for large combustion plants. An investment plan has been developed to ensure that the emission and technology requirements defined in the BAT Conclusions are duly met.

Development prospects
The Act on the Promotion of Electricity from High-Efficiency Cogeneration was passed in December 2018. The entry into force of its provisions along with a set of secondary legislation will allow the company to apply ­ with respect to the planned new gas-fired units of the PGNiG TERMIKA Group ­ for participation in a new support system that will replace the existing one, based on certificates of origin and described in the Energy Law. In consequence of the introduction of the capacity market system and the main auctions which have taken place, additional revenue has been secured for 2021­2037. Furthermore, in 2019, the PGNiG TERMIKA Group will continue projects related to upgrades of existing and construction of new power generation units, including: · Continuation of the construction of
a CCGT unit at the era CHPP ­ total capital expenditure estimated at PLN 1.6bn. Incurred capital expenditure on the project until the end of 2018: PLN 196m. Completion is scheduled for

2020. The progress of works at the end of 2018: 61%; · Construction of a peak-load boiler house at the era CHPP ­ total capital expenditure estimated at PLN 150m. Incurred capital expenditure on the project until the end of 2018: PLN 11m. The trial run is scheduled to begin in 2019; · Continuation of the construction of a CCGT unit at the Stalowa Wola CHPP ­ total capital expenditure estimated at PLN 1.4bn. Incurred capital expenditure on the project until the end of 2018: PLN 1,1bn. Completion is scheduled for Q4 2019. PGNiG TERMIKA will seek to improve its return on assets, diversify its fuel mix (coal, gas, biomass, RDF), and defend its market position as a leading heat producer in Warsaw. In the whole of Poland, it will focus on the acquisition of heating systems and development in the area of gas technologies in the heating sector, autoproducer generation and distributed generation.

In the second half of 2018, further measures were taken to improve Geovita's participation in public procurement procedures.
Polski Gaz Towarzystwo Ubezpiecze Wzajemnych (Polski Gaz TUW, mutual insurance company) In 2018, cooperation was continued with respect to insurance contracts for both PGNiG and PGNiG Group members. The company provides insurance mainly to PGNiG Group companies on the basis of members' mutuality within the company, which allows it to tailor the insurance services to policyholders' needs through their actual contribution to the company's operation and the ability to directly report their insurance needs.
In 2018, cover provided under the upstream business insurance for PGNiG was renewed, an application was filed with the Polish Financial Supervision Authority to

157

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

extend the scope of Polski Gaz TUW's business to include sickness-related insurance, and the company's share capital was increased to PLN 40m in order to establish a life insurance subsidiary.
Moreover, two major changes took place in the regulatory environment of Polski Gaz TUW in 2018, which had a material effect on the operations of insurance companies. They involved a significant increase in information provision requirements in consequence of the entry into force of the Act on Insurance Distribution and the provisions of the GDPR.
Development prospects
PGNiG Technologie In line with the objectives for 2018­2020, PGNiG Technologie will operate primarily as a provider of construction and assembly services and manufacturer of finished products in the gas and oil mining sector, mainly as part of the PGNiG Group. The company additionally intends to improve the success rate of winning high-budget strategic contracts involving the construction or upgrade of gas and oil pipelines and mines, as well as development of oil/ gas fields and underground gas storage facilities. Furthermore, PGNiG Technologie seeks to acquire new contracts on foreign markets (mainly in Norway and Ukraine) and in the power sector.

PGNiG Serwis The company perceives opportunities in the ongoing process of streamlining and reduction of operating expenses at the PGNiG Group, as a result of which it may take over ancillary activities and provide support services to more PGNiG Group companies. In 2019, PGNiG Serwis additionally wants to expand its personal, property and IT security business.

Gazoprojekt In 2019, Gazoprojekt will seek to continue its services for existing customers, not only within the PGNiG Group, but also for other leading gas and oil market players. This applies, in particular, to projects involving the transmission and storage of crude oil and natural gas, and expansion of chemical plants. Additionally, Gazoprojekt intends to intensify its networking efforts, seeking to acquire project support contracts on foreign markets.
Geovita In the near future, the company will continue its restructuring efforts to optimise costs and improve the efficiency of sales channels and operational processes.
CLPB (Central Measurement and Testing Laboratory) CLPB's primary objective is to maintain its position as the leading research laboratory and attestation centre for measurement systems and devices used in the natural gas industry and a natural gas quality control laboratory for all kinds of natural gas (L and E) and all their forms (CNG, LNG) as well as biogas. In the coming years, CLBP intends to grow its capabilities in testing hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles (there is no such laboratory in Poland, despite the emerging market for hydrogen fuel) and geological analysis (porosimetry and core gas testing, analysis of liquid mineral hydrocarbons).

Consolidated financial report

In 2018, the PGNiG Group posted revenue of PLN 41,234m, up by PLN 5,549m (16%) compared with the previous year, when revenue was PLN 35,685m (after presentation changes under IFRS 15). In the same period, operating expenses amounted to PLN 36,839m, up 16% year on year. As a result, consolidated EBIT for 2018 came in at PLN 4,395m, up PLN 485m (12%) year on year, while EBITDA reached PLN 7,115m, up by PLN 536m (8%) year on year.
Key factors driving the increase of revenue, but also of operating expenses, during the

year included the growing prices of hydrocarbons. With temperatures in Poland higher by an average of 0.6OC in 2018, the Group sold a total of 29.0 bcm of gas (up 2.3 bcm on 2017). Sales of crude oil and condensate from production also rose year on year, by 140 thousand tonnes, to 1,410 thousand tonnes. The higher temperatures also translated into 5% lower heat output and only a minor (1%) increase in gas distribution volume.

Property, plant and equipment are the largest component of the PGNiG Group's

assets. As at December 31st 2018, this item amounted to PLN 34,236m, having increased by PLN 1,784m (6%) relative to December 31st 2017. The balance of impairment losses on those assets rose by PLN 240m year on year. Equity-accounted investees rose by

162

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

PLN 205m (13%) year on year, following the revaluation of shares in Polska Grupa Górnicza Sp. z o.o. and Polimex-Mostostal S.A.
As at the end of 2018, the Group's current assets were PLN 14,373m, having increased by PLN 2,534m (21%) relative to the end of 2017. The rise in current assets was mainly attributable to the PLN 1,347m (52%) year-on-year increase in cash and cash equivalents. It is worth to note the growth in inventories, which stood at PLN 3,364m at the end of 2018, up by PLN 616m (22%) on the end of 2017.
Equity is the main source of financing of the PGNiG Group's assets. At the end of 2018, the Group's equity was PLN 36,632m, up by PLN 3,005m (9%) relative to the end of 2017. The change in equity was attributable, among others, to the net profit of PLN
Financial highlights of PGNiG Group

3,209m earned in the reporting period and no dividend payment in 2017.
As at the end of 2018, non-current liabilities were PLN 7,255m, up PLN 251m (4%) on December 31st 2017. As at December 31st 2018, the PGNiG Group reported current liabilities of PLN 9,384m, up PLN 1,812m (24%) year on year. The increase in liabilities was attributable to a PLN 469m (23%) growth of short-term debt (mainly under debt securities) and a PLN 499m (15%) rise in trade and tax payables (mainly relating to current income tax).
In connection with the increase in equity and in current liabilities, the Group's debt ratio and debt to equity remained fairly stable year on year, having changed respectively from 30.2% to 31.2% and from 43.3% to 45.4%.

Projected future financial standing

In the coming periods, the financial standing of the PGNiG Group will be materially affected by changes in the prices of hydrocarbons on global commodity markets and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These factors will be of particular importance for the PGNiG Group's performance in the Exploration and Production and Trade and Storage segments.
Any changes in hydrocarbon prices affect revenues of the Group entities engaged in production, and determine the demand for seismic and exploration services offered by the Group companies. Rising gas and crude oil prices have a positive effect on performance generated by the Exploration and Production segment. Long-term forecasts of hydrocarbon prices strongly influence projected cash flows from production assets, and as a consequence entail the necessity of revaluation of property, plant and equipment.
On the other hand, in view of the fact that the prices of gas purchased by PGNiG under the Yamal and Qatar contracts are linked to prices of crude oil, the effect of rising oil prices on the performance of the Trade and Storage segment is opposite to the effect that rising oil prices have on the performance of the Exploration and Production segment. Any increase of crude oil prices translates into higher cost of gas purchased by PGNiG. This correlation may change following the ruling by the Stockholm Arbitration

Tribunal regarding the price formula used in the Yamal contract.
The PGNiG Group's financial results will also be materially affected by situation on the domestic currency market. Any strengthening of the zloty against foreign currencies (primarily the US dollar) will have a positive effect on performance of the Trade and Storage segment by driving down PGNiG's gas procurement costs, although it must be noted that the effect of exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the PGNiG Group's hedging policy.
The PGNiG Group's financial results will also be affected by the President of URE's position regarding the level of gas fuel sale and distribution tariffs and heat sale tariffs. In addition, the progressing deregulation of the gas market in Poland will continue to put pressure on the performance of the PGNiG Group's Trade and Storage companies engaged in the provision of gas sale services. Competition for customers has prompted the launch of a number of discount schemes dedicated to customers buying gas from the Group and the change in pricing terms to reflect market prices. These factors may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Trade and Storage segment by eroding its margins.
However, the PGNiG Group companies have put in place a number of initiatives to improve efficiency. These initiatives

170

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

focus, among other things, on optimisation of the cost base and are expected to have a positive effect on the PGNiG Group's financial results.
In the Generation segment, financial results will also be considerably affected by the support programmes for electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration sources and renewable sources. Changes in the market prices of CO2 emission allowances will be increasingly affecting the PGNiG Group's financial position in the segment.

Another key factor affecting the segment's performance are prices of the fuels used to produce heat and electricity.
In the coming quarters, the Group intends to maintain a high level of capital expenditure. Spending will focus primarily on projects involving maintenance of hydrocarbon production rates, as well as projects in the exploration for and appraisal of crude oil and natural gas deposits, and development of the power generation segment.

Compliance policy

The formal basis for introduction of the compliance function at the Company is its Compliance Programme. From among the various available solutions, the Company has adopted the one assuming that: · Compliance is an special element of
PGNiG's risk management, which is clearly demonstrated by implementation of the compliance function as part of the non-compliance risk management system; · The Management Board appoints a Compliance Officer, responsible for coordination and information; · Taking into consideration the wide scope of the Company's activities, each area at risk of non-compliance was assigned a non-compliance risk area manager (leader); · Ultimately, responsibility for noncompliance risk management and performance of duties arising from the compliance programme lies with the risk owner (acting with the relevant non-compliance risk area manager, as applicable). The Compliance Programme provides for regular obligations, such as periodic reporting on compliance standards, compliance risks (and their assessment in terms of materiality/consequences and probability of occurrence), and risk response (risk management

method and cost of response). Moreover, the programme imposes certain permanent obligations, which consist mainly in monitoring changes in compliance standards and reporting material risks.
Every employee, partner or stakeholder can report suspected misconduct or abuse through the `compliance line' established under the programme.
Ethics is the cornerstone of an effective compliance risk management system, and a system of identification and prevention of any breaches in this area, which is why in order to consolidate and standardise the principles of ethics applicable at the PGNiG Group.
In 2018, a Compliance Policy was implemented across the Group. The Policy sets out: · the rules and standards of conduct
applicable at the PGNiG Group, as well as the behaviour and ethical values expected from employees; · remits of the respective bodies responsible for managing ethics and compliance at the PGNiG Group; · the manner of coordination and exchange of information on any breaches of applicable laws, customary market norms, industry standards, good market practice, or standards of ethical conduct at the PGNiG Group;

A person is considered a candidate to the Management Board elected by the employees if, during the election, 50% of valid votes plus one were cast in favour of that person, with the reservation that the election results are binding on the Supervisory Board if at least 50% of the Com-

pany's employees participated in the election. Management Board members are appoin-
ted for a joint term of three years. A member of the Management Board may resign from their position by delivering a notice to that effect to the Company, represented by another Management Board member or commercial proxy, with copies to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the minister competent for matters pertaining to energy. The resignation must be submitted in writing, or will otherwise be ineffective towards the Company.
The Management Board member elected by the employees may also be removed upon a written request submitted by at least 15% of the Company's employees. The Supervisory Board orders the voting and its results are binding on the Supervisory Board if at least 50% of the Issuer's employees participate in the ballot, and if the percentage of votes cast in favour of the removal is not lower than the majority required for the election of a member of the Management Board by the employees.

Risk management
As part of the certified QHSE Management System implemented at PGNiG, conforming to the ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 standards, all business processes and all risks potentially affecting the performance of individual processes or disrupting the achievement of process deliverables have been identified and assessed. In addition, opportunities for making business processes more effective have been identified. Risks and opportunities for PGNIG processes have been identified and assessed in accordance with the Process Risk Management procedure. The adopted risk assessment methodology is based on the PN-ISO 31000 standard. The rules laid down in the procedure specify the methods of risk and opportunity identification, analysis and assessment, risk and opportunity treatment, risk and opportunity monitoring and control, as well as evaluation of measures

taken. Process risk assessment is performed on an ongoing basis, at least once a year.
Risks are analysed by determining the location of the event as well as its causes, effects, and probability of its occurrence, taking into account any existing safeguards minimising the potential impact or probability of occurrence of a given event. In the case of unacceptable risks, action is planned to reduce such risks to acceptable levels. High risk levels are accepted in certain justified cases. The Process Owner is responsible for assessing risks inherent in the process under his/her management and for action taken with respect to high-level risks and opportunities.
Around 680 process risks were identified in 2018, including legal, technical, technology, organisational, and HR risks. Risk level was defined as high for approximately 7% of identified risks, and mitigation measures were defined for 80% of those risks. The remaining high-level risks were accepted in view of exhausted mitigation measures. Those risks are subject to ongoing monitoring to prevent their materialisation.
Several dozen opportunities were also identified in business processes, and relevant actions were planned to enhance process delivery and effects.
