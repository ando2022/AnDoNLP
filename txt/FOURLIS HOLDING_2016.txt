7. Information about Group's plan of development
According to the temporary data of the Hellenic Statistical Authority of 6/3/2017 the GDP in terms of volume, for the 4th quarter of 2016, decreased by 1,1% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2015. This fact leads to the estimation that the year 2016 will end up to a slightly negative sign for the Greek economy.
The excess of the primary surplus goal (from 0,5% to 2,0%) at the fiscal front despite being a good progress, it is not itself sufficient to create a positive perspective and therefore ambitious expectations for the year 2017.
The Management of the Group, following its expectations that in the year 2017 in Greece the retail trading will remain under pressure due to the ongoing unemployment, high taxation of natural persons and legal entities but also the weakness of the banking system to dispose capitals for new investments as well as the fact that the risk of a new recession cycle has not yet been eliminated, aims to: a) maintain and increase its profitability at which it has returned since the year 2015, b) the continuation of strictly chosen investments, especially in the segment of retail trading of sporting goods where in-
vesting opportunities exist and can be implemented with the current funding abilities, c) gain benefits from synergies and scale economies that have been achieved within the Group especially after the ab-
sorption of the company FOURLIS TRADE SA from the company HOUSEMARKET SA and the completion of warehouse and distribution services supply towards all companies of the Group from the company TRADE LOGISTICS SA, d) the research of new investment opportunities in activity areas ­ such as the management of retail stores ­ that the Group is well aware of and has positive results, e) maintain the balance of the income source of the Group between domestic and abroad companies for the rational allocation of the political ­ economic risk at the different countries of activity.
In the year 2017, the Management of the Group, with the expectation that the outcome of the Greek assessment will be positive and the stability in the political and economical segment will be embedded, will proceed to the implementation of its business plan with selective investments in Greece and foreign countries that the Group operates, as follows:
In the retail trading of sporting goods segment, with a current network of one hundred and thirteen (113) stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Turkey as well as two (2) e-commerce stores in Greece and Romania, within the year 2017 four (4) new INTERSPORT Stores are expected to be added to the existing network and one (1) e-commerce store in Cyprus. Moreover, four (4) new TAF stores are expected to be added to the eight (8) already operating stores.
At the end of 2017, the retail trading of sporting goods segment is expected to have a netwotk of one hundred and seventeen (117) INTERSPORT Stores and twelve (12) TAF Stores as well as e-commerce stores in Greece, Romania and Cyprus. The home furniture and household goods segment will operate seven (7) IKEA Stores, seven (7) Pick up Points and three (3) E-COMMERCE STORES IN Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus.
Education and training of human capital, the constant and fair evaluation in all levels as well as dedication to the values of the Group - "Integrity", "Respect" and "Efficiency" ­ continue to compose major comparative advantages through which the Group aims to achieve its goals.

FOURLIS Group Identity

IKEA stores are assessing with greater emphasis the corresponding risks and the increased possibility of having such an event due to the high number of visitors, the multitude, the extent and the diversity of the facilities. All these take place without downgrading our interest for all other facilities of the Group regarding Health and Safety of customers and all counterparties.

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

Customer care and satisfaction · INTERSPORT & TAF: High quality in customer service is achieved through INDUCTION programs, constant guidance and training, as well as related educational programs, constructive feedback, annual appraisals and constant meetings and «Mystery Shopping» survey, carried out by a partner company.

Business Activities

· IKEA: Policies and procedures for better customer service and satisfaction, besides constant training in customer service and use and operation of goods, also include ordinary meetings of all those included in customer service, constructive feedback, assessments of customers' complaints and periodic assessments of employees.

by a partner company four times a year.

e) Employee matters: Principal risks / impacts related to employee matters linked to Group's and Company's operations
In the context of our approach to corporate responsibility, we identify and prioritize on a regular basis the employee matters that are linked to our activities and may cause negative impacts to our stakeholders as well as to Sustainable Development in general at a national level.
Taking into consideration the above, we intensively monitor the impacts of our activities in relation to the issues of: · merit-based recruitment and development · training and education · health, safety and employee wellbeing at work · internal communication
The way we manage these risks is presented in the following sections.
f) Employee matters: Corporate policies
Merit-based recruitment and development When any of our companies require new job positions, those are readily covered either by an internal transfer/promotion of employees (through the Open Resourcing Policy), or by a direct transfer/promotion of an employee (for Executives), or by a new recruit.
The main pillars of our Policy on employee recruitment and professional development of our Human Resources, are: · The common recruitment evaluation criteria for all Group's companies to ensure equal opportunities and to avoid dis-
crimination. · The provision of equal development opportunities through internal transfer and promotion processes to all employees
of the Group. · Taking into consideration the balance between the two genders in the selection and development processes of our em-
ployees.
Since 2008, we have adopted an new Efficiency and Development Appraisal System for all employees of our Group, so as to ensure that the appraisal procedure is clear.
Training and education At the FOURLIS Group we believe that the employees' need for training is continuous and increasing, as the competition and the current market requirements are constantly generating new vocational training and education needs. For this reason, the training of each Group's employee begins upon his/her recruitment. The first training program for all employees of the Group is an induction program, through which we ensure that our new employees are informed about the Structure of the Group, the Principles, the Code of Conduct and the Internal Operation Regulation of each company.
In 2011, «FOURLIS Learning Academy» was created and besides all other training programs, the year 2016 the program FOURLIS Retail MBA begun. This program was designed and created in 2015, under the aegis of AUEB and HRBA, with

Health, safety and employee wellbeing at work

Knowing that the creation of a safe and healthy work environment is our obligation, at the FOURLIS Group we not only follow the relevant clauses of the Greek legislation on labor law, but we also attend to the assessment of possible risks that



we may face in the following year and we take the necessary measures in order to prevent any possible accidents.

An important priority of ours is to safeguard compliance with the Health and Safety Policy by the conduction of intensive in-



spections by safety technicians, throughout the Group's company's facilities and by having the safety technician conduct

an occupational risk assessment study. At the FOURLIS Group, as a minimum prerequisite, we comply with the requirements



of the Greek legislation and the "ILO Code of Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Dis-

eases". We also invest in the constant and regular training of all employees, so that they can respond to emergencies af-

fecting both their and our clients' safety. Especially in the IKEA stores we have created internal Safety, Fire Protection and

First Aid teams.

Executive Summary 2016

The Code follows the approach of compliance or explanation and has the following demands of the listed companies which

chose to implement it: the disclosure of their intention and either their compliance with all the specific practices of the Code or their explanation of the reasons leading them not to comply with these specific practices.



The general principles of the Code cover the following topics: · Role and responsibilities of the Board



· Size and composition of the Board

Board members must be elected by shareholders at a maximum term of four (4) years (specific practice 5.1 Nomination of Board Members)

Explanation/ Justification of deviations from special practices of the Corporate Governance Greek Code
An amendment on Articles of Incorporation is required, which is a decision of the General Assembly. It will be proposed as a change by the termination of the term of the members of the current Board of Directors.

The evaluation of the performance of the Board and its Committees should take place at least every 2 years in line with a clearly established procedure. The evaluation exercise should be led by the Chairman and its results discussed by the Board. The Chairman should act on the results of the performance evaluation by addressing the weaknesses of the Board. The Board should also evaluate the performance of its Chairman. This should be led by the independent Vice Chairman, if appointed, or by another non - executive Board member (specific practice 7.1, Board evaluation).

The responsibilities of the Board of Directors include the assessment of its Committees. For the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, the Company has ended to the use of questionnaires completed by the members of the Board, which will be processed by the company's Secretary and presented annually to the Board during the last meeting of the year.

The non - executive Board members should convene periodically without the executive members in order to evaluate the latter performance and discuss their remuneration (specific practice 7.2, Board evaluation).

If stock options are granted, they shouldn't mature in less than three (3) years from grant date (special practice 1.2, Level and structure of remuneration).

The stock option plan (SOP program) in force, provides maturity to stock options in less than three (3) years from grant date. In case of a new SOP program, there will be a revision of this specific special practice.

Executive Board members' contracts should provide that the Board may demand full or partial recovery of any bonuses awarded on the basis of restated financial statements of previous years or otherwise erroneous financial data used to calculate such bonuses (specific practice 1.3, Level and structure of remuneration).

The existing contracts of the Company do not include this term, but a specific reference has been made to the last revision of the Code of Conduct distributed to all the employees of the Company.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal controls as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Business Activities

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these separate and consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards of Auditing that have been adopted by the Greek Law (GG/B`/2848/23.10.2012). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether separate and consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

2. Basis of presentation of the Financial Statements
2.1. Basis of preparation
The accompanying Financial Statements consist of the separate financial statements of the parent Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The Board of Directors approved the accompanying financial state-
68 Annual Financial Report

ments for the year ended on December 31 2016, on March 13, 2017. These financial statements are subject to the approval of the General Assembly of the Company's shareholders.

The accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except

for certain data of Assets and Liabilities (investment properties and derivative financial instruments) that have been measured at fair value, and assuming that the Company and its subsidiaries will continue as a going concern. All amounts are



presented in thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated and any differentiations in sums are due to rounding.

2.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates



The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect



the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from

those estimates. Estimates are based on management's previous experience including expectations of future events under

normal conditions. The aforementioned judgments, estimates and assumptions are periodically re - assessed in order to

be in line with current available data and reflect current risks.

Executive Summary 2016

When applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, estimates and assumptions that may have a significant impact on the items reported in the financial statements:

FOURLIS Group Identity

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

Business Activities

Estimates: · Deferred Tax assets: deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be avail-
able against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward unused tax losses can be utilised. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires significant judgments and estimates to be made in relation to the future activities and prospects of the Group companies and as to the level and timing of future taxable profits. · Fair Values of investment properties: the Group carries its investment properties at fair values as determined by independent appraising firms. he fair values of investment properties are assessed on an annual basis. The determination of the fair values of properties requires management to make assumptions with respect to the market rental rates for similar properties, sales comparables, capitalization and yield rates, and expectations on future rental income. · Impairment test of investments in subsidiaries: at each reporting date, the Parent Company examines whether there are impairment indicators in relation to its investments in subsidiaries. Such assessment requires management to make significant judgements with respect to the existence of internal or external factors and the extent to which they affect the recoverable amount of these investments. If impairment indicators exist, the Company determines the recoverable amount of these investments. The determination of the recoverable amount requires estimates to be made with respect to the expected future cash flows of the investment, the business plans of the subsidiaries, and the determination of the applicable discount and growth rates. Further details are provided in Note 10. · Useful lives of property plant and equipment: Management makes estimates when determining the useful lives of depreciable assets. Such estimates are periodically reviewed. The useful lives estimated and applied are discussed in Note 3.7. · Post - retirement benefits to personnel: post - retirement obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions which may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of a discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and turnover rates. Due to the complexity of the valuation and the underlying assumptions included therein, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses that result from the difference among the actuarial assumptions are recognized directly in Equity. Such actuarial assumptions are periodically reviewed by management. Further details are provided in Note 19. · Share-based Payments: Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 19 of the Financial Statements.

Social Responsibility

Judgments: · Provisions for impaired receivables: In the subsidiaries of the Segment of Wholesale Trading of Electrical Equipment the
provision of impaired receivables is based on the historical data of receivables. Further details are provided in Note 12.

· Provisions for slow moving goods: Inventory turnover ratio is tested regularly and provisions are made for the slow moving goods. Further details are provided in Note 11.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the following accounting principles:
3.1. Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise of the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiaries controlled by the Company directly or indirectly. Control exists when the parent company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The subsidiaries' financial statements are prepared as of the same reporting date and using the same accounting policies as the parent company. Intra - group transactions (including investments in related companies), balances and unrealized gains are eliminated. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences and cease to be consolidated from the date that control is transferred out of the Group. Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non - controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. The financial results of subsidiaries, that are acquired or sold within the year, are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from or up to the date of acquisition or sale, respectively.
Certain of the above - mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis based on the revised IAS 27 and therefore the following differences are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation: · Acquisitions of non - controlling interests, prior to January 1, 2010, were accounted for using the parent entity extension
method, whereby, the difference between the consideration and the book value of the share of net assets acquired were recognised as goodwill. · Losses incurred by the Group were attributed to the non - controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent, unless the non - controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover these.
3.2. Business Combinations and Goodwill
Business Combination is a transaction or another event during which an acquirer takes over control of one or more businesses. A Business is a combination of activities and assets that can be leaded and managed in order to return profits directly to its owners.
If the acquired assets do not compose a business, the transaction or any other fact are accounted as an acquisition of an asset and the acquisition cost is allocated among assets and liabilities based on the relative fair values during the acquisition date.
Business Combination is accounted for using acquisition method. The cost of acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets contributed, the shares issued and the liabilities assumed at the transaction date, plus the amount of any non controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non - controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net asset. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired, the difference is recorded directly to the income statement.
Goodwill arising from subsidiaries' acquisitions is recorded as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not amortized but at least annually is subject to impairment test. As a result, after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, less any impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each cash generating unit that is expected to benefit from the combination. The impairment test is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to its carrying value including the allocated goodwill. The re-
70 Annual Financial Report

coverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The value in use is determined via a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

Gains or losses arising from the disposal of subsidiaries are determined after taking into account the goodwill allocated to

the disposed unit.



3.3 Investments in subsidiaries

In the separate financial statements of the Parent Company, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost, less any



impairment in value. Impairment tests are carried out when there are clear indicators of impairment, in accordance with

IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets".



3.4 Investments in associates

Executive Summary 2016

Associates are those entities, in which the Group has significant influence but which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. A percentage holding from 20% to 50% implies significant influence. Such percentage holding indicates that company is an associate. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method based on which the investment is carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate, less provisions for any impairment in value. Goodwill arising upon the acquisition of associates is included in the value of investment, while any negative goodwill is recorded in the income statement upon acquisition.

FOURLIS Group Identity

The Group's share in the gains or losses of associates after acquisition is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, while post - acquisition movements in reserves are recognized directly in reserves.

In applying the equity method of accounting, the Group appropriately adjusts the financial statements of those associates who are not applying IFRS so as to comply with IFRS and be uniform with the accounting policies of the Group. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the transferred asset.

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

When the Group's participation to the associate's losses equals or exceeds its interest in an associate, including any other bad debts, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has any liabilities or made payments on behalf of the associate and generally those arising from the ownership status. In the separate financial statements of the Parent Company, investments in associates are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

Business Activities

3.5 Segment information The Board of Directors of the Company is the chief operating decision maker and monitors internal financial reporting information in order to evaluate the performance of the Company and the Group and to take decisions about resource allocation.

Management has defined its segments based on these internal reports according to IFRS 8. The operating segments of FOURLIS HOLDINGS S.A. are defined as those business segments where the Group is active and on which the internal information system of the Group is based.

Social Responsibility

For the categorization by business segment, the following has been taken into account: · the nature of products and services, · quantitative limitations, required by IFRS 8.

According to the aforementioned, the Group presents information by operating segment as follows: · Retail Trading of Home Furniture and Household Goods (IKEA stores). · Retail Trading of Sporting Goods (INTERSPORT and TAF stores).

3.6 Foreign currency translation

(a) Functional currency and reporting currency The companies of the Group maintain their books in the currency of the financial environment in which each company op-

Annual Financial Report

Annual Financial Report 71

erates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro's which is the functional currency of the parent company.

(b) Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency according to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items carried at fair value are considered as part of the fair value of those items and are recorded together with the fair value adjustments.

(c) Foreign Group Companies Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using the functional currency. The translation of the financial statements of the Group's companies which use a different functional currency from the parent company is performed as follows: · Assets and liabilities are translated to Euro at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the Statement of Financial
Position. · Equity is translated at historic rates. · Income and expenses are translated using the average foreign exchange rate of the period and on an annual base ac-
cording to the average foreign exchange rate of the last twelve (12) months. · The resulting foreign exchange differences (gains/losses) are recognized in other comprehensive income and in Foreign
Exchange differences from Statement of Financial Position translation Reserve. When subsidiaries operating in foreign countries are sold, accumulated foreign exchange differences existing in the Foreign Exchange differences from Statement of Financial Position translation Reserve are recognized to the statement of income as gains or losses from investments sales.

Goodwill and adjustments to fair values upon an acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate of the date of the Statement of Financial Position.

3.7 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured, by category, as follows: · All categories of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses. · Cost includes all directly attributable costs for the acquisition of the items of property, plant and equipment. These costs
include borrowing costs of loans drawn to finance the acquisition or construction of assets which are capitalized until the date when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Significant additions and improvements are recognised as part of the cost of the asset when the recognition criteria are met. All other costs (repairs and maintenance) are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred.

Upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value is recorded as gain or loss in the Income Statement.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful economic life of the assets. Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis.

The estimated useful lives of the Group's property plant and equipment, except of the land that is not depreciated, are as follows:

Category Buildings - Building installations (owned premises) Buildings on third party land Machinery and equipment Motor vehicles Miscellaneous equipment

Useful life 10 - 40 years 10 ­ 36 years 9 - 10 years
6 - 9 years 4 - 10 years

72 Annual Financial Report

Owner - occupied buildings or buildings whose use has not yet been determined and which are under construction are recorded at cost less any impairment losses. This cost includes professional compensations and borrowing costs. The depreciation of that owner - occupied buildings begins from the time the buildings are ready for use.

3.8 Investment property



Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment

property is stated at fair value, which is evaluated annually. The carrying value of investment property reflects the market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment property fair value are



recognized in the Income Statement of the period they occur.

3.9 Intangible assets



Executive Summary 2016

The intangible assets of the Group (excluding goodwill) are depreciated over their useful life.

· Royalties Trademarks and licenses are valued at cost less amortization. Amortization is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful lives, which have been determined from 5 to 20 years.

· Software - Other intangible assets Software licenses are valued at cost less amortization. Amortization is charged on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful lives and the depreciation rate is 15%.

FOURLIS Group Identity

Expenditure on development and maintenance of software is expensed as incurred. Expenditure of development activities for the production of new or substantially improved software (in - house developments), is recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met: a) when a specific asset is created, b) when it can be demonstrated that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits and c) when the expenditures of development can be measured reliably. Such expenditures include also labour costs and an appropriate proportion of overheads. In case of software replacement, while the old one is no longer in use, intangible asset is permanently deleted from the Books and the net book value burdens the income statement.

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

Costs incurred for performing software upgrades, are capitalised and the new gross value forms the depreciable amount.

3.10 Impairment of non - financial assets except Goodwill

Business Activities

The carrying amounts of the Group's assets are reviewed for possible impairment when there is indication that the book value can not be recovered i.e. when the book value is higher than the recoverable amount from their use or sale.

The recoverable value is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre - tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable value is less than the carrying value, then the net book value is reduced to the recoverable value.

Social Responsibility

Impairment losses are expensed as incurred in the Statement of Income, except if the asset has been revalued, then the impairment loss reduces the related revaluation reserve. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exists of have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. When in a subsequent period, the impairment loss should be reversed; the carrying value of the asset is increased to the level of the revised estimation of recoverable amount. The new net book value should not exceed the net book value that would have been determined if the impairment losses had not been accounted in previous periods.

3.11 Financial instruments

A financial instrument consists of every agreement that creates a financial asset in a business and a financial liability or equity instrument in another business.

Annual Financial Report

Annual Financial Report 73

The Group's financial instruments are classified at initial recognition in the following categories based on the substance of the agreement and the purpose for which they were acquired:
i) Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Such financial assets, represent assets, which satisfy any of the following conditions: · Financial assets held for trading (including derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedging rela-
tionships, those that are acquired or created in order to be sold or re - acquired and those which form part of a portfolio of recognized financial means). · Financial assets designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
ii) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non - derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active market. This category does not include: · Receivables from advances for the purchase of goods or services, · Receivables resulting from tax transactions imposed by law, · Any item not dealt with by an agreement giving the right to an entity to collect cash or other financial assets.
Loans and receivables are included in current liabilities/ assets, except of those whose maturity extends beyond twelve (12) months after the reporting date and which are classified as non - current liabilities/ assets. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
iii) Held - to - maturity Investments Non - derivative financial items with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held - to - maturity when the Group has the intent and ability to hold to term to maturity. After initial measurement, held - to - maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
iv) Available - for - sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets which are classified under this category or which cannot be classified under any of the three preceding categories. Financial assets available for sales are valued at fair value and the unrealised gains or losses are recognised as other comprehensive income in a reserve under equity until the item is sold or impaired. At the date of sale or impairment, the gains or losses are transferred to the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the item. Investments are initially recorded at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transactions costs. Investments are derecognised when the right to the cash flows of the investment expire or are transferred and the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the investment.
The fair values of financial assets, which are traded on active markets, are determined by reference to quoted prices. The fair value of financial assets not traded on active markets is determined by using valuation techniques such as use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis.
3.12 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
· Assets carried at amortized cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has incurred, the
74 Annual Financial Report

amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.

The amount of the loss is recognized in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment



exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that

are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk charac-



teristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are

not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss de-

creases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previ-

ously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the income

statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.

Executive Summary 2016

FOURLIS Group Identity

· Available for sale financial assets For equity instruments classified as available for sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss - measured at the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value - is removed from other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement. In the case of debt instruments classified as available for sale, impairment losses are reversed through the income statements if an increase in the fair value of the debt instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the income statement.

3.13 Inventory

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by using the weighted average method. The cost of completed products and incomplete inventory includes the cost of direct raw materials, the direct labor cost and the general industrial expenses. The net realizable value is the estimated sales price less any costs to sell. The cost of inventory does not include any financial expenses.

3.14 Trade receivables

Business Activities

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and they are subsequently valuated at the amortised cost by using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

When there is evidence of impairment of receivables, the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Then, the interest is calculated at the same rate on the impaired (new book) value.

3.15 Cash

Social Responsibility

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at banks and on hand, as well as short term (up to 3 months) investments of high liquidation and low risk.

3.16 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation are valued at the lower price between carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any possible fair value increase in a subsequent valuation is registered in Profit and loss but for amounts not bigger than the initially registered impairment loss. Since the date on which an asset is classified as held for sale, this asset is no longer depreciated or amortized. Non-current assets held for sale are classified as such, provided that their carrying value will be recovered through sale rather than through continuing use. This condition is considered valid only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale at its current condition. Management

Annual Financial Report

Annual Financial Report 75

requires commitment to the sale which is expected to be completed either based on stipulated by contractual time commitment or within a year from classification date.
A discontinued operation is an integral part of a financial entity that either has been sold or has been classified as held for sale and: a) represents a separate major part of business operations or a geographical area of operations, b) is part of a single, coordinated divestment program of a great part of operations or a geographical area of operations or c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with the prospect to be resold.
3.17 Share Capital
Direct costs incurred for increases in share capital are recorded, net of related income taxes against the share premium reserve. The cost of treasury shares net of any related income tax is recorded as a reduction of equity, until these shares are sold or cancelled. Any gain or loss on sale of treasury shares, net of direct transaction costs and any related income tax is recorded as a reserve account under equity.
3.18 Loans
Loans are initially recorded at their fair value less any direct costs related to the transaction. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest and related expenses on loans taken for purchase or construction of fixed assets are capitalized. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the asset is ready for its intended use. In case of borrowing specifically for the purpose of constructing or acquiring an asset, the borrowing costs related to the loan agreement are directly capitalised. Otherwise, in order to determine the part of the loan related with that fixed asset, a method is implemented to determine the proportion of the capitalized interest and the proportion of the interest which will be recorded to the statement of comprehensive income as an expense. Revenues, occurred as a result of investing part of a loan taken for construction of a fixed asset, reduce the amount of borrowing costs capitalized.
3.19 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
The effective part of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is recognized directly to equity if it is related to cash flow hedges while the ineffective part is charged to the consolidated income statement, while the non - effective part is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. If the hedge is related to effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss.
Under cash flow hedge accounting, when the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of non - financial asset or a non - financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognized the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognized in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the statement of comprehensive income.
3.20 Current and Deferred Tax
Taxes recorded in the statement of comprehensive income include both current and deferred taxes.
Current income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case it is recognised, in a similar way, directly in equity. Current income taxes include the current liabilities and/ or assets, to or from the tax authorities, relating to the taxes payable on the taxable income of the
76 Annual Financial Report

period. Current taxes are increased by any income taxes related to provisions for tax differences or additional taxes which are imposed by the tax authorities upon audit of the unaudited tax years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the year where the asset or

liability will be settled, taking into account the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or are virtually applicable at the reporting date.



Deferred taxes arise on temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax purposes and those for the purposes of preparation of the financial statements. Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on all taxable



temporary differences at the reporting date, between the tax basis and book value of assets and liabilities.

The expected tax effects of temporary tax differences are recognized either as deferred tax liabilities or as deferred tax as-

sets. In case of an inability to accurately measure temporary tax differences, the initial recognition is made based on esti-

mation of the reversal time and such estimation is reviewed each year.

Executive Summary 2016

Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be used or sufficient taxable deductible temporary differences that incur in the same company and will be recovered. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that is unlikely that sufficient taxable income will be generated in order to recover the deferred tax asset.

FOURLIS Group Identity

The Group sets off deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities only if: · it has a legal right to set off current tax receivables against current tax payables and · deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income tax imposed by the same tax authority.

As a result deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the separate financial statements of the Company while such items are presented separately in the consolidated accounts of the Group.

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

If the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than business combination, then it does not affect the neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss and therefore it is not taken into account.

3.21 Employee Benefits
Employee benefits are:
a) Short term benefits Short term benefits to employees in money or in kind are recorded as an expense as they accrue.
b) Post - retirement benefits According to the regulations of Law 2112/ 1920 amended by the article 74 paragraph 2 of the Law 3863/2010 and completed be the Law 3899/17-12-10 article 17 paragraph 5a and the Law 4093/12, the Greek subsidiaries of the Group pay retirement compensation to their employees. Such compensation varies in relation to the employees' years of service and salary payable at the time of retirement and is accounted for as a defined benefit plan. Post - retirement obligations are calculated at the present value of future employee benefits accrued as at the end of the reporting period, based on the benefits to be earned over their expected labor life. The above mentioned obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuation methods and are determined using the Pro-

Annual Financial Report

Annual Financial Report 77

jected Unit Method. Net costs of the period are included in the attached statement of comprehensive income and consist of the present value of the employee benefits that were accrued during the current year, the interest derived from the employee benefit obligation and the actuarial gains and losses which are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the comprehensive income and they are not transferred in income statement in next periods. Full yield curve method is used for the definition of the discount interest rate in the calculation of the present value of the employee benefits.
c) State insurance programs The employees of the Greek subsidiaries of the Group are covered, in terms of insurance programs, mainly through the Social Insurance Institution (IKA) the largest Social Security Organization of the private sector, which supplies pension and medical coverage. Every employee is obliged to participate partially, through his salary, in the costs of the insurance program, while the remaining cost is covered by the Group. Upon retirement, the pension fund is responsible to cover the obligation of pensions and retirement benefits to the employees. As a consequence the Group does not have any other legal or future obligation to cover future employee benefits according to this pension program. This program is considered and accounted for as a defined contribution plan whereby the accrued social security contributions are recorded as an expense in the financial period in which they are incurred.
d) Private insurance programs Every full time employee of the Group belonging to the management team, according to the internal company policy, is covered by a private insurance pension and other benefits program. The Group covers, the contract defined fees, while the financial management of the program is performed by the insurance company. This program is considered and accounted for as a defined contribution plan whereby the accrued cost of the insurance fees is recorded as expense in the period in which they are incurred.
e) Stock option plan The Company intends to attract, retain and incentivise the executives of the Company and the executives of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as through the Stock Options plan, the participants have a direct equity interest in the Company which link their performance to the Company's future performance and the increase of shareholder value. This program regards equity shares transactions.
The Company makes decisions regarding the implementation of the Stock Option Plan ­ to executives of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in compliance with par.5 of Art.42e of Law 2190/1920.
A basic condition for participation in the Stock Options plan is the salaried working relationship of executives with the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates.The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair values at the date in which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the period from grant date to maturity date of the options with a concurrent increase in equity.
The program takes into account the following variables: Exercise price, Share price at grant date, Grant Date, Maturity date(s) of rights, Expected Stock Volatility (Volatility), Dividend Yield, Risk Free Rate.
3.22 Government grants
Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as deferred income and amortized over the expected useful life of the related asset. Such amortization is presented in other income statement.
3.23 Contingent liabilities and Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal, contractual or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the present value of the expense expected to be required to settle the liability.
78 Annual Financial Report

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless there is a probability of financial outflow or inflow.

3.24 Revenue and expense recognition

Revenue is measured at the fair value of sales of goods and provision of services, net of Value Added Tax, discounts and



returns. Inter - company revenues are eliminated.

The recognition of revenue is accounted for as follows:



· Sales of goods: Sales of goods are recognized when the Group invoices and delivers the goods to the customers

and the goods are accepted by them. Retail sales are through cash payments or through credit cards. In these cases



the income recorded is the amount received by the customer. In the case of guarantees for returned retail sales value

the returns are recorded as incurred.

Executive Summary 2016

· Provision of services: The income from provision of services is recorded in the period in which the services are pro-

vided, based on the stage of completion of the provided service.

· Interest income: Interest income is recognized proportionally in time and by using the effective interest rate.

· Dividends: Dividends are recorded as income when the right to collect vests which is upon the decision of the General

Assembly of Shareholders (ordinary or extraordinary). Expenses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive

income as accrued.

· Advertising costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in distribution expenses.

· Borrowing costs: Underwriters costs, legal and other direct costs incurred during the issue of long term loans are de-

ducted from the loan balances and are recorded to the statement of comprehensive income based on the effective

interest rate method over the duration of the loan. Borrowing cost is recognized as an expense during the issue

period, except of the case that Group capitalizes borrowing costs according to IAS 23.

3.25 Leases

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

Leases in which all the risks and benefits of the property remain with the lessor are recorded as finance leases. All the other leasing contracts are recorded as operating leases. · Group as a Lessor: Income from operating leasing is recognised as income on a straight - line basis over the lease
term. · Group as a Lessee: Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight - line basis over the
lease term. Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased item regardless of whether there is a transfer of the ownership title or not at the end of the lease, are classified as finance leases. The property held under finance leases is capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction in the lease liability and the financial expenses in order to achieve a constant interest rate on the residual financial liability.

Business Activities

Leasing of property, plant and equipment where all risks and rewards associated with the ownership of an asset are transferred to the Group, regardless the final transfer or not of its ownership title, compose financial leasing. This leasing is capitalized at the beginning of the lease at the lowest value between fair value of the asset and present value of the minimum leases. Each lease is allocated between liability and financial expenses so as to succeed a fixed interest rate for the remaining financial leasing.

Social Responsibility

The related lease liabilities net of financial expenses are classified as liabilities and the related financial expenses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income over the duration of the lease. Property, plant and equipment acquired through a finance lease are depreciated at the lower of the assets' useful lives and the lease term.

3.26 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities are not offset in the financial statements unless there is a legal right of set - off and intention for settlement of the net amount or settlement of the asset and liability simultaneously.

3.27 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial Assets A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized where: · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, · the Group or the Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation
to pay them in full without material delay under a "pass - through" arrangement and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Groups´ continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
3.28 Earnings/Losses per share
The basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profits after taxes with the weighted average number of shares of each period/ year.
The weighted average number of shares arises by summing the outstanding shares into which the share capital is divided and the rights that can be contingently exercised and are owned by the company and subtracting the shares buy back.
3.29 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following amended IFRSs which have been adopted by the Group and the Company as of 1 January 2016:  IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative (Amendment)
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements further encourage companies to apply professional judgment in determining what information to disclose and how to structure it in their financial statements. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The narrow-focus amendments to IAS clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. The amendments relate to materiality, order of the notes, subtotals and disaggregation, accounting policies and presentation of items of other comprehensive income (OCI) arising from equity accounted Investments. The Management of the Company and the Group has not used this amendment.  IAS 16 Property, Plant & Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible assets (Amendment): Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The amendment provides additional guidance on how the depreciation or amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets should be calculated. This amendment clarifies the principle in IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, the ratio of revenue generated to total revenue expected to be generated cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortize intangible assets. The Management of the Company and the Group has not used this assessment.

quisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business in accordance with IFRS and specifies the appro-

priate accounting treatment for such acquisitions. The Company and the Group has no transactions that fall within the scope of this amendment.



 IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans (Amended): Employee Contributions

The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2015. The amendment applies to contributions from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans. The objective of the amendment is to simplify the ac-



counting for contributions that are independent of the number of years of employee service, for example, employee

contributions that are calculated according to a fixed percentage of salary. The Company does not have any plans that



fall within the scope of this amendment.

 IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (Amendments)

Executive Summary 2016

The amendments address three issues arising in practice in the application of the investment entities consolidation ex-

ception. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The amendments

clarify that the exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements applies to a parent entity that is a subsidiary

of an investment entity, when the investment entity measures all of its subsidiaries at fair value. Also, the amendments

clarify that only a subsidiary that is not an investment entity itself and provides support services to the investment entity

is consolidated. All other subsidiaries of an investment entity are measured at fair value. Finally, the amendments to

IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures allow the investor, when applying the equity method, to retain the

fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries. The

Management of the Company and the Group does not expect that this specific amendment will affect the financial state-

ments.

The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 ­ 2012 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs.The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2015. None of these had an effect on the Group's and Company's financial statements  IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: This improvement amends the definitions of 'vesting condition' and 'market condition'
and adds definitions for 'performance condition' and 'service condition' (which were previously part of the definition of 'vesting condition').  IFRS 3 Business combinations: This improvement clarifies that contingent consideration in a business acquisition that is not classified as equity is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not it falls within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.  IFRS 8 Operating Segments: This improvement requires an entity to disclose the judgments made by management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments and clarifies that an entity shall only provide reconciliations of the total of the reportable segments' assets to the entity's assets if the segment assets are reported regularly.  IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: This improvement in the Basis of Conclusion of IFRS 13 clarifies that issuing IFRS 13 and amending IFRS 9 and IAS 39 did not remove the ability to measure short-term receivables and payables with no stated interest rate at their invoice amounts without discounting if the effect of not discounting is immaterial.

The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 ­ 2014 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. None of these had an effect on the Group's and Company's financial statements.  IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: The amendment clarifies that changing
from one of the disposal methods to the other (through sale or through distribution to the owners) should not be considered to be a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is therefore no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. The amendment also clarifies that changing the disposal method does not change the date of classification.  IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a

Also, the amendment clarifies that the IFRS 7 disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities are not required in the condensed interim financial report.  IAS 19 Employee Benefits: The amendment clarifies that market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be used.  IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting: The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the greater interim financial report (e.g., in the management commentary or risk report). The Board specified that the other information within the interim financial report must be available to users on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time. If users do not have access to the other information in this manner, then the interim financial report is incomplete.
Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Group or the Company  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. EU has not yet adopted this standard. Company and Group Management estimates that this standard will not have an impact on the financial statements.  IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that will apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction or the industry. The standard's requirements will also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity's ordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, plant and equipment or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance obligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods and key judgments and estimates. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.  IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) The Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB's intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the "separately identifiable" principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. These Clarifications have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.  IFRS 16: Leases The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer (`lessee') and the supplier (`lessor'). The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. The standard has not been yet endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.  Amendment in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of account-

ing. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment

on the companies of the Group.

 IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (Amendments)

The Amendments become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with earlier application per-

mitted. The objective of the Amendments is to clarify the requirements of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses in order to address diversity in practice in the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes. The specific issues where diversity in



practice existed relate to the existence of a deductible temporary difference upon a decrease in fair value, to recovering

an asset for more than its carrying amount, to probable future taxable profit and to combined versus separate assessment. These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amend-



ment on the companies of the Group.

 IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative (Amendments)



The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with earlier application permitted.

The objective of the Amendments is to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes

in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The

Amendments specify that one way to fulfil the disclosure requirement is by providing a tabular reconciliation between

the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities, in-

cluding changes from financing cash flows, changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other

businesses, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in fair values and other changes. These Amend-

ments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the com-

panies of the Group.

 IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share based Payment Transactions (Amendments)

FOURLIS Group Identity

The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.

The Amendments provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the

measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, for share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature

for withholding tax obligations and for modifications to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes

the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed

by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.

 IAS 40: Transfers to Investment Property (Amendments)

Board of Directors ­ Group Structure

The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.

The Amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development

into, or out of investment property. The Amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or

ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use. A mere change in

management's intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use. These Amendments

have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of

the Group.

Business Activities

 IFRIC INTERPETATION 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.

The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration

in a foreign currency. The Interpretation covers foreign currency transactions when an entity recognizes a non-monetary

asset or a non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recog-

nizes the related asset, expense or income. The Interpretation states that the date of the transaction, for the purpose

of determining the exchange rate, is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred in-

come liability. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the trans-

actions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. This Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU.

The Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.

 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other than those of summarized financial information for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, apply to an entity's interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate that is classified as held for sale, as held for distribution, or as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5.
4. Financial Risk Management
a) Financial Risk Management The Group is exposed to financial risks such as foreign exchange risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The management of risk is achieved by the central Treasury department, which operates using specific guidelines set by the Board of Directors. The Treasury department identifies, determines and hedges the financial risks in cooperation with the Groups' subsidiaries that face these risks. The Board of Directors provides written instructions and directions for the general management of the risk, as well as specific instructions for the management of specific risks such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions in foreign currencies (RON, USD, TRY, SEK) with suppliers which invoice the Group in currencies other than the local. The percentage of the balance of suppliers in currency other than the publication currency (euro) is 15,36% of the total. The Group, in order to minimize the foreign exchange risk, according to the needs, in certain cases pre - purchases foreign currencies.
Credit risks: The Group has diminuated the credit risk due to the disinvestment in the segment of wholesale trading of electrical equipment and the focus in retail segments where the payment of goods is mainly made by cash in hand or by pre-paid credit cards.
Interest rate risk/liquidity: The Group is subject to cash flow risk which in the case of possible variable interest rates fluctuation, may affect positively or negatively the cash inflows or outflows related to the Group's assets or liabilities.
Cash flow risk is minimized via the availability of adequate credit lines and cash. Also, the Group has entered into Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contracts in order to face interest rate risk.
b) Provisions, contingent liabilities and assets There are no other commitments and contingent liabilities that can affect the financial condition and results of the Group.
5. Segment Information

The parent company registered in its income dividend from subsidiary of amount  8,5 million during the year 2016.

19.Employee retirement benefits
19.1 Liabilities due to termination of service
The obligation of employee compensation due to termination of service (Law 2112/20, 4093/12 for Greek Companies, Bulgarian Labor Law for Bulgarian Companies and Labor Law 1475 for Turkish Company) appears in the Financial Statements in compliance with IAS 19 and is based on an actuarial study elaborated by AON Hewitt on December 31st,2016.

Basic assumptions of the actuarial study for Greece are the following:

Greek Companies Average annual payroll increase Discount interest rate Inflation Plan duration (years)

2016 1,00% 1,65% - 1,90% 1,00% 15-24

2015 1,00% 1,86% - 2,74% 1,00% 10-24

In case of an average annual payroll increase by 0,50% (namely 1,50%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Greek companies would increase from 7,74% to 12,13%. In case of a discount rate increase by 0,50%, the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Greek companies would decrease from 7,04% to 10,58%.

Bulgarian Companies Average annual payroll increase Discount interest rate Inflation Plan duration (years)

2016 3,50% 2,15% 2,00% 24-29

2015 3,50% 2,36% 2,00% 24-31

In case of an average annual payroll increase by 0,50% (namely 4,00%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Bulgarian companies would increase from 12,27% to 14,96%. In case of a discount rate increase by 0,50% (namely 2,65%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Bulgarian companies would decrease from 10,90% to 13,10%.

Turkish Company Average annual payroll increase Discount interest rate Inflation Plan duration (years)

2016 7,10% 10,00% 5,10%
23

2015 7,10% 11,00% 5,10%

94 Annual Financial Report

In case of an inflation increase by 0,50% (namely 5,60%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service would in-

crease by 11,00% for INTERSPORT ATLETK MAAZACILIK VE DI TCARET A.. In case of a discount rate increase

by 0,50% (namely 10,50%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service would decrease by 10,00% for INTER-

SPORT ATLETK MAAZACILIK VE DI TCARET A.. In the analysis of sensitivity of Turkey, a reference is made to the

inflation rate and not to compensation increase because benefits in Turkey are subject to a maximum salary (plafond) and an increase/decrease of inflation will affect the maximum salary.



The expense derived from the compensation to employees due to retirement, that was recorded in the Income Statement of the financial year 2016 is analysed as follows:



Service Cost Interest Cost Cost reduction/settlement/termination service Total amount allocated in Income statement Balance of Liability at the beginning Compensation due to retirement Paid amounts Actuarial gains/losses Balance of liability in the end

20.Financial Instruments and Risk Management Policies
20.1 Credit Risk
Exposure to Credit Risk The Group has significantly reduced its exposure to credit risk due to the disinvestment of the Wholesale Trading of Electrical Equipment segment and the focus in the retail segments where the payment of goods is mainly made by cash or credit cards discounts.
The maximum exposure at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, without taking into consideration any hedging or insurance strategies, was as follows:

20.2 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is retained at low levels by maintaining adequate bank credit lines and significant cash and cash equivalents which on 31/12/2016 amounted to  33,7 million for the Group vs  24,9 million on 31/12/2015. During year 2016, the Group succeeded to maintain the improved credit terms from its main suppliers.

The contractual loan dues including interest payments, excluding the net - off agreements, are as per paragraph Borrowings, while for Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities are less than 12 months.

20.3 Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk exposure The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising for its transactions in foreign currencies (RON, USD, TRY, SEK). The percentage of the balance of suppliers in currency other than the publication currency (euro) is 17,59% of the total. The Group, in order to minimize the foreign exchange risk, in certain cases pre - purchases foreign currencies.
The Group has investments in companies overseas, the net assets of which are exposed to foreign exchange risk. This type of foreign exchange risk (translation risk) arises due to the operations in Romania (RON), Bulgaria (BGN) and Turkey (TRY). The Management has managed to reduce foreign exchange risk, given the strong capital structure of the companies and to decrease borrowings in currencies other than the local.
More particularly, approximately 90% of GENCO TRADE SRL (Romania) loans are in local currency (RON) in an effort to avoid the exchange difference charges resulting from RON devaluating vs. the Euro. In Bulgaria the local currency is pegged to the Euro (EUR/ BGN = 1.95583) a fact which can not guarantee that economic problems and consequences of the global crisis on Bulgaria, will not increase the risk that this conversion ratio will remain constant. In Turkey, the financing for commercial activity is in local currency, while for investments is in euro.

20.4 Interest Rate Fluctuation Exposure

Profile The Group is subject to cash flow risk which in the case of possible variable interest rates fluctuation, may affect positively or negatively the cash inflows or outflows related to the Group's assets or liabilities. Despite of the fact that we believe that in an environment of prolonged global slowdown, the risk of rising interest rates remains low, the group has entered into Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contracts effectively converting part of the loans from floating to fixed interest rate for a period of 3 to 5 years.

The profile of Group's loan liabilities at the date of the Statement of Financial Position is analysed in paragraph Borrowings.

Annual Financial Report 99

Sensitivity Analysis of fair value for financial instruments with a variable interest rate A 1% fluctuation of the Group's borrowing rate at December 31, would increase (decrease) equally the Net Equity and the Operating Results by  1.481 thousand for the year 2016 and  1.496 thousand for the year 2015.
Sensitivity Analysis of fair value for financial instruments with a fixed interest rate No such Instruments (Assets/Liabilities) valued at fair value through income statement exist.
20.5 Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of the financial instruments of assets and liabilities (i.e. trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments, borrowings and finance leases) approximate their fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between two market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of the financial instruments as of 31 December 2016 represent management's best estimate. In situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Group's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the Group based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: · Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; · Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; · Level 3: Assets or liabilities prices that are not corroborated by market data.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: · Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables accounts: the carrying amounts ap-
proximate their fair value either due to the short maturity of these instruments or because there is no foreign currency risk exposure. · Borrowings: The carrying amount approximates their fair value mainly due to the fact that they bear interest at floating rates and are denominated in local currency. · Derivative financial instruments: The valuation method was determined by taking into consideration all factors in order to determine precisely fair value, such as the current and the prospective interest rates trend and the duration and falls into level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Within the year, there were neither moving between levels 1 and 2 nor moving inside and outside level 3 during the measurement of fair value. Moreover, within the same year, there was no change in the purpose of any financial asset which would lead to a different classification of this asset.
20.6 Capital Management
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure and maintain strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support the investment projects and maximizing the return of invested capital for the shareholders.
The Group monitors its capital management through the use of a gearing ratio - net debt divided by equity plus net debt where net debt includes interest bearing loans and borrowings minus cash. The Group's strategic objective is to maintain the above ratio between 30% and 45%. On 31/12/2016 the ratio stood at 41% (2015: 44%).

Upon completion of the audit, the Management of the Company does not expect any significant liabilities to occur, other than those recorded in the financial statements. In order for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 to be considered integrated, provisions specified in par. 1a of Article 6 POL 1159/2011 should apply. The integration of the years 2014 and 2015 is implemented based on POL 1124/2015.

In September 2014 the tax audit for the financial years 2007-2010 for the subsidiary HOUSEMARKET S.A. was completed and taxes of amount  1.841 thousand, as well as fines and surcharges of amount  2.022 thousand were assessed. On 24/10/2014 an administrative appeal was submitted, according to art. 63 of the Law 4174/2013, seeking for the review of the assessment acts of the Tax Authorities, and half of the amount disputed, i.e.  1.937 thousand was paid. On 24/2/2015 the company was informed of the decision of the Authority for the Settlement of Disputes, concerning the aforementioned administrative appeal, which reduced the taxes assessed to  1.632 thousand and the fines and surcharges to  1.761 thousand. On 3/4/2015 two (2) appeals (concerning VAT and income tax) were submitted to the Administrative Courts, against the decision of the Authority for the Settlement of Disputes. On 29/4/2015, based on the L. 4321/2015, the full payment of the amount of the main tax was made with a decrease of additional taxes and surcharges attributable. 22/9/2015 was the date set for the discussion of the appeal of the subsidiary HOUSEMARKET SA in the Administrative Court of Appeals, which was postponed for 1/12/2015. On 1/12/2015 the case was discussed at the Administrative Court of Appeals and the resolution 1406/2016 was issued regarding the appeal versus assesments of income tax and the resolution 1405/2016 regarding the appeal versus assesments of VAT. Based on the resolution 1406/2016, the relative Appeal conducted versus assesments of income tax of the fiscal year 2007 was, at a highly significant extent, accepted and the trial of the rest years (2008, 2009 and 2010) was postponed until December 2016 (6/12/2016). The trial of the fiscal years (2008, 2009 and 2010) took place on 6/12/2016 and the relevant resolutions are expected to be announced within the year 2017. Based on the resolution 1405/2016, the Judicial Appeal of VAT was rejected. The resolutions 1406/2016 and 1405/2016

were served on 25/7/2016. Against the 1406/2016 resolution of the Administrative Court of Appeals, the appeal of 14/11/2016 was lodged on behalf of the State, the trial date of which has not yet been determined. The Management estimates that any contigent liability may arise for the Company, as a result of this case, will not have a significant impact on the Income Statement, the cash flows or the total financial condition of the Group.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between assets and liabilities tax recognition and financial statements composition.
On 31/12/2016, the Group had accumulated carried forward tax losses in its subsidiaries on part of which a provision was made for deferred tax asset of amount  8.134 thousand (31/12/2015:  6.068 thousand) as the Management considered that the recognition criteria were met. For the part of tax losses on which a deferred tax asset has been recognized, the Management estimates that they will be covered against taxable profits before their expiration date.
Given that some of the Group companies have not been audited by the tax authorities for a few years, as mentioned above, it is considered by the Group that adequate provisions for current and future tax audit differences have been made. On 31/12/2016, the cumulative Group's provision for unaudited tax years amounts to  2.054 thousand ( 2.054 th. on 31/12/2015) and to  20 thousand for the Company as at 31/12/2016 ( 20 th. on 31/12/2015) which is displayed in Income Tax Payable.
