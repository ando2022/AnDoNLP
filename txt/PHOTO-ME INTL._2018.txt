PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

In the 2019 financial year, the Group continued to make progress on its growth strategy, led by the expansion of our self-service Laundry operations.

Total revenues from Laundry operations increased by 19.0% and revenue from Revolution increased by 30.2%. This growth was achieved despite a decrease in B2B Laundry revenue and aided by the first-year contribution from La Wash laundry services. In line with our plan, revenue from Laundry activity has continued to increase as a proportion of the Group's total revenue.

Identification declined by 1.1%, reflecting challenging market conditions in the UK. Excluding the UK operations, Identification revenue grew by 0.7%

Revenue from Kiosks declined by 19.1% following the restructuring of Photo-Me Retail, which happened in financial year 2018 and resulted in a lower number of kiosks in the Group's portfolio.

RESULTS Our operations in Continental Europe and Asia continued to perform in line with our expectations. As previously announced, overall trading in the UK became more challenging than expected as consumer activity slowed, owing to uncertainty around the UK's exit from the European Union. This resulted in lower revenues from business-to-business and machine sales activity due to delays in order decisions, albeit we expect part of these revenue delays to be recovered during the 2020 financial year.

Reported revenue reduced by 0.7% to £228.1 million and by 0.8% at constant currency. Adjusted revenue increased by 2.1%, excluding a £6.3 million revenue contribution from Photo-Me Retail in the prior year.

Reported EBITDA (excluding associates) was £69.7 million (2018: £71.0 million), resulting in an EBITDA margin of 31.4%. Excluding the impact of one-off items detailed below, EBITDA margin was 32.0%.

Adjusted profit before tax was 6.0% lower at £44.1 million when adjusted for one-off items in the financial year 2019 and the prior financial year. A reconciliation of Reported profit before tax to Adjusted profit before tax is detailed in the table below.

STRATEGIC REPORT

The Group remains highly cash generative, with £63.9 million of cash generated from operations in the period (2018: £61.0 million). This continues to support the ongoing investment in innovation and its future growth.

per share, this brings the total dividend for the year ended 30 April 2019 to 8.44 pence per share (2018: 8.44 pence per share). This will be paid on 8 November 2019 to shareholders listed on the register on 18 October 2019. The ex-dividend date will be 17 October 2019.

Capital expenditure in the year was £30.3 million (2018: £43.6 million). This reflects lower trading in the UK and our strategy to reduce the level of capex and focus on the expansion of our Laundry business, through deploying Revolution machines only at high-footfall locations.
Our net cash position at 30 April 2019 was £16.3 million, compared with net cash of £26.7 million at 30 April 2018. This net cash position reflects the distribution of dividends amounting to £31.9 million during the financial year and £36.4 million of net cash outflow on investing activities. Investing activities includes the net cash outflow on the acquisition of La Wash (£4.2 million) and Sempa SARL (£9.3 million), and ongoing investment in the growth of Photo-Me's existing business. 
STRATEGY Photo-Me operates, sells and services a wide range of instant-service equipment, primarily aimed at the end consumer. Our operations are focused on the three principal business areas of Identification, Laundry and digital Kiosks. We currently operate across 18 countries.
Our growth strategy is focused on diversifying our operations by developing new technologies with multiple applications that can be speedily deployed, at a relatively low cost to the business, across new and existing geographies and provide a rapid return on investment.
We have R&D centres in France (primary facility), Portugal, Vietnam and Japan. Our capabilities in this area are supported by a team of more than 60 dedicated engineers.
In recent years, our activities have been focused on the development and deployment of our secure upload Photo ID technology in our Identification business.
ACQUISITION OF SEMPA SARL ("SEMPA") In line with our strategy to grow Photo-Me through product diversification and innovation, the Group acquired Sempa in April 2019, for a gross consideration of 20.64 million, funded by a new debt facility of 20.0 million. Sempa's net cash position upon acquisition was more than 9.8 million, resulting in net cash outflow of approximately 10.8 million.
Sempa is the leader in France for the commercialisation of self-service fresh fruit juice equipment and operates 2,788 units. This acquisition was an important strategic development for Photo-Me and marked the Group's entry into the fresh fruit and vegetable juice market, which is estimated to be worth $154 billion¹ globally, and the platform to develop a new business area for the Group.

For the current financial year ending 30 April 2020, the Board intends to maintain a total dividend of 8.44 pence per ordinary share.
THE BOARD During the last few years, having regard to the substantial changes being made to the businesses of the Group, the Board has been mindful of the importance of maintaining stability, and continuity. Nevertheless, it is conscious of the need to bring in new Directors to take the Group forward and will continue to review the composition of the Board accordingly. The first steps have been taken following the recent decision to appoint a new non-executive director to the Board.
COLLEAGUES On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our team members across the world for their ongoing hard work and continued commitment throughout the year, supported by our country managers.
I would also like to welcome our new colleagues from Sempa into the Group as we look ahead to building an exciting new business together.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK Our Laundry business will remain the core growth driver for the Group, accounting for an increasing proportion of the Group's total revenue in the medium-term. We will continue to progress our rollout of Identification products for governments that support our strong presence in the Identification market.
Our entry into the growing fresh fruit and vegetable juice market will enable us to further diversify our operations. We plan to replicate the success of this business in France across other geographies in which we operate. In addition, we are investing in new product development to expand the products offered to the end consumer, such as an apple and pineapple juice machine. The intention is for this business to become a significant part of the Group's growth strategy and in the financial year ending 2020, we will report fresh juice activities separately, alongside our current business areas of Identification, Laundry and Kiosks.
This new business presents an exciting new opportunity for Photo-Me and steps have been taken to introduce patents and innovations to allow us to further penetrate the fresh juice market.
While consumer uncertainty continues to weigh on our business in the UK, we remain confident that overall the Group will continue to perform well in the current financial year and beyond.

Sempa has already achieved considerable success in France and we look forward to replicating this via our existing network and commercial relationships across Photo-Me's international markets, with our initial focus being on Europe. The rollout of the new juice estate will leverage our existing network of regional field engineers and our sales team, alongside Sempa's industry experience, at low incremental cost to the Group.

SIR JOHN LEWIS Non-executive Chairman
17 July 2019

DIVIDENDS Photo-Me is committed to creating value for its shareholders. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the Board is proposing a final dividend payment of 4.73 pence per share (2018: 4.73 pence per share). When combined with the interim dividend of 3.71 pence

PLANS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE NEW JUICING TECHNOLOGY supported by Photo-Me's R&D capabilities and Sempa's industry expertise.

In line with its strategy to diversify its instant service offering, in April 2019 the Group acquired SEMPA Sarl ("Sempa"), the leader in France for the commercialisation of self-service fresh fruit juice equipment.

Photo-Me is now focused on developing a new growth business area in fresh fruit juice.

The established Sempa business will give Photo-Me a strong foothold from which to launch the expansion of this business across the Group's geographic network, with the initial rollout planned in Europe.

With Sempa's expert team, Photo-Me's R&D engineers will develop additional self-service fresh fruit juice equipment to meet the needs of these new markets for the juice business.

BUSINESS REVIEW

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT
Our strategy is to grow our business through ongoing investment in new technologies and complementary products and services.
SERGE CRASNIANSKI Chief Executive Officer & Deputy Chairman
KEY READS IN THE BUSINESS REVIEW SECTION: P19 OVERVIEW BY PRINCIPAL BUSINESS AREA P22 REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHY P27 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIS) P28 FINANCIAL REVIEW

The 2019 financial year saw macro headwinds and uncertainty in the UK, resulting in a slowdown in consumer activity and delays to B2B orders. This put pressure on our financial performance, and resulted in a £6.3 million negative revenue impact. As a result, Group revenues declined by 0.7%, and underlying profit before tax by 5.8%.
Across our other geographies, the Group performed well and in line with our expectations. Overall, profit before tax was slightly ahead of our revised expectations.
We continued to make progress on our strategy to expand our Laundry services business and we achieved strong results with a 9.4% increase in total laundry machines deployed, translating to a 19% increase in Laundry revenue in the financial year, while total revenue from Revolution laundry units increased by 30.2%.
GROWTH STRATEGY THROUGH PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION AND INNOVATION Investment in innovation remains at the core of the business. PhotoMe's growth strategy to deploy new products and technologies, with multiple applications across our vending estate, is underpinned by an ongoing focus on R&D and product diversification.
We have in-house research and development capabilities in France, Portugal, Vietnam and Japan, and we employ a team of 60 dedicated and highly experienced engineers.
Our team specialises in new product and software development, focused on three key areas: (i) the refurbishment and upgrade of our estate; (ii) further development and rollout of our proprietary security biometric identification solutions; and (iii) complementary products and services.
Our largest facility is in France, where our team plays a key role in identifying new market opportunities and carries out smallscale product manufacture and testing. Once new products are fully launched, larger scale production is outsourced to our manufacturing partners.
The expansion of our Laundry business, currently present in Ireland, Portugal, the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, remains a core pillar of the Group's long-term growth strategy, with significant potential across territories where Photo-Me operates.
Expansion is funded by cash generated from our Identification business, which represents a global market-leading estate of hi-tech photobooths offering multiple instant-vending services.
Essentially, our growth strategy is focused on expanding the number of units in operation, increasing the yield per unit, and minimising production and operational costs to the Group in achieving this objective.

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

STRATEGIC REPORT

We are continually looking for opportunities to enhance our product offering and leverage our established long-term relationships with site owners and our network of 700 dedicated field engineers.
DEVELOPMENT OF A FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICE PRODUCT OFFERING As part of our diversification and innovation approach, we entered the growing fresh fruit and vegetable juice market with the acquisition of Sempa in April 2019.
The business operates via a lease model, whereby Sempa sells fresh fruit juice equipment to customers through lease finance agreements. It receives payment upon the sale of the equipment and the lease finance contracts are then subject to renewal every 12 months (on average). Sempa's customers include retail, office and work spaces, and small businesses.
The growing importance people place on their health and well-being makes it an exciting time to enter this market, with the health benefits of juice driving its popularity and potential.
Our intention is for Photo-Me to become the global leader in self-service fresh fruit juice machines and to replicate the success Sempa has seen in France by rolling out the equipment across our European network.
The Group will open a fruit juice dedicated R&D department at our facility in France, with the aim of launching a new and innovative fruit juice machine by the calendar year end.
LAUNCH OF FIRST BANKING BOOTH In November 2018 in Paris, the Group launched its first banking booth, which provides front-end retail banking services to customers, in partnership with Anytime, a Belgian Fintech business.
The technology allows customers to open a personal or professional bank account and scan in supporting documents. It then takes two days for a new account to be opened once compliance checks have been completed. The new client receives a credit card by post within two days of the account opening. In the long-term, customers will be able to deposit cheques and cash in the booths and speak directly to bank specialists through the screen. A 10-machine pilot is underway in Paris with the support of Anytime.

OVERVIEW BY PRINCIPAL BUSINESS AREA

IDENTIFICATION
(PHOTOBOOTHS AND INTEGRATED BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS)
Photo-Me is the world's largest operator of photobooths with market-leading photographic quality and technology, operating a well-established network of photobooths. Identification accounts for 61.5% of vending units in operation.
Our strategy is to (i) expand our presence in high-footfall locations; (ii) grow revenue by offering customers a broader range of services via our photobooths; and (iii) penetrate new geographies. In particular, we remain focused on deploying our proven identification security technology.
The increasing appetite from governments for improved and digitalised security ID underpins our growth strategy in this business area.

Excluding the UK, Identification revenue grew by 0.7% and the number of units in operation increased by 0.9%.

Overall Identification revenue declined by 1.1% due to a more challenging trading environment in the UK and continued uncertainty around the UK's European Union exit negotiations. Consumer activity slowed and footfall in retail locations was lower year-on-year. In addition, the UK Government's decision to allow photo ID taken on a smart device or camera at home to be used for passport photo ID has impacted Identification volumes and 178 machines were removed from the UK estate, and will be relocated, due to rising operational costs.

Elsewhere, we continued to see a resilient performance aided by the diversification of our photobooth services, including the rollout of our encrypted photo ID upload technology with governments in the UK, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. In total, the Group has more than 12,000 photobooths connected to government organisations for the secure upload of photo ID. The Board anticipates that this number will continue to grow as discussions with governments progress.
Capex for Identification reduced in the period as we prioritised expenditure on the installation of Revolution machines, only in high-footfall locations.
We will continue to invest in advanced identification technology and innovative solutions. A photobooth capable of delivering photo ID for babies and young children ­ the "first of its kind" ­ is currently in development.

LAUNDRY
(UNATTENDED LAUNDRY SERVICES, LAUNDERETTES, B2B SERVICES)

The Group owns and operates laundry units and has a presence in 12 countries, with operations primarily in France, the UK, Ireland, Belgium and Portugal. The expansion of our Laundry business, organically and by acquisition, remains the primary growth driver for the Group.

*There were 2,522 full-time units in operation during FY2019 compared with 2,031 in FY2018.

Total Laundry revenue grew by 19.0% year-on-year, despite a decrease in B2B Laundry revenue (-£3.6m), and represented 19.2% of total Group revenue in FY2019, up from 16.0% in the prior year and 10.0% in FY2017.
This reflects the continued expansion of our Laundry operations, with 427 new units installed in the 2019 financial year, generating stable revenues. During the period we installed 45 units per month on average (including sales).
The key geographies for growth continue to be the UK, Ireland, Portugal, France and Spain. The Group is looking to expand its presence in Germany (currently 20 units) and Austria (two units).
We anticipate approaching 6,000 owned, sold and acquired laundry units by the calendar year 2020, subject to macro-economic factors outside of the Group's control. And we continue to expect this business to contribute an increasing proportion of total Group revenue and profits.
Our Laundry business comprises three areas of operation: Revolution, Launderette and business-to-business laundry services.
Revolution is our 24-hour, outdoor, self-service laundry unit, which is typically located in high-footfall sites such as supermarket car parks and petrol station forecourts. Our strategy is to expand the estate through our partnerships with strategic site owners globally and identify and expand into new high-demand markets.
The number of Revolution units in operation increased by 18.1%, with 2,732 machines operating as at 30 April 2019 (2018: 2,313).
Total revenue from Revolution units increased by 30.2% year-on-year, and now represents 12.1% of our total vending estate compared with 9.2% in 2018, an increase of 2.9 percentage points.
Revolution capex reduced year-on-year, reflecting the lower cost of production as well as the Group's focus and discipline around identifying high-footfall locations where the Revolution units will be highly profitable, rather being wholly focused on the number of units deployed.

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

STRATEGIC REPORT

Launderette shops are typically situated in or near to town centres where there is limited competition from other laundry services. Our aim is to continue to expand our launderette presence through an owned-and-operated model.
La Wash, our Spanish laundrettes franchise company, which the Group acquired in May 2018, contributed revenue of £3.8 million and a profit before tax of £0.9 million, in accordance with our expectations. We are looking to build on our presence in Spain.
Business-to-business (B2B) laundry services provides the distribution and leasing of laundry and catering equipment. Our B2B customers include institutions such as hospitals, care homes and universities. The growth strategy is to extend our presence both in the UK and into new territories through acquisitive growth.
The Group's B2B operations are currently focused in the UK, where overall trading became more challenging in the second half of the 2019 financial year. Year-on-year revenue declined 39.0% to £5.8 million (2018: £9.5 million), while underlying loss before tax declined to -£0.1m (2018: underlying profit before tax of £1.4 million). As previously announced, due to economic uncertainty, the Group experienced delays in orders that significantly affected the performance of this business. We believe this is a timing issue and that these orders will be recovered in FY2020.

These Speedlab units were transferred to Photomaton in France, were refurbished and then redeployed across the country to replace previous generation machines.
The decrease in revenue is due to the removal of 491 kiosks related to the Photo-Me Retail restructuring programme in FY2018. Excluding this, Kiosks revenue has increased by 1.6%.
OTHER VENDING EQUIPMENT The Group operates 9,621 (2018: 9,829) other vending units such as children's rides (4,749 units), photocopiers (3,391 units) and amusement machines (455 units).
These are typically an extension of our product range at sites where we have an existing relationship with the site owner.
While this is not one of our three principal business areas, these machines are profitable and benefit from synergies relating to other areas of the business, such as our network of field engineers.
Further details on financial and strategic progress in each of our three principal areas of operation are provided in the Review of Performance by Geography.

KIOSKS
(HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL PRINTING SERVICES)

Our digital printing kiosks offer a wide range of print formats and personalised products that are competitively priced. Our latest generation kiosks ­ Speedlab cube and Speedlab bio ­ are fully integrated with all major social media networks and offer rapid and high-quality printing for customers.

Our key geographic markets are France, the UK and Switzerland. Our strategy is to capitalise on our market-leading position by increasing our presence in high-footfall locations, extending the range of services in our kiosks and entering new geographies.

STRATEGIC REPORT

KEY FINANCIALS The Group reports its financial performance based on three geographic regions of operation: (i) Continental Europe; (ii) the UK & Republic of Ireland; and (iii) Asia.
In Continental Europe, revenue grew by 7.9% and operating profit by 5.0%. The performance in the UK and Republic of Ireland was impacted by macro headwinds in the UK, which resulted in a revenue decline of 16.9% and a 32.2% decline in operating profit. The turnaround in Asia continued and, while revenue was down marginally, operating profit decreased by 13.5% including the impact of restructuring fees of £1.8m relating to the Japanese business.

VENDING UNITS IN OPERATIONS In Continental Europe, machine units increased by 2.8% with 266 laundry units, 193 photobooths and 67 kiosks.
In the UK, 225 unprofitable photobooths were removed and an additional 85 Revolution machines were in operation at the period end.
Following the restructuring programme, the number of units in Asia stabilised.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHY CONTINUED

CONTINENTAL EUROPE
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Continental Europe remains the largest revenue contributor to the Group. As at 30 April 2019, 53.8% of the Group's total units in operation were situated in Continental Europe, compared with 52.6% in the prior year.

Reported Revenue
Year to 30 April 2019
£130.7m
+7.9%
Operating profit
Year to 30 April 2019

+5.0%

This region contributed 57.3% of Group revenues for the year (2018: 52.7%) and 74.1% of Group operating profit before Corporate costs (2018: 66.9%).
Looking forward, the acquisition of Sempa is expected to be earnings enhancing in the financial year ending 30 April 2020 and thereafter. In the financial year ending 30 April 2020, it is expected to contribute profit before tax of approximately £3.2 million at current exchange rates.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS The Group remains in discussions with the French Government regarding the extension of its secure photo ID transfer technology to include photo ID for new passports and identification cards (91% of photobooths are enabled). Advanced discussions continued with the Dutch Government regarding the deployment of this technology for use in driving licences in the Netherlands, with 70 photobooths already upgraded with this technology.

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

The Laundry business continued to perform well, including a first-time contribution from La Wash Group, which was acquired in May 2018 for a consideration of £4.4 million. The profit before tax of La Wash was £0.9 million in FY2019. The expansion of Revolution laundry operations in Portugal, France and Spain has continued and the Group is looking at the viability of the German and Austrian markets.
The acquisition of Sempa during the period marks a significant new opportunity for the division, as Photo-Me becomes the leading player in the French self-service fresh juice equipment market, with plans to expand this offer into other countries in Europe via the Group's existing commercial network.

STRATEGIC REPORT

UK & REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (INCLUDING CORPORATE)
The performance of this division was impacted by the macro environment, which generated ongoing consumer uncertainty during the financial year, in relation to the UK's European Union exit negotiations and the tough trading conditions faced by retailers.

A slowdown in consumer spending had a significant effect on earnings in the UK, which affected performance at a Group level. UK revenues in the first half were also temporarily impacted by the restructuring of Photo-Me Retail in the UK market in H2 2018. Photo-Me Retail now operates 241 kiosks, which generate very high revenue levels and the business is profitable.
In Ireland the continued rollout of Laundry has delivered 64 new Revolutions, and revenue in the country increased significantly by 19.0% in FY2019.
The UK & Republic of Ireland division contributed 23.2% of Group revenue in the 2019 financial year (2018: 27.7%), and 15.6% of operating profit before corporate costs (2018: 21.8%).
Revenue was £52.9 million, representing a decline of 16.9% compared with the prior year. Operating profit was £7.1 million, down 32.2%.
As at 30 April 2019, 24.9% of the Group's total units in operation were situated in the UK and the Republic of Ireland (2018: 25.8%).
STRATEGIC PROGRESS In its Identification business, the Group continued to focus on the rollout of secure digital upload technology for Irish Online Passport renewal and British passport renewals. In total, 51.0% of the photobooths are now enabled for UK passport renewals.
Laundry continued to grow apace in the Republic of Ireland, with 64 units deployed in the period. Laundry revenues now account for 77.4% of the country's total revenue (2018: 72.2%).

ASIA
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group's turnaround plan implemented in H2 2018, to address the significant challenges in the Japanese market, identified in the 2018 financial year, has proven highly effective. The business has recovered faster than initially expected and is performing well.

Reported Revenue

Trading in the other countries in Asia remains strong. Asia contributed 19.5% of Group revenue (2018: 19.6%) and 10.3% of Group operating profit excluding corporate costs (2018: 11.3%).
At constant currency, revenue was down marginally (-0.8%) and operating profit decreased by 13.5%, including the costs of restructuring the Japanese business.
The restructuring programme in Japan was completed in the period, at a total cost of £1.8 million. Excluding this one-off cost, operating profit in Asia was £6.5 million compared to £5.4 million in FY2018, an increase of 20.2%.
As at 30 April 2019, 21.3% of the Group's total units in operation were situated in Asia, compared with 21.6% in the prior year.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS While the photo identification market in Japan remains highly competitive, the Board continues to believe that there are growth opportunities, given Photo-Me's dominant market position in the country. As a result, the Group intends to commence the deployment of its new units, which have a significantly lower production cost than the units deployed previously and will offer a 35.0% faster return on investment.

OUR TEAM At Photo-Me, our team is structured to reflect our entrepreneurial and creative heritage and is aligned to our business strategy and objectives. We are committed to nurturing talent within our teams and developing the next generation of leaders.
This year the business has met with both challenges and successes. I would like to take this opportunity to specifically thank the teams who have worked so successfully on the recovery of our Japan operations to deliver strong results that give us real confidence in the future of this business. I would also like to acknowledge the ongoing hard work of our teams, which continue to meet the challenges of the UK market.
In addition, I would like to welcome the Sempa team to Photo-Me. We look forward to replicating the success they have already achieved in France across the territories that Photo-Me operates, through the sharing of technological and industry expertise.

FUTURE PROSPECTS The Group will remain focused on driving profitability from its existing estate and investing in new and complementary products to extend the suite of services available through its established instant-service equipment network. There will be a strong focus on R&D, particularly as it relates to the Group's fresh fruit juice offering and its entry into this highly attractive new market for the Group. We remain confident for the future.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Diluted earnings per share were 8.26 pence (2018: 10.60 pence), a decrease of 22.1%. Basic earnings per share were 8.27 pence (2018: 10.64 pence).

TAXATION The Group tax charge of £11.3 million corresponds to an effective tax rate of 26.6% (2018: 19.7%). The increase in the effective tax rate over last year is attributable to a one off catch up deferred tax charge in the Group's French operations.

The Group undertakes business in 18 countries worldwide, with most of the tax charge arising in France, Japan and the UK. In each jurisdiction in which the Group operates, operations are organised so that the Group pays the appropriate amount of tax at the right time, in accordance with local regulations, ensuring compliance with the Group's tax policy and guidelines.

DIVIDENDS During the year, the Group paid dividends totalling £31.9 million, in respect of the interim and final dividends for the year ended 30 April 2018.

The interim dividend for the year ended 30 April 2019 was 3.71 pence per share (2018: 3.71 pence), which was paid to shareholders on the register on 5 April 2019.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

Similar to any business, the Group faces risks and uncertainties that could impact the achievement of the Group's strategy. These risks are accepted as inherent to the Group's business. The Board recognises that the nature and scope of these risks can change; it therefore regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the systems and processes to mitigate them.
The table below sets out what the Board believes to be the principal risks and uncertainties, their impact, and actions taken to mitigate them.
ECONOMIC

NATURE OF THE RISK

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

Global economic conditions Volatility of foreign exchange rates

Economic growth has a major influence on consumer spending. A sustained period of economic recession could lead to a decrease in consumer expenditure in discretionary areas.
The majority of the Group's revenue and profit is generated outside the UK, and the Group results could be adversely impacted by an increase in the value of sterling relative to those currencies.

The Group focuses on maintaining the characteristics and affordability of its needs-driven products.
The Group hedges its exposure to currency fluctuations on transactions, as relevant. However, by its nature, in the Board's opinion, it is very difficult to hedge against currency fluctuations arising from translation in consolidation in a cost-effective manner.

REGULATIONS
NATURE OF THE RISK
Centralisation of the production of ID photos

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

In many European countries where the Group operates, if governments were to implement centralised image capture for biometric passport and other applications, or widen the acceptance of self-made or home-made photographs for official document applications, the Group's revenues and profits could be affected.

The Group has developed new systems that respond to this situation, leveraging 3D technology in ID security standards, and securely linking our booths to the administration repositories. (Solutions are in place in France, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and the UK; discussions in Belgium and the Netherlands).
Furthermore, the Group also ensures that its ID products remain affordable and of a high quality.

NATURE OF THE RISK Brexit

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

The UK's referendum decision to leave the European Union (EU) ("Brexit") will most probably lead to changes in regulations in the UK as well as to modifications to numerous arrangements between the UK and other members of the EU, affecting trade and customs conditions, taxation, movements of resources, etc.

The Board is keeping the potential impacts of the referendum decision to leave the EU on all the Group's operations under review.
Any potential developments, including new information and policy indications from the UK Government and the EU, will be looked at carefully on a continual basis, with a view to enhancing the ability to take appropriate action targeted at managing ­ and, where possible, minimising ­ any adverse repercussions of Brexit.
The specific impact of Brexit on the Group will depend on the details of the conditions of the break-up to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.
The Board foresees that in the short-term the negative impact of the uncertainty overshadowing the general UK economy could also spill over into the Group's UK operations. In the long-term, potential "renationalisation" of UK identity documents (including the conversion of the EU burgundy passports to the navy blue British version), as well as strengthened immigration regulations, could lead to increased requests for the Group's secure identification products.

Business rates

Since early 2015, the Valuation Office Authority has been issuing significantly increased assessments for some of the Company's estate, mainly photobooths and printing kiosks, and in some instances applying rates that the Company considers unreasonable. The census campaign led by the government is part of the well-publicised strategy to systematically increase the amount of tax collected through business rates. The business tax risk is limited to the Company's operations in the UK. The Company has expensed the cost of the tax charge as reasonably estimated.

The Company has engaged advisers to reduce its exposure to business rates. The Company has received advice that the vast majority of the affected estate should not be subject to business rates, and therefore it has systematically appealed before the Valuation Tribunal the assessments received, while negotiating with the authorities to reduce that exposure. The Company believes that, following the latest decision by the Upper Tribunal on 12 April 2017 in the ATM case, the risk should be capable of successful mitigation. Discussions are ongoing with the Valuation Office Agency on this matter.

STRATEGIC
NATURE OF THE RISK Identification of new business opportunities
Inability to deliver anticipated benefits from the launch of new products

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

The failure to identify new business areas may impact the ability of the Group to grow in the long-term.
The realisation of long-term anticipated benefits depends mainly on the continued growth of the laundry business and the successful development of integrated secure ID solutions.

Management teams constantly review demand in existing markets and potential new opportunities. The Group continues to invest in research in new products and technologies.
The Group regularly monitors the performance of its entire estate of machines. New technology-enabled secure ID solutions are heavily trialled before launch, and the performance of operating machines is continually monitored.

MARKET
NATURE OF THE RISK Commercial relationships

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

The Group has well-established, long-term relationships with a number of site-owners. The deterioration in the relationship with, or ultimately the loss of, a key account would have an adverse, albeit contained, impact on the Group's results, bearing in mind that the Group's turnover is spread over a large client base and none of the accounts represent more than 1% of Group turnover.
To maintain its performance, the Group needs to have the ability to continue trading in good conditions in France and the UK, taking into account the situation in these two countries.

The Group's major key relationships are supported by medium-term contracts. We actively manage our site­owner relationships at all levels to ensure a high quality of service.
The Group continues to monitor the situation in both the French and the UK markets.

OPERATIONAL
NATURE OF THE RISK Reliance on foreign manufacturers

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT
The Group sources most of its products from outside the UK. Consequently, the Group is subject to risks associated with international trade.

MITIGATION
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics before the Group procures products from any new country or supplier. The Group also maintains very close relationships with both its suppliers and shippers to ensure that risks of disruption to production and supply are managed appropriately.

NATURE OF THE RISK Reliance on one single supplier of consumables
Reputation
Product and service quality
TECHNOLOGICAL
NATURE OF THE RISK Failure to keep up with advances in technology Cyber risk: Third party attack on secure ID data transfer feeds

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

The Group currently buys all its paper for photobooths from one single supplier. The failure of this supplier could have a significant adverse impact on paper procurement.
The Group's brands are key assets of the business. Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brands could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in our customer base.

The Board has decided to hold a strategic stock of paper, allowing for 6­10 months' worth of paper consumption, to allow enough time to put in place alternative solutions.
The protection of the Group's brands in its core markets is sustained by products with certain unique features. The appearance of the machine is subject to high maintenance standards. Furthermore, the reputational risk is diluted as the Group also operates under a range of brands.

The Board recognises that the quality and safety of both its products and services is of critical importance and that any major failure will affect consumer confidence.

The Group continues to invest in its existing estate to ensure that it remains contemporary, and in constant product innovation to meet customer needs. The Group also has a programme in place to regularly train its technicians.

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MITIGATION

The Group operates in fields where upgrades to new technologies are mission-critical.

The Group mitigates this risk by continually focusing on R&D.

The Group operates an increasing number of photobooths capturing ID data and transferring these data directly to government databases.

The Group performs an ongoing assessment of the risks and ensures that the infrastructure meets the security requirements.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

OUR APPROACH TO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The Group recognises its responsibilities to the community and the environment and believes that health, safety and environmental issues are integral and important components of best practice in business management. Our management of corporate responsibility can influence our ability to create long-term financial and non-financial value, and impacts on our relationship with shareholders and other stakeholders.

HIGHLIGHTS
PRODUCTS
ISO CERTIFIED
ISO International Standards ensure that products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality.

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES We believe that effective management of corporate responsibility can reduce risks and help us identify business opportunities.

We prioritise our corporate responsibility activities based on three main drivers:
oo legal requirements and future policy trends; oo customer, employee and investor preferences for corporate
responsibility; and oo cost savings and business efficiency

We aim to ensure that our approach is consistent with the directors' duty to promote the success of the Company, a legal requirement included in the Companies Act 2006. This duty is based on the principle of `enlightened shareholder value'.

EMPLOYEES

HOW WE MANAGE CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY The Board is ultimately accountable for corporate responsibility. The Chief Operating Officer has specific responsibility for risk management and health, safety and environmental matters, with delegated authority through line management.

The Group operates in highly differentiated national markets with differing national laws, preferences and cultures. As a result, operational direction and management of corporate responsibility lie primarily with national business managers, who are best placed to ensure compliance with national legislation and market expectations.
The Group's internal audit programme operates a risk-based assessment process, including corporate responsibility issues. The Board reviews Group-wide performance on corporate responsibility within the assessment and review process. Where necessary, Group-wide policies are developed or revised to address specific risks, opportunities, or new information.

PRODUCTS

THE DEVELOPMENT, USE AND DISPOSAL OF OUR PRODUCTS REPRESENT A MAIN AREA OF BOTH RISK AND OPPORTUNITY. WE ENSURE THAT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO MEET EXISTING LEGISLATION AND INCREASED CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES.

To ensure products manufactured by KIS SAS (the Group's manufacturing subsidiary, based in France, which subcontracts this function to third parties) consistently satisfy our stringent quality requirements, ISO 9001 standard certification has been achieved.
THE REVOLUTION UNITS ARE ECO-FRIENDLY: oo The built-in washing liquid pump provides the ideal quantity
for each washing cycle and reduces waste oo The highly concentrated washing liquid, free of phosphates,
colouring agents and preservatives, meets the French OCERT standard. Ecological, effective low-temperature and without allergen, this washing liquid naturally perfumes the linen oo The boiler only heats the water when the dryer is not in operation oo The energy-saving dryer reduces power consumption. oo LED lights use less energy than standard lighting oo The launderette only requires 13KW (compared with 30KW for a classical launderette)
THEY ARE ALSO USER-FRIENDLY oo The launderettes comply with CE standards and the new decree
N°2012-412 practical since 1st July 2012 oo Accessibility for our disabled customers has been a priority in
the design of this launderette from the outset. The machines and touchpads are located at the legally required height, thus combining a beautiful design with easy access for our customers oo As an added service to the customer, a built-in pump releases a specially designed neutral and mild washing liquid with a pleasant fragrance. This also helps ensure the machines are kept clean and tidy oo Equipped with high capacity professional washing machines (8 and 18kg), the user can wash and dry large or heavy loads such as duvets, blankets and pillows in a record time of 30 minutes per washing cycle oo Customers can enter their mobile number at the point of payment and an SMS will be sent to alert them 5 minutes before the end of the cycle oo This free service is convenient for customers who might use this waiting time for shopping oo Thanks to the touch screen, the payment station is easy to use by following the on-screen instructions oo Besides the coin and bill acceptor, the credit card payment is available as an option. It is a service which facilitates the use of the launderette and thus increases its use

THEY ARE ALSO BUYER-FRIENDLY oo Floor space used is less than 5m² ­ relatively little for a new
innovative service oo Low installation cost oo The launderette is delivered fully assembled and cabled, and can be
installed in half a day oo Thinner power cables (due to low power), thus cheaper
In consideration of global concerns regarding the disposal of waste and increasing metal prices and landfill costs, we have focused more attention on the re-use and recycling of our retired products. Currently, more than 90% by weight of the materials used in our photobooths, mostly steel and other metals, is recycled at the end of their product lifecycle. In light of our concerns regarding increased energy costs and man-made impact on climate change, we have embraced technological advances by investing in energy-saving improvements to our products, which are explained further under "Environment" below.
The needs of all our customers are important to us. This drives a continual review of our products and the development of solutions to meet these needs. For example, we have improved services offered to customers with disabilities, and complied with the Equality Act 2010 by introducing on-screen instructions within our photobooths for hardof-hearing customers, and voice instructions and carefully selected screen colours and font sizes for customers with visual impairments. In addition, the development of the universal photobooth enables access for wheelchair users.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT CUSTOMERS, SITE OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES ARE FREE FROM RISK FROM PRODUCTS OPERATED BY THE GROUP. IN ADDITION TO THESE MORAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.
Our commitment to the safety of our customers and business partners is achieved through a network of trained service operatives who routinely service installed equipment on customers' sites as well as conducting periodic safety inspections and tests. Customers and site owners can raise any safety concerns directly through our call centres, which immediately inform management and direct an operative to the site within 24 hours.
New products from external suppliers are assessed to ensure that they meet relevant safety standards before being launched in the market. We work with our suppliers where appropriate, sharing the benefit of our many years' experience of developing products to the highest standard of safety.
Photobooth security is managed by a multipoint locking system with either one or two security padlocks depending on the model. Our photobooths meet current electrical standards through a declaration of conformity (DOC) and Conformité Européene (CE) marking confirming Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS2) product compliance. Our experienced engineers also test equipment regularly to ensure it meets both Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) and Amusement Device Inspection Procedures Scheme (ADIPS) standards.
Children's rides manufactured by Jolly Roger (Amusement Rides) Limited, a Group subsidiary company in the UK, are produced in accordance with industry guidance issued by the British Amusement and Catering Trades Association (BACTA) and conform to CE marking confirming RoHS2 product compliance. This supplements the various British, European and International standards that apply to children's rides and ensures a minimum standard of quality and safety. The Company is also a registered inspection body within the UK of ADIPS Scheme administered by BACTA and enables its qualified operatives to inspect children's rides and issue the required safety certification.

Within the UK, the general manager fully supports the health and safety policy and ensures there is provision on the agenda of regular senior executive meetings to address health and safety matters. Policies and procedures developed over the years continue to be reviewed and adjusted as part of the process of continual improvement and keeping pace with legislative advances. To achieve the standard of health and safety performance to which the Company aspires, we believe that it is important to empower individuals at all levels and equip them with the tools and skills they require by providing relevant training and information.
The Company continues to improve its employee-induction process and has introduced an alternative online training system supplied by Essential Skillz in 2014 to teach and refresh employee skills as required. That database showed over 4,000 training sessions and 70% compliance with the training plan. The Company continues to maintain its membership of the British Safety Council and is also a member of the CE Marking Association. In addition to demonstrating our commitment to best safety and environmental practice and consistent improvement, these ongoing partnerships enable us to access expert advice and quality training resources to assist us in achieving these goals.
In the UK, the Company is accredited under two safe contractor schemes, one managed by Alcumus and the other by Altius, and has also received an assured Vendor award. This accreditation is reviewed annually and requires all Health and Safety policies and procedures to be audited by the scheme.
We recognise that all employees have an important contribution to make in the ongoing development and implementation of our health and safety policies and procedures. This is reflected in the representation from all levels of the business on the Health and Safety Committee.

STRATEGIC REPORT
ENVIRONMENT

THE COMPANY RECOGNISES ITS RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE IMPACT OF ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.
The main risks to the business in this area arise from increased legislation and the rising cost of waste disposal. The Company has mitigated its exposure to these risks by:
oo consistently reducing, in previous years, the amount of waste produced, although in recent years our UK operations saw an increase in packaging waste due to the acquisition of the ASDA Photo Centre business;
oo the recovery, refurbishment and resale of electrical equipment such as children's rides which promote the principle embodied in recent legislation of reuse before recycling. This not only generates cost savings but also creates a source of income. Where possible, we endeavour to embrace technological advances to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment. Such initiatives include:
oo the ability to automatically shut down (and restart) photobooths during closing hours which saves approximately 30% of power consumption on site;
oo the use of remote telemetry systems to minimise the number of service visits and reduce wastage of consumables;
oo the substitution of old-technology lighting with new low-energy lamps in all photobooths. The new Photobooth by Starck uses the latest LED lighting which also eliminates the hazardous waste associated with fluorescent tubes; and
oo the replacement of most old CRT monitors with new flat screen technology which is more energy-efficient and eliminates associated hazardous waste

Although we are not presently exposed to material risks related to climate change, we are taking proactive steps to ensure that our energy use and demand for natural resources are reduced wherever possible. In addition to the examples highlighted above, the Company operates a green fleet policy which specifies that vehicles are sourced according to practicality and environmental impact as defined in terms of CO2 emissions.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS Reporting of GHG emissions As of 1 October 2013, all quoted companies must report GHG emissions in their annual report as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended).
In accordance with the disclosure requirements for listed companies, the table below shows the Group's greenhouse gas emissions for the current and preceding financial year.
The Group is required to report the emissions it is responsible for (as defined below), and to provide at least one `intensity ratio' together with an explanation of methodology used.
In the table below, the Group has not reported fugitive emissions (which include leakages from refrigerants used in air conditioning units, etc.) because no data were available and, given the low number of such units in the Group, management did not consider such emissions to be material.

ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS

CONSOLIDATION APPROACH

The figures on the previous page are based on subsidiary companies owned by Photo-Me, except for those non-material subsidiary companies (mainly new start-up ventures) whose vending estate comprises less than 50 machines.
For those investments where the Group has less than 50% of the issued share capital, the Group does not have operational control for day-to-day activities and these entities are not included in the above figures.

BOUNDARY SUMMARY

The Group has included vending estates which are owned by the Group even though it does not directly control the operational use (i.e. period of operation) for these assets.

EMISSION FACTOR SOURCE

Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2016 GHG Conversion Factors for Company Report (2016: DEFRA 2014).

METHODOLOGY

The Company followed the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard.

M AT ER I A L I T Y THRESHOLD

As mentioned above, subsidiary companies with less than 50 units of operating equipment have been excluded, as have depots and other property units where the total amount spent on heating, lighting and power is less than £50,000 per annum per site.

INTENSITY RATIO

As explained below.

SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS The main components of these emissions are:
oo Emissions from motor vehicles operated by the Group, including service and installation personnel (servicing and maintaining the operational estate etc.) and administrative staff
oo Natural gas consumption on the Group's premises

SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS The main components of these emissions are:
oo Purchased electricity for use on the Group's premises. This is mainly for heating and lighting. The Group's property estate largely consists of administrative offices and storage depots. Most manufacturing of vending equipment and products are outsourced to third parties. In those instances, emissions are controlled by third parties
oo Emissions from vending equipment
The Group's chosen intensity ratio for external reporting is calculated by dividing total emissions by the average number of units of operating equipment during the year for the reporting companies.

STRATEGIC REPORT
VIABILITY STATEMENT

THE DIRECTORS HAVE ASSESSED THE VIABILITY AND PROSPECTS OF THE GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE.
In doing so, the directors have considered and taken into account the Group's present position and the principal risks facing it, the latter being set out in the Strategic Report. The directors have carried out their assessment by:
I. considering the potential repercussions of those principal risks at least annually as well as the risk impact of each major event or transaction;
II. examining the effectiveness of the actions taken to mitigate the principal risks;
III. continually reviewing strategy and market developments through regular executive briefings; and
IV. taking into account the Group's operational processes and financial resources. Based on this robust assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities over a three-year period to June 2022
This assessment included stress tests on the future performance and solvency for changes in the base assumptions over the three years and also for the principal risks facing the business in severe but plausible combination scenarios together with the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. Consideration has also been given to the risk of regional changes such as Brexit; however, the Board believes that having diverse geographical operations means that the Group is less susceptible to the effects of regional changes.

The directors decided that a three-year period is appropriate for this assessment because it enables a good level of confidence due to a number of factors including: (i) the Group's considerable financial resources including the high cash generation of its operations; (ii) the inherent unlikelihood of all or even most of the identified potential principal risks materialising simultaneously; (iii) the length of major operating contracts; (iv) the Group's diverse geographical operations plus its established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world; and (v) its proven track record in R&D development and its ability to adapt to market trends.
The directors have no reason to believe the Group will not be viable over a longer period, however, given the inherent uncertainty involved in looking at longer time frames, the period over which the directors consider it possible to form a reasonable expectation as to the Group's longer-term viability is three years.

REPORT OF DIRECTORS

THE DIRECTORS SUBMIT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS THEIR REPORT, THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GROUP, AND SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC AS REQUIRED BY LAW FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2019.
The Corporate Governance Statement and the Corporate Responsibility Statement should be read as forming part of this report. In this document, references to "The Group", "The Company", "we", or "our", refer to Photo-Me International plc, its subsidiary companies and, where applicable, its associated undertakings, or any of them as the context may require.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES The principal activities of the Group continue to be the operation, sale, and servicing of a wide range of instant-service equipment. The Group operates coin-operated automatic photobooths for identification and fun purposes, and a diverse range of vending equipment, including digital photo kiosks, amusement machines, business service equipment, and laundry machines. The Company's subsidiary and associated undertakings are shown on pages 138 to 139.The Group entered the self-service fresh fruit juice equipment market in April 2019, with the acquisition of SEMPA Sarl. The Board believes this will become a key business area alongside Identification, Laundry and Kiosks, and be a significant part of the Group's future growth strategy.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS The results for the year are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 74. The directors recommend a final dividend of 4.73 p per ordinary share which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 3 October 2019, will be paid on 8 November 2019 to shareholders listed on the register at the close of business on 18 October 2019. The ex-dividend date will be 17 October 2019. This, together with the interim dividend of 3.71p paid on 10 May 2019, makes a total dividend for the year of 8.44p per ordinary share.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Strategic Report describes the activities of the business during the financial year, recent events (including any important events affecting the Group which have occurred since the financial year end), and gives an indication of likely future developments in the Group's business.

REPORT OF DIRECTORS CONTINUED

DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE The Company maintained directors' and officers' liability insurance cover throughout the financial year. This insurance cover extends to directors and officers of subsidiary undertakings and remains in force. Article 191 of the Company's Articles of Association allows the indemnification of directors of the Company and associated companies and of directors of a company that is the trustee of an occupational pension scheme for employees of the Company or an associated company against liability incurred by them in certain situations, and would, if granted, constitute a "qualifying indemnity provision" within the meaning of Section 236 (1) of the Companies Act 2006. No such indemnities have been granted.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies incorporated in the UK to include in their annual financial report: (i) a statement of how they have applied the main principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the "Code"); and (ii) a statement as to whether they have complied throughout the accounting period with all relevant provisions set out in the Code. The directors consider that the Company has, throughout the year ended 30 April 2019, complied with those provisions of the September 2016 edition of the Code that are applicable to it, except for the following, which is dealt with in more detail below: Ms Coutaz-Replan is a member of the Audit Committee, although she is not considered to be independent. The Code and associated guidance are available on the Financial Reporting Council website at https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-governance-andstewardship/uk-corporate-governance-code.
Explanations of how the principles have been applied and the provisions complied with are set out below.
THE GROUP'S BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY The Group's business model and strategy are summarised in the strategic report, and describe, amongst other things, how the Company generates and preserves value over the longer term and the strategy for delivering the objectives of the Company.
THE BOARD BOARD COMPOSITION Throughout the year under review, the Board comprised six directors, being the Non-executive Chairman; the Chief Executive Officer; and four Non-executive Directors, three of whom the Board considers to be independent, namely Emmanuel Olympitis, Jean-Marcel Denis and Yitzhak Apeloig; and one whom the Board considers to be nonindependent because of her previous employment with the Company, namely Françoise Coutaz-Replan. Ms Coutaz-Replan resigned as an employee of the Group in August 2015. On 2 May 2018, Mr Eric Mergui was appointed to the Board as Chief Operating Officer; he is not considered independent.
PHOTO-ME GROUP BOARD

AUDIT COMMITTEE

NOMINATION COMMITTEE

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

THE CHAIRMAN The Chairman has the overall responsibility for managing the Board. The Chief Executive Officer has responsibilities for strategy, operations and results. The Chief Operating Officer has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Group and routinely reports to the Chief Executive Officer. A clear division of responsibility exists, such that no one individual or group of individuals can dominate the Board's decision-making process. Throughout the year under review, Sir John Lewis served as Chairman and Serge Crasnianski served as Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chairman. In the Board's opinion, even though Sir John Lewis has been a Director since 2008 and Chairman since 2010, it is proposed that he remain in place for the time being.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE The Board structure has complied with the Code provision that, as a "smaller company" (as defined by the Code), the Company has three independent Non-executive Directors excluding the Chairman. Although Mr Olympitis has been a Director since December 2009, he is considered by the Board as independent on the basis that he continues to demonstrate total independence in his behaviour and in his interaction with the rest of the Board.
In the case of Mr Apeloig, he is an experienced non executive director and a qualified accountant. He is also managing partner of ATE Technology Equipment b.v., a controlling shareholder in The Dan David Foundation which is a substantial shareholder in the Company. The Board considers him to be independent because he continues to demonstrate independence in his behaviour and in his interaction with the rest of the Board.
THE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR Emmanuel Olympitis has served as the Company's Senior Independent Non-executive Director throughout the period.
If a new director were to be appointed, the Board would ordinarily appoint someone whom it believes has sufficient knowledge and experience to fulfil the duties of a director. If this were not the case, an appropriate training course would be provided. An appropriate induction programme is undertaken for all newly appointed directors. All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Any director wishing to do so in furtherance of his or her duties may take independent advice at the Company's expense. All directors are required to stand for re-election every three years and newly appointed directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment. However, with a view to complying with the requirements of the 2018 edition of the Corporate Governance Code (to whose provision the Company became subject as of 1 May 2019), at this year's annual general meeting, all directors will stand for re-election.
DIRECTORS' CONFLICTS OF INTEREST During the year, directors completed questionnaires in respect of their interests. The Board will continue to monitor and review actual or potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis and will consider whether or not it is appropriate to authorise any such conflicts.

BOARD EVALUATION The Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman review the performance of other Executive Directors. The Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer and each Non-executive

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Director. The Non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, evaluate the performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. During the year, the Chairman met with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
An internal process to assess the effectiveness of the Board was undertaken during the year, consisting of a confidential survey. Areas

that were identified in which there was considered to be room for improvement will be addressed by the Board during the current year.
The Board had five meetings during the year under review.
The attendance of directors at those meetings and meetings of Board Committees is set out below.

OPERATION OF THE BOARD The Board is normally scheduled to meet in person four or five times a year, with ad hoc meetings (including by way of conference calls) convened to deal with urgent matters. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision. These include the approval of the financial statements, dividend policy, major acquisitions and disposals and other transactions outside delegated limits, significant changes in accounting policies, the constitution of Board Committees, risk management and corporate governance policy.
The Board has delegated various matters to Committees, as detailed below. These Committees of the Board meet regularly (the Nomination Committee meets as required and met once in the year under review in connection with a proposed new appointment to the Board). The Committees deal with specific aspects of the management of the Company. The Board has delegated authority to the Committees and they have defined terms of reference that are available on the Company's website (www.photo-me.co.uk). Decision-making relating to operational matters is delegated to the Chief Operating Officer and senior management.
Board and Committee papers are circulated in advance of each meeting and are supplemented by reports and presentations to ensure that Board members are kept fully informed.
Regular communication between the directors also takes place outside the formal forum of Board/Committee meetings.
BOARD COMMITTEES THE AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors. For the whole of the year under review, Jean-Marcel Denis (Committee Chairman), Emmanuel Olympitis (Senior Independent Director) and Sir John Lewis (Chairman of the Board) served on the Committee; Françoise Coutaz-Replan (the Group's former Finance Director) and Yitzhak Apeloig (who is a qualified accountant) were appointed to the Committee on 20 October 2016. The composition of the

Committee was compliant with the Code, to the extent the Code permits a smaller company's Chairman to be a member of the Audit Committee providing he was considered independent on appointment as Chairman, however, it was not Code-compliant to the extent that Ms Coutaz-Replan is not independent. Nonetheless, the Board considers Ms Coutaz-Replan an invaluable support, given her knowledge of the systems and processes gained when she was the Group's Finance Director from September 2009 until August 2015. The Board considers that Emmanuel Olympitis, Jean-Marcel Denis, Françoise CoutazReplan and Yitzhak Apeloig have suitable recent and relevant financial experience to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
Meetings are normally held at least twice a year. Seven meetings were held during the year under review. Other directors, together with the Chief Financial Officer and representatives of the external auditor, are generally invited to attend meetings, as is the Group's internal auditor when required.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR The Audit Committee meets with the external auditor, without executive directors present, at least twice a year. On behalf of the Board, the Committee reviews the Group's accounting and financial reporting practices, the reports of the internal auditor and external auditor, and compliance with policies, procedures and applicable legislation. In addition, the Committee monitors the effectiveness of both the external and internal audit functions and reviews the Group's internal financial control systems and reporting processes, and risk management procedures. The Committee considers the appointment of the external auditor and makes a recommendation on the audit fee to the Board; it assesses the effectiveness of the external auditor by means of an internal review process, assisted by a confidential questionnaire; it sets a policy for safeguarding the independence of the external auditor; and reviews the external auditor's work outside of the audit itself, taking into account the nature of the work, the size of the fees and whether it is appropriate for the external auditor to carry out such work. Details of the audit and non-audit fees are provided in note 4 to the financial statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Grant Thornton UK LLP has been the external auditor of the Group since the Annual General Meeting in October 2018. The Audit Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for Grant Thornton UK LLP's re-election as auditor for the coming year. The Board is committed to putting the audit contract out to tender at least once every 10 years. It conducted a tender process for the external audit role in 2018 in which it invited three firms to tender for the role of external auditor; Grant Thornton UK LLP was the successful tenderer.
KEY MATTERS CONSIDERED During the last financial year, the Committee conducted a tender of the external audit function, as described above. It also met to review the interim results of the external audit for the previous financial year, the external auditor's half-year review and the audit plan for the audit for the year ended 30 April 2019. In July 2019, the Committee met to review this Annual Report and to receive the external auditor's update and report on its audit activity.
The Committee's primary areas of focus have been:
oo The integrity, completeness and consistency of financial reporting, including the adequacy, clarity and appropriateness of disclosures
oo The areas where significant judgments and estimates are required in the financial statements
oo The scope and programme of audits, along with the quality and effectiveness of audit processes so that they complement the other risk management activities within the Group
oo The materiality level to apply to the audit oo Whether the going concern basis of accounting should continue to
apply in the preparation of the annual financial statements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, which are detailed in note 1 to the financial statements. The key areas of assumptions, judgments and estimates that have been monitored and considered by the Committee were:
oo The carrying value of the GBP-denominated goodwill in connection with the Japanese subsidiary and the potential impairment of this asset
How this was addressed: The determination of whether or not goodwill has to be impaired requires a review of the value in use of the asset. The main judgments in relation to the review were considered to be the achievability of the budget, the discount rate being applied to projected future cash flows and the potential impact of the volatility of the Japanese yen. The calculation of the value in use was undertaken in April 2017 and the Committee considered the conclusions and sensitivity calculations that had been undertaken as part of the review.
oo The appropriateness and valuation of provisions
How this was addressed: Provisions for termination of employment: The main judgments were considered to be the average potential claim per person and the period of lapse for the claims. The Committee reviewed all the legal documentation and the methodology of calculation.
Provision for litigation: The main judgments were considered to be the probable outcome of claims, including the potential exposure. The Committee has reviewed the arguments contained in the documents initiating the legal processes and the correspondence with the lawyers.

oo The carrying value of operating equipment and the potential impairment of these assets
How this was addressed: The Committee reviewed the assumptions made for the assessment of future discounted cash flows of the operating assets per country and per category. The review included the discount rate applied and the achievability of the forecasts as compared with the past performance, as well as the impact of external changes in markets or regulations.
The Committee's Terms of Reference are available on the Company's website.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE During the year under review, the Remuneration Committee comprised Emmanuel Olympitis (Committee Chairman), JeanMarcel Denis (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Sir John Lewis (Chairman of the Board). Thus, the composition of the Committee was compliant with the provisions of the Code, which require the Remuneration Committee of a smaller company to comprise at least two independent non-executive directors with the chairman of the board additionally being permitted to serve as a member providing that he or she was considered independent on his or her appointment as chairman, which was the case.
The Committee meets at least once per year. It met once in the year ended 30 April 2019.
The Committee makes recommendations to the full Board in respect of the Group's remuneration policy. The Committee also keeps under review the remuneration of the chairman, the Group's executive directors and senior executives, to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for their contribution. The Committee also makes awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme. The Committee's Terms of Reference are available on the Company's website.
The Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 42 provides details of how the Committee applies the directors' remuneration principles of the Code.
THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE During the year under review, the Nomination Committee comprised Sir John Lewis (Committee Chairman), Emmanuel Olympitis and JeanMarcel Denis. Thus the composition of the Committee was compliant with the applicable provision of the Code, which requires the Nomination Committee of a smaller company to have a majority of independent non-executive directors with the chairman of the board additionally being permitted to serve on the Committee as a member or as chairman.
The Committee, which meets as required, makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new directors.
The Nomination Committee is committed to the pursuit of diversity, including gender diversity, throughout the business. Appointments to the Board are made on merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender diversity. The Nomination Committee does not commit to any specific targets. The Group's Diversity Policy also recognises the benefits of diversity. The Nomination Committee will also ensure that its development in this area is consistent with the Group's current and future requirements, enhances Board effectiveness, and reflects the Company's UK listing and the international activity of the Group.

SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT The Chief Executive Officer has regular meetings with the Company's major institutional shareholders to help ensure, amongst others, that the Board develops an understanding of the views of major shareholders about the Company and the Group.
The Chairman also meets with major shareholders and has contact with them as and when required. The Senior Independent Non-executive Director and, where appropriate, other Nonexecutive Directors, are also made available to meet with major shareholders on request. Any pertinent feedback arising from such meetings is reported to the Board at its regular meetings and/or by correspondence or dialogue.
Private investors are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting and have the opportunity to question the Board. All members of the Board usually attend the Annual General Meeting. The notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on each separate issue. The number of proxy votes lodged is given at the meeting after the vote on a show of hands for each resolution and is published on the Company's website after the meeting.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group's systems of internal control and risk management, and for reviewing their effectiveness. This is effected by receiving reports from the Audit Committee following its review. The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and risk management for the year under review. The Board is generally satisfied that such systems have operated adequately throughout the period.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Such a system can, however, provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has in place processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks that are applicable to the business. The Board regularly reviews these processes.
The Chief Executive Officer is ultimately responsible for risk management. Executive Managers of individual Group companies are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of the key risks applicable to their areas of responsibility. The risks are assessed on a regular basis.
The Managers of Group companies are aware of their responsibility to operate systems of internal control that are effective and efficient for their businesses, to provide reliable financial information and to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system, with an annual budget approved by the Board. Actual results are reported monthly through the Group's financial systems, and variances are reviewed. The Audit Committee receives reports from both the internal auditor and the external auditor and reports its conclusions to the Board.
A whistle-blowing procedure by which staff may raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters, was in place throughout the year. The whistle-blowing policy can be found on the Company's website.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT IN RELATION TO THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS The Group has a thorough assurance process in place in respect of the preparation, verification and approval of periodic financial reports.
This process includes:
oo The involvement of qualified, professional employees with an appropriate level of experience (both in Group finance and throughout the business)
oo Formal sign-offs from appropriate business segment Managing Directors and Finance Directors
oo Comprehensive review and, where appropriate, challenge from key internal Group functions
oo A transparent process to ensure full disclosure of information to the external auditor
oo Engagement of a professional and experienced firm as external auditor
oo Oversight by the Audit Committee, involving (amongst others):
(i) A detailed review of key financial reporting judgments that have been discussed by management
(ii) Review and, where appropriate, challenge on matters including: the consistency of, and any changes to, significant accounting policies and practices during the year; significant adjustments arising as a result of the external audit; the going concern assumption; and the Company's statement on internal control systems, before endorsement by the Board
The above process, plus the review by the Audit Committee of a comprehensive note that sets out the details of the preparation, internal verification and approval process for the Annual Report and Accounts, provides comfort to the Board that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, and give the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT

The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our executive Remuneration Policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders.
EMMANUEL OLYMPITIS Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2019, which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee ("the Committee") and approved by the Board.
This report has been prepared in line with all relevant legal requirements, including the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended).
THE REPORT IS DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS: oo This Annual Statement, which summarises remuneration outcomes
in 2018/19 and how the Remuneration Policy will be operated in 2019/20 oo The Remuneration Policy Report, which details the Company's policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors, which was last approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM oo The Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses details of the Committee, how the Remuneration Policy was implemented in the year ended 30 April 2019, and how the policy will operate for the year ending 30 April 2020
As no changes are being proposed to the Remuneration Policy, only the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to a vote at the forthcoming 2019 AGM. This will be an advisory vote.
R E M U N E R AT I O N O U TC O M E S I N 2018/ 19 The performance of the Group is summarised on pages 4 to 41 and in the financial statements, on pages 74 to 142.
In light of this year's results, the Committee has determined that no annual bonus should be payable to the CEO or COO in respect of the financial targets. While no bonus was awarded to the CEO in respect of performance against his personal/strategic targets, the COO was awarded a bonus of 63% of salary for the year just ended, based on performance against personal/strategic targets set by the CEO (noting that the COO was appointed to the Board following the start of the 2018/19 financial year and that subsequent bonus targets will be set by the Committee). Further details of the bonus award and targets are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Based on EPS performance over the three years to 30 April 2019, 27.92% of the share options granted to the COO in 2016 will vest this month. No such awards were granted to the CEO.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION P O L I C Y F O R 2019 / 20 The Committee proposes to operate the Remuneration Policy for the CEO and COO for the year ending 30 April 2020 as follows:
oo Following a review of the Executive Directors' salaries, the CEO's annual base salary was increased for the current year by 2.05% in line with inflation. There will be no increase to the COO's salary. As such, the current base salary levels for the CEO and COO are £551,960 and £474,946, respectively
oo Benefit and pension provision will be in line with the approved Remuneration Policy
oo Annual bonus will continue to be capped at 150% of salary, with targets based on year-on-year pre-tax profit growth for a majority of the bonus and a number of key personal/strategic targets for a minority of the bonus. The bonus targets and performance against those targets will be disclosed retrospectively in next year's Directors' Remuneration Report
oo The Committee is intending to grant an award of share options over 150% of salary to both the CEO and the COO with vesting, subject to three-year EPS performance targets and continued service. While the Committee did consider scaling back award levels in light of share price performance over the past year, the Committee does not feel that this is necessary or appropriate in light of the relatively modest award level (noting that these awards are structured as market-value options rather than nil or nominal cost awards) and noting that no awards were granted to the COO in 2018

USE OF DISCRETION In determining remuneration outcomes for the year ended 30 April 2019, the Committee has not exercised discretion (positive or negative).
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our executive Remuneration Policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders. This is reflected in the Company's voting results at the 2017 AGM (approval of the current Remuneration Policy) and the 2018 AGM (Annual Statement and Remuneration Report), with both resolutions supported by a significant majority of shareholders.
In conclusion, the Committee believes that the Company's Remuneration Policy continues to be aligned with the Company's strategic objectives of delivering shareholder value and supporting the long-term success of the Company. That said, as the current Remuneration Policy will reach the end of its three-year term next year, the Committee will carry out a detailed review of the Remuneration Policy in advance of the 2020 AGM.
EMMANUEL OLYMPITIS Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 17 July 2019

In light of this year's results, the Committee has determined that no annual bonus should be payable to the CEO or COO in respect of the financial targets.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT

THE POLICY SET OUT BELOW WAS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 2017 AGM AND WILL REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THE 2020 AGM.
The Committee's Remuneration Policy for the executive directors is to have regard to the directors' experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to provide a competitive remuneration package that attracts, retains and motivates highcalibre executives from whom first-class performance is expected. The Remuneration Policy is also intended to be consistent with the Company's business objectives, risk profile and shareholder interests.

In order to align the interests of shareholders and executive directors, a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors is performance-related, through an annual bonus plan and the grant of share options.
The Committee will ensure that the incentive structures for executive directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or governance ("ESG") risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures, there is no restriction on the Committee that prevents it from taking into account ESG matters, nor do these remuneration structures encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Committee has given careful consideration to the performance measures applicable to both the annual bonus and the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committee's belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging, with the majority (or the entirety) linked to the achievement of profit-related targets. The Committee may also link a proportion of the annual bonus to strategic and/or personal objectives if it deems this appropriate with regard to the Company's key objectives. The earnings per share (EPS) performance condition, applicable to the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme, was selected by the Committee on the basis that it incentivises the delivery of sustainable long-term financial performance and rewards management for growing the Company while retaining an appropriate profit margin. The use of share options retains a robust link between management and shareholders by incentivising management to deliver long-term growth in the Company's share price. The Committee retains discretion over the use of other financial/share price-based performance metrics and the calculation of EPS in order to appropriately adjust for any material one-off items including (but not limited to) major acquisitions, changes in accounting policies and major share issues.
The Committee operates the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme in accordance with the scheme rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC legislation. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plan.
HOW EMPLOYEES' PAY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT The Committee is aware of the general pay and conditions in the Group as a whole when determining the directors' Remuneration Policy and its implementation. However, reflecting standard practice, employees are not consulted in the formulation of the policy.
HOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY RELATES TO THE GROUP The Remuneration Policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for most senior executives in the Group. Employees below executive level have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-based remuneration, with remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role of the employee in question. Long-term incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the Group's earnings' growth and share-price performance.
HOW SHAREHOLDERS' VIEWS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT The Committee continues to take an active interest in shareholder views on our executive Remuneration Policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders. This is reflected in the voting result at the 2017 AGM, with over 99.86% shareholder support in respect of the Directors' Remuneration Policy.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTIONS The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company's prevailing approved Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment and takes into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate, and may be set initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the midmarket level once expertise and performance have been proven and sustained.
Consistent with Part 4 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, any caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice unless absolutely necessary.
The annual bonus potential would be limited to 150% of salary, and grants under the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme would be limited to 150% of salary. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited, in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its original terms.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses, as appropriate.
Fee structure and quantum for non-executive director appointments will be based on the prevailing non-executive director fee policy.
APPROACH TO LEAVERS No executive director has the benefit of provisions in his or her service contract for the payment of predetermined compensation in the event of a termination of employment. It has been the Committee's general policy that the service contracts of executive directors (none of which is for a fixed term) should provide for termination of employment by giving notice or by making a payment of an amount equal to base salary (and in the case of the CEO and COO, an additional amount equal to the cost of providing any benefits for the period of notice) in lieu of any unserved notice period. It is the Committee's general policy that no executive director should be entitled to a notice period or payment on termination of employment in excess of the levels set out in his or her service contract. In determining amounts payable on termination, the Committee also considers, where it is able to do so, appropriate adjustments to take into account accelerated receipt and the executive director's duty to mitigate his or her loss. An annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, although it will be prorated for time served and paid at the normal pay-out date.

The treatment of any share awards granted to an executive director will be determined based on the relevant scheme rules.

The default treatment under the 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme is that any outstanding awards or unexercised options lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances (e.g. death, ill health, disability, redundancy or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee), "good leaver" status is applied. In this scenario, other than in the case of a retirement, any outstanding options will normally be exercisable on the date of cessation and remain exercisable for a period of six months (or 12 months in the case of death). On a retirement, options vest at the normal vesting date and remain exercisable for a period of six months.

The default treatment under the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme is that any outstanding awards or unexercised options lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances (e.g. death, injury, disability or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee), "good leaver" status can be applied at the discretion of the Committee or shall apply in relation to HMRC tax-favoured options as relevant. In this scenario, any outstanding options will normally be exercisable on the date of cessation and remain exercisable for a period of six months (or 12 months in the case of death). Alternatively, in the case of non-tax favoured options, the Committee has the discretion to determine that good leavers' awards should continue to be exercisable based on the normal timetable.

The extent to which outstanding option awards become exercisable for good leavers will depend on the satisfaction of any applicable performance conditions (over a curtailed or full performance period, as relevant). Time pro rating of options will apply to good leavers' awards unless the Committee determines that time prorating is inappropriate.

The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an executive director, the Company may make a contribution towards that individual's legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.

SERVICE CONTRACTS Details of the CEO's and COO's service contracts are as follows:

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Serge Crasnianski1 Eric Mergui2

DATE OF CONTRACT 01/05/2010 10/09/2009

NOTICE PERIOD 12 months 12 months

All non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms, subject to re-election at the AGM immediately following their appointment, and every three years thereafter. None of the non-executive directors will ordinarily be entitled to compensation upon termination of their involvement with the Company. However, if a non-executive director should be removed as a result of a resolution duly proposed and resolved by members of the Company during the non-executive director's normal term of appointment, he or she will be entitled to compensation equal to three months' fees, and in the case of the chairman, six months' fees. The relevant appointment letter and term dates of the non-executive directors are set out below:

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS The Board may allow executive directors to accept appropriate outside commercial non-executive director appointments provided the aggregate commitment is compatible with their duties as an executive director. Whether or not the executive director concerned may retain fees paid for these services will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and will be subject to approval by the Board.

ANNUAL BONUS The annual bonus will continue to be capped at 150% of salary, with the majority of the bonus (80% of potential for the CEO and 51% of potential for the COO) based on financial targets as follows:

Group pre-tax profit less than prior year Group pre-tax profit between 100% and 105% of prior year Group pre-tax profit 5% more but less than 10% higher than that of prior year Group pre-tax profit 10% or more than prior year

Twenty per cent of the CEO's bonus (30% of salary) will be based on personal/strategic targets linked to (i) driving the expansion of the Group's activities with particular emphasis on identifying acquisition targets and subsequent negotiations; (ii) devising and implementing succession management for senior colleagues. 49% of the COO's bonus (73.5% of salary) will be based on personal/strategic targets linked to (i) identifying and handling strategic acquisitions including post-integration management; (ii) managing the main Group subsidiary companies; and (iii) co-ordinating the international network.

The bonus targets and performance against those targets will be disclosed retrospectively in next year's Directors' Remuneration Report.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES The Committee is intending to grant an award of share options over 150% of salary to both the CEO and the COO with vesting, subject to threeyear EPS performance targets and continued service. These EPS targets have yet to be agreed but they will be disclosed in the associated RNS announcement issued post grant. While the Committee did consider scaling back award levels in light of the share price performance over the past year, the Committee does not feel that this is necessary or appropriate in light of the relatively modest award level (noting that these awards are structured as market-value options rather than nil or nominal cost awards) and noting that no awards were granted to either the CEO or the COO in 2018.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The fees for non-executive directors are reviewed at least once every three years; the current applicable fee levels for the roles below are as follows:

Committee Assessment of performance against the targets

While the Committee was satisfied that significant progress was made in respect of Target 1 and Target 2, the Chief Executive asked that the Committee did not award a bonus for this part of the annual incentive plan. As such, no annual bonus was awarded.

Bonus Award - % of 0% of maximum max (% of salary) (0% of salary)

Although the bonus targets were originally set by the CEO at the point that the COO was a below Board executive*, the Committee was satisfied that significant progress was made in respect of Target 1 (managing acquisitions), Target 2 (managing the main subsidiary companies) and Target 3 (coordinating the international network) when considered against the performance of the Company and noting the rollout of the strategy to diversity vending operations, the continued expansion of Laundry operations, the deployment of photobooth identification solutions and the speed of the recovery in Japan.
As such, the Committee accepted the judgment of the CEO that it was appropriate to award an annual bonus of £298,781 in respect of performance for the year ended 30 April 2019.
42% of maximum (63% of salary)

* The Committee accepted the judgment of the CEO that significant progress was made following the COO's appointment to the Board. The Remuneration Committee now sets the COO's financial and personal/strategic annual bonus targets

The CEO received no bonus for the year. The COO received a bonus for the year of £298,781, the targets for which had been agreed between him and the CEO before the former's appointment to the Board.

EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME (ESOS) (AUDITED) The ESOS awards granted to Eric Mergui on 13 July 2016 completed their performance period on 30 April 2019 and accordingly have been included in the 2019 single total figure of remuneration. These awards are fully based on performance against an EPS target.

Details of the EPS performance target, the level of achievement against the target and the resultant level of vesting are set out in the table below.

Performance condition Actual

Based on the above, 93,242 of 334,000 share options held by Eric Mergui will vest in July 2019. As these awards have an exercise price of 141.50 pence (i.e. significantly above the share price at 30 April 2019, resulting in no intrinsic gain at the year-end), the value in the single figure for Eric Mergui has been shown as £nil.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES

THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, WHO ARE NAMED ON PAGE 44, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS AND THE GROUP AND COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATIONS.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for the Group and the Company for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company's financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and the Company's financial statements, the directors are required to:
oo select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; oo make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; oo state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU; and oo prepare the financial statements on the going-concern basis unless it
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that their financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group's financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT Each of the directors of the Company, whose names and functions are listed on page 44, confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:
oo the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
oo the Strategic Report, which is incorporated into the Report of the Directors, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors have arrangements in place to ensure that the information presented in the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable; these are described on page 51.
The Board considers, on the advice of its Audit Committee, that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's and the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND KEY JUDGEMENTS Our significant accounting policies are set out on pages 82 to 88 of the consolidated financial statements and conform with IFRS as adopted by the EU. These policies and applicable estimation techniques have been reviewed by the directors who have confirmed them to be appropriate for the preparation of the 2018/2019 consolidated financial statements.

OPINION
OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED We have audited the financial statements of Photo-Me International plc (the `Company') and its subsidiaries (the `Group') for the year ended 30 April 2019 which comprise the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statements of Financial Position, the Group and Statement of Cash Flows, the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
oo the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Company's affairs as at 30 April 2019 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;
oo the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
oo the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
oo the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
oo the disclosures in the annual report set out on page 30 to 33 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
oo the directors' confirmation, set out on page 30 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
oo the directors' statement, set out on page 47 of the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors' identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and the Company 's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
oo whether the directors' statement relating to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
oo the directors' explanation, set out on page 41 of the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the `Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH oo Overall materiality: £1,577,000, which represents 3.7% of the
Group's profit before tax;
oo Key audit matters were identified as:
----Impairment of goodwill;
----Impairment of property, plant and equipment; and
----Impairment of other intangible assets.
oo We have performed full scope audit procedures on the financial statements of the Company, and on the financial information of 9 other components.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest

effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters ­ Group and Company Impairment of goodwill The Group has goodwill recorded in the financial statements of £26.6m (Company ­ £nil). As explained in Note 11 management has undertaken an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 `Impairment of Assets'. The process for measuring and recognising impairment under IAS 36 is complex and requires significant judgment. Goodwill has been allocated for management's impairment testing to eleven (2018: nine) cash-generating units ("CGUs"), allocated between geographical areas and activity. Key assumptions used by management include future growth and discount rates of each CGU. We have therefore identified the impairment of goodwill as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group has property, plant and equipment ("PPE") recorded in the financial statements of £95.4m (Company - £14.5m). The carrying value of photo booths and vending machines is numerically significant. There is a risk of impairment of these assets due to a number of factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, technology and consumer preference. There is inherent uncertainty involved in the forecasting of future cash flows which impacts the estimated recoverable amount of PPE.

How the matter was addressed in the audit ­ Group
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
oo assessing the Group's accounting policy and disclosures for compliance with IAS 36;
oo testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the underlying data used by management in their impairment assessment, by confirming the consistency of formulae used and agreeing inputs to supporting documentation including historic profit and loss data and individual market results;
oo using our in-house valuation specialists as an auditor's expert to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate applied to cash flows for each CGU;
oo challenging management's assumptions concerning forecast cash flows, based on historical trends, knowledge of country-specific markets and any changes in customer preferences and regulations;
oo evaluating historical accuracy of forecasting and discount rate by comparing to actual performance; and
oo assessing management's sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions used.
The Group's accounting policy on Impairment of goodwill is shown in notes 1.4 and 1.8 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 11.
Key observations Based on the results of our work, we determined the impairment of goodwill to be reasonable.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
oo assessing the Group's accounting policy and disclosures for compliance with the financial reporting framework IFRS;
oo evaluating the design and implementation of key controls by management to identify impairments of PPE;
oo testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the underlying data used by management in their impairment reviews, by checking the consistency of formulae used and agreeing inputs to supporting documentation including historic profit and loss data and individual market results;

Key Audit Matters ­ Group and Company There is also a risk that depreciation rates applied to specific Groups of assets do not truly reflect the useful economic lives (`UEL') of these assets and therefore that the asset valuation may be overstated. We have therefore identified the recoverability of PPE as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Impairment of other intangible assets Other intangible assets as recorded in the financial statements predominantly include capitalised development costs, software, patents and licenses amounting to £15.2m (Company £nil). These assets have a combination of finite and indefinite useful economic lives. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 , management must assess intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the reporting date and test annually for impairment where the asset has an indefinite useful life. The estimated recoverable amount associated with this assessment is subjective due to the high inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows. We have therefore identified the impairment of other intangible assets as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.

How the matter was addressed in the audit ­ Group
oo assessing and challenging management's assumptions used in their impairment assessment including forecast cash flows, historical trends, knowledge of country-specific markets and any changes in customer preferences and regulations;
oo for assets with indications of impairment but assessed by management otherwise, challenging their assumptions of the achievability of the country-specific plans, based on our understanding and research of the relevant market and its competitive environment;
oo focussing on management's impairment assessments in relation to the Group's Spanish and UK components, based on the loss-making nature of the current Spanish market and the impact of regulatory factors in the UK have led to a fall in revenues, respectively; and
oo assessing the appropriateness of UELs determined for these assets in relation to their type, based on market expectations and consideration of past performance.
The Group's accounting policy on measurement and impairment of PPE is shown in notes 1.5 and 1.8 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 12.
Key observations Based on the results of our work, we identified no issues in relation to the recoverability of PPE.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
oo assessing the accounting policy and disclosures for compliance with the financial reporting framework IFRS;
oo testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the underlying data used by management, by checking the consistency of formulae used and agreeing inputs to supporting documentation including historic profit and loss data and individual market results;
oo using our in-house valuation specialists as an auditor's expert to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate applied to cash flows for each intangible asset;
oo challenging management's assumptions around forecast cash flows, based on historical trends, knowledge of country specific markets and any changes in customer preferences and regulations;
oo assessing historical accuracy of forecasting and discount rate by comparing to actual performance; and
oo performing a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions used.
The Group's accounting policy on Impairment is shown in notes 1.4 and 1.8 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 11.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work.
Materiality was determined as follows:

Materiality measure Financial statements as a whole

Group
£1,577,000 which was calculated as 3.7% of the Group's profit before tax.
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because this is a key measure reported to investors on the Group's financial performance.

Company
£366,000 which is 1% of the Company's revenue.
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate due to the Company being a trading entity.

£17,500 and misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Our audit approach was based on a thorough understanding of the Group's business and is risk based, undertaking substantive testing on significant transactions and material account balances, and included:
oo evaluation by the Group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. For example, significance as a percentage of the Group's total assets, revenues and profit before tax;
oo full scope and targeted audit procedures accounted for 79% of Group revenue and 84% of Group profit before tax. Targeted audit procedures accounted for 7% of Group revenue and 2% of Group profit before tax. The remaining 14% of Group revenue and 14% of Group profit before tax is represented by 34 reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 5% of any of Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these components;
oo of the Group's 47 reporting components, we subjected 10 to full scope audit procedures and 3 to specified audit procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for Group purposes, but did present specific

individual risks that needed to be addressed ­ for example, interim visit, evaluation the Group's internal controls environment including its IT systems and controls;
oo the Group audit team instructing component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team determined the component materialities, which ranged from £35,000 to £946,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on 5 of the 10 full scope components was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Company, was performed by the Group audit team; and
oo the Group Engagement Partner visiting 2 component locations in France and Japan, to assess the audit risk and strategy being adopted by the component auditors. Telephone conference meetings were held with the component auditors, including planning calls and post reporting calls, where the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail and any further work required of the component auditor by the Group audit team was discussed.

TO THE MEMBERS OF PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC F O R T H E Y E A R E N D E D 30 A P R I L 2019

EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD The objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error; and to respond appropriately to those risks. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements in the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAs (UK).
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, our procedures included the following:
oo we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to the Company and the Group and industry in which they operate. We determined that the following laws and regulations were most significant: IFRS, Companies Act 2006, UK Corporate governance code, taxation laws and pension laws.
oo we understood how the Company and the Group are complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by, making inquiries to the management, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our inquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
oo we assessed the susceptibility of the Company's and Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and component auditors included:
----identifying and assessing the design effectiveness of controls management has in place to prevent and detect fraud
----understanding how those charged with governance considered and addressed the potential for override of controls or other inappropriate influence over the financial reporting process
----challenging assumptions and judgments made by management in its significant accounting estimates;
----identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations;
----assessing the extent of compliance with the relevant laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement item.
oo we communicated relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level to the component auditors and both the Group engagement team and component auditors performed the audit procedures as above. Any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were communicated by/to components and considered in our audit approach, if applicable.
oo we did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.
OTHER INFORMATION The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report,

other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
oo fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 65 ­ the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
oo audit committee reporting set out on page 49 - the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
oo directors' statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 48 ­ the parts of the directors' statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
OUR OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 ARE UNMODIFIED In our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
oo the information given in the strategic report and the report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
oo the strategic report and the report of the directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
oo adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
oo the Company financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
oo certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
oo we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As explained more fully in the statement of directors' responsibilities set out on page 65, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company 's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
OTHER MATTERS WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2019 and subsequent financial periods.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
USE OF OUR REPORT This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
F O R T H E Y E A R E N D E D 30 A P R I L 2019

AUTHORISATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRSS The Group and the Company financial statements of Photo-Me International plc (the "Company") for the year ended 30 April 2019 were authorised for issue by the directors on 17 July 2019 and the statements of financial position were signed by S Crasnianski, Chief Executive Officer and J Lewis Non-executive Chairman.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales and whose shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange, under the symbol PHTM. The registered number of the Company is 735438 and its registered office is at Unit 3B, Blenheim Rd, Epsom, KT19 9AP. The principal activities of the Group are shown on page 45.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and IFRS Interpretation Committee interpretations as endorsed by the European Union ("EU"), and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements and the Company's individual financial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise stated, to all of the statements presented. New standards adopted for this financial year are shown in note 2 on page 87.

A review of the business activity, future prospects and financial position of the Group are covered in the Chairman's Statement and the Strategic Report.
Critical accounting estimates and key judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
1) Development costs ­ notes 1.4 and 11 Management determine when the criteria for capitalisation
of development costs have been met including commercial viability and ability to reliably measure costs as an intangible asset based on discounted expected cash flows and the costs can be reliably measured. Judgement is required in determining the practice for capitalising development costs and is required in assessing whether the development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation. This judgement has been applied consistently year to year.
2) Taxation ­ note 7 During the previous year, the Group implemented a new
transfer pricing policy with the help of specialist external advisers. In conjunction with the external advisers, Management has determined that the transfer pricing policy will be deductible as implemented.

In presenting these financial statements, the directors have followed the Financial Reporting Council's ("FRC") objective in "cutting clutter" with the aim of simplifying notes and descriptions and removing nonmaterial disclosures.
1.1 B AS I S O F P R E PA R AT I O N The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held at FVTPL and available-for-sale financial assets that are measured at fair value.
Going concern The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared on the going concern basis.
In reaching this conclusion management has reviewed detailed budgets, which reflect, where applicable, the current economic conditions, with regard to the level of demand for the Group's manufactured products, the level of consumer confidence, the uncertainty of the Euro and cash flow forecasts for the next financial year and high level projections thereafter. The cash flow projections indicate that the Group and the Company will remain comfortably within their available banking facilities. Additional information on these facilities is provided in note 15.

The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management's judgement of the expected recoverability of the balance. The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax rates in the respective jurisdictions. The estimation of provisions in respect of current taxation depends on management's judgements in respect of taxation enquiries and the uncertainty surrounding resolution.
Group and Company The following are areas of estimation uncertainty:
1)Goodwill and other intangible assets ­ notes 1.4, 1.8 and 11 The recoverable amount of cash generating units (CGUs) has
been determined by management based on a value in use basis. These calculations require estimates by management, including management's expectations of future growth in revenue, costs and profit margins, cash flows and discount rates.

2)Impairment of property, plant and equipment ­ notes 1.5,1.8, 12 and 13 Management make estimates of the useful life of capitalised development costs and property, plant and equipment as disclosed below in notes 1.4 and 1.5. The carrying value for significant asset classes of operating equipment is tested annually for impairment based on a value in use calculation. Key sensitivities in the value in use calculation include revenue, volumes, selling prices operating costs and discount rates. Other key factors in determining value in use include technological developments and regulatory changes.
3) Taxation ­ notes 1.17, 7 and 24 The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based
upon management's judgement of the expected recoverability of the balance. The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax rates in the respective jurisdictions. The estimation of provisions in respect of current taxation depends on management's judgements in respect of taxation enquiries and the uncertainty surrounding resolution.
1.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group consolidates the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries, and includes associates under the equity method, as at 30 April each year.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date on which control ceases. Losses applicable to non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a negative balance.
The principal subsidiaries affecting the results and financial position of the Group are shown in note 29.
Changes in ownership of subsidiaries and loss of control Changes in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss. Any interest retained in a subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. Acquisition costs for business combinations are expensed as incurred. The consideration transferred for the

acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets acquired, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at their fair values on acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date, with such gains or losses arising from re-measurement recognised in profit and loss.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Where necessary subsidiaries' accounting policies have been changed to ensure consistency with the Group's policies.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures Associates are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
The principal associates affecting the results and financial position of the Group are shown in note 29.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the portion of results for the period and net assets not held by the Group. They are presented separately within the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 1.3 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements and the Company's own financial statements are presented in Sterling being the functional and presentational currency of the Parent Company and all values are shown in £'000 except where indicated.

1.4 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquisition of a subsidiary or associate over the fair value of the Group's share of net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investment in associates.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group's subsidiaries at the exchange rate ruling on the date the transaction is recorded. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates ruling at 30 April. Exchange gains and losses resulting from the above translation are reflected in the income statement, except where they qualify as cash flow hedges and are reflected in equity. There were no qualifying cash flow hedges in 2019 or 2018.
Income statements of overseas entities are translated into Sterling, at weighted average rates of exchange, as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction and their balance sheets are translated at the exchange rate ruling at 30 April. Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets are taken to equity, as is the exchange difference on the translation of the income statement between average and closing exchange rates. For this purpose net assets includes loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Such cumulative exchange differences are released to the income statement on disposal of the subsidiary or associate.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates post 1 May 2004 is treated as a foreign currency asset and translated at the rate ruling at 30 April. On transition to IFRS on 1 May 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies. Pre 1 May 2004 goodwill was treated as a sterling asset and is included in these financial statements at that value less any subsequent impairment.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired and is carried at cost less any impairment. On disposals, goodwill is included in the calculation of gains or losses on the sale of the previously acquired entity.
Goodwill relating to previous acquisitions (pre-1999) was charged under UK GAAP to equity and is not included in the gain or loss on sale of the previously acquired entity to which it relates.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units. Each of these units represents the Group's investment in each region of operation.
Research and development expenditure Research and Development costs are accounted for in line with all relevant criteria as mandated by IAS 38. Research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in developing projects are capitalised as intangible assets when it is considered that the commercial viability of the project will be a success based on discounted expected cash flows, and the costs can be reliably measured. Other development costs are expensed and are not recognised as assets.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets (including research and development) acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Other intangibles are capitalised at cost.

The policies applied to the Group's intangible assets are summarised as follows:

1.5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.

Subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised, either as a separate asset, or included in the cost of the asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any parts of the assets that are replaced are derecognised. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

Freehold land is not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, or occasionally on a reducing balance basis, to reduce cost to the estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset at the following rates:

Freehold buildings Leasehold improvements
Photobooths and vending machines Plant, machinery, furniture, fixtures and motor vehicles

2% ­ 5% straight-line
over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis
10% ­ 33.33% straight-line
12.5% ­ 33.33% straight-line or reducing balance. Capitalised assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the asset or the life of the lease

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each year end and adjusted, if appropriate.

The critical judgement areas for operating equipment revolve around the useful life of the asset and whether an impairment charge is required. Operating equipment assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment testing.

1.6 INVESTMENT PROPERTY Certain of the Group's properties are classified as investment properties; being held for long-term investment and to earn rental income. Investment properties are stated at cost and the building element is depreciated to reduce cost to its estimated residual value at rates between 3.33% and 8.33% on a straight-line basis.

1.7 LEASES Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of lease payments discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest element in the lease payment is expensed at a constant interest rate, whereas the obligation net of the interest element is included in other payables.

All other leases, including any fixed element of site agreements are classified as operating leases and rentals are expensed over the period of the lease on a straight-line basis.

Where a Group company acts as a lessor the lease is classified as finance or operating lease and accounted for as follows:
When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments are recognised as a receivable. The rental is allocated between finance income and repayment of capital in each accounting period using the actuarial method, such that finance income will emerge as a constant rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease.
Lease income on operating leases is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis and the asset is included in the statement of financial position based on the nature of the asset.
1.8 IMPAIRMENT For goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, the carrying value is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired.
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset is higher than the recoverable amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognised. In carrying out such impairment evaluations the recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. Assets that do not generate largely independent cash inflows are grouped at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist (cash-generating units) and the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit (CGU). If necessary, the carrying value is reduced by charging an impairment loss in the income statement.
Reversal of impairment Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised. No impairment loss is reversed for goodwill.
1.9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Group Policy applicable from 1 May 2018 (i) Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, and
subsequently at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
(ii)Financial assets held at amortised cost These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (iii)Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of trading or if so designated by management. Assets held in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within one year; otherwise they are classified as non-current. Financial assets in this category are initially recorded and subsequently valued at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
(iv) Borrowings Borrowings are recorded initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This method includes any initial issue costs and discounts or premiums on settlement. Finance costs on the borrowings are charged to the income statement under the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is cancelled, discharged or has expired.
(v) Trade and other payables Trade payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Recognition and measurement For investments designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are based on current bid prices. For unlisted investments the Group uses various valuation techniques to determine fair values.
Classification of financial assets Financial instruments are designated in accordance with the business model under which the instrument is held. Changes to the classification of financial instruments on transition are shown in note 32.

These assets are held at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.
Included within these amounts are cash deposits that are subject to restrictions and are not freely available for use by the Group until a future date.
(iii)Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of trading or if so designated by management. Assets held in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within one year; otherwise they are classified as non-current. Financial assets in this category are initially recorded and subsequently valued at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
(iv) Available-for-sale financial assets Financial assets not classified in any of the above categories
are shown as available-for-sale financial assets and are shown as non-current assets, unless management intends to sell the financial assets within 12 months of the end of the financial year. These assets are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently carried at fair value.
(v) Borrowings Borrowings are recorded initially at the fair value of the  consideration received net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This method includes any initial issue costs and discounts or premiums on settlement. Finance costs on the borrowings are charged to the income statement under the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is cancelled, discharged or has expired.

Impairment of financial assets The Group calculates the expected credit loss (ECL) as mandated by IFRS 9 on the Group's trade and other receivable balances outstanding at the reporting date. This includes receivables arising from equipment sales and the Group's B2B laundry business but excludes vending revenue. The ECL is based on the 5 year average historic credit losses as a proportion of trade and other debtors compared to the total provision for bad doubtful debts at the reporting date, with business units bearing a similar credit risk profile segmented together.
No ECL was required at 1 May 2018 or 30 April 2019.

(vi) Trade and other payables Trade payables are initially recorded at fair value and  subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Recognition and measurement For investments designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale financial assets the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. For unlisted investments the Group uses various valuation techniques to determine fair values, including at cost less any provision for impairment, where appropriate.

Policy applicable until 30 April 2018 (i)Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such financial assets arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position. These assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
(ii) Held to maturity financial assets These financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.

At each year end date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets, has become impaired. Any impairment loss so recognised is reflected in the income statement. Indications of impairment may include a reduction in the quoted price, a reduction in the underlying profitability of the investment and other factors indicating that the value of the investment has fallen.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and simultaneously settle the liability.

1.10 I N V E N TO R I E S Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of work-in-progress and finished goods includes an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Finished goods also includes operating equipment not yet sited.
Raw materials and consumables are valued on a first-in first-out basis or on an average cost basis where average cost is not significantly different to first-in first-out due to the fast turnaround of consumables. The Group uses standard costs to value inventory and these standard costs are regularly updated to reflect current prices.
Inventories are stated net of provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on expected future usage.
1.12 C AS H A N D C AS H E Q U I VA L E N TS Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statements of financial position at cost. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities in the statements of financial position. For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand, unrestricted deposits held at banks with less than three months' notice and other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, less bank overdrafts.
1.13 S H A R E C A P I TA L Shares of the Company are classified as equity.
Where the Company acquires its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax relief), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity shareholders until the shares are either cancelled or subsequently reissued. The amount is shown in equity as treasury shares. Where such shares (the treasury shares) are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.
1.14 E M P LOY E E B E N E F I TS Pension obligations Group companies have various pension schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries in which they operate.
The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants, with contributions made by employees and the Company with defined benefits being based upon the employee's length of service and final pensionable salary. The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Defined benefit scheme The Group also has defined benefit pension schemes as noted in note 22.
The net obligation for the Group's defined benefit pension schemes is calculated for each scheme separately by estimating the future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value amount of plan assets. The calculation is performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit actuarial method. If this calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, this asset is only recognised to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of a refund of contributions paid to the fund or reductions in future

contributions. In calculating the present value of any economic benefit consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements.
Re-measurement of the net liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effects of any asset ceiling, are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the then net defined liability(asset), taking into account changes in the period as a result of contributions and pension benefits paid. Other expenses are charged to profit and loss.
When plan benefits are changed or the plan curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised in profit and loss. Gains and losses on settlement of any plan are recognised when settlement occurs.
Defined contribution scheme Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
Other post-employment benefits In addition to the pension schemes noted above, contracts of employment in certain Group companies require provision to be made for employee retirements. These provisions are based on local circumstances, length of service and salaries of the employees concerned. They are included in post-employment benefit obligations, and shown in note 22 as other retirement provisions.
Equity compensation benefits The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date of grant, determined using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The Group does not have options with market conditions.
On exercise of the option the proceeds received are allocated to share capital (nominal value of shares) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments (shares) to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of the employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the investing period as an increase to the investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to other reserves in equity.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised in the income statement in the period when the Group is demonstrably committed to the termination of employment or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Short-term employee benefits The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term employee benefits (such as holiday pay, bonuses and profit sharing) where these obligations contractually arise (for example, as a result of employment contracts) or where a constructive obligation has arisen from past practice.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 1.15 P R OV I S I O N S Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are discounted where the effect of the time value of money is material.
1.16 TA X AT I O N Tax expense for the current period comprises current and deferred tax and is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying value in the accounts.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in future periods in which the temporary difference will reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the future taxable profit, against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, will be available.
Deferred tax is provided, or an asset recognised, on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at year end.
1.17 S E G M E N T R E P O R T I N G Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker as required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Details of the segments are shown in note 3.
1.18 R E V E N U E R E C O G N I T I O N Revenue is is recognised at the point in time when value and control is transferred to the customer to the extent that the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and is recognised when it is probable that the Group will collect the related consideration. Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable and is measured net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.

Vending revenue from the operation of photo booths, laundries, kiddy rides and kiosks is recognised when the services are provided which is when payment is received. Vending revenue is total consideration received during the period including that held in machines at the balance sheet date. There are no vending transactions requiring unbundling of components.
Revenue from the sale of equipment, spare parts and consumables is recognised upon delivery of products and acceptance, if applicable, by the customer. Equipment, spare parts and consumables are sold on their own and on unbundling required for accounting purposes.
Revenue from the provision of services, principally maintenance contracts, is recognised evenly over the period in which the service is available to the customer. Services are sold on their own as stand alone products with no unbundling required.
1.19 OW N W O R K C A P I TA L I S E D Some of the Group's subsidiaries manufacture vending equipment, which is then sold to the Group's operating companies and capitalised by them as fixed assets. The amount capitalised includes direct costs associated with the manufacture of such items together with applicable overheads, but excluding general overheads and administration costs. Profits made by the selling company are eliminated on consolidation.
1.20 DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS Dividends to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders' equity in the period in which the shareholders' right to receive payment is established.
1.21 G OV E R N M E N T G R A N TS Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit and loss on a systematic basis in periods in which the expenses are recognised, provided the terms of the grant are satisfied.
1.22 COMPANY INVESTMENTS In the Company statement of financial position, investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less impairment. The Company reviews, at least annually, the carrying value of investments and performs an impairment exercise.
An impairment charge is made where there is evidence that the carrying value exceeds the future cash flows of the investment or where its carrying amount will not be recovered from sale.

1.23 SPECIFIC ITEMS The presentation and use of Specific items is a non-GAAP measure and the use of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature and frequency. Management determines whether an item is specific and warrants separate disclosure by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. This is consistent with the way operating performance is presented and reported to management.
The directors believe that the presentation of the Group's results in this way is relevant to providing a clear understanding of the Group's performance, as Specific items are by definition material, unusual and rare. Management consider their exclusion necessary to provide a more clear understanding of the Group's underlying performance.
For those years where Specific items are shown in the Group statement of Comprehensive Income an alternative earnings per share is shown in the earnings per share note. Alternative earnings per share and alternative diluted earning per share are shown and are calculated on earnings available to Ordinary shareholders excluding Specific items.
Underlying results are reported results adjusted to exclude the effect of Specific items.
2 N E W STA N D A R D S , A M E N D M E N TS A N D INTERPRETATIONS
New accounting standards Adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments for the first time in these financial statements with no material impact.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with Customers.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 May 2018. Adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the Group's financial position or performance; therefore, no restatement of the comparative figures has been required.
Classification IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their intrinsic cash flow characteristics.
IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL and eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
The adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has not had a material impact on the accounting for trade receivables, loans, investments in debt securities and investments in equity securities that are

managed on a fair value basis. At 30 April 2018, the Group had equity investments with a carrying value of £4,286,000 classified as available for sale that are held to maximise cash flows through sale. On 1 May 2018, Under IFRS 9, the Group has designated these investments as measured at FVTPL, consequently, all fair value gains and losses will be reported in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets IFRS 9 replaces the `incurred loss' model in IAS 39 with a forwardlooking `expected credit loss' (ECL) model. This requires considerable judgement about how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, except for investments in equity instruments.
88.1% (2018: 88.0 %) of the Group's revenue consists of prepaid vending activities with no inherent credit risk.
The ECL was calculated with reference to the Group's current provision for doubtful debts as a proportion of trade receivables at year end compared to the 5 year average profit and loss charge in respect of bad debts as a proportion of average debtors. Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables of which the current state of the economy (such as Brexit, market interest rates or growth rates) and particular industry issues in the countries in which it sells its goods are judged to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. The ECL calculation was prepared on a segmented basis with business units with a similar credit risk profile segmented together.
Based on the above calculation, the Company and the Group's existing provisions were sufficient to cover the ECL 1 May 2018 and 30 April 2019.
Classification ­ Financial liabilities IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification of financial liabilities, however, under IAS 39 all fair value changes of liabilities designated as at FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss, whereas under IFRS 9 these fair value changes are generally presented as follows:
oo the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability is presented in OCI; and
oo the remaining amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss.
The Group has not designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL and it has no current intention to do so. Adoption of IFRS 9 did not indicate any material impact on the classification of financial liabilities at 1 May 2018.
Changes to the classification of financial assets on transition are shown in note 32.

IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers was adopted on 1 May 2018. Adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers did not have a material impact on the Group's financial position or performance; and therefore, no restatement of the comparative figures has been required.
No other new standards, amendments or interpretations to standards effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 May 2019 have had a material impact on our financial position or performance, nor the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements.
Not adopted by the Group Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the year ended 30 April 2019 and have not been early adopted.
With the exception of IFRS 16 Leases, none of the accounting standards issued but not yet effective are expected to have a significant impact on our annual financial statements, including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
IFRIC 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. In particular, the interpretation addresses whether uncertain tax treatments should be considered separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments, and addresses the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities. IFRIC 23 is effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 Leases The Group adopted IFRS 16 on 1 May 2019.
IFRS 16 mandates the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability for all arrangements that meet the criteria of a lease and do not qualify for an exemption. The right-of-use (ROU) asset is depreciated over the term of the lease with the liability amortising over the life of the lease with a resulting interest charge.
IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use and enjoy substantially all the economic benefits of an identified asset, for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.
The Group has arrangements across a number of categories that may meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16. These include:
Site agreements: The Group operates approximately 47,000 vending units. These units are deployed under a fee paying agreement with the site occupier. These agreements vary widely in their terms and conditions. The Group is examining, on an individual basis, the degree to which these agreements meet the definition of

a lease under IFRS 16, with particular regard to the presence of an identified asset with no substitution rights. While the standard sets out the definition of a lease, judgement is required in assessing the degree to which those criteria are met, particularly with regard to the presence of an identified asset with no substitution rights.
Property and motor vehicles: The Group occupies a number of buildings and utilises a number of motor vehicles under rental agreements. Following an examination of the agreements, the Group has determined that these arrangements qualify as leases under IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 will be adopted on the modified retrospective basis, meaning that the carrying amount of the initial right-of-use assets will equal the respective lease liabilities for all leases entered into before 1 May 2019; with no restatement of prior year comparatives required. The impact of the change in accounting standard on each line item in the financial statements will be provided.
The following practical expedients will be applied:
oo the Company will apply a single discount rate to lease arrangements for assets with similar characteristics;
oo the Company will exclude other initial direct costs from the measurement of the ROU asset for all asset classes (Site agreements, Property and Motor vehicles);
oo the Company will apply the use of hindsight to determine the lease term;
oo the Company will conduct impairment testing immediately before the date of initial application; and
oo the Company will elect to not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For arrangements meeting the definition of a lease, costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability, which may impact the phasing of operating profit and profit before tax, compared to the cost profiles and presentation in the income statement under IAS 17. This will also impact the classification of associated cash flows in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
Except for IFRS 16 as noted above, the Directors do not currently anticipate that the adoption of any other standard or interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified, based on information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in order to allocate resources to the segments and monitor performance. The Group reports its segments on a geographical basis, Asia, Continental Europe and United Kingdom & Ireland. The Group's European operations are predominately based in Western Europe and with the exception of the Swiss operations use the Euro as their domestic currency. The Board, being the CODM, believe that the economic characteristics of the European operations, together with the fact that they are similar in terms of operations, use common systems and the nature of the regulatory environment allow them to be aggregated into one reporting segment.

The CODM monitors performance of the segments at the underlying operating profit level before Specific items, interest and taxation.

In accordance with IFRS 8, no segment information is provided for assets and liabilities in the disclosures below, as this information is not regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

The segment results are as follows:

10 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Parent of £31,226,000 (2018: £40,134,000) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential shares into shares. The Group has only one category of dilutive potential shares being share options granted to senior staff, including directors, as detailed in note 20.

The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out in the table below:

Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows of the CGU. Cash flows include a forecast period of five years, based on actual operating results, budgets and economic market research with a terminal value based on a long term growth rate applied thereafter.

Key assumptions Growth rate 1%-3% (2018: 3%)

The growth rate has been determined based on a conservative basis for expected annual growth in EBITDA for each CGU and takes into account revenue, volumes, selling prices and operating costs. It is based on past experience and expected future developments in markets and operations.

Discount rate 6.5%­7.5% (2018: 6.9%­8.3%) The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts for the CGUs are derived from the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the Group adjusted for economic and political risks for the specific country concerned.

The rates used are: United Kingdom 7.2%, (2018:8.3%), Ireland 7.7% (2018: 7.9%), France 7.7% (2018: 7.8%), Germany 6.5% (2018:7.5%), Spain 6.95% (2018: n/a), Switzerland 7.1% (2018: 6.9% ) and Japan 7.5% (2018: 6.9%). The Board is confident, overall, that these discount rates reflect the circumstances in each region, and are in accordance with IAS 36.

Included in the net book value of other intangible assets is £3,447,000 corresponding to droit au bail (2018: £3,478,000).

Droit au bail, which occur in France, are payments made for the right to occupy a space to site vending equipment. The Group has control over the use of these rights and has classified them as having an indefinite life, as the Group considers that there is no foreseeable limit to the period in which they can be utilised. Although the Group has no intention of selling these rights, there is a value attached to them. These assets are carried at cost, being the payments made for the right to occupy the space. In determining fair values of such assets for the purpose of impairment testing, the Group has based its assumptions on current prices paid for such assets (using actual amounts paid by the Company and/or management estimates for amounts paid by third parties) and, where the right has been held for a number of years, the expected sales price, less costs to sell. The carrying amount of these intangible assets has been reviewed on an individual basis for impairment testing at least once a year and more frequently if there is an indication that they may be impaired. If the fair value is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised and charged to cost of sales. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in the basis of this assessment would cause the carrying value of these rights to exceed their recoverable value.

Also included in other intangible assets is £2,212,000 (2018: £2,549,500) relating to the licence which grants the right to use space in Asda stores following the acquisition of the Photo Division of Asda Stores Limited in the financial year ending 30 April 2017. The useful life of this intangible asset is finite and is being amortised over the term of the licence agreement (10 years) to October 2026. The amortisation charge is included within cost of sales. The Group tests the carrying value of the Asda licence annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was measured on the basis of its value in use, by applying cash flow projections based on financial forecasts covering the period to October 2026. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation were those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the forecast period. The estimated growth rates were based on past performance and expectation of future changes in the market. The growth rate used was 2% (2018: 2%) and the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 10% (2018: 5.93%).

The Group tests all significant operating equipment asset classes for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Impairment reviews on operating equipment are all conducted on a value in use basis.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the CGUs was measured on the basis of its value in use, by applying cash flow projections based on financial forecasts covering a period of up to eight years, in line with the useful economic life of the asset class. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation were those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the forecast period. The estimated growth rates were based on historic performance trends and budgets. The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the financial forecasts ranged from 0% to 3% (2018: 0%- 3%). A conservative pre-tax discount rate of 8.3% (2018: 10%) was applied to the cash flows. No impairment losses were identified and consequently no impairment losses were recognised in 2019 (2018: none).

On 1 August 2018, the Group disposed of its interest in Stilla Technologies SA, a French company specialising in universal and flexible digital PCR (dPCR) genetic testing, for 5,000,000, resulting in a gain of £3,258,000 (see note 4). The Group's interest in Stilla Technologies SA was held by MGInvest Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Photo-Me International.

On 28 February 2018, Max Sight Group Holdings Limited was listed on the Hong Kong Growth Enterprise Market. In preparation for the listing, Max Sight Limited and Fullwise Limited (included in `Other' below) were merged with certain other companies to form an enlarged group (Max Sight Group Holdings Limited), resulting in a dilution of Photo-Me's shareholding. Following the listing, Photo-Me's interest in Max Sight Group Holdings Limited was approximately 13.75% of the total issued share capital and voting rights. As a result, Max Sight Limited and Fullwise Limited ceased to be associates and accordingly, Max Sight Limited and Fullwise Limited were de-recognised as associated entities resulting in a deemed disposal. The amounts shown below in respect of Max Sight Limited for the year ended 30 April 2018 are the Group's share of revenue and profit for the period in which Max Sight Limited and Fullwise Limited were associates.

15 F I N A N C I A L I N ST R U M E N TS Group Treasury The Group has a centralised treasury function. The primary aim for this function is to manage liquidity and funding arrangements and the Group's exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The general approach for Group Treasury is one of risk reduction within a framework of delivering total shareholder return.

Treasury operations Overview and policy Treasury policy is set by the Board. Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures. To date the treasury function has limited itself to obtaining surplus cash from the subsidiaries and depositing this in bank accounts owned by the Group's Treasury Company. The Board has defined an investment strategy, amounts and types of products to which the surplus cash may be invested.

The Board monitors the performance of the Treasury function and is responsible for making changes to the personnel and limits of authority of Treasury personnel.

The Board has provided written principles for overall risk management of the Treasury Function. It has also defined policies and procedures covering such areas as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative instruments and investment of excess liquidity (surplus funds above the immediate and short­term operational funding needs, such as working capital requirements). The key objectives for Group Treasury are to protect the principal value of cash and cash equivalents, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise external borrowings, and to maximise the return on cash.

15 F I N A N C I A L I N ST R U M E N TS C O N T I N U E D Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations in settling its financial liabilities. The Group's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. A material and sustained shortfall in the Group's cash flow could undermine the Group's credit rating, impair major investor confidence and restrict the ability of the Group to raise new funds.
The Group maintained a satisfactory net cash position throughout the year and preceding year as a result of cash generation from the business.
During the current year and prior year surplus cash held by the operating subsidiaries, over and above balances required for working capital management was transferred to Group Treasury. These funds were kept in their local currency, or converted into sterling and kept in the Treasury Company bank accounts which are interest bearing.
The strong cash generation and retention from the business together with available credit resources, help mitigate liquidity risk.
The Group may hold financial instruments (such as bank and other loans) to finance its day to day working capital requirements, for capital expenditure, for corporate transactions (such as dividend payments to shareholders, share buybacks, acquisitions), for the management of currency and interest rate exposure arising from its operations (which may involve the use of derivatives and swaps) and for the temporary investment of short-term funds. No derivatives or swaps have been used in the year ending 30 April 2019 (30 April 2018: none). With a satisfactory net cash position, the Group largely finances its working capital and capital expenditure programmes from its own resources. In addition financial instruments such as trade receivables (amounts due from customers as a result of a sale) and trade payables (arising from purchases of materials and services) arise from day to day trading.
The following notes describe the Group's financial risk management policy and details on financial instruments.
15 ( A ) FA I R VA L U E S O F F I N A N C I A L I N ST R U M E N TS BY C L ASS There is no difference between the fair values and the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities held in the Group's or the Company's statement of financial position.
Held at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), amortised cost, to maturity, available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives The fair value is based on quoted prices at the reporting date for quoted investments and other valuation methods for unquoted investments. For restricted deposit accounts held to maturity, fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date if the effect is material.
Cash and cash equivalents The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying value where cash is repayable on demand. For short-term cash deposits and other items not repayable on demand, fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest-bearing borrowings Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Trade and other payables The fair value of trade and other payables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date if the effect is material.

IFRS 13 requires an analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value, which are classified as financial instruments held at FVTPL (2018: Other financial assets ­ available for sale) by valuation method as follows:

Level 1 ­ q uoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 ­ inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as process) or indirectly (that is derived from process).

Level 3 ­ inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data

At 30 April 2019, the Group held financial instruments amounting to £1,387,000 (2018: £4,286,000). These amounts included the Group's interest in Max Sight Group Holdings Limited of £1,176,000 (2018: £4,074,000) which is a listed investment valued at level 1. Other financial instruments of £211,000 (2018: £212,000) are valued at level 3.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
15( B ) F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T R I S K M A N AG E M E N T Financial risk factors and financial risk management Overview The Group and the Company are exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
(i) Credit risk (ii) Liquidity risk (iii) Market risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. It mainly arises on trade and other receivables and bank balances.
Liquidity risk arises from the Group and the Company having insufficient cash resources to meet its obligations as and when they fall due for payment.
Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices that will impact on the Group's and the Company's income statement or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Listed below are details of these risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and monitoring risks and the Group's management of capital.
Risk Management Framework The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential risks for the Group. Information has been disclosed relating to the Parent Company only where material risk exists.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key financial risks faced by the Group in line with changing market conditions and the Group's strategy. If necessary, the Group's internal audit function may assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of controls and procedures. The Board retains responsibility for ensuring the adequacy of systems for identifying and assessing significant risks, that appropriate control systems and other mitigating actions are in place and that residual exposures are consistent with the Group's strategy and objectives. Assessments are conducted for all material entities.
The Group may use derivatives to manage exchange or interest rate risk. Approval for their use is given by the Board and the position is monitored constantly.
With regard to management of interest rate risk, the objectives are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on earnings and shareholders' funds and to ensure no breach of covenants. This is mainly achieved by reviewing the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The Group's liquidity risk management involves maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.

15 ( B ) F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T R I S K M A N AG E M E N T C O N T I N U E D (i) Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, and on outstanding trade and other receivables. Cash deposits are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to customers with an approved credit history.

Credit quality of financial assets Individual Group companies have banking relationships with leading banks in the country in which the Group company operates. Surplus cash is placed with Group Treasury bank accounts, as described above. The Group has procedures in place to ensure that cash is placed with sound financial institutions.

The Group and the Company trade with a large number of customers, ranging from quoted companies and state organisations to individual traders. Individual Group companies have credit control procedures in place before making sales to new customers and levels of credit are reviewed in light of trading experience. The normal terms of trade are in the range 30­90 days. The collection of outstanding receivables is monitored at both the Group and subsidiary level.

The Group and the Company make provisions against trade and other receivables, such provisions being based on the previous credit history of the debtor and if the debtor is in receivership or liquidation.

The maximum credit risk for financial assets is the carrying value.

Trade receivables are normally interest free. The normal terms of settlement are between 30 and 90 days. Other receivables and prepayments and accrued income are interest free.

Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due or an impairment amount being required under the ECL model mandated by IFRS 9.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. The Group does not have trade receivable and contract assets for which no loss allowance is recognised because of collateral.

The Directors have concluded that the credit risk of trade and other receivables has not increased significantly since initial recognition. The Directors have come to this conclusion having considered micro and macro economic factors including Brexit, the Group's knowledge of its customers, payment history of the customers and industry trends.

Details of how the ECL is calculated are set out in note 2. No ECL was required following the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 May 2018 or 30 April 2019.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At 30 April 2019, trade receivables of £3,935,000 (2018: £3,391,000) were past due and relate to a number of individual customers for whom there is no recent evidence of default and therefore are not impaired.

The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed on an individual basis, based on credit ratings and experience. Management believes adequate provision has been made for trade receivables.

Amounts due from subsidiaries of £16,503,000 (2018: £26,164,000) are all current.

(ii) Liquidity risk The Group's liquidity risk management involves maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Trading forecasts indicate that the current facilities provide more than sufficient liquidity headroom to support the business for the foreseeable future. The net cash position at 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018 has reduced liquidity risk for the Group.

The Group has adequate undrawn facilities and, having regard to the Group's cash flow, it is considered that these facilities provide adequate headroom for the Group's needs. The facilities are generally reaffirmed by the banks annually. These undrawn facilities, if used, will be subject to floating rates of interest and may be subject to the normal covenant conditions attached to such borrowings.

Certain lending banks may impose loan covenants on borrowings, which are normal for these types of borrowings, and, during the years to 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018, the Group and the Company have comfortably complied with such requirements.

Financial instruments held at amortised cost and held to maturity These largely comprise of restricted bank deposit accounts where the cash acts as security against possible shortfalls in the funding required to meet future payments in the course of business.

(iii) Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency. In addition, the Group faces currency risks arising from monetary financial instruments held in non-functional currencies. The income statement reflects the impact of realised and unrealised exchange differences on trading items and monetary financial instruments (note 4).

The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. The main currency translation risk relates to foreign operations whose functional currency is the Euro, Swiss Franc or Japanese Yen. The investments are not hedged. The translation reserve reflects the exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of the foreign operation (note 20).

Operational foreign exchange exposure Where possible, the Group tries to invoice in the local currency of the respective entity. If this is not possible, to mitigate exposure, the Group endeavours to buy from suppliers and sell to customers in the same currency. The exposure relating to receivables and payables denominated in the non-functional currency is normally less than 3 months as this is the normal settlement period for these items.

Subject to the requirements of Group Treasury, as noted above, where possible, the Group tries to hold the majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the local currency of the respective entity.

114

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Monetary assets/liabilities The Group continues to monitor exchange rates and buy or sell currencies in order to minimise the open exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The Group may use derivative financial instruments mainly to reduce the risk of foreign exchange exposure on trading items (sales or purchases in currencies other than the domestic currency of the company concerned) and interest rate movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes.

IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis The following table shows the impact on profit and equity of a change of 10% in exchange rates, excluding translation risk, assuming all other variables held constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.

The above table shows which components of net debt are subject to interest. With the current low interest rates for bank base rates worldwide, the interest which can be earned on bank deposits is low. The Group's exposure to floating rate interest bearing debt is small and a change in interest rates will not have a material change on interest expense.

116

PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL PLC

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis With current low interest rates and the Group's level of debt financing, the impact on the total interest payable charges due to a change of 100 basis points (1%) on borrowings subject to floating rates of interest is not material. Consequently, no sensitivity tables have been presented. The Group has total loans outstanding at 30 April 2019 of £67,393,000 (30 April 2018 of £33,325,000), of which £67,393,000 (30 April 2018 of £33,325,000) is subject to fixed interest rates between 0.49% and 1.2%. An increase of 1% in the fixed rate of interest would result in an extra £600,000 (30 April 2018: £400,000) of interest expense.

Terms and debt repayment schedule The table below shows the maturity profile and interest rates of the Groups borrowings at 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018. Floating rate interest borrowings (overdrafts) are based on LIBOR, EURIBOR or equivalent rates in other countries plus a margin (generally between 0.45% and 1.0%).

The Company has no external loans outstanding at 30 April 2019 (2018: none).

Price risk The Group and the Company are exposed to changes in prices on raw materials, consumables and finished goods purchased from suppliers. Wherever possible, price rises are passed on to customers via sales price increases to help manage this risk.

The Group's and Company's investment in Max Sight Group Holdings Limited, which at 30 April 2019 amounted to £1,176,000 (30 April 2018: £4,074,000) and is listed and is thus subject to variations in the quoted price. The Group's other investments in equity securities are not listed, and are not material thus the Group does not have any significant exposure to price risk on these equity investments.

15( C ) C A P I TA L R I S K M A N AG E M E N T The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to enhance long-term shareholder value, by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment (by increasing profits available for dividends) and by managing the capital gearing ratio (mixture of equity and debt).

The Group manages, and makes adjustments to, its capital structure in light of the prevailing risks and economic conditions affecting its business activities. This may involve adjusting the rate of dividends, purchasing the Company's own shares, the issue of new shares and reviewing the level and type of debt. The Group manages its borrowings by appraising the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and the mix of long-term and short-term borrowings. Details of how the Group and subsidiaries are funded are shown below. There were no changes to the Group's approach to capital management during the year.

Group The Group is funded by share capital and retained earnings; supplemented by external borrowing as required. The Group has had a strong net cash position throughout the current and comparative year.

During the year ended 30 April 2019 the Group increased its net borrowings by £35,556,000 (30 April 2018: £22,997,000) in order to take advantage of historically low interest rates in order to reduce the Group's weighted average cost of capital and to increase the Group's capacity to invest in product offerings as it continues to evaluate potential acquisitions.

At 30 April 2019, £982,000 of the total net cash (2018: £1,710,000 ) comprised bank deposit accounts that are subject to restrictions and are not freely available for use by the Group and Company. These amounts are shown under financial instruments held at amortised cost / held to maturity.

Net cash is a non-GAAP measure since it is not defined in accordance with IFRS but is a key indicator used by management in assessing operational performance and financial position strength. The inclusion of items in net cash as defined by the Group may not be comparable with other companies' measurement of net cash/debt. The Group includes in net cash, cash and cash equivalents and certain financial assets, mainly deposits, less current and non-current borrowings outstanding.

The tables below, which are not currently required by IFRS, reconcile the Group's net cash to the Group's statement of cash flows. Management believes the presentation of the tables will be of assistance to shareholders. Presentation of this information is recommended by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) as good practice as being of use to shareholders and analysts, in their Financial Lab Project, Net Debt Reconciliations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All options can be exercised, in normal circumstances, within a period of four years from the exercise of option date, providing that the performance criterion or performance condition has been achieved. The subscription price for all options is based upon the average market price on the three days prior to the date of grant. Options are restricted, or may lapse, if the grantee leaves the employment of the Group before the first exercise date.

All options are equity settled options.

Options granted after 2005 are covered by the new Photo-Me Executive Share Option Scheme. The vesting of options is subject to an EPSbased performance condition relating to the extent to which the Company's basic EPS for the third financial year, following the date of grant, reaches a sliding scale of challenging EPS targets.

Options are normally granted over shares worth up to 150% of a participant's salary each year. In exceptional cases as part of the terms of attracting senior management, options in excess of that number may be granted.

The weighted average exercise price of all options outstanding at 30 April 2019 is 129.0p (2018: 121.2p) and the weighted average exercise price of options exercisable at 30 April 2019 is 118.5p (2018: 91.9p).

The weighted average share price for options exercised during the year ended 30 April 2019 was 46.6p (30 April 2018: 133.7p).

The weighted average remaining years for options outstanding at the year end date is 3.2 years (2018: 4 years).

Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, share options granted to senior management including directors after November 2002 have been fair-valued and the Company has used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model takes into account the terms and conditions under which the options were granted.

The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018:

The charge for share-based payments is £141,000 (2018: £197,000) and for the Company the charge is £7,000 (2018: £20,000).

Share price volatility is based on historical data.

Reserves Group Treasury shares (Group and Company) In accordance with shareholders' resolutions passed at Annual General Meetings, the Company may purchase its own shares up to a maximum of 10% of the Ordinary shares in issue. At 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018 the Company held no shares in treasury.

Other reserves Other reserves mainly arise in subsidiaries, are generally not distributable, and arise as a result of local legislation regarding capital maintenance.

Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates. In accordance with the options allowed under IFRS 1, only exchange rate differences arising on translation after the date of transition, 1 May 2004, are shown in this reserve. When an overseas subsidiary or associate is disposed, the cumulative exchange difference relating to the entity disposed is recycled through the income statement as part of the profit or loss on sale in finance revenue/cost and is shown as a movement in other comprehensive income.

Company Other reserves The Company's other reserves include £201,000 (2018: £201,000) arising on the redemption of the deferred shares and £1,997,000 (2018: £1,864,000) relating to the fair value of options granted to employees of Group undertakings (note 14).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Bank loans bear interest rates based on LIBOR or foreign equivalent rates appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred. Further details are provided in note 15 and in the tables below. Margins are generally between 0.4% and 1.0%.

Obligations under finance leases The Group has entered into finance lease arrangements for certain items of property, plant and equipment, largely for periods of up to four (2018: four) years (note 12). The total finance lease creditor at 30 April 2019 was £1,842,000 of which £779,000 was due within one year and the remaining £1,063,000 due between two and five years, (2018: total finance lease creditor £354,000, £133,000 due within one year and £221,000 due within two to five years).

22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement and post-employment schemes including both funded defined benefit schemes, and defined contribution schemes.

Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a benefit at retirement. The amount is determined by the plan rules and is dependent on such factors as age, years of service and pensionable pay and is not dependent on contributions made by the Company or members. The income statement service cost, in respect of defined benefit plans represents the increase in the defined benefit liability arising from pension benefits accrued by members in the current period. The Company having such plans is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be covered by the assets of the plan.

The Group's and the Company's policy is to recognise actuarial gains and losses immediately each year in the statement of changes in equity, under other comprehensive income. These comprise the impact on the defined benefit liability of changes in demographic and financial assumptions compared with the start of the year, actual experience being different to those assumptions and the return on plan assets above the amount included in net pension interest.

Defined contribution plans are arrangements in which the benefits paid to participants are linked to the amount of contributions paid and the performance of the scheme. Such plans are independent of the Company and the Group and the Company and the Group have no exposure to investment and experience risks. The income statement charge for these plans represents the contributions paid by the Group based on a percentage of employees' pay.

The Group's and the Company's defined benefit pension schemes are included in the statement of financial position under employment benefit obligations, as are other overseas retirement provisions.

The amounts charged to profit and loss for all post-employment benefits are shown in note 5.

The amount shown in the statement of financial position is detailed as follows:

Photo-Me International plc defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a final salary defined benefit scheme in the UK for some long-serving employees, which is funded by contributions from the Company and by members of the scheme. This pension scheme (the Photo-Me International plc Pension and Life Assurance Fund) is closed to new entrants. The defined benefits are based upon then employee's length of service and final pensionable salary.
The actuarial valuation of the UK Pension scheme has revealed a surplus at 30 April 2019, 30 April 2018, 30 April 2017 and 30 April 2016. This surplus has not been recognised as an asset, in accordance with IFRIC 14, as in the future the surplus will not be recovered by a reduction in future contributions to the scheme. The scheme has been closed to new members for over 30 years.

22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED

The Fund is administered by a corporate Trustee, with Trustee Directors, which is legally separate from the Company. The Trustee Directors include representatives of both the Company and Fund members. The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the benefits.

The level of benefits provided by the Fund depends on a member's length of service and salary at date of leaving or retiring from the Fund. Annual pension increases between leaving the Fund and retirement are linked to increases in the Retail Prices Index (RPI). After retirement, annual pension increases are at 3.0% pa for pension accrued before April 1997 and in line with increases in the RPI, up to a maximum of 5.0% pa, for pension accrued from April 1997.

The benefit payments are from a trustee administered fund containing assets held in trust and governed by UK regulations and practice. The amount of Company contributions is decided jointly by the Trustee Directors and the Company.

The Fund's investment strategy is decided by the Trustee Directors, in consultation with the Company. The Trustee Directors exercise their powers of investment (or delegation where these powers have been delegated to a fund manager) in a manner calculated to ensure the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole. In order to avoid an undue concentration of risk a spread of assets is held. The diversification is both within and across asset classes. The assets are invested in a manner appropriate to the nature and duration of the expected future retirement benefits payable under the Fund. Day to day selection of stocks is delegated to fund managers appointed by the Trustee Directors. As regards the review and selection of their fund managers, the Trustee Directors take expert advice.

UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary with an effective date of 1 June 2015. At this date the Fund had a funding level of 104% and a surplus of approximately £0.3 million on a technical provisions basis, consistent with the projected unit basis required under IAS 19. This basis uses actuarial assumptions adopted by the Trustee Directors of the Fund that are consistent with the Fund continuing on an ongoing basis with support from the Company.

Risks associated with the Fund The fund exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant of which are described below.

Asset volatility Changes in bond yields Inflation risk
Life expectancy

The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Fund's liabilities for IAS 19, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Fund's bond holdings and insurance policies backing pensions in payment.
Some of the Fund's benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
The majority of the Fund's obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

The sensitivity information shown above has been prepared using the same method as adopted when adjusting the results of the latest valuation to the reporting date. This is the same approach as has been adopted in previous years.

Overseas post-employment benefit obligations Provisions for obligations to make termination payments on retirement, to employees who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes, are as follows:

The Group's Japanese subsidiary undertaking, Nippon Auto­Photo K.K, has an unfunded post-employment retirement provision based on an employee's length of service with the company and their current salary. The allowance is paid to an employee when they leave the company. This has been provided for in full within the accounts. Nippon Auto ­Photo K.K, agreed with the employees that 50 % of the liability for the retirement provision will be paid in cash to an independently controlled defined contribution scheme, with the balance to be met by the company when the employee leaves.

To meet the legal obligations within France, the Group's subsidiary undertakings have unfunded retirement provisions, which were valued by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method at 30 April 2019 and 30 April 2018. This actuarial valuation incorporated the following principal assumptions in arriving at the present value of the obligations:

Temporary differences associated with Group investments Unremitted earnings of overseas affiliates No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on current legislation or where the Group is able to control remittance of earnings and it is possible that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets amounting to £1,220,000 (2018: £1,249,000) arising on temporary differences of £5,052,000 (2018: £5,114,000), in respect of unrelieved tax losses and other temporary differences have not been recognised, as their future economic benefit is uncertain.

The expiry dates of unrelieved tax losses are as follows:

Expiring in less than one year Expiring between two and 20 years No expiry date

Group 2019 £'000
­ 228 992 1220

2018 £'000

In addition, the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset on gross capital losses of £3,756,000 (2018: £3,756,000), of which £3,627,000 (2018: £3,627,000) relate to the Company, which have not been recognised as their future economic benefit is not certain.

Factors that may affect future tax charges There will be a reduction in the corporation tax rates in two of the major jurisdictions in which the Group operates, in the UK to 17% from 2020 and in France to 25% from 2022 respectively. The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised based on the respective corporation tax rates at which they are anticipated to unwind in each jurisdiction.

26 OPERATING LEASES AND SITE AGREEMENTS CONTINUED Lease arrangements The Group and the Company have entered into operating lease agreements in respect of property, plant and machinery, the majority of which are for motor vehicles.

Site owner agreements The Group and the Company have entered into various commission agreements with site-owners enabling the Group and the Company to site vending equipment for a number of years. The amounts shown in the table above represent the minimum fixed commission payable. Certain agreements may, in addition, have clauses where additional commission is payable based on a percentage of revenue generated, above a specified amount.

In January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS16 Leases which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Under this standard all leases, both finance and operating will be included in the statement of financial position. The Group is currently studying the impact of IFRS 16 on its operating leases and examining the extent to which commission arrangements meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.

27 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Capital commitments The table below shows the amount of capital commitments with third parties for property, plant and equipment and the amounts placed with the Group's procurement companies for vending equipment.

Contingent liabilities The Company and subsidiary undertakings have given guarantees in the normal course of business to third parties, including to the Group's bankers. No losses are expected from guarantees given by the Company and subsidiary undertakings.

In the opinion of the Directors, adequate provision has been made for claims and legal disputes and the Directors therefore consider that no contingent liability for litigation exists.

The Group has no contingent liabilities with regard to its interest in the associated undertakings (2018: none).

30 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS La Wash Group On 23 May 2018, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of La Wash Group, consisting of Global Network Investment SL and Smart Real Estate & Refurbishment SL, for a consideration of 5 million, obtaining control of the group on that date. Based in Barcelona, the La Wash Group is a leader in the Spanish business-to-business laundry services market.
The acquisition was funded from the Group's cash resources.
Deferred consideration A further £220,000 of consideration is payable to the vendor of the acquired businesses based on earnings in the year ended 30 April 2019.
Goodwill The goodwill acquired of £2,570,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the value of the assembled workforce and the ability of the senior staff to generate future business.
