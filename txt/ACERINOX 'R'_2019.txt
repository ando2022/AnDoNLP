Letter from the Chairman
Dear shareholders,
I once again have the privilege of addressing you to inform you of the activities carried on by Acerinox in 2019, the results obtained and the context in which this occurred.
It goes without saying that, firstly, I would like to mention the extraordinary situation in which we are living as I write this letter. We must deal with this situation, manage it with prudence, intelligence and courage, and face it with the total commitment of everyone.
I am of course referring to the pandemic caused by Covid19, which is affecting us individually and
economically in a significant way. However, despite the severe impact this situation is having on the world, and particularly on Spain, I am certain that we will be capable of overcoming it with endeavour and sacrifice.
I would like to begin this letter by offering the solidarity of Acerinox and myself with all families who have been directly affected, and we send them our most sincere and loving embrace.
For this reason, and for these families, I would like to take this opportunity to call for unity and solidarity among us all to enable us to overcome together the human and economic impact that this situation will have on our society, so we can return to normality, stability and growth as soon as possible.
Everyone is aware that the situation is very severe and worrying; it is putting from our health to the economic stability of companies and states at risk, and it is also altering our way of life, our habits, the way in which we engage with others, work and even how we enjoy ourselves, our families and our friends.
Now, more than ever, our capacity as a company and the values that shape it are being put to the test, so we must be a benchmark, ensuring, as we always have, to protect the health and safety of our workers whilst setting an example of endeavour, efficiency, commitment, sense of duty, work and tenacity. All this will enable Acerinox, our company, to continue progressing and leading our sector.
Results of Acerinox 2019 was a year marked by a very complicated macroeconomic environment; the economy was already showing signs of a slowdown before the progressive global hiatus caused by coronavirus. However, according to data from the IMF and the World Economic Forum, the global economy grew by 2.9% in 2019 and, before the Covid-19 crisis, was expected to grow by 3.3% in 2020.
Among the markets, worthy of mention is the rise of the Chinese and Indian markets, with growth in 2019 of 6.1% and 4.8%, respectively, and 2020 forecasts of 6% and 5.8%, respectively. These two countries
2

recorded growth percentages considerably higher than the western markets, with 2.3% growth in the US and 1.2% growth in the Eurozone, and 2020 forecasts of 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, grew by just 0.5% in 2019 and is forecast to grow by 1.1% in 2020.
In Spain, the growth forecast for 2020 was reduced to 1.6%, having ended 2019 with an increase of 2.0%, growth above the European average. However, according to the OECD's estimates, the country still has certain structural imbalances, such as an unemployment rate of 15%, an uncontrollable public deficit, public debt of 97%, a middle class that has seen its purchasing power decrease in recent years and low private savings.
Despite such a complex setting, although with positive expectations for 2020 before the crisis in which we are immersed commenced, Acerinox achieved a commendable adjusted EBITDA of 402 million, and generated notable cash flows of 231 million, which, for another year, enabled the Group to maintain its investments, with investments in fixed assets totalling 128 million, reduce net debt to an 18-year low of 495 million and increase shareholder remuneration by 44%, allocating 184 million thereto.
These are positive results if we take into account the conditions under which they were achieved. The overproduction in China had a crucial impact on prices in the Asian and European markets, despite its volume decreasing in the last year. Despite the safeguard measures imposed by the European Union, imports continued to access the European market, saturating its capacity and resulting in prices falling at year-end. The exception to the aforementioned, as in prior years, was the US, a market that, despite also being influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties with a drop of 10% in apparent consumption, performed better than the others did with basic prices remaining stable.
Nevertheless, Acerinox achieved the second highest billings in the last decade, 4,754 million, only behind the 5,011 million recognised in 2018. The reported EBITDA, amounting to 364 million, includes the adjustment of 38 million relating to the provision for the labour force adjustment plan in the Acerinox Europa factory.
In 2019, the Acerinox Group felt obliged to make a series of strategic decisions that were particularly significant for its results. At year-end, very conservative projections were made for the coming years, in view of the economic and other uncertainties that could have an effect on overall economic growth. As a result, the company decided to recognise impairments of 98 million in our Bahru Stainless plant, and an impairment of 68 million of the goodwill generated from the acquisition of Columbus Stainless in 2002.
Additionally, impairments of 61 million were made to the tax credits as a result of Spanish legislation. None of the three cases gave rise to cash outflows; however, they did affect the Group's results, giving rise to a loss after tax and minority interests of 60 million.
Acquisition of VDM There is no doubt that the news for which 2019 will go down in the company's history is the agreement to purchase VDM Metals, world leader in the production of special alloys with production plants in Germany and the US.
This acquisition enables us to diversify towards sectors with greater added value, and offers us the opportunity to grow in new applications within the aerospace, chemical, medical, hydrocarbon, renewable energies, water treatment and emissions control industries, among others.

Letter from the Chairman
Upon obtaining all the authorisations from the competition authorities, we proceeded with the closing of the transaction, having incorporated this company into the scope of Acerinox. I would like to take this opportunity to give the warmest welcome to our colleagues at VDM Metals, in whom we have placed our trust to help us continue growing as the efficient and competitive company that we are.
Lastly, I would like to emphasise that the acquisition took place under very favourable conditions for Acerinox, with VDM Metals being valued at 532 million, of which 310 million will be paid and 57 million will be assumed in debt, representing a Company Value/EBITDA of 5.5 times before synergies.
Excellence 360 As you can see, 2019 was a particularly intense and exciting year thanks to the decisions made, the new paths taken and the market conditions.
We cannot face challenges of this scale without applying new technologies and Digital Transformation systems. Together with Sustainability, Efficiency and Excellence, this is one of the strategic fields on which our growth plan is founded in order to manufacture, distribute and sell stainless steel in an even more competitive and efficient way, meeting the needs of our customers and expanding the application of our products.
To unify and reinforce the aforementioned, we launched Excellence 360º. It is a plan that combines the Group's various Digital Strategy projects with the traditional Excellence Plans. It is an ambitious programme with which we expect to gain recurring returns of 125 million from 2030 onwards. In 2019 alone, we obtained savings estimated to have totalled 24 million.
Sustainability Acerinox's vision is to be a sustainable company in the long term; therefore, we have integrated this concept into the daily tasks of our business. We promote and are committed to sustainability in its broadest sense: economic sustainability together with social and environmental sustainability, assuming this philosophy recently developed in the business world as our own, with which the ultimate goal of the company must be the appropriate balance between these three concepts.
In 2019 this need was met through the creation of a Sustainability Department, which was set up to establish the company's strategy in this connection and respond to the requests for information from our Stakeholders, society in general and the media.
As is the case in so many other areas, Sustainability is an area in which Acerinox was already leading the sector, as demonstrated by the fact that the Group records 30% less emissions than the sector average. However, we want to go further and encompass more processes. We have reaffirmed our commitment to climate neutrality; we form part of the world's most stringent sustainability indexes (such as FTSE and GRI, to which we report our activity) and we have prepared the Sustainability Report with the greatest scope and detail in the company's history, analysing extensively the production plants and the Group's parent in four large areas: Social, Products, the Environment and Health and Safety.
I invite you to read carefully the Sustainability Report, given the vast amount of information it contains.

Acerinox shares The markets performed positively in 2019 following the crash suffered in the final months of 2018, which were significantly influenced by the geopolitical crises occurring during the year, such as the trade war between the US and China, the UK's exit from the European Union and the monetary policies established by the world's major central banks.
Performance of the Acerinox shares was inconsistent during 2019, reaching their lowest value for the year on 15 August, from which date it rose until year-end by 43%, due mainly to the positive reaction from the markets to the third quarter results issued in November and the agreement to acquire VDM. Lastly, our shares increased by 16% at year-end, outperforming the Ibex 35, which grew by 12%.
Shareholder remuneration increased by 11%, from 0.45 per share to the 0.50 paid in 2019 through the payment of the 0.30 dividend plus the payment of 0.20 with a charge to the share premium.
Furthermore, the share capital of Acerinox was reduced by 1,380,337.50 through the cancellation of 5,521,350 treasury shares, as a result of the implementation of the First Share Buyback Programme approved by the Board of Directors.
Shareholder remuneration increased by 44% as a result of adding the dividend to the share premium and to the amount allocated for the cancellation of the treasury shares.
Corporate governance The Board of Directors continues to believe that the company's corporate governance is a fundamental element for its management, and strives to develop all aspects thereof according to its best practices in order for the company to be recognised in the markets for its excellence.
Accordingly, it is worth mentioning that the Board of Acerinox is one of the most diverse in the Ibex 35, since it is comprised of four different nationalities and women make up 23.7%, with a commitment to reach 30% as soon as possible. Board members have extensive experience in a wide range of fields, such as industry, finance, the public sector, technology and universities.
In 2019 the governing bodies met a total of 33 times, with both the board and its committees increasing the number of sessions, while the quantity and quality of the information reaching these bodies has improved.
I would like to draw attention to the following most significant developments occurring in 2019:
-The core activity of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors focused on analysing the company's strategic opportunities and operations, specifically the VDM transaction and Acerinox's Strategic Plan.
-T he Audit Committee has once again remained very active in 2019, focusing on the detailed analysis of the financial statements, the relationship with the internal and external auditors, the systematic analysis of the company's risks and the monitoring of the compliance function.
-The Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee dedicated it's time to the tasks relating to the appointment of board members and of the senior management team and to the remuneration policy thereof, as well as the promotion and development of talent management
5

within the company. It also worked actively in the scope of Corporate Governance, preparing a proposed modification of the Appointments Committee section of the Board of Directors Regulation, promoting the approval of a new General Policy focused on anticipating and regulating conflicts of interest, developing the new competency matrix approved by the board, leading the assessment of the board and its committees, and monitoring Acerinox's Sustainability Plan.
Coronavirus crisis In the first four months of 2020, we have been experiencing an unprecedented and extraordinary situation, the global crisis caused by the pandemic originating in China last December and which has spread around the world.
This pandemic is affecting the five continents, virtually all countries; but it is specifically affecting, and with unprecedented harshness, Europe, the US, and even more specifically at this time our country, Spain.
The human tragedy we are experiencing is unparalleled by any other situation through which our generation has had to live, and for this reason I wanted to begin this letter by demonstrating our solidarity with all those who have been affected by these tragic circumstances. I also think now is the moment to thank all those in our society who are on the front line of this battle for their sacrifice, commitment, efforts, and ultimately their work; we are all facing one of the worst moments in recent history.
This health crisis and the strict confinement and economic activity hiatus measures that had to be implemented, will lead to a major economic crisis with incalculable consequences for the global economy, for the economies of regions in which we operate and, naturally, the Spanish economy.
Stock exchanges around the world have anticipated historical declines, with a high degree of volatility and a global recession in spite of the announcement of multi-million stimulus programmes and aid deployed by Institutions, Governments and Central Banks.
Despite the multitude of analyses currently being performed, it is difficult to anticipate how severe the recession will be, how long it will last, how close the recovery is or whether it will be a "V" or "U" bounce back. What we can anticipate are very difficult times and we must prepare ourselves.
I would like to assure you that at Acerinox we are prepared for this expected difficult situation, with the conviction that if we are prepared for the worst, we will be prepared for more benign situations.
In these circumstances, we recognise that there are three very important things for which we must care. Firstly, and above all, the health and safety of our workers, for which we have implemented strict operating protocols. Secondly, which is key, is to look after the cash flows, the liquidity of the company, since looking after this means we control the fundamental elements of the business, such as sales, costs, working capital, etc. Fortunately, we can say that Acerinox has a healthy liquidity position thanks to its prudent financial policy, which will enable the company to withstand extreme scenarios that it may have to face. Thirdly, we must preserve unity, commitment and cooperation within the company. The organisations are demonstrating their worth and are rising to the challenge, and at Acerinox there is no doubt that we will rise to the occasion, as we already demonstrated in the last crisis.
We are a global company with a presence in many markets and with an excellent product, which will continue to be required in the growth process necessary after this crisis.
6

Acerinox has a much higher fundamental value than that reflected by the current market price, which is affected by the current situation and not by its fundamentals. We are certain that we will emerge from this difficult situation stronger, and that with our current situation and the incorporation of VDM, the time will come when the markets recognise and reflect the intrinsic value of our company. Before concluding, I would like to thank all those that form part of the Acerinox Group for their efforts and commitment to the company, with which I know they have a great feeling of closeness and belonging. I would like to send a special thank you to our executive team, led by the Chief Executive Officer, which is the backbone of our company. I would, of course, also like to thank the Board of Directors, which constantly takes care of the general interests our company and of our shareholders. I would like to end this letter by reaffirming the message of support and unity I transmitted at the beginning. We will overcome this extraordinary and emotionally difficult situation with commitment and sacrifice among everyone, with each and every one of us working hard from the position we are in. Kind regards, Rafael Miranda Robredo Chairman of Acerinox April 2020

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
Dear shareholders,
I am honoured to address you once more to inform you of the results achieved by Acerinox in 2019 and the context in which these results were obtained, as well as the efforts we are making to maintain our Company at the forefront of the stainless steel sector.
Evidently, one of the events subsequent to 2019 yearend, the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, its terrible impact on health, the mortality and its devastating consequences on the global economy, have completely overshadowed the events occurring in 2019, to which it is hard to pay attention and remember. However, I shall focus on the business carried on by Acerinox in 2019, the results obtained and the other relevant matters of our activities, if only to leave a record so that we can remember the year once we have overcome this severe crisis.
As always I will explain our approach, as a Spanish and global industrial company, which is already a challenge in itself in a tremendously competitive world, and a company that is committed to the importance of the industry as a guarantor of quality employment, development and the welfare state. A country without industry, or a Europe without industry, will always be subject to third party interest, and they would find it difficult to defend our lifestyle model. Industry was lacking in Spain during previous crises, but I am confident that this time we will learn that we are also necessary for sustainable development.
In order to explain Acerinox's 2019 results, three key factors that have marked our activity must be mentioned: firstly, the trade war between China and the US, which has increased market uncertainty and volatility; secondly, the slowdown of the main consumer markets, perhaps as a result of the aforementioned but also due to the economy's regular cycle; and lastly, the excess stainless steel production capacity.
It is clear that the rapid development of the Chinese economy has altered global trade flows. China has become the world's factory and it is incredible how fast the country's cities and population are developing. Depending on the approach taken, this reality could be an opportunity, but it could also be a threat. It is seen as a threat by the US, which has gone from being the first country to encourage production with very cheap labour in China and relocate a significant portion of its industry, to seeing how, with this process, they were also exporting employment and a part of their wealth. The decision to reverse this process led to the trade war between the two greatest powers, which has only just begun. At first it was named the "steel war" due to the tariffs imposed to protect the US steel industry; however, negotiations are taking place over a wide spectrum and are attempting to even up the trade balances whilst also trying to defend local employment and supply. Europe must determine its role in this game as we run the risk of being excluded from making critical decisions, since international organisations are losing influence over direct negotiations between two powerhouses and bilateralism is gaining ground in international relations. In this regard, the economy, stock exchanges and also stainless steel markets have moved in line with the declarations made by the leaders of
8

both countries and the possibilities of agreements, which would bring stability to very volatile markets that are constantly on high alert due to the uncertainty and the lack of visibility.
Additionally, and perhaps as a result of this uncertainty, we saw how the real economy slowed down in line with the trend that began in the third quarter of the previous year. Following a slight upturn in the first quarter of 2019, the gross domestic product of the main economies declined every quarter to a two-year low in the fourth quarter of 2019. We have always affirmed that the stainless steel sector is very cyclical and anticipates the economic cycles, and we have had two consecutive years in which apparent consumption in Europe and the US has experienced negative growth. This gave us hope for a possible recovery in 2020, which regrettably will not occur as a result of the global crisis caused by the spread of coronavirus.
Lastly, I would like to mention the third and final key factor, the worldwide excess stainless steel production capacity, which amplifies all events and has led to the lowest sales prices in history being established for our materials. Since 2010, when I took on the role of Chief Executive Officer of Acerinox, I have been drawing attention to this problem and to the proliferation of factories in China under the country's strategic plans and without taking into consideration the laws of international markets. If the Chinese manufacturers located in Indonesia, arising as a result of the so-called Silk Road or "One Belt One Road Initiative", are added to this country's production, in 2019 it accounted for 61% of global production, creating severe distortions in all international markets. Since 2000, when China accounted for just 3% of global production, all growth in the production of stainless steel has been driven by China, preventing the development of the other manufacturers in market-oriented economies and compelling us to compete thanks only to the efficiency of our plants and to the continued improvement of our facilities and our costs, since we are unable to increase production due to the low profitability of projects and we cannot grow with corporate operations as a result of the sector's high concentration.
Logically, these circumstances have led to the intensification of global trade regulatory measures, with each country attempting to defend itself against unfair trade practices. In the stainless steel industry there are just seventeen countries with melting shops, of which sixteen have trade measures in force, either import or anti-dumping duties. Only Japan maintains an open market since it is protected by technological barriers that make it difficult for other manufacturers to penetrate this country's market; however, this also prevents Japanese manufacturers from being internationally present given their competitive disadvantages.
According to our estimates, which we have based on data from the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF), in 2019 global stainless steel production grew by just 2.9%, whereas the cumulative growth rate in this century is 5.7% per year. Only China and India are thought to have grown, by 10.1% and 5.2%, respectively, whilst production in developed countries has declined significantly: -7.9% in Europe, -7.6% in the US and -9.7% in Japan. In other words, even during a year of economic slowdown, Chinese manufacturers increased production, causing a tremendous strain on the decrease in prices in all international markets and forcing traditional manufacturers, including Acerinox, to reduce production.
Our melting shop production, totalling 2.23 million tonnes, was 8.6% lower than in 2018; hot rolling production, totalling 1.95 million tonnes, was 8.0% lower; and cold rolling production, totalling 1.61 million tonnes, was 8.3% lower than 2018. All our factories recorded lower activity levels compared to 2018, controlling production to guarantee positive cash flow generation and a reduction in debt.
Performance of the Acerinox Group companies was not homogeneous due to the significant differences in prices in the main markets in which they operate. As mentioned, the significant pressure on prices due to exports from China and Indonesia have led to prices falling to record lows in the surrounding countries, and has forced these neighbouring countries to place pressure on the remaining international markets, especially
9

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
on those that have insufficient protection measures. This is the case for Europe, where the safeguarding measures established by the European Commission have clearly proven to be insufficient, primarily because they were designed for a growing market and not for the situation in which we find ourselves, where the apparent consumption of stainless steel flat products fell by 4.1% according to our estimates. As always we have been drawing attention; Europe is not capable of reacting as swiftly as current events require, and it is not flexible since its governance system is complex and decision making requires slow bureaucratic processes.
We must bear in mind that the safeguarding measures were approved following the US government's decision to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and to avoid the deflection to Europe of the materials that were being exported to the US. After establishing the first provisional measures in July 2018, the definitive measures were adopted in February 2019, establishing country quotas based on the average imports between 2015 and 2017. Once the quotas have been exceeded, a tariff of 25% would be applied; however, this has not occurred since the measures were sufficient, maintaining the market penetration of imports at approximately 29%.
Given this situation, prices in Europe have come closer than ever to Asian prices and have reached historical lows. Furthermore, in a declining market significant material stocks have accumulated as importers tried to anticipate the enforcement of quotas. These circumstances have profoundly affected the results of three of our factories for which the European market is very important: Acerinox Europa, Columbus and Bahru Stainless. Columbus also suffered from the weakness of the South African market, which fell by 10%, and Bahru Stainless, located in Malaysia, had to compete in South-East Asia, the region with the world's lowest prices.
On the other hand, our US factory, North American Stainless (NAS), benefited from the 25% tax duty in the US, where we are the market's major player with a market share of almost 35%. Despite the sharp decline of 9.3% in apparent flat product consumption, the reduction in imports to 14.5% of the market share has enabled US manufacturers to act by controlling their production to guarantee price stability. With a more stable market and the significant cost reductions we are achieving, NAS performed more than satisfactorily and was the real driving force behind the Group's results.
It is thanks to these intense cost reductions that Acerinox's quarterly results have experienced a positive trend, unlike the economic situation. Quarterly EBITDA rose from 90 million in the first quarter to 97 million in the second quarter, 103 million in the third quarter and 112 million in the fourth quarter, which was subsequently reduced to 74 million as a result of the adjustments made, which will be explained hereinafter. Our billings of 4,754 million, although 5.1% less than 2018, is the second highest of the decade.
I would like to highlight that in this environment we have generated very significant operating cash flows of 359 million, which enabled us to reduce our debt by 57 million to 495 million, after having invested 152 million, increased dividend payments by 11.1% to 0.50 per share and after having repurchased shares for the subsequent write-off thereof totalling 49 million.
This prudent strategy of prioritising cash flow generation and debt reduction, which was just 1.2 times EBITDA at year-end, and the strength of our balance sheet will be vital in addressing the challenges we face, from the acquisition and integration of VDM to overcoming the unexpected economic crisis in which we find ourselves as I write to you.
Prudence and pre-emption have also led us to carry out significant adjustments at year-end, which will improve our situation in the future. Only one of the adjustments made affects our EBITDA, the provision for the cost of the labour force adjustment plan, necessary to reduce the workforce by 215 at Acerinox Europa and improve the factory's competitiveness. This adjustment had an impact of 38 million and did not produce a cash outflow in 2019.
10

The remaining adjustments, which did not give rise to a cash outflow, were the impairments made in Bahru Stainless amounting to 98 million, and the impairment of the goodwill of Columbus amounting to 68 million. Similarly, as a consequence of changes to Spanish tax laws regarding the application of prior years' tax loss carryforwards, impairments were made on the tax credits amounting to 61 million. I would like to insist that none of these extraordinary and non-recurring impairments gave rise to any cash outflows. Following all these adjustments, in 2019 EBITDA amounted to 364 million, 24% lower than 2018, and a loss after tax and minority interests of 60 million was recognised, compared to a profit of 237 million in 2018.
In 2019, the value of Acerinox's shares increased by 16%, and exceeded 12% of the Spanish IBEX-35 index, due mainly to the boost received following issuance of the results of the third quarter and announcement of the acquisition of VDM, which I will explain hereinafter.
At Acerinox we have always opted for maximum efficiency and process optimisation to maintain competitiveness and our organic growth strategy; however, this growth strategy has been hampered due to the aforementioned excess production capacity. As a result, we have had to put on "standby" our plans to expand in Malaysia, where the construction of a hot-rolling mill and a melting shop were planned in order to complete our integrated manufacturing project, in line with the model of our other factories.
Thus, in recent years organic growth has been focused on upgrading equipment, modernising production processes, investing to improve the environmental impact and continually improving costs. Accordingly, we have successfully undertaken the most recent investments, a rolling mill and a bright annealing line in the US, and another rolling mill and a state-of-the-art annealing line in the Spanish factory.
We have also developed the Excellence 360 plan, in which we have unified our traditional plans of excellence with the improvements that we are already obtaining from applying new digital technologies. We have merged both projects to create our digital strategy since, in a commodities sector like ours, success is based on competitiveness and that always depends on process efficiency, productivity, supply chain optimisation and service quality.
Incorporating more sensors at the critical points of our equipment will add a large volume of data, and the mass analysis thereof will help us to understand and control better our processes, anticipate quality problems and faults and, ultimately, improve our productivity and our efficiency. Furthermore, demand forecasting will enable us to shorten and obtain greater flexibility in the supply chain, react faster to changes in the market and reduce our working capital.
During its first year of implementation, the Excellence 360 plan provided us with annual recurring savings that we have quantified at 24 million. We had planned to achieve progress of 19%, and we achieved 20% of the objectives set for five years, which will provide improvements of 125 million per year to our statement of profit or loss. Undoubtedly, this is an ambitious project on which our success in the future largely depends.
Since 1970, when Acerinox was founded, we have always held these concepts for continuous improvement in our DNA. However, in such a competitive environment, it is not possible to depend solely on cost reductions as, although they are absolutely necessary, they have a limit and this is something that we can never permit, limiting our growth. We must reinvent ourselves in order to maintain our enthusiasm and success in the long term and remain at the forefront of the sector.
To this end, in 2019 we worked intensively, and this analysis and endeavour gave rise to the acquisition of the German company VDM Metals, world leader in the manufacture of special alloys. With this acquisition, Acerinox opens the door to a different sector, one of high added value and cutting-edge technology, which
11

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
is complementary to our traditional market. With this transaction we hope to develop significant synergies, since VDM is not only the world's leading manufacturer, it also has the most advanced research and the best reputation among its customers.
The aim is to not only add the results of a fantastic Company to our financial statements, or stop at the synergies we have identified. The aim is to make VDM our special projects division, with which we will help very developed industries and industries of the future to select the best materials from the widest range of products or develop alloys that are tailored to their needs. In doing so we will add value to Acerinox's traditional products and we will situate ourselves as the best option for advanced tailor-made solutions. In other words, we will lead in the supply of high-alloy materials for their use in very aggressive and highly demanding environments in sectors such as the aerospace, energy, automotive, recycling and water treatment sectors, among others.
We are incorporating into our Group the most advanced technology in the sector in the design and industrial development of special alloys, we are incorporating significant patents and access to more sophisticated and exacting consumers and we are stepping into the future with the most innovative processes, such as powder metallurgy, which is the basis for the three dimensional printing of metallic materials.
VDM Metals has its headquarters in Werdohl, Germany, and has 7 productions plants, 5 in Germany and the remaining 2 in the US. VDM Metals has almost 2,000 highly-qualified employees and, with the exchange of experiences and a mind open to learning new ways of doing things, we will be able to take a significant step in terms of the excellence of our operations. In 2018/19 financial year, which ended 30 September 2019, VDM Metals recognised sales amounting to 852 million and EBITDA totalling 97 million. The company was valued at 532 million, and in March 2020 Acerinox disbursed 310 million to purchase all the ownership interest in the company, having received the necessary authorisations from the European and US competition authorities. The ratio of the company's valuation in relation to its EBITDA is 5.5 times before synergies, which is undoubtedly advantageous and creates value for our shareholders. We are enthusiastic about this project, which marks a before and after in Acerinox's history at a time when we have reached a significant milestone, the year 2020 when we will celebrate the company's 50th anniversary.
Henceforth, we will have two strategic pillars to develop, on the one hand, Excellence, and on the other, Value Creation. These are two very solid and closely related pillars, which can only be sustained by building them on our traditional financial strength that has enabled us to tackle this transaction with relative ease.
However, to achieve strategy and success for Acerinox in the long term, we must complete our project with a strong commitment to sustainability and the circular economy. We manufacture a remarkable and modern material with a growing scope, and which has significant possibilities to expand into new areas of use, due mainly to the lowering of its costs given the demanding competition and the advances achieved in its industrial production. We have always tried to explain the advantages of stainless steel thanks to its useful life, its ability to be recycled endlessly and its low maintenance, which makes it unbeatable when taking into account the life cycle cost of the products manufactured therewith. Henceforth, we will also complement our range of products with special alloys that resist in circumstances where stainless steel properties reach their limits.
When society finally becomes aware of the fact that using and discarding and abusing the planet's resources will only lead to disaster, we must be capable of valuing the use of environmentally-friendly materials, in the same way that we will value the companies that minimise their waste, collaborate actively with society and guarantee quality employment and the professional development of its employees. If this is the path that the developed society, and particularly the European society, has chosen, there is no doubt that responsible purchasing and the appreciation of responsible companies will be the logical consequence of this process in order to sustain our life model.
12

Accordingly, Acerinox has always actively worked to recycle its waste and use it in other industries within the circular economy, and we also try to minimise our consumption of energy and all other resources. We manufacture a material that is 100% recyclable indefinitely, and more than 90% of our production is obtained from recycled materials, mainly scrap. Being more sustainable also leads to being more competitive and, therefore, we must be capable of introducing our sustainability objectives into our Excellence 360 plan in order to set a truly comprehensive objective. To expand and value our efforts, in 2019 we created the Sustainability Department, which will set new objectives and will monitor their achievement.
We have also worked to improve the lives of our human capital, by reaching agreements of a social nature in our main workplaces and expanding the training plans, and we have achieved the best accident rate in the company's history. We actively collaborate with universities and vocational training centres and, as a result of these efforts, we attract a substantial number of young people to our team since, during their scholarships and collaborations, they gain knowledge of the wide selection of jobs offered by Acerinox and of the possibility of pursuing a comprehensive career with us.
As we approach our fiftieth birthday, we must look back in order to learn from our experiences and set ourselves new goals. We are the successors of a generation that built and developed a company that is now an international benchmark for the steel industry, a generation to which we feel indebted. We continue to lead our sector, being one of the most global Spanish companies, with its decision-making centre in Spain, and we are paving the way in the most modern strategies of good governance, aware of the fact that good governance boosts our position in investors' preferences, makes us proud of what we do and enables us to attract talent to guarantee continuity and the future.
There is no time like the present, close to reaching half a century of existence, to seek new avenues of growth, which will enable us to continue generating value and enthusiasm within this magnificent group of people that I have the honour of leading, all of us who work in Acerinox. You would undoubtedly find it difficult to encounter a company with a human team as capable, attuned and committed as that of Acerinox. It at least makes me feel very proud of my work and admit the privilege I have to work for all of you and for all of those that, in one way or another, are associated to our Group.
I would like to end by thanking you for the trust you place in Acerinox, and commit myself to making every effort possible to strengthening the value of our Company. I would also like to thank our suppliers, customers, institutions and financial analysts for the excellent treatment and friendship shown to us. Naturally, I cannot thank enough Acerinox's human team and, especially, my closest associates, who have made a colossal effort this past year, demonstrating their profession, disposition and commitment. I am certain that, with such support, we will continue to grow and we will remain the international benchmark for the stainless steels sector.
Kind regards, Bernardo Velázquez Chief Executive Officer

North American Stainless (NAS) is the world's most competitive stainless steel plant, and thanks to it, Acerinox is the market leader in the United States. It is a fully integrated factory, built in 1990 by the Acerinox Group in Ghent (Kentucky) and it supplies flat and long products mainly to the North American continent.
NAS has the most advanced manufacturing equipment and levels of efficiency, excellence and quality superior to those of its competitors, with a significant market share and it offers the widest range of products.
Furthermore, the market penetration of products manufactured in the newly launched bright annealing line during 2019 was a success that exceeded the Group's own expectations, consolidating its leadership position.
The plant is located in a superb position thanks to the advantages in terms of distribution as it has its own river port with navigable access from the centre of the US to the Atlantic via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Furthermore, the main stainless steel consumption areas of the country are only a few hours away by road.

Bahru Stainless is probably the world's most cutting-edge and technologically advanced stainless steel production plant.
The plant is in one of the most strategic geographical points for world trade, in Johor (Malaysia), in the Malacca Strait. It has its own port with direct access to both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, so it has considerable competitive advantages of distribution.
Bahru has cold rolling mills and is aimed at supplying the Asian market (although it distributes its products throughout the world) as well as adding to the Group's global production by purchasing semi-finished product from other Group factories. This material is cold rolled in this plant, improving the production costs of the supplying factories and providing advantages to Acerinox's global distribution and sales network.

Roldán and Inoxfil are two of the three long product manufacturing plants that the Group has (the third, as already stated, is in the North American Stainless American plant).
Roldan is located in Ponferrada (León, Spain) and it produces angles, bars and wire rods. Part of the latter is sent to Inoxfil, located in Igualada (Barcelona, Spain). It is, therefore, the last production link in a network that begins after receiving billet from Acerinox Europe, since it is the only plant of the Group that has steelworks in Spain.
The long product manufactured by the two plants supplies both the domestic market and international customers and their stainless steels are present in some of the most high-profile international projects. During 2019, Acerinox allocated new investments to Roldán aimed at the installation of production and control equipment and the maintenance of existing ones.

2.1 Stainless steel market
The year started with an improvement in demand in all markets, completing a first half of the year with a lot of activity followed by a slowdown in the third quarter and staying at low levels in the last. According to ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum), world stainless steel production increased 2.9% in 2019 compared with previous year. The growth in 2019 was once again concentrated in China, being the only country together with India that recorded an increase (10.1%) reaching almost 30 million tons in 2019. To which we must add the production of the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan in Indonesia, a country in which we estimate that it consolidated the level reached in 2018 of over 2 million tons. This situation generated an excess of supply in the Asian market with very negative effects on prices, which ended up affecting all markets. All this, in an uncertain environment of geopolitical tensions, such as Brexit in Europe and the growing protectionism at a global level with regard to relations between the US and China. Indonesia, in just a few years, has been outstanding for having transformed itself into one of the world's leading producers of stainless steel with the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan, which led to tension the markets, which in turn have reacted with anti-dumping, safeguard and anti-subsidy measures. Paradoxically, China was the first market to impose anti-dumping measures in March against Indonesia. And in April, came the denial of the request for exclusion from Section 232 in the United States for slabs from Indonesia (aimed at the joint venture of Allegheny with Tsingshan); the inclusion of Indonesia in the European Union safeguard measures from October, as well as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations in the European Union and in India, which could also impose measures on the latter country in the coming months, with some provisional measures already in place in Europe since April.

The Acerinox Industry in 2019

It should be noted that, today, virtually all producing countries have some kind of trade barrier in effect, including those where Acerinox has its production plants.
In this complicated environment, Acerinox has reiterated its commitment to the geographic diversification of its operations, adjusting the strategy according to the behaviour of the main markets.

2.1.1 Europe The market trend, in terms of final demand, was in line with the economic slowdown in the EU as a whole, and particularly in the two main stainless steel markets: Germany and Italy At the sector level, according to Eurofer estimates, construction growth of 3.8% stands out, while for both motor vehicles and appliances it revised its estimations downward in January with falls of -5.9% and -1.4% respectively.
The definitive safeguard measures that were adopted in February 2019 amended the preliminary ones imposed in July 2018, establishing annual quotas by country to the main origins (those that accounted for more than 5% of the imports in the three-year period 2015-2017) and a residual quota for the rest, reviewable quarterly.
The 25% tariff was maintained above the quotas. There was also the exclusion of developing countries below the 3% threshold of imports, under the WTO rules, that of countries in the European Economic Area and countries of the preferential trade agreement between the European and Africa was also excluded, including South Africa. Hence our factory, Columbus Stainless, remained unaffected.

34

In September, a review of the definitive measures was approved, with a reduction of 5% to 3% in the annual increase in quotas, and the inclusion of Indonesia in the residual quota as of 1 October, for having exceeded its imports as a developing country over the threshold of 3% in 2018, both in cold and hot.
Despite these measures, European producers were unable to prevent the pressure of the imports that, with the US market closed off, found in Europe the main destination of their surplus production. This was reflected in the fact that the imports in Europe was only reduced by 5%, in line with the fall in the market.
The strong increase in imports from Indonesia until it was included in the measures is a fact that must be emphasise. This, together with other imports from Asia, had a very negative impact on prices.
In August, the European Union initiated an anti-dumping investigation on hot rolled flat products from Indonesia, China and Taiwan, with provisional measures implemented in April.
In addition, in October the followed European Union initiated an anti-subsidy investigation on same materials from Indonesia and China, with provisional measures expected to be implemented by July.

The reduction of imports by the measures of Section 232, around -26%, partially offset the fall in apparent consumption of flat products, which recorded a decrease of -9.3%.
By activity sectors, according to our data, construction fell -0.3%; motor vehicles by remained flat 0.0%; and the household appliances sector by -7.3%. In this last sector, the materials of the new line of bright annealing of North American Stainless stood out for their great acceptance in the market, exceeding the objectives set by the company.
Inventories in stockists were below average with the usual trend of reductions in the final stretch of the year, ending 2019 with the lowest levels of recent years.
Finally, as we have mentioned, in April, the US Department of Trade rejected the exemption from Section 232 requested by the joint venture between Allegheny and Tsingshan for imports of slabs from Indonesia.
Regarding the neighbouring markets, i.e. Mexico and Canada, ended 2019 with significant drops in apparent consumption of around -15% and -12% respectively, affected by the economic situation, by trade tariffs imposed by the US. and given the uncertainty of the agreements of the new USMCA.
In South America; Brazil, which continued to represent around 70% of the region's consumption, we estimate consumption in 2019 fell by around 2% compared to 2018, due to political instability.

2.1.3 Africa, Middle East and Turkey The South African economy grew slightly in 2019, although at a lower rate than expected and in any case this increase was not reflected in the sector since the apparent consumption of stainless steel contracted around 10% in 2019, in line with the trend of the main consumer sectors, especially the motor vehicle sector, due to a lack of confidence in the market and the shortage of large projects during the year. In the markets of North Africa and the Middle East there was a strong demand until Ramadan in May, falling back from that moment, due to the general situation of uncertainty in the area. In Turkey, one of those negatively impacted by market uncertainties, apparent consumption was reduced by 20%. By final sectors, the white goods maintained figures similar to those of the previous year, motor vehicles fell, and construction was also down to a greater extent.

2.1.4 Asia Overcapacity in Asia was the dominant note during the past year due mainly to the new factory of the Chinese producer Tsingshan that broke into the cold rolling mill market at very low prices, which resulted in lower final prices world-wide and which in turn spread to all Asian market, reaching all-time low prices. This situation aggravates the excess overcapacity in Asia already mentioned on numerous occasions. Apparent consumption in China grew but to a lesser extent than production, which led to increased inventories.

3. RAW MATERIALS
The gradual fall in demand, together with trade tensions and their possible impact on consumption, marked a downward trend in prices, with the exception of nickel where speculative movements generated a different behaviour.
Nickel Starting from its yearly low of USD 10,485/Mt on January 2, nickel prices improved over the first half of the year, thanks to the recovery of nickel consumption, mainly in China, closing the semester around USD 12,600/Mt, while the nickel inventories of the London Metal Exchange (LME) gradually declined.
The second half of the year was marked by a sharp rise in nickel prices, mainly due to rumours of a possible bringing forward of the export ban on nickel ore in Indonesia that reached its price in the LME at levels of USD 16,000/Mt in mid-August. At the end of this month, the final confirmation by the Indonesian Government took place, bringing forward the said export ban to 1 January 2020, which caused its price to skyrocket to its yearly high on 2 September at USD 18,550 /Mt.
Nickel inventories fell to 85,830 tonnes just in October, interpreted as a speculative move by an Asian manufacturer to raise the price in the LME, which caused a complaint filed to the EU in front of the WTO dated 23 January 2020 and the beginning of an internal investigation. After that, because of dynamic of the market, return to increase inventories, finishing the year in 153,318 tonnes.

On 8 November Acerinox announced the purchase of 100% of the German company VDM Metals, after reaching a purchase agreement with Lindsay Goldberg Vogel, a private investment firm and current owner of VDM. VDM is the world leader in the production of special alloys and is recognized as a leading exponent of R&D in the sector. Headquartered in Werdohl, Germany, it develops and manufactures special nickel and cobalt alloys, as well as high-alloyed stainless steels with special properties. It has 7 production plants between Germany and the United States, about 2,000 employees and in FY 2018/19 it had sales of 852 million and an EBITDA of 97 million. With this operation, the Acerinox Group plans to diversify into sectors with greater added value and is an opportunity to grow in new markets and sectors such as aerospace, the chemicals industry, the medical industry, hydrocarbons, renewable energy, water treatment and emissions control. The transaction is valued at 532 million euros of which Acerinox will pay 310 million, taking on 57 million in debt, which means an Enterprise Value/EBITDA of 5.5 x before synergies. The final closure of this operation is subject to approval by the European and US competition authorities, among others, and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2020. At the same time, the purchase was presented to the employee representatives of both companies and until the end of it, Acerinox and VDM Metals will continue to operate as independent companies.

Excellence 360º
6. EXCELLENCE 360º
In 2019, all Digital Transformation initiatives were unified within a 5-year plan (2019-2023) called Excellence 360º. This plan brings together the traditional Excellence Plans (2008-2018) and all the projects that constitute the Group's Digital Strategy. Excellence 360º is focused on strengthening the business comprehensively: Production (increasing quality in the process and productivity), Supply chain (optimising stock and increasing accuracy in deliveries), Commercial/ Sales (improving margins) and Procurement of Raw Materials (optimising the mix at all times). All of this thanks to the use of new technologies and putting the customer at the centre of the business.
The initiatives that comprise Excellence 360º are:

1. 360º Planning: In 2019, the first phase of the new integrated planning model commenced. This phase includes a tool to optimise the factory finishing shop, as well as transportation and a Demand Planning tool. 2. Predictive Quality: Pilot projects under way in all factories focused on predicting quality issues through data analysis; defect seams and chipping in steel, cloud defects in BA and inclusions in steel. 3. Predictive maintenance: Focused on lines that are critical for the continuity of production. New sensorisation, online monitoring and data analysis; hot rolling mill motors, continuous casting in slabs, annealing and pickling lines and vehicle transporting slag cones. 4. Supply efficiency data analytics: Creation of predictive models that optimise the consumption of supplies and consumables; optimisation of refractory consumption AOD and optimisation of the use of electrical power. In parallel with all projects, an organisation is being created in each factory responsible for implementing the projects and new profiles have been identified to accelerate the transformation of the organisation. Finally, in 2019 the third and final year of the Chair of Connected Industry of which Acerinox is patron was completed in conjunction with leading industrial and technological companies. The Chair is a privileged forum where opinion is generated with all the topics that revolve around the connected Industry. During 2019, discussions centred on how to integrate robotics into the industry, the potential of Artificial Intelligence, the impact of traceability on the supply chain and finally an analysis of the digital agenda in Spanish industry.

Excellence 360º
Excellence 360º aims to progressively achieve a return of 125 million euros on a recurring basis from 2023.
In the first year of Excellence 360º, Acerinox achieved savings estimated at more than 24 million euros, which are 20% over the total scope, and which are in line with the target scope of 19% for the first year.
It is, as already mentioned, a crucial area for the company that covers each of the areas involved in the production, distribution and sales processes. For this reason, the Group makes a special effort in the search for tools that improve each of these parts. In that spirit, in 2019 Acerinox reached an agreement with Oracle to start implementing the Oracle Demand Planning Cloud solution, thanks to which it will plan demand accurately. It is software that will add a competitive advantage when it comes to making the corresponding decisions throughout the supply chain, aligning the market behaviour in real time. The solution incorporates statistical algorithms that generate an accurate forecast for each customer and makes it possible to plan the demand for each type of product for each of the regions, for each customer and for each channel, redefining how Acerinox manages its supply chain.
This plan is part of the 360º Planning Project, which has already been reported previously but is fundamental in different areas such as the one at hand. This is a leap of innovation in supply chain management, in collaboration with Minsait (Indra) to develop advanced demand and supply-chain orientated solutions, and that in 2019 began to be rolled out in Acerinox Europe and were then deployed progressively in factories in the United States, South Africa and Malaysia.

During financial year 2019, Acerinox continued with its policy of investments in new equipment, and the improvement and maintenance of existing equipment. It allocated 151.7 million in 2019 for this purpose.
At the Acerinox Europe plant, investments of 66.4 million were made and these are broken down into those required to complete the investment of 140 million with which the company developed in 2018 a new annealing and pickling line (AP-5) and a cold laminator line (ZM7), and to complete the investment in upgrading the AP-3 annealing and pickling line. In addition, it invested in a refrigerated vault for the No. 2 electric furnace and began the installation of a ladle furnace, which will enable a greater optimisation of the production processes in the melting shop and a reduction in costs and greater energy efficiency thanks to reducing the consumption of refractory material and electrodes, the reduction of emissions and the increase in availability of the furnace.
At the North American Stainless plant, investments worth 42.1 million were made, which were those required to complete the installation of the new coil splices and finishing equipment line.
At the Columbus Stainless plant, 32.8 million were earmarked mainly to complete the installation of the new SL5 cutting line.
In addition, the new ladle furnace has advanced, which improves the productivity and costs of the steel works.
In the Roldán factory, new investments amounted to 4.1 million for the installation of new production and control equipment.

R+D+I
8. R+D+I
Research and permanent development is one of the most differentiating points that a stainless steel production company as Acerinox can offer as an added value within such a demanding sector.
The Group, aware of this, maintains a continuous commitment to investment in this section with the aim of achieving new applications, thicknesses, textures, brightnesses, efficiencies, savings and sustainability improvements from studies and tests under way in laboratories.
In its research and development departments the Group is working on the search for product improvements and efficiency through new tools such as lasers, high precision, infra-red cameras and the most sophisticated technological advances to apply to production processes in each of the workshops.
Innovative improvements in a sector such as steel-making and in such large-scale processes as those required by stainless steel manufacturing plants and machinery are not limited to one department or a specific laboratory. Every phase of the entire process, every link in the supply chain and every step of management systems is potentially improvable and no one is better place to do so than those who daily use it.
That is why Acerinox Europa, NAS and Columbus (the Group's integrated factories) each year present the Rafael Naranjo Awards with which it seeks to reward the improvement of workers' safety with the sole objective of zero accidents, the pursuit of excellence and efficiency in production processes and the reduction of environmental impact.
In this edition of Acerinox Europe, projects were distinguished in three categories: Quality in Progress, Safety and Environment, with a total prize fund of 45,000 to projects that helped to implement improvements in energy consumption and raw materials reductions, as well as to increase the efficiency of production machines.
In addition to research and internal promotion, Acerinox collaborates with different public bodies and institutions, as well as universities, in promoting these subjects. In the search for different alloys or the extension of the applications of use of stainless steel Acerinox maintains close collaboration with the Spanish Ministry of Industry through the CDTI (Centre for Development) and the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC).
Through the latter project, the company is backing and supporting the Comfuturo programme of the CSIC Foundation, with the aim of attracting and retaining the talent of the best young Spanish researchers to work in areas of practical application in companies. In the case of Acerinox, Eduardo Torroja, a researcher in the Institute of Construction Sciences, is currently developing a slag study project that is part of Acerinox Europe's plant sustainability strategy as a way of transforming what is currently waste into valuable products.
52

The development of new technologies has been a constant during these 50 years since the founding of Acerinox. Not only organically but also through collaborations with customers and suppliers. The Group has several specialised facilities for this purpose that have the latest technology for chemical analysis and studies of corrosion or other properties of metal, under the direction of experts in each of the projects. In these laboratories Acerinox develops new stainless steels aligned with the needs of emerging markets and the latest demands. These studies achieve surface finishing and functionalisation applications for automotive, deep drawing, or for new technologies such as additive manufacturing.

9. FINANCE
9.1 Results
In an environment as complicated as 2019, the adjusted EBITDA adjusted by the Group of 402 million, and, in particular, the cash flow generation of 231 million, enabled increased shareholder returns by 44%, to 184 million, and a reduction of the group´s net debt by 10% to 495 million, the lowest since 2002.
The historically low price levels seen in Europe, and the increase in record levels of imports despite safeguard measures, led the Group to seek a new efficiency threshold for Acerinox Europa. One of the first measures was to cut 215 jobs, which had an accounting impact for the financial year of 38 million, with no immediate cash outflow. As a consequence, the Group published an adjusted EBITDA of 402 million, separate from the reported EBITDA of 364 million.
At the end of the year, conservative projections regarding price recovery in the Asian and European markets, has led the Group to take impairment losses in Bahru Stainless of 98 million, as well as writing off the goodwill from the acquisition of Columbus Stainless in 2002 of 68 million. Similarly, in view of the limitations imposed by Spanish legislation on tax loss carrybacks from previous years, tax credits were written off amounting to 61 million. All these extraordinary and non-recurring impairments have no effect on cash flow.
The cumulative impact of all these measures amounts to 38 million with regard to EBITDA (lay offs in Acerinox Europa), 204 million with regard to pre-tax result (lay offs, impairment of assets in Bahru and goodwill in Columbus) and 236 million in net result (the foregoing, and the tax credit impairment losses).
The most significant statistics for the year and the variation compared with the previous year are summarised in the following table (in million euros):

Depreciation of 175 million, was 6% higher than the previous year, mainly due to the depreciation of new investments in Acerinox Europa.
The adjusted EBIT of 226 million, was 28% lower than in 2018 (312 million). The net financial result of 0.4 million in 2019, improved compared to 2018 (-2 million).
We believe that it is noteworthy that, closing the financial year with debt of 495 million, the financial management allows the net financial result to be positive.

At the end of the financial year, very conservative projections were made for the coming years in view of the economic, tariff, health and political uncertainties and the effect these may have on overall economic growth.
As a result of the foregoing, and taking into account the limitations imposed by Spanish legislation in accounting terms for the recovery of tax losses, deferred tax assets were impaired for an amount of 61 million. This measure, which is a consequence of the Company's accounting prudence, could be reversed in years to come, if the aforementioned uncertainties are resolved.
The profit after tax and minority interests increased to 176 million. After all the end-of-year adjustments discussed, Acerinox reported a loss of 60 million.

9.2 Cash flow generation
Cash flow generation, established as one of the priority objectives in the Group's Strategic Plan, was outstanding. The free cash flow generation of 231 million, enabled the Group to increase returns to shareholders (184 million) by 44%, and to reduce net financial debt by 10% to 495 million. Despite the increase in the returns to shareholders, debt was reduced by 57 million, the same figure as in 2018. The reduction in working capital was particulary strong, generating 96 million of cash flow, of which 44 million corresponded to operating cash flow. The increase in taxes paid with respect to the previous year includes 29 million paid to the Spanish Public Treasury, which will be reimbursed in 2020. Payments for investments in fixed assets in 2019 amounted to 128 million.

9.4 Financing

The strategy followed during the last number of years has focused on optimising the cost of financing, taking advantage of existing liquidity in the markets, extending maturities, increasing fixed rate debt and benefiting from the low interest rate environment. All the Group's financing was term debt. Of this, 77% was long-term. 92% of the Group's loans are at fixed interest rates. The cash deposits held by the Group at the end of the year of 877 million, enable it to cover the maturities of the loans until 2024.

9.7 Evolution of the stock market
The geopolitical crises that occurred throughout the year, especially the trade war between the United States and China, the UK's complex process of exiting the European Union, as well as the twists and turns of monetary policies of the world's major central banks set the course, not only in the stainless steel sector, but in the markets in general. IBEX 35 index closed the year with 12% increase facing the decrease of 15% registered during 2018. The Fed's announcement of the end of rate hikes at the beginning of the year was instrumental in investors calming down in the face of the risk of recession. In the first half of the year, the IBEX rose 8% to 9,199.

However, in the rest of the year it was some specific events that generated uncertainties and with it, volatility in stock markets. Continued information issued by the United States, and specifically negotiations with China, seriously concerned investors in August. There was a sharp stock market slump for fear that the tariff battle would lead to a drastic global economic downturn. China responded to tariffs with a devaluation of the yuan (Renminbi), and let it fall to its lowest level against the dollar. The IBEX lost 8,800 (-1.35%) and the Dow Jones -2.9%
In September, rate cuts and asset purchases by central banks sought to restore calm in markets and the investment community.
The stock market landscape improved after learning of the consensus for the first phase of the trade agreement between the major powers and Boris Johnson's victory in the UK general election. Central banks reinforced positive sentiment for investors in December, posing an economic scenario less threatened by risks.
The Spanish Stock Exchange also had to live with institutional paralysis with two elections from which no government has yet emerged at the end of the financial year. Uncertainty drove away many international investors looking for predictable markets, with stable regulatory frameworks.

In general terms, the year was very positive for variable return investments worldwide. But it should be borne in mind that the stock exchanges suffered a heavy blow in the last months of 2018, especially in December when the main indices closed at a loss. Hence, part of the rise in 2019 may have been due to purely corrective movement.

The Risks and Their Management

10. THE RISKS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
Acerinox has a Risk Management Model for identifying, classifying, and evaluating any possible event that could affect all the units and significant functions of the organisation as well as establishing the control and responsibility mechanisms derived from each one of them. The Model has as the ultimate objective of providing reasonable security for attaining objectives, whether strategic, operational, compliance, or reporting.
For the correct implementation of the measures and the strict monitoring of their fulfilment in each of the possible contingencies, in 2015 the Group approved the Risk Management Control Policy of Acerinox, S.A. and their Group of Companies.
Through the Policy, the mechanisms and basic principles are established for the management of opportunities and risks that allow them to:
· Achieve the strategic objectives determined by the Group. · Provide full guarantees for the shareholders. · Protect the Group's results and reputation. · Defend the interests of the key Stakeholders of the Company. · Ensure business stability and financial solidity in a sustained manner over time.
Any business activity generally entails a series of risks associated to it and, in the case of steel making, Acerinox recognises and classifies the uncertainties characteristic of the industry in which it operates.
Moreover, the substantial risks facing the Company on a daily basis requiring full-time management and special surveillance are inter-related and can be summarised in the following diagram:

The main risks are as follows: · Competition: Business risks related to competition and trade barriers in the various international stainless steel
markets. · E conomic Cycles: Demand for products in light of developments in the markets. · Overcapacity: Business risks related to production overcapacity, especially in China and its impact on reduction
of prices. · Raw Materials: Large variations in their value and availability, especially in short periods of time. · C ybersecurity: not only the usual daily operation (multi-channel communication, management and control
systems...), but also the entire digital transformation process in which the Group is immersed, may be affected by attacks on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. · Financial: Lack of liquidity, restricted access to funding sources, increasing funding costs, the volatility of exchange rates, the volatility of interest rates and credit risks. · Strategic risks: regulatory uncertainties and the evolution of investments. · Regulatory risks: Presence in the international arena with activities in numerous countries, regulatory frameworks, and business environments. Special attention to compliance and care with regard to environmental issues.

Traditionally the Acerinox Board has been one of the most diverse of the IBEX 35, coinciding with people of different nationalities (up to five) and coming from several continents. It has represented a great experience in the field of industrial (energy, steelmaking, automotive, renewable energies, chemistry, food to name a few, in the (investment banking, savings banks and banks) the public sector, information technologies, pharmacy and universities.
By gender, the Board currently has 23.7% female members. However, the company is committed to reaching 30% by 2020.
To support this process of seeking and incorporating qualitative diversity, the Board approved a matrix of competencies, which it has also extended to its various committees that allows it to know their strengths and competencies matrix in greater detail and which is a tool that will guide the selection of those who must fill vacancies in the future.

Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors undertook the commitment to carry out an annual assessment of its performance and carry out this exercise every three years through the services of an external consultant. The 2019 assessment increased its scope as all of the directors assessed the performance of all Board bodies, including committees of which they are not members. The result was a higher level of requirements, which resulted in an undoubted stimulus that points to new areas of improvement.
From an organic point of view, both the Board and its Committees increased their activity in this financial year. In addition to the ten meetings held by the Board, the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee and the Executive Committee also increased in frequency, to six and ten respectively, together with the nine meetings of the Audit Committee amounted to a total of 35 meetings of the Group's governing bodies, not counting the General Meeting. This figure is expected to be maintained in successive years.
Despite the additional effort that the intensification of corporate life entails, the Board reflected on its size, and decided to bring the number of members closer to what can perhaps be regarded as the average of listed companies on the IBEX 35. It therefore proposed that the Board not fill the vacancy left at the end of Mr Manuel Conthe's term of office and has not covered the discharge resulting from the termination of the Proprietary Board Member Mr Mvuleni Qhena.
Since 2016 the largest group in this body is that of the independent directors, with seven members, followed by the five proprietary directors, and one executive director. It has been sought to ensure that this proportion is repeated in the Executive Committee where it has been taken care that there is a proportion similar to that of the shareholders; four independents, one executive and three Proprietary Directors. In the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, the distribution is three independent and a proprietary member and the same applies to the Audit Committee. Both in the Board itself as well as the Committees, the chairperson's position is occupied by an independent director.
As the year 2018 ended with the adaptation of the Board's Regulations to the Technical Guide of the National Stock Market Commission on Audit Committees, 2019 does so with an amendment to the Regulation as a result of similar guidance, this time with regard to the Appointments and Remuneration Committees. It is particularly important that the Board preferred to maintain both powers in the same Committee, as opposed to one of the recommendations, which is precisely to split it by assigning its functions to two distinct committees. The Committee further strengthened its powers in matters relating to corporate governance. This Committee was set up as the guarantor of good practice in the internal sphere. A version of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors with the annexes containing the aforementioned amendments can be found on the company's website (www.acerinox.com) .
This policy section must highlight the adoption during 2019 of a new General Policy, number 9, dedicated to foreseeing and regulating conflicts of interest, to laying the groundwork for the procedures in cases where the directors, senior executives of the Company and the companies of their Group and persons linked to one another could be involved. Continuing with policies, the fact that several years have passed since the approval of the oldest ones, changes in regulations, trends in legal doctrine and attitudes of regulators mean that there is a need to review and, where appropriate, make the requisite adjustments to them, work which has already begun and which is expected to be completed in this financial year.
74

At the request of the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board procured its own dissemination and knowledge-enhancing mechanisms. The Board thus held meetings with the aim of examining in depth matters such as raw material markets, the importance of energy in the business objective, the future of stainless steel, the impact of various energy sources on the automotive sector, the growing influence of voting advisors, as well as regular regulatory and case law updates. This good practice is expected to increase in the coming financial years. This need to improve inputs from decision-making bodies also resulted in the growing presence of third parties, non-members of the corporate bodies in the deliberations. On the one hand, the attendance increased of several managers of the organisation who had to demonstrate in person their expertise and knowledge in specific areas, and did so with the presence lawyers, auditors and investment bankers when they were called upon to do so. These hearings were particularly significant in the Executive Committee, the body that designs the Group's medium-and long-term strategy and where some of the strategic decisions are reviewed for its submission to the Council after discussion and approval. The governing bodies also promoted, at the proposal of the CEO, the growth in the number of the Group's senior management positions, increasing the number of senior managers, from eight to ten, by assigning the Director of Strategy to this position and with the creation of a new Directorate of Institutional Relations, Sustainability and Communication, which among other functions will consolidate tasks in spheres as important as sustainable growth, energy savings, and the circular economy throughout the Group. To conclude this section, the Board of Directors was particularly sensitive to the shareholders in this financial year, taking decisions of great importance. On the one hand, the dividend per share increased from 0.45 to 0.50 and on the other it launched a first share repurchase programme for repayment, in order to increase remuneration in 2019 and in successive years. The details of this buy-back transaction, which generated a capital decrease decision by way of the redemption of shares at the General Meeting, can be found in the corresponding section of this report.

Significant events since the end of the Financial Year
12. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE THE END OF
THE FINANCIAL YEAR
Among the significant events that occurred in the first two months of 2020 were the following: - Commencement by the European Commission of inspections of hot rolled imports as part of the antidumping process launched against China, Indonesia and Taiwan and anti-subsidy measures against China and Indonesia with the aim of being able to implement retroactive measures as the case may be. - EUROFER, on behalf of European steel manufacturers, has filed a formal complaint with the FCE and the LME on the basis of indications of manipulation of nickel prices on the London Metals Commodities Market by the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan. This coincided with the application to the US Department of Trade by AISI, the American Association of Steel Manufacturers, to exclude Indonesia from the list of countries with preferential access to the US market.
In January, the US competition authorities gave the green light to the purchase of VDM Metals by Acerinox. At the time of writing, authorisation was received from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for the acquisition of VDM. Acerinox is awaiting the decision of the European authorities. The impact that the expansion of covid-19 (coronavirus) may have on the economy and on our industry is uncertain.

Independent auditor´s report on the consolidated annual accounts
To the shareholders of Acerinox, S.A.:
Report on the consolidated annual accounts
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated annual accounts of Acerinox, S.A. (the Parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, and the income statement, statement of other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and related notes, all consolidated, for the year then ended.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, as well as its financial performance and cash flows, all consolidated, for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with legislation governing the audit practice in Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those relating to independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated annual accounts in Spain, in accordance with legislation governing the audit practice. In this regard, we have not rendered services other than those relating to the audit of the accounts, and situations or circumstances have not arisen that, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned legislation, have affected our necessary independence such that it has been compromised.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated annual accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated annual accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter Goodwill recovery

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As indicated in Notes 2.8, 2.12 and 7.1 of the accompanying consolidated report, the Group carries out, at least at the end of each fiscal year, the estimate of the recoverable value of goodwill.
For calculations of recoverable value, the Group uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Management that require relevant judgments and estimates that include, among others, the operating result on sales and discount and growth rates in the long term, considering that the projected flows are subject to uncertainty. The most significant assumptions used by the Group are summarized in Note 7.1 of the attached consolidated report.
As mentioned in this Note 7.1, in the year 2019 there was an impairment of 67,889 thousand euros corresponding to the entire goodwill linked to the acquisition during 2002 of a controlling interest in the company Columbus Stainless , Ltd.

First, we have proceeded to understand the relevant processes and controls related to the evaluation of impairment in goodwill by the Group Management, including those related to the preparation of budgets and the analysis and monitoring of projections, which constitute the basis for the main judgments and estimates made by the Group Management.
With regard to cash flows, we have verified the calculations made and compared the projected annual flows, which are based on the plans and budgets approved by the Group Management, with those actually achieved in the year 2019.
Likewise, we question the key assumptions used by the Group Management, contrasting them with historical, comparable results available and other external sources. For this we have relied on experts in valuations of our firm that have evaluated the methodology and key assumptions used to calculate the current value of the flows estimated by the Group.

Deviations in these variables and management estimates can determine important variations in the calculations made and, therefore, in the goodwill recovery analysis.
This fact, together with the relevance of the consequent deterioration recorded, motivates it to be a key issue for our audit.

Additionally, we have assessed the reasonableness of the sensitivity analysis broken down in the accompanying consolidated annual accounts report.
As a result of the analysis performed, we consider that the conclusions of the Group Management on the estimates made and the consequent deterioration recorded, as well as the information disclosed in the attached consolidated annual accounts are adequately supported and consistent with the information currently available.

Recovery of property, plant and equipment

As indicated in Notes 2.12 and 8.1 of the accompanying consolidated report, the Group assesses at the end of each fiscal year if there are indications of impairment of assets. If there is such an indication, the Group estimates its recoverable amount. Note 8.1 details the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) that show signs of deterioration.

As a starting point for our procedures, we have understood the relevant processes and controls related to the evaluation of impairments in property, plant and equipment by the Group Management, including those related to the preparation of budgets and the analysis and monitoring of projections , which constitute the basis for the main judgments and estimates made by the Group Management.

Acerinox, S.A. and subsidiaries

For calculations of the recoverable value through the value in use, the Group uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Management that require relevant judgments and estimates that include, among others, the operating result on sales, rates discount and long-term growth, considering that the projected flows are subject to high uncertainty. Also, for the Bahru Stainless CGU, the Group Management has relied on an expert to determine the fair value less costs of sales. The most significant assumptions used by the Group are summarized in Note 8.1 of the attached consolidated report.
As mentioned in this Note 8.1, in the year 2019 there was an impairment of 97,234 thousand euros of the net assets of the CGU of Bahru Stainless.
Deviations in the variables and estimates of the Management can determine important variations in the conclusions reached and, therefore, in the analysis of recovery of property, plant and equipment.
This fact, together with the relevance of this heading and the consequent deterioration recorded, motivates it to be a key issue for our

With regard to cash flows, we have verified the calculations made and compared the projected annual flows with those actually achieved in the year 2019. These projections are based on the plans and budgets approved by the Group Management that have been contrasted with experts independent of the Management for certain CGUs, as detailed in Note 8.1. In this case, we have evaluated the competence, capacity, objectivity and conclusions of the expert, as well as the adequacy of his work as audit evidence.
Likewise, we question the key assumptions used by the Group Management, contrasting them with historical, comparable results available and other external sources. For this we have relied on experts in valuations of our firm that have evaluated the methodology and key assumptions used to calculate the current value of the flows estimated by the Group.
Additionally, we have assessed the reasonableness of the sensitivity analysis broken down in the accompanying consolidated annual accounts report.
As a result of the analysis performed, we consider that the conclusions of the Group Management on the estimates made and the consequent deterioration recorded, as well as the information disclosed in the attached consolidated annual accounts are adequately supported and consistent with the information currently available.

Recovery of deferred tax assets

As of December 31, 2019, the accompanying consolidated annual accounts reflect an amount of 101,033 thousand euros of deferred tax assets, and net of an amount of 34,597 thousand euros of deferred tax liabilities, the recovery of which depends on the generation of bases positive taxable in the Corporation Tax in future years (Notes 2.20, 3.h and 19.3.3 of the attached consolidated report).
The recovery of these deferred tax assets is analyzed by the Group by estimating the tax bases, based on the business plans of the different Group companies, and on the planning possibilities allowed by the tax

In the first place, we have proceeded to understand and evaluate the criteria used by the Group to estimate the possibilities of utilization and recovery of deferred tax assets in the following years, related to business plans.
Based on the business plans prepared by the Group Management, we have contrasted the key assumptions, estimates and calculations made for their preparation, comparing them with the historical, comparable results available and other external sources.
As part of the analysis, we have also evaluated the tax adjustments considered for the estimation

legislation applicable to each company and to the tax group.
As mentioned in Note 19.2, in the year 2019 there was an impairment of 60,987 thousand euros, mainly due to the recovery estimates of the Spanish tax group.
Consequently, the conclusion on the recovery of deferred tax assets shown in the attached consolidated balance sheet is subject to significant judgments and estimates by the Group's Management regarding both future tax results and applicable tax regulations. in the different jurisdictions where it operates.

of taxable bases, the applicable tax regulations, as well as the decisions about the possibilities of using the tax benefits corresponding to the different Group companies.
The analysis carried out have made it possible to verify that the calculations and estimates made by the Group Management, as well as the conclusions reached, in relation to the recovery and the consequent deterioration of the deferred tax assets, are consistent with the current situation, with the expectations of future results of the Group and with its tax planning possibilities available in the current legislation.

This fact, together with the relevance of this heading and the consequent deterioration recorded, motivates it to be a key issue for our audit.

Registration of the Collective Dismissal Procedure in Acerinox Europa, S.A.

As described in Note 2.17.b of the attached consolidated report, termination benefits are recognized as a provision for pensions and similar obligations and as a personnel expense only when the entity has demonstrably committed to terminate the link that binds the company to an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date, or to pay compensation for termination as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary termination by employees.
During this year, Acerinox Europa, S.A., agreed with its workers a reduction in the workforce of the Factory of the Campo de Gibraltar (Cádiz) by 215 people (see Note 16.1.2).
As of December 31, 2019, the Group Management considers the outflow of economic resources due to such obligations probable and has recorded a provision for restructuring plans amounting to 26,016 thousand euros (Note 16.1.2), 9,254 thousand euros in other post-employment obligations corresponding to the contribution to the Treasury (Note 16.1.2) and 2,802 thousand euros for compensation (Note 16.1.2).

In the first place, the criteria used by the Group for the estimation of the provision made, as well as the fulfillment of the criteria for recognition of the provision and its adequate accounting in the corresponding fiscal year, have been understood and evaluated.
Likewise, we have analyzed the reasonableness of the information used for the calculation and we have relied on actuarial experts from our firm to verify the data used in the calculation made by the Group Management.
On the other hand, the breakdowns in the consolidated annual accounts have been evaluated in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The analysis carried out have made it possible to verify that the calculations and estimates used by the Group Management are reasonable according to the information currently available and the conclusions reached from said analysis are adequately disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts of the Group.

Acerinox, S.A. and subsidiaries
The relevance of this fact justifies the consideration of this issue as a key issue for our audit.
Other information: Consolidated management report
Other information comprises only the consolidated management report for the 2019 financial year, the formulation of which is the responsibility of the Parent company´s directors and does not form an integral part of the consolidated annual accounts.
Our audit opinion on the consolidated annual accounts does not cover the consolidated management report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated management report is defined in the legislation governing the audit practice, which establishes two distinct levels in this regard:
a) A specific level applicable to the consolidated statement of non-financial information and certain information included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, as defined in article 35.2 b) of Audit Act 22/2015, that consists of verifying solely that the aforementioned information has been provided in the management report or, if appropriate, that the consolidated management report includes the pertinent reference in the manner provided by the legislation and if not, we are required to report that fact.
b) A general level applicable to the rest of the information included in the consolidated management report that consists of evaluating and reporting on the consistency between that information and the consolidated annual accounts as a result of our knowledge of the Group obtained during the audit of the aforementioned financial statements and does not include information different to that obtained as evidence during our audit, as well as evaluating and reporting on whether the content and presentation of that part of the consolidated management report is in accordance with applicable regulations. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that material misstatements exist, we are required to report that fact.
On the basis of the work performed, as described above, we have ascertained that the information mentioned in paragraph a) above has been provided in the consolidated management report and that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated management report is consistent with that contained in the consolidated annual accounts for the 2019 financial year, and its content and presentation are in accordance with the applicable regulations.
Responsibility of the directors and the audit committee for the consolidated annual accounts
The Parent company´s directors are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated annual accounts, such that they fairly present the consolidated equity, financial position and financial performance of the Group, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated annual accounts, the Parent company´s directors are responsible for assessing the Group´s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the aforementioned directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
5

Acerinox, S.A. and subsidiaries
The Parent company´s audit committee is responsible for overseeing the process of preparation and presentation of the consolidated annual accounts.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor´s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with legislation governing the audit practice in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual accounts.
As part of an audit in accordance with legislation governing the audit practice in Spain, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group´s internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent company´s directors.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Parent company´s directors´ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group´s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor´s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor´s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated annual accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated annual accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Parent company´s audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
6

Acerinox, S.A. and subsidiaries We also provide the Parent company´s audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements, including those relating to independence, and we communicate with the audit committee those matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Parent company´s audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated annual accounts of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor´s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated annual accounts of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter IFRS-EU) and other applicable provisions in the financial reporting framework. The annual accounts for 2019 have been prepared using the same accounting principles (IFRS-EU) as for 2018. except for the standards and amendments adopted by the European Union. which are obligatory as of 1 January 2019. which are as follows:
· IFRS 16 ­ Leases: The Group has begun to apply the aforementioned IFRS in this financial year. which replaces IAS 17. The Group has decided to apply the new standard retroactively. i.e. recognising the cumulative effect of the initial application of the standard. at the date of initial application and without restatement of the comparative information. In note 2.2 there is a description of the new standard. and the Group's analysis of its initial application.
· IFRIC Interpretation 23 -- Uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Group applies this standard from 1 January 2019. The standard provides the requirements on how to reflect the effects of uncertainty when accounting for income tax. The Group has tax litigation in various countries. as explained in note 19 and therefore needs to analyse the effects of uncertainty on its financial statements in order to record its impact if it is considered probable that this will affect the tax expense or deferred tax assets or liabilities. At 31 December 2018. the Group had recognised a provision arising from these uncertain tax litigations. These have been reclassified. in accordance with the standard. from "non-current provisions" on the balance sheet to "deferred tax liabilities". as a payable tax not expected to be settled in the short term. The company has therefore reclassified it as a non-current tax. The Group made this reclassification on 1 January 2019 without changing the comparative data of the previous year. At year end this provision amounts to 11,2 million euros. as explained in note 16.
· Amendment to IFRS 9 -- Classification of certain prepayable assets. The Group has applied this standard from 1 January 2019. although it has not had any impact since it does not have instruments that. despite having contractual cash flows consisting of principal and interest payments. do not meet this condition because of the early settlement characteristic.
The Group also includes in these financial statements the new disclosures required by these standards (Note 10).

2.2 Impact of the new IFRS 16 standard on leases adopted by the Group in 2019
The Group started applying the new IFRS 16 standard for leases on 1 January 2019. As set out in the standard. the Group has recognised lease assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position (except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). The Group is applying the exemption in the standard for short-term leases and leases with a low-value underlying asset under which the lessee can continue to record lease payments for such leases as expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. With respect to transition. the Group. as permitted by the standard. has decided to apply it retroactively. recognising the cumulative effect of the initial application of the standard on the date of initial application. Therefore. it has not restated the comparative information. The Group has applied the following principles of initial application:
- W here it acts as a lessee. the Group recognises a lease liability on the initial date of application for all leases previously classified as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 (except in the aforementioned cases). The lease liability has been measured at the current value of remaining lease payments. discounted using either the interest rate implied in the lease ­ if that rate can be easily determined ­ or the incremental interest rate of the lessees' debt for cases in which the rate is not established in leases.
- At the same time. the Group has recognised an asset by right measured for an amount equal to the amount of the lease liability. For leases classified as finance leases under IAS 17. the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application is the carrying amount of the asset and lease liability. In addition. the Acerinox Group has decided to avail itself of the practical solution that allows the rule in transition whereby it has not re-evaluated whether a contract is. or contains. a lease on the date of initial application. Instead. it has applied this standard to contracts that had previously been identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. Consequently. the Group applies requirements with respect to the identification of a lease to contracts entered into (or modified) from the initial application date. 1 January 2019. Nor has it recognised the lease liability and the asset for right of use for leases whose term expires within 12 months from the date of initial application. but has accounted for these leases as short-term leases. i.e. as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. From 1 January 2019. the Group identifies the existence of a lease in new contracts. determines the lease term and measures it in accordance with IFRS 16. as explained in the measurement criteria (note 2.11). Note 10 includes detailed information on right-of-use assets recognised by the Group and lease liabilities.
2.3 Evaluation of the main standards and interpretations that will be mandatory in 2020
A number of new standards and interpretations will be obligatory for forthcoming annual periods and have not been adopted early. The following are standards or interpretations pending adoption by the European Union that will be mandatory in the coming fiscal years and may have an impact on the Group:
· A nnual Improvements to IFRS. 2015-2017 cycle: The amendments affect IFRS 3. IFRS 11. IAS 12 and IAS 23 and will apply to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group does not expect the application of these amendments to have any impact.
· Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture: these amendments clarify the accounting treatment of sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture. The Group has no significant investments in associated companies or joint ventures.
· Amendment to IAS 19 - Amendment. reduction or liquidation of the plan: specifies how companies should determine the expenses for pensions when changes occur in a defined benefit plan. The Group does not expect the application of this standard to have any impact. since benefit plans are suitably outsourced.
· A mendment to IFRS 3 - Definition of a business: this amendment will affect the business combinations whose acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2020. Early application is allowed.

2.4 Basis of presentation of the consolidated annual accounts
The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared by the directors of the Parent Company to give a true and fair view of the Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position at 31 December 2019 and 2018. as well as the consolidated results of its operations and changes in consolidated equity and consolidated cash flows for the years then ended.
For the purpose of comparison with each of the items in the financial statement. the financial statements for 2019 also include the figures for the previous year.
These consolidated annual accounts are presented in euros. rounded off to the nearest thousand. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis. except for the following assets and liabilities. which have been measured at fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value with changes through other comprehensive income. Inventories have been measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared based on the individual accounting records of the Company and the subsidiaries forming the Acerinox Group. The consolidated annual accounts include certain adjustments and reclassifications made to bring the accounting and presentation policies used by different Group companies into line with those of the Company.
The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires the Parent Company's management to make judgements. estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and. therefore. the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement. These estimates are based on experience and other factors considered appropriate. The Group may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances. The aspects that involve a greater degree of judgement in the application of IFRS-EU. or for which the estimates made are significant for the preparation of the annual accounts. are detailed in note 3. Qualitative and quantitative details of the risks assumed by the Group. which could have an effect on future years. are provided in note 4.
The shareholders at their annual general meeting held on 11 April 2019 approved the consolidated annual accounts for 2018. The Group's consolidated annual accounts for 2019 are currently pending approval by the shareholders. The directors of the Company believe that these consolidated annual accounts will be approved with no changes by the shareholders at their annual general meeting.
2.5 Going concern assumption and accruals basis
The consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, Income and expenses are recognised on an accruals basis, irrespective of collections and payments.
2.6 Consolidation principles
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company either directly or indirectly exercises control. The Company exercises control over a subsidiary when it is exposed. or has rights. to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Furthermore. the Company is understood to have power over a subsidiary when it has existing substantive voting rights that give it the ability to direct the financial and operating activities and policies of the subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual accounts from the date on which control commences to the date on which control ceases.
The Group assesses the time at which control is taken. also taking into account the restrictions imposed in the contracts that prevent control from being taken until circumstances arise that are beyond the Group's control. such as approval by an international body or any other condition precedent provided for in the contract.
The Group has considered potential voting rights in assessing its level of control over Group companies.
The subsidiaries' accounting policies have been adapted to Group accounting policies.
The Acerinox Group's consolidated subsidiaries that are included in the consolidated group as of 31 December 2019 and 2018 are listed in note 5.
b) Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the Group's profit or loss and net assets attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests' share in the Group's net assets and consolidated comprehensive income for the year are disclosed separately in consolidated equity and in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired are recognised at the acquisition date at the proportional part of the fair value of the identifiable net assets.
Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment. even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When the percentage of equity held by minority interests changes. the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect changes in its relative interests in the subsidiary. The Group recognises directly in equity the difference between the amount
109

Consolidated Annual Accounts
by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received. and attributes this difference to the owners of the parent. The results attributed to the minority shareholder up to the acquisition date are recognised as results attributable to minority interests.
The Group assesses whether there are any clauses or financial instruments in contracts with minority interests that could oblige the entity to deliver cash or another financial asset. or to settle it as if it were a financial liability. in order to determine its classification and measurement.
When classifying a financial instrument in the consolidated financial statements. an entity considers all the terms and conditions agreed between the members of the Group and the holders of the instrument. in order to determine whether the Group has an obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset under the instrument in question. or to settle it in a manner that entails its classification as a liability. To the extent that an obligation or a settlement provision exists. the instrument is classified as a financial liability in the consolidated financial statements.
Sometimes these options are conditional on the occurrence of some uncertain future event that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument. If. in addition. the issuer of this instrument does not have an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset. it is deemed to be a financial liability of the issuer unless. among other things. the part of the contingent settlement provision that would require settlement in cash or another financial asset is not genuine. i.e. is extremely exceptional. highly abnormal and very improbable.
c) Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method for business combinations.
No business combinations took place in 2019 or 2018. d) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in financial and operating decisions. but not control or joint control. The Group is generally understood to exercise significant control when it holds more than 20% of voting rights.
The financial statements of associates are included in the consolidated annual accounts using the equity method. The Group's share of the profit or loss of an associate from the date of acquisition is recognised with a credit or debit to share in profit/loss of equity-accounted investees in the consolidated income statement for the year.
Losses of an associate attributable to the Group are limited to the value of its net investment. as the Group has not acquired any legal or constructive obligations.
The Group has no significant investments in associates. e) Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation
Balances and transactions between Group companies and the resulting unrealised gains or losses with third parties are eliminated on preparing the consolidated annual accounts.
2.7 Translation differences
a) Functional and presentation currency
The annual accounts of each Group company are expressed in the currency of the underlying economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The functional currency is the local currency for the majority of Group companies. with the exception of Bahru Stainless. NAS Canada and NAS Mexico. whose functional currency is the US dollar. The figures disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts are expressed in thousands of euros. the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.
b) Foreign currency transactions. balances and cash flows
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date. at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and recorded at historical cost are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. In the case of non-monetary assets belonging to countries considered hyperinflationary. at the end of each period the historical cost is revalued. applying a price index to express them in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the period. A detailed description of the valuation of items in hyperinflationary economies is included in section (d) below.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date on which fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary items measured at fair value are recorded as a part of the gain or loss on the fair value of the item.
110

In the consolidated statement of cash flows. cash flows from foreign currency transactions have been translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates the cash flows occur.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation into the functional currency of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
c) Translation of foreign operations
In preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements. the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than the euro have been translated to euros at the closing rate prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period; and exchange differences are recognised separately in equity and in the statement of comprehensive income under "translation differences". Translation differences are taken to profit and loss when the company that generates them ceases to form part of the Group.
The Group has applied the exemption permitted by IFRS 1. First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. relating to accumulated translation differences. Consequently. translation differences recognised in the consolidated annual accounts generated prior to 1 January 2004 are recognised in retained earnings. Furthermore. the Group did not apply IAS 21. The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. retrospectively to goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS. Consequently. goodwill is considered as an asset of the acquirer. not the acquiree. and is therefore not subject to variations due to exchange rate fluctuations affecting the acquiree.
For presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows. cash flows. including the comparative balances of foreign subsidiaries. are translated into euros applying the same criteria as that used to translate the financial statements.
d) Conversion of financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies
Since 1 July 2018. Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy by complying with the qualification requirements established in IAS 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina. as detailed in note 5.
The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy are stated in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. Both the comparative figures for the previous period and the information relating to previous periods are restated only to the extent that they are significant for the Group. in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. Since most non-monetary items are carried at historical cost. the restated cost of each item is determined by applying to said historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period. The Group has not restated the balances relating to previous years as their impact is not material.
At the beginning of the first period of application of this Standard. the components of owners' equity. except retained earnings and revaluation surpluses. shall be restated by applying a general price index to the various items from the dates on which they were contributed or from the date they arose otherwise. The restated retained earnings shall be derived from the remaining amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. At the end of the first period and in subsequent periods. all components of equity shall be restated by applying a general price index from the beginning of the period. or from the date of contribution if later.
All items in the statement of comprehensive income are expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. To this end. all amounts shall be restated for the change in the general price index from the date on which income and expenses were recorded in the financial statements.
The gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in profit or loss.
In note 14.6 the impacts of the valuation according to this standard in this year and in 2018 of the financial statements of Acerinox Argentina are included. after Argentina had been declared a hyperinflationary economy.
2.8 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the positive difference between the cost of acquisition and the Group's share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (assets. liabilities and contingent liabilities) at the acquisition date.
The goodwill recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Acerinox Group mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless. Ltd. in 2002.
After initial recognition. goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. but is estimated annually (or more frequently if events indicating a potential loss in the value of the asset have been identified) if it has suffered an impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36. Hence. goodwill is assigned to each company's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies generated by the business combination. (See note 2.12). Impairment losses are recognised for a cash-generating unit when the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the Group's goodwill is allocated is determined based on its value in use. (See note 2.12)
111

Consolidated Annual Accounts
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business combination is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. after reassessing the measurement of the assets. liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. as established in the standard.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset. b) Internally generated intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge is expensed in the consolidated income statement when incurred.
When research findings are applied to produce new products or to substantially improve existing products and processes. the associated development costs are capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible. The Group has sufficient resources to complete development and sufficient future cash flows are expected to be generated to recover the costs. with a credit to self-constructed non-current assets in the consolidated income statement. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials. direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
The Group does not capitalise development expenses in cases where. after project start-up. the future flows of projects obtained through research and development activities are not monitored.
Expenditure on activities for which costs attributable to the research phase are not clearly distinguishable from costs associated with the development stage of intangible assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Capitalised development costs are not amortised while the project is underway. Upon successful completion of the project. amortisation begins on a systematic basis over the estimated useful life. In the event of changes in the circumstances that led to the capitalisation of the project expenditure. the unamortised balance is expensed in the year the changes arise.
c) Computer software
Computer software licences are capitalised at the cost of acquiring the licence and preparing the specific program for use.
Computer software maintenance or development costs are charged as expenses when incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique computer software packages by the Group are recognised as intangible assets provided that they are likely to generate economic benefits that exceed the associated costs for more than one year. Capitalised expenses comprise direct labour costs and directly attributable overheads.
d) Amortisation
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they become available for use.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
- Industrial property: 5 years
- Computer software: 2-5 years
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Residual values. depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed. and adjusted if appropriate. at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.
2.9 Property. plant and equipment
a) Owned assets
Property. plant and equipment are recognised at cost or deemed cost. less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Items of property. plant and equipment that require a period of time in order to be ready for use are classified as under construction. An asset is understood to be ready for use when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. When in operation it is reclassified to the corresponding asset category. based on its nature.
The cost of self-constructed assets is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset. while also considering the criteria applicable to production costs of inventories. The production cost is capitalised by allocating the costs attributable to the asset to self-constructed noncurrent assets in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowing costs directly linked to financing the construction of property. plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost until the asset enters service. The Group also capitalises certain borrowing costs incurred on loans that are not directly designated to finance the investments. applying a capitalisation rate to the amounts used to finance these assets. This capitalisation rate is calculated based on the weighted average of the borrowing costs incurred on loans received by the Company other than those specifically allocated to finance the assets. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised never exceeds the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period.
112

The cost of property. plant and equipment includes major repair costs. which are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated period remaining until the following major repair.
Subsequent to initial recognition of the asset and once it is ready for use. only improvement costs incurred which will generate probable future profits and for which the amount may reliably be measured are capitalised. Costs of periodic servicing of property. plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.
Spare parts are carried as inventory unless the Group expects to use them over more than one period. in which case they qualify as property. plant and equipment and are depreciated over their useful life. The carrying amount of a spare part is written off when it is used to replace a damaged part. Spare parts of property. plant and equipment are classified under technical installations and machinery in the breakdown provided in note 8.
Gains or losses on the sale or disposal of an item of property. plant and equipment are recognised as operating income or expenses in the income statement.
b) Amortisation
Property. plant and equipment are depreciated by allocating the depreciable amount of the asset on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost or deemed cost of an asset. less its residual value. Each part of an item of property. plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.
Residual values. depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed. and adjusted if appropriate. at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.
Land is not depreciated. unless the Group has acquired the right to use the land and related property for a specific number of years. in which case it is depreciated over the period of the right of use.
Property. plant and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:
- Buildings: 14-50
- Technical installations and machinery: 3-30
- Other property. plant and equipment: 2-10
2.10 Investment property
Investment property comprises Group-owned buildings held. but not occupied by the Group. to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and subsequent sale.
The Group only makes transfers to or from property. plant and equipment to investment property when there is a change in the use of the property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost. including transaction costs. Subsequently the Group applies the same criteria as for property. plant and equipment.
Lease income is recognised using the criteria described in note 2.21 b).
2.11 Right-of-use assets
Initial application
The Group began to apply the new standard for leases (IFRS-16) on 1 January 2019. It has been applied retroactively. i.e. recognising the cumulative effect in the balance sheet. at the date of initial application and without restatement of the comparative information.
Where it acts as a lessee. the Group recognises a lease liability on the initial date of application for all leases previously classified as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 (except in short term leases and leases in which the underlying asset is of negligible value). The lease liability has been measured at the current value of remaining lease payments. discounted using either the interest rate implied in the lease ­ if that rate can be easily determined ­ or the incremental interest rate of the lessees' debt for cases in which the rate is not established in leases. At the same time. the Group has recognised an asset by right measured for an amount equal to the amount of the lease liability.
For leases classified as finance leases under IAS 17. the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application is the carrying amount of the asset and lease liability.
In addition. the Acerinox Group has decided to avail itself of the practical solution that allows the rule in transition whereby it has not re-evaluated whether a contract is. or contains. a lease on the date of initial application. Instead. it has applied this standard to contracts that had previously been identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. Consequently. the Group applies requirements with respect to the identification of a lease to contracts entered into (or modified) from the initial application date. 1 January 2019.
113

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The Group has not recognised the lease liability and the right-of-use asset for leases whose term expires within twelve months of the date of initial application. In such cases. it has accounted for such leases as short-term leases. i.e. as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Measurement basis The Group assesses whether the contract constitutes. or contains. a lease. A contract constitutes. or contains. a lease if it carries with it the right to control the use of an identified asset for a specified period of time in return for consideration. When the Group acts as lessor. it recognises lease assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position (except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). The Group measures the asset for right of use at cost. equal to the present value of the expected payments to be made for the lease during the period established in the contract. For the determination of lease payments. the Group takes into account:
a) fixed payments. less the lease incentives to be collected; b) variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; c) the amounts expected to be paid by the lessee as residual value guarantees; d) the exercise price of a purchase option. if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option; e) lease termination penalty payments. if the term of the lease reflects the lessee's exercise of the option to terminate the lease. The Group measures the current value of total remaining lease payments. discounted using either the interest rate implied in the lease ­ if that rate can be easily determined ­ or the incremental interest rate of the lessees' debt for cases in which the rate is not established in leases. The Group considers that the term of the lease is the non-revocable period of a lease. plus the periods covered by the option to extend the lease. if the lessee is reasonably certain that he will exercise that option. In determining the term of the lease and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease. an entity applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable. A lease ceases to be enforceable when both the lessee and the lessor have the right to terminate the lease without the permission of the other party. After the initial date. the Group measures the asset at its initial cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. adjusted to reflect any re-evaluation of the lease liability. Also. after the start date. the Group measures the lease liability at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Whenever there are changes in contracts. the lessee shall reassess the lease liability in order to reflect the lease payments. The amount of the revaluation of the lease liability shall be recognised as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. In cases where the leases are short-term or where the underlying asset is of little value. the Group records the lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In determining the lease term. the Group considers the non-revocable term of the lease. to which the following is added: - the periods covered by the option to extend the lease. if reasonably certain that it will exercise that option; and - the periods covered by the option to terminate the lease. if is reasonably certain that it will not exercise that option. A tenancy ceases to be enforceable when both the lessee and the lessor have the right to terminate the tenancy without the permission of the other party. subjecting themselves only to a negligible penalty. Note 10 includes detailed information on right-of-use assets recognised by the Group and lease liabilities.
114

2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets. other than inventories and deferred tax assets. are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists. the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
At the end of each period. the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. The Group considers that indications of impairment exist when there is a significant decrease in the value of the asset. significant changes in the legal. economic or technological environment that could affect the valuation of assets. obsolescence or physical impairment. idle assets. low returns on assets. discontinuation or restructuring plans. repeated losses in the entity or substantial deviation from the estimates made. This means to that evaluate the existence of signs of impairment. both external sources of information (technological changes. significant variations in market interest rates. market values of assets. etc.) and internal sources (evidence of obsolescence. etc.) are considered.
As set out in note 2.8. the recoverable amount of goodwill. which is not amortised. and of intangible assets not yet available for use is estimated at each closing date. unless prior to this date there were indications of a possible loss in value. in which case these are tested for impairment.
Impairment losses are recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset. or its corresponding cash-generating unit. exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are expensed in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
To determine the fair value calculation. the Group may contract an independent valuator
Value in use is the present value of estimated cash flows. applying a discount rate that reflects the current market valuation of the time value of money and the specific risks of the asset in question. For assets that do not generate cash inflows themselves. the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. considered as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
In estimating the value in use of an asset. the Group takes into account the estimated future cash flows that the entity expects to derive from the asset. expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows. the time value of money and the risks inherent in the asset in question and any other factors that any other market participant would reflect in pricing the future cash flows derived from the asset.
The effects of uncertainties in estimating the asset's value in use may be reflected as adjustments to future cash flows or as adjustments to the discount rate. with the result being a weighted average of all possible outcomes.
In determining value in use. the Group bases its cash flow projections on reasonable and well-founded assumptions that represent management's best estimates of the set of economic conditions that will prevail over the remaining life of the asset. giving greater weight to external evidence. In addition. such cash flow projections are based on the most recent budgets approved by management. These projections generally cover a maximum period of five years. unless a longer period can be justified.
The Group estimates cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the budgets. extrapolating such projections using a constant growth rate which does not exceed the average long-term growth rate of the stainless steel industry. nor the rate of the country or countries in which the entity operates.
Management assesses the reasonableness of the assumptions on which its current cash flow projections are based by examining the causes of differences between past and current cash flow projections. ensuring that the assumptions on which its current cash flow projections are based are consistent with actual past performance. and considering that the effects of subsequent events or circumstances that did not exist when those actual cash flows were generated justify those differences.
Details of the variables and assumptions used by the Group to calculate value in use and identify cash-generating units are provided in notes 7.1 and 8.1.
Except in the case of goodwill. impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed through the income statement provided that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. However. the new carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount (net of amortisation or depreciation) that the asset would have had if no impairment loss had been recorded.
2.13 Financial instruments
The Group began to apply the new IFRS 9 standard on financial instruments on 1 January 2018.
The Group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when. and only when. it becomes a party to the contractual terms of the instrument.
2.13.1Classification The Group classifies financial assets on the basis of their measurement as: measured at amortised cost or at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income. The basis for classification depends on the entity's business model and the characteristics of the financial asset's contractual cash flows.
115

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Financial liabilities are classified on the basis of their measurement. They are generally classified as measured at amortised cost. except where financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss or in comprehensive income.
In general. the Group shall not reclassify any financial assets or liabilities. unless the business model changes.
2.13.2 Financial assets A financial asset is any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset.
At the time of initial recognition. financial assets are measured at fair value. in addition to any transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently measured according to each of the categories in which they have been classified:
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group includes derivative financial instruments in this category. except those that are designated as accounting hedges and qualify for recognition as such.
The derivative financial instruments included in this category are classified as current assets and measured at fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised as an expense in profit and loss.
Changes in fair value are recorded under "revaluation of financial instruments at fair value" in the income statement.
b) Financial assets at amortised cost Loans and receivables include non-derivative financial assets with receivables are for a fixed or determinable amount and that are not traded in an active market. Specifically. this includes loans granted and accounts receivable. They are only classified as non-current when they are not due to mature within 12 months of the reporting date. They are initially recognised at fair value which. unless proved otherwise. It coincides with the price of the transaction plus the costs directly attributable thereto and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. using the effective interest method. except for accounts receivable which are measured at transaction price because they do not have a significant financial component. they are expected to be received in the short term and the effect of not discounting the cash flows is not significant.
The Group makes the necessary valuation corrections in accordance with an expected loss model. which takes into account the historical loss. in addition to other external factors. The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. discounted at the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition. These losses are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement and are reversed with the recognition of the income in profit and loss when their causes are eliminated.
The Group has defined a new impairment loss model. It is based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts at each of the subsidiaries and on the claims made under the arranged credit insurance policies. including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%-90% and deductibles). and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim. whether from the insurance company or the customers themselves. These estimates are reviewed within our credit risk control system (Commercial. Financial and Commercial Risk departments. Risk Committee as well as the Corporate Risk Management Department). It constantly monitors the particular markets of each subsidiary. receives the inputs of specialised experts from insurance companies. and reviews future estimates from international organisations of recognised prestige (IMF. OECD. etc.). also

116

taking into account the macroeconomic estimates of each country. The Group takes into account and monitors the significant variations in credit risk that may occur during the term of the loans.
Discounted notes and factored trade receivables are recognised until maturity under both trade receivables and current loans and borrowings. unless the risks and rewards associated with these assets have been substantially transferred. in which case they are derecognised.
The Group considers that it has transferred a financial asset when it has transferred the right to receive the cash flows derived from the asset; or it has retained those rights. but has assumed the contractual obligation to pay those assets to another entity. In this case. the Group also considers the different additional conditions established in the standard (it has no obligation to pay any amount to another entity. unless it receives the cash flows derived from the financial asset; it cannot sell or offer the transferred financial assets as collateral; and it has an obligation to pay the cash flows received without significant delay). If. in addition. the Group does not retain the risks and rewards of these assets. it will remove them from the balance sheet.
Most of the assignment contracts signed by the Group comply with this definition and are therefore removed from the balance sheet.
c) Financial assets at fair value with changes through other comprehensive income This category includes the Group's investments in the capital of other companies over which the Group has no control or significant influence and which are not held for trading.
These assets are generally classified as assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. although the Group has taken the option permitted by the standard to opt at initial recognition for subsequent changes in fair value to be presented in other comprehensive income. since these assets are not held for trading.
They are initially recognised at fair value. which is the same as the transaction price plus any transaction costs incurred. in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. provided that this is reliably measurable. and the gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The fair value of listed securities is determined by reference to the share price. The fair value of financial assets that are not quoted in official markets is calculated by reference to discounted future cash flows.
Equity investments included in this category whose market value cannot be reliably defined are measured at acquisition cost. less any impairment losses.
Acquisitions and disposals of investments are accounted for at the date on which the Group undertakes to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
In the event of a sale of available-for-sale financial assets. the difference between the amount of the sale and its fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.13.3 Financial liabilities For measurement purposes. financial liabilities are classified into the following categories:
a) Financial liabilities at amortised cost This category includes the debits and items to be paid as well as the bonds issued by the Group.
It includes non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments. Debts and payables are initially recognised at cost. which is the same as their fair value. less any transaction costs incurred. These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between the amount received (net of transaction costs) and the amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss. However. trade payables falling due in less than one year that have no contractual interest rate and are expected to be settled in the short term are measured at their nominal amount.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when the obligation specified in the corresponding contract has been honoured or cancelled. or has expired.
When debt is refinanced. the Group assesses the significance of the modifications made to determine whether they are materially different and. therefore. the effects of the new agreement should be recorded as if it were a cancellation and. simultaneously. a new loan. The terms will be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows discounted under the new terms. including any net fees paid of any fees received. and using the original effective interest rate to calculate the discount. differs by at least 10 per cent from the discounted present value of the cash flows still remaining from the original financial liability. If an exchange of debt instruments or a modification of conditions is accounted for as a cancellation. the costs or commissions incurred will be recognised as part of the cancellation cost. If the aforementioned exchange or modification is not accounted for as a cancellation. the costs and commissions will adjust the carrying amount of the liability. and will be amortised over the remaining life of the modified liability.
117

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The Group has contracted reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are recognised under trade and other payables until they are settled or repaid or have expired.
b) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss This category includes the Group's derivative financial instruments. except for financial guarantee contracts or designated accounting hedging instruments.
These are recognised at fair value. The amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability shall be presented in other comprehensive income. The remaining amount of the change in the fair value of the liability is presented through profit or loss for the period. unless this treatment would create an accounting asymmetry in profit or loss for the period. in which case all changes in fair value are recognised through profit or loss. In the Acerinox Group the only liabilities designated in this category are derivatives used to hedge fluctuations in the exchange rate. These are short-term financial instruments in which the variation attributed to credit risk is not significant.
2.13.4 Hedging operations accounting The objective of hedging operations accounting is to represent. in the financial statements. the effect of the Group's risk management activities in which financial instruments are used to cover exposures from derivative financial instruments that may affect the income statement for the year. A hedging relationship meets all the requirements for hedge accounting only if all the following conditions are met:
(a) The hedging relationship should consist only of hedging instruments and eligible hedged items.
(b) At the inception of the hedging relationship. there should be a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for performing the hedge.
(c) The hedging relationship should meet all of the following hedging effectiveness requirements:
i. There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
ii. Credit risk does not have a dominant effect on changes in value resulting from that economic relationship.
iii.T he hedging ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the amount of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the amount of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that amount of the hedged item.
At the inception of the hedge. the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationships and the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedges.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition. which coincides with their fair value. They are subsequently recognised at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are classified and measured as financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Where derivatives qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges. they are treated as such and the recognition of any resultant unrealised gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedged item. The effective part of the realised gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and later transferred to the income statement in the year or years in which the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The Group prospectively discontinues the accounting of fair value hedges when the hedging instrument expires. is sold or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. In these cases. the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is recorded in profit or loss.
The Group only undertakes cash flow hedges.
2.13.5 Measurement of fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified based on valuation inputs into the following levels:
LEVEL 1: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined by reference to market inputs in active markets.
LEVEL 2: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on observable market inputs. other than quoted prices.
LEVEL 3: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs.
118

2.14 Inventories
Inventories are initially measured at cost of acquisition or production. Valuation allowances are made and recognised as an expense in the income statement when the cost of acquisition or production of inventories exceeds the net realisable value.
The Group uses the same cost model for all inventories of the same nature and with a similar use. It uses the weighted average cost measurement method.
Finished goods and work in progress are measured at the weighted average cost of raw and other materials consumed. incorporating applicable direct and indirect labour costs and general manufacturing costs based on the higher of normal operating capacity or actual production. The cost of underutilisation of operating capacity is not included in the value of finished goods and work in progress.
Net realisable value is the expected selling price of these goods less costs to sell. In the case of work in progress the estimated costs of completion are also deducted from this price.
Raw materials are not written down below cost if the finished goods in which they will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost of production.
Any write-downs that reduce inventories to their net realisable value are reversed. up to the cost of the inventories. if the circumstances that gave rise to the write-downs cease to exist.
2.14.1 Emission allowances Pursuant to Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December. the Group recognises CO2 emission allowances as inventories. As International Financial Reporting Standards do not specify how to classify emission allowances. the Group opted to harmonise the two policies by adopting similar classification criteria in both the individual and consolidated accounts.
CO2 emission allowances are measured at cost of acquisition. Allowances acquired free of charge under the National Allocation Plan pursuant to Law 1/2007 of 9 March are initially measured at market value at the date received. At the same time. a grant is recognised for the same amount under deferred income.
Emission allowances remain classified as inventories until surrendered.
At year end. the Group assesses whether the carrying amount of the allowances exceeds their market value in order to determine whether there are indications of impairment. If there are indications. the Group determines whether these allowances will be used in the production process or earmarked for sale. in which case the necessary impairment losses would be recognised. These provisions are released when the factors leading to the valuation adjustment have ceased to exist.
A provision for liabilities and charges is recognised for expenses related to the emission of greenhouse gases. This provision is maintained until the company is required to settle the liability by surrendering the corresponding emission allowances. These expenses are accrued as greenhouse gases are emitted.
For rights assigned free of charge. at the same time as the expense is recognised. the corresponding part of the deferred income account is cancelled. using an operating income account as the balancing entry.
In the case of swaps of emission allowances. given that all of the Group's allowances were acquired free of charge. the accounting treatment applied by the Group is that of non-commercial swaps. The Group derecognises allowances surrendered at their carrying amount and recognises those received at their fair value when received. The difference between both values is recognised as deferred income.
In note 11. detailed information on emission allowances received and consumed in 2019 and 2018 is included.
2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances. demand deposits with banks and other short-term. highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows. the Group classifies interest paid and received as cash flows from operating activities. while dividends received are considered cash flows from investing activities and dividends paid are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.
119

Consolidated Annual Accounts
2.16 Grants
2.16.1 Capital grants Capital grants are those received by the Group for the acquisition of property. plant and equipment and intangible assets. They are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet. They are initially recognised at the original amount awarded when there is reasonable assurance that this will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached. Subsequently. they are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets for which the grants were received.
2.16.2 Operating grants Operating grants are those received to finance specific expenses. They are recognised as income as the expenses are incurred. Grants relating to CO2 emission allowances that are free of charge. are taken to income in line with the recognition of the corresponding greenhouse gas emission expense.
2.17 Employee benefits
Certain Group companies have assumed the following long-term commitments with their employees:
a) Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Certain Group companies pay contributions to pension and life insurance plans on a mandatory. contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are accrued. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Provisions are not made for defined contribution plans as they do not generate future obligations for the Group.
b) Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a commitment entered into by a company with its employees to remunerate services rendered. These benefits have been established based on local legislation in certain countries. contracts signed to that effect. or as included in collective bargaining agreements prevailing in certain Group companies.
Accrued commitments are calculated as the present value of the accumulated benefits accrued by personnel until the reporting date. using actuarial assumptions. Calculations are made by independent experts. Group companies record the corresponding provisions to cover these commitments.
Existing obligations may be classified as:
·Pension plans: certain Group companies have commitments with some employees reaching retirement age.
·Early retirement benefits: certain Group companies have undertaken to pay benefits to employees who opt to take early retirement.
·Supplements: these plans are obligations agreed with certain Group employees to supplement their remuneration on retirement.
·Other post-employment commitments: certain Group companies provide healthcare benefits to their retired employees. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment.
·Redundancy procedures: this year. the Acerinox Europa. S.A.U. Group company reached an agreement with its employees to restructure its workforce by approving an early retirement plan that allows workers assigned to this plan to take early retirement under certain conditions once they reach the age agreed in the plan. The Group has recognised a liability for the present value of the commitments arising from this plan. Compensation for dismissal is recognised as a provision for employee pension benefits and as a personnel cost solely when the company is demonstrably committed to terminating the relationship of an employee or group of employees prior to the normal retirement date.
The Group complies with obligations regarding the externalisation of these commitments in countries where this is applicable.
Defined benefit liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet reflect the present value of defined benefit obligations at the reporting date. minus the fair value at that date of plan assets. The Group recognises changes in the actuarial value of obligations in other comprehensive income.
When plan assets include insurance policies that exactly match the amount and timing of some or all of the benefits payable under the plan. the fair value of the insurance policies is considered equal to the present value of the related payment obligations. so the Group nets these positions on the balance sheet.
120

An independent expert calculates the actuarial value of post-employment obligations. The measurement is performed using the Projected Unit Credit method. taking into account mortality tables and estimated future increases in medical costs.
c) Share-based payment transactions The Group applies standard IFRS 2. relating to share-based payments. to transactions settled with equity instruments. in which the company receives goods or services in exchange for shares in the parent company.
The Board of Directors of Acerinox. S.A. held on 22 March 2018 approved a multi-year remuneration plan or long-term incentive (LTIP) plan that allows the Executive Director and Senior Executives of the Acerinox Group to receive part of their variable remuneration through the delivery of Acerinox. S.A.'s own shares. In note 15.1.3 detailed information on the characteristics of the approved plan is included.
Since this is an equity-settled share-based payment transaction in which the equity instruments granted are not immediately irrevocable and become irrevocable when the other party completes a specified period of service. the Group recognises the services received on a straight-line basis over the period in which the rights to receive such shares become irrevocable. while recognising the corresponding increase in equity. In the event plans specify a certain period and achievement of targets for vesting
The Group recognises the assets or services received. and the corresponding increase in equity. at fair value. on the date of the concession agreement for the equity instruments to be awarded. Fair value is determined by the market price of the entity's shares adjusted to take into account the terms and conditions under which those shares were granted (except for conditions for irrevocability or consolidation. other than market conditions. which are excluded from the determination of fair value). The Group uses the evaluation of an independent expert to do this. who uses an evaluation method accepted by standard market techniques.
When the obligation to deliver its own equity instruments is to the employees of a subsidiary. the events must be qualified as a "contribution". in which case the parent company: shall recognise an increase in the value of its interest in the subsidiary. with a credit to its own equity instruments. and shall measure it at the fair value of the equity instruments transferred at the grant date.
At the time the shares are delivered. the accounting difference between the equity item cancelled and the shares delivered is recognised against the reserves of the parent company.
2.18 Provisions
The Group recognises provisions when:
(i) It has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events;
(ii) It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
(iii) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. taking into account all risks and uncertainties surrounding the amount to be recognised as a provision and. where the time value of money is material. the financial effect of discounting provided that the expenditure to be made each period can be reliably estimated.
2.19 Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current
The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as current and non-current. Assets and liabilities are considered current when the Group expects to realise or settle them within 12 months after the reporting date or they are cash or cash equivalents.
2.20 Income tax
The income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated tax payable on the consolidated taxable income or tax loss for the year using prevailing tax rates enacted at the reporting date and applicable this year. Current tax includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method. based on temporary differences that arise between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated annual accounts. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates (and laws) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognised in the income statement. except to the extent that it relates to items previously charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
121

Consolidated Annual Accounts
Deferred tax liabilities are always recognised. Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income or deferred tax liabilities will be available against which the asset can be utilised. The Group recognises in the balance sheet the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or deductions. provided that these are recoverable within a reasonable period of time. also taking into account the limitations on their application established by law. The Group has determined that a period of 10 years is reasonable. provided that tax legislation permits it. To this end. the Group makes projections of future results. approved by management. which take into account both the current macroeconomic conditions and the market in order to determine the recoverability of these loans. Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer considered probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated or there are no deferred tax liabilities against which the assets can be offset. Reductions are reversed if there is renewed expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available against which the derecognised balance can be utilised. Both the reduction of deferred tax assets and their subsequent reversal are recognised as a higher or lower tax expense. respectively. in the income statement for the year in which they occur. The Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so. the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under non-current assets or liabilities. irrespective of the expected date of recovery or settlement. When inspecting procedures result in an assessment to be paid. the Group generally recognises such amounts as a current expense for the amount payable. and a deferred tax expense for the change in assets or temporary difference liabilities arising from the assessments. In those cases in which there is no conformity with the amounts payable and the Group decides to lodge an appeal against the proceedings. considering furthermore that their result is highly probable to be favourable for the Group. the Group would recognise an asset for the amounts previously paid and which it estimates to be recovered. Certain companies in the Consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to tax if distributed. since there are withholdings at source in certain legislation affecting the payment of dividends. The Group recognises any tax effect in this respect provided that it is not deemed likely that the reserves will have to be distributed in the foreseeable future. which will mean the reversal of the temporary difference. That is. when the parent entity has estimated that such gains will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. it does not recognise a deferred tax liability. The Group will also reverse this temporary difference against the results of the year when new legislative modifications eliminate or reduce the tax liability of these reserves. The Parent Company has filed consolidated tax returns since 1998. As agreed by the shareholders at an annual general meeting held on 28 May 2003. Acerinox. S.A. and some of the Spanish-domiciled subsidiaries form part of a consolidated tax group on an indefinite basis. with the exception of Metalinox Bilbao. S.A.U. and Inoxidables de Euskadi. S.A.U.. which file tax returns separately. At 31 December 2018 and 2017. the consolidated tax group comprised: Acerinox. S.A.. Acerinox Europa. S.A.U.. Roldan. S.A.. Inoxfil. S.A.. Inoxcenter. S.L.U.. and Inoxcenter Canarias. S.A.U. As a result of the tax consolidation regime. reciprocal receivables and payables arise between the companies in the Group as a result of offsetting tax bases between the companies in the Group.
122

2.21 Income
Revenue is an increase in economic benefits during the period in the form of additions or increases in the value of assets or decreases in liabilities that result in an increase in equity and are not related to owners' contributions.
Revenue represents the transfer of goods or services promised to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recognised when the customer obtains control of the good or service that has been sold. i.e. when they have the ability to direct the use of and obtain all of the benefits from the good or service.
The Group takes the five-step model into account to determine when revenue should be recognised and the amount.
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the price to the performance obligations
5. Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. There is no contract when each of the parties has the unilateral and enforceable right to terminate a non-executed contract without compensating the other party.
The Group's recurring or ordinary revenues relate mainly to:
a) Sales of goods and rendering of services Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods is transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due. or the possible return of goods. Sales proceeds are recognised at the transaction price. which is the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services promised to a customer. excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. There is no contract when each of the parties has the unilateral and enforceable right to terminate a contract without compensating the other party. The selling process of stainless steel is through sales orders. From this point of view. this analysis has revealed that orders arranged by the Group with customers do not give rise to an enforceable right or obligation. since the parties are entitled to unilaterally terminate a non-executed contract without compensating the other party up until the time the goods are delivered. Accordingly. no obligation comes into existence until the goods are delivered.
Depending on the commercial terms of sale. the control and risk of the goods may be transferred when the materials are shipped from the Group's facilities or when they are delivered to the customer. The Group takes these terms of sale into account when determining the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods passes to the buyer.
In determining the transaction price. the Group considers all of the following aspects:
(a) variable consideration;
(b) limitations on estimates of variable consideration;
(c) existence of a significant financing component in the contract;
(d) non-cash consideration; and
(e) consideration for payments to be made to the customer.
Revenue is recognised net of taxes. returns and discounts that the Group considers probable at the date the revenue is recognised. and after the elimination of intra-Group sales.
b) Rental income Rental income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
c) Income from dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive it is established.
123

Consolidated Annual Accounts
2.22 Environment
The Group takes measures to prevent. reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities.
Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. However. where necessary. the Group recognises environmental allowances by applying the general criteria outlined in note 2.18.
Property. plant and equipment acquired by the Group for long-term use to minimise the environmental impact of its activity and protect and improve the environment. including the reduction and elimination of pollution. are recognised as assets. applying the measurement. presentation and disclosure criteria described in note 2.9.
2.23 Changes in accounting estimates and policies. and correction of errors
The Group applies IAS 8 to recognise changes in accounting estimates and accounting policies and to correct errors. The Group recognises changes in accounting estimates in the period in which they occur. Accounting errors are corrected in the year in which they occurred. restating the comparative information presented in the financial statements whenever these errors are material. Policy changes are recognised retrospectively. adjusting the opening balances of the affected net equity items from the previous reporting year. unless there is a specific transitional provision for the initial application of a Standard or an Interpretation.
NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires that the Company's management make judgements. estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and. therefore. the amounts reported in the annual accounts.
Accounting estimates and judgements are assessed constantly and based on past experience and other factors. including expectations of future events that are considered reasonable. The Company may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and judgements related to future events. The resulting accounting estimates could differ from actual results. In accordance with IAS 8 on Accounting Policies. Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. changes in accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the Group's financial statements.
The Group's main estimates are as follows:
a) Impairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 2.12.
The Group reviews property. plant and equipment at each reporting date to ascertain whether there is any indication of impairment. taking into account the criteria set out in the policy. If any such indication exists. the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable value of an asset is the higher of fair value less cost to sale or value in use.
Recoverable amount of the Group cash generating units have been calculated based on the value in use; or fair value less cost to sale for certain assets.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined based on their value in use. These calculations are made using reasonable assumptions based on past returns and future production and market development expectations. Some of these assumptions relate to sales. margins. discount rates and growth rates to perpetuity. which involve a high degree of judgement. Details of the analyses conducted by the Group in 2019 and 2018 are included in notes 7.1 and 8.1.
b) Useful lives of plant and equipment Group management determines the estimated useful lives and corresponding depreciation charges for its plant and equipment based on expert valuations. These could alter significantly as a result of technical innovations. variations in plant activity levels. etc. Management regularly reviews the depreciation charge and adjusts it when estimated useful lives are different from those previously applied. fully depreciating or derecognising technically obsolete and non-strategic assets which have been abandoned or sold.
The Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty). Ltd carried out re-estimations of the useful lives of certain equipment in both 2019 and 2018. as explained in the note 8.
124

c) Fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments The Group acquires derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in exchange rates and interest rates. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets is determined by using valuation techniques mainly based on market conditions existing at each reporting date. and provided that financial information is available to carry out this valuation. In note 12.2.4 there is additional information on financial instruments measured in accordance with these assumptions.
d) Provisions As mentioned in note 2.18. the provisions recognised in the consolidated balance sheet reflect the best estimate at the reporting date of the amount expected to be required to settle a liability. provided that the materialisation of this outflow of resources is considered probable. Changes in foreseen circumstances could affect these estimates. which would be revised if necessary.
In the case of provisions arising from litigation in which legal proceedings are pending. it is the lawyers or independent experts who determine the likelihood of occurrence of the events giving rise to the need to enter a provision. In those cases in which it is considered possible. although it is not probable that an outflow of resources will take place or it is difficult to determine reliably the amount of the provision. the Group will consider this to be a contingent liability and will disclose the information in the notes. (Note 16)
e) Net realisable value As mentioned in note 2.14. the Group estimates the net realisable value of its inventories to recognise any impairment required. Expected selling prices of inventories less costs to sell are considered when calculating net realisable value.
f) Determination of loan impairment based on expected loss criteria As mentioned in note 2.13.2. the Group has defined a new impairment loss model based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts at each of the subsidiaries and on the claims made under the contracted credit insurance policies. including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%-90% and deductibles). and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim. whether from the insurance company or the customers themselves. These estimates are reviewed within our credit risk control system (Commercial. Financial and Commercial Risk departments. Risk Committee as well as the Corporate Risk Management Department). which constantly monitors the particular markets of each subsidiary. receives the inputs of specialised experts from insurance companies. and reviews future estimates from international organisations of recognised prestige (IMF. OECD. etc.). also taking into account the macroeconomic estimates of each country. The Group takes into account and monitors the significant variations in credit risk that may occur during the term of the loans.
g) Adjustment for hyperinflation Since 1 July 2018. Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy due to meeting the qualification requirements established in IAS 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina. as detailed in note 5.
The financial statements of Acerinox Argentina have been expressed in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. The restated cost of each item in the financial statements is determined by applying to its historical cost of said items and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period.
In this year. which is first period of application of this Standard. the components of owners' equity. except retained earnings and revaluation surpluses. have been restated by applying a general price index to the various items from the dates on which they were contributed or from the date they arose otherwise. The restated retained earnings are the result of applying these indices to the remaining amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
All items in the statement of comprehensive income have also been expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. To this end. all amounts have been restated by applying an index calculated on the basis the change in the general price index from the date on which income and expenses were recorded in the financial statements.
The gain or loss on the net monetary position has been included in profit or loss.
In note 14.6 includes the impacts of the valuation according to this standard. which in any case have been immaterial to the Group.
h) Recoverability of available tax loss carryforwards and deductions Apart from tax legislation. which in many cases allows the recovery of tax losses without limitation. as established in accounting policy (note 2.20). the Group recognises in the balance sheet the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or deductions provided that these are recoverable over a reasonable period of time. which the Group has set at 10 years. The Group regularly evaluates the recoverability of available tax credits through projections of profit and loss approved by management. to conclude as to whether they will be recoverable in said reasonable period.
The Group takes into account the limitations to offsetting tax loss carryforwards as stipulated in certain legislation. In note 19.3 details the Group's existing tax credits and the bases used to determine the recoverability of capitalised tax credits are provided.
Based on the Group's projected results. taking into account both the current macroeconomic conditions and the market. certain tax credits. which had previously been capitalised. proved to be not recoverable in a reasonable period of time and. therefore. the Group derecognised them in this year against results. as explained in note 19.3.3.
125

Consolidated Annual Accounts
i) Recognition of deferred tax liability for investments in subsidiaries. As set out in the accounting policy (note 2.20) certain companies in the Consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to tax if distributed. since there are withholdings at source in certain legislation affecting the payment of dividends. The Group recognises any tax effect in this respect provided that it is not deemed likely that the reserves will have to be distributed in the foreseeable future. At the same time. the Group will also reverse this temporary difference against the results of the year when new legislative modifications eliminate or reduce the tax liability of these reserves.
For these purposes. at 31 December 2018. the Group had recognised liabilities of 25 million euros relating to the foreseeable distribution of reserves in the amount of 250 million euros. On 27 November of this year. the Protocol Amending the Convention between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation entered into force. The Protocol amends several articles of the existing Convention. including the one referring to dividends and interest. so that dividends from shares representing 80% or more of the capital with voting rights of the company paying the dividends will not be subject to taxation at source. and a series of requirements are also set out for the application of this exemption. which the Group complies with. whereby it is no longer necessary to recognise a deferred tax liability for investments in subsidiaries. Further. the Group has repatriated reserves in April amounting to 134 million euros. subject to taxation. Hence. it reverted 13.4 million euros as it does not consider the repatriation of further amounts to be probable. At year end. the Group had reversed the remaining 11.6 million euros. Note 19 includes a detailed explanation of this derecognition.
j) Determination of the terms of leases The new IFRS 16 requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from leases in the statement of financial position. Hence. the Group will have to assess whether the contract constitutes. or contains. a lease.
The Group also measures the asset for right of use at cost. equal to the present value of the expected payments to be made for the lease during the period established in the contract. To this end. the Group is obliged to analyse both the amount of the payments it plans to make (both fixed and variable payments or penalties) and the lease term. for which it must take into account the options for extending the contract.
Note 10 includes detailed information on leases and their recognition and measurement in the Group's financial statements.
NOTE 4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (currency risk. interest rate risk and price risk). credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group aims to minimise the potential adverse effect on its financial profits through the use of derivative financial instruments. where appropriate to the risks. and by taking out insurance policies. In note 12.2.6 there is a detailed analysis of the Group's derivative financial instruments at year end.
The Group does not acquire financial instruments for speculative purposes.
4.1 Market risk
Market risk arises from variations in market prices due to exchange rate or interest rate fluctuations or changes in the price of raw materials and other materials. which can affect either the Company's results or its equity as well as the values of its assets and liabilities.
4.1.1 Currency risk The Group operates internationally and in various currencies. in particular with the US dollar. and is therefore exposed to currency risk. Currency risk arises from commercial transactions. financing and investment operations. and from the translation of financial statements whose functional currencies are other than the Consolidated Group's presentation currency (euros).
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the reporting date. at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in profit or loss account. To avoid fluctuations in profit and loss account due to changes in exchange rates. and to ensure the expected cash flows. the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge most of its financial and commercial transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each country. To this end. at the beginning of each month and subject to fortnightly review. each company considers its loans in non-local currency. trade receivables and supplier balances in foreign currency. the sales and purchases in foreign currency forecast for the period and exchange rate insurance coverage. The Group may take commercial and finance transactions as a whole into account when evaluating its total exposure for the purpose of hedging transactions in foreign currency. The Group hedges balances with third parties and between Group companies.
126

Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates that could affect assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency would be offset by a change of the same amount as in the derivative which has been signed. Changes in the derivative are recorded in the income statement. offsetting any changes that occur in foreign currency monetary items.
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group to hedge this risk consists on forward exchange rate of either sales or purhcases negotiated by the Group's Treasury Department in accordance with policies approved by the Management.
The Group also uses. if necessary. other types of derivatives such as cross-currency swaps to control currency risk in financing operations. At year-end there were no outstanding derivatives of this type. since there was no debt in a currency other than the functional currency.
Although the entity's business model is to hedge foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments and even though there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. the Group does not formally document the relationship and. therefore. most of the exchange rate derivatives arranged by the Group do not qualify as cash flow hedges. hence they cannot be registered in accordance with the policy set out in note 2.13.4. Policies that do not comply with these criteria have been registered as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
In general. financial instruments designated to hedge currency risk exposure arising from commercial transactions or transactions between Group companies are not recognised as hedging instruments. However. if they were to be. they would be those intended to hedge financing operations with financial institutions.
The Group only hedges cash flow risks for transactions made in foreign currencies that are registered in the balance sheet. so any change in the derivative valuation is registered in profit and loss account. and is offset by any changes that occur at each reporting date in the monetary items recorded in foreign currencies. The designation of these instruments as hedging instruments does not give rise to any accounting differences in the Group's income statement.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their market price at the reporting date. which is the present value of the difference between the forward trading price and the forward market price of each contract.
In note 12.2.6 there are details of the financial instruments arranged by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2019 and 2018.
Lastly. the Group is exposed to currency risk as a result of the translation to euros of the individual financial statements of companies whose functional currency differs from the Group's presentation currency. particularly the US dollar and the South African rand. The USD-euro exchange rate at 2018 year end was 1.1450. while at 2019 year end it stood at 1.1234 (USD appreciation of 2% for the year). The exchange rate of the South African Rand to the Euro at 2018 year end was 16.4594. while at the end of this year it was 15.7773 (Rand appreciation of 4%).
The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign investments in currencies other than the euro. since these are strategic long-term investments that the Group does not intend to sell or settle. In note 14.4 a breakdown of the changes in translation difference items during the year is included.
Based on the conversion exchange rates of these currencies against the euro at the end of 2019 and 2018 respectively. sensitivity to changes in exchange rates. with other variables remaining constant. is as follows:

Consolidated Annual Accounts
4.1.2 Interest rate risk The Group's financing comes from various countries and in different currencies (mainly in euro. US dollar and South African rand). with a range of maturity dates and mostly variable interest rates.
The Group's financial liabilities and financial assets are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. To manage this interest rate risk. curves are analysed regularly and sometimes derivatives may be used. These derivatives take the form of interest rate swaps and qualify for recognition as cash flow hedging instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date. taking into account interest and exchange rates at that date and the credit risk associated with the swap counterparties.
As in 2018. during 2019 the Group has continued to reduce the cost of its long-term loans by renegotiating their reference interest rate. To this end. Group has extended the maturity of a portion of its long-term loans by increasing the amounts and also reducing the costs thereof.
In 2019. in order to reduce the risk of changes in the variable interest rate. the Group has signed interest rate swaps amounting to 210 million euros. equivalent to the amount of the new loans arranged with Bankia and Caixabank. In addition. three new fixed-rate loan contracts were signed for 120 million euros with Bankinter. Kutxabank and Unicaja.
With regard to 2018. the Group increased the amount of debt with a fixed interest rate. mainly as a result of signing a long-term. fixed-rate financing contract for 125 million euros with Banco Sabadell. At the same time. the volume of interest rate derivatives increased to 250 million euros of new loans signed with Banca March. Caixabank. ICO and BEI.
In note 12.2.6 there are the details of the financial instruments signed by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2019 and 2018.
Regarding the Group's interest rate sensitivity. had interest rates on the outstanding debt at year end been 100 basis points higher. with all other variables remaining constant. the Group's consolidated profit after tax would have been 1.58 million euros lower due to a higher finance cost on variable-rate debt (7.23 million euros lower in 2018). The effect on the Group's equity of higher interest rates across the entire curve would have been an increase of 15.85 million euros (whereas there would have been an increase of 5.29 million euros in 2018). In addition. the higher borrowing costs would have been partially offset by increases in the values of its interest rate hedging derivatives held at the reporting date.
4.1.3 Price risk The Group is exposed to several types of price risk:
1. Risk due to changes in the listed price of securities held in listed companies.
The risk of price fluctuations in listed securities relates to the shares presently held by the Group in Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (Nippon). The Group does not hedge this risk with derivative financial instruments. Upon adoption of the new standard of valuation of financial instrument (IFRS 9). the Group designated these instruments in the category of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. and any changes are recognised in equity. The impact of the fluctuations in listed securities during the year is explained in note 12.2.5.
2. Risk of changes in prices of raw materials
Stainless steel is an iron alloy with a minimum chromium content of 10.5%. which also contains other metals such as nickel or molybdenum to give it specific properties. Due to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials used in the manufacturing process. as both nickel and molybdenum are listed on the London Metal Exchange. stainless steel prices can be very volatile. as these fluctuations are passed on to the customer in the selling price.
The cost of raw materials accounts for approximately 65-70% of the total product cost. of which nickel accounts for 40-50%. Nickel price volatility affects directly and significantly in the cost of stainless steel. The price setting strategy together with its price fluctuations is therefore one of the most critical functions and requires significant knowledge of the market. In Europe. South Africa and the United States. sale prices comprise a base price and a variable component known as the alloy surcharge. The alloy surcharge is a mathematical formula. calculated on a monthly basis by each of the market's stainless steel producers. that takes into account the variation in the price of certain raw materials (particularly nickel. chromium and molybdenum) and fluctuations in the USD/EUR exchange rate. The application of this alloy surcharge allows to transfer to customers nickel price fluctuations on the London Metal Exchange during its production phase. as well as price fluctuations of other raw materials and the USD/EUR exchange rate. This natural hedge is applied to 90% of the Group's sales (Europe. America and South Africa).
The manufacturing process is arranged according to the existing customer backlog. The Group's manufacturing period is 15 days. allowing it to link the cost of raw materials with its selling price to the customer through the aforementioned alloy surcharge. Keeping strict control over inventories and adapting production process to market circumstances help to alleviate the risk of raw material price fluctuations.
This year. the mitigating effect of the risk of price variation posed by the alloy surcharge has behaved differently in the United States and Europe. In the North American market. the alloy surcharge has been respected by the market and has contributed to price stability. as evidenced by the consistency of margins maintained by North American Stainless throughout the year. On the other hand. in Europe. as in the previous year. the price trend was not determined by fluctuations in raw materials but by the consequences of tariff barriers in the different markets. These have affected import flows into Europe. without the provisional safeguard measures established by the European Commission in July 2018 or the
128

definitive ones that came into force in February 2019 having had the expected effect. On the contrary. both in the second half of 2018 and in the last quarter of 2019. they have provoked the effect of calling and accelerating imports. which have come to represent. in both moments. 30% of the market. triggering an unprecedented drop in prices in Europe. This increase in imports has occurred at very high levels of stock in the storage sector. and all this has meant that the European market in 2019 has been operating more with an effective price system than with the former traditional scheme of base price + alloy surcharge.
3. Risk of price distortion due to accumulation of stocks on the market
The stainless steel market is characterised by its healthy demand. which has grown at an annual rate of approximately 6% for over 50 years. Exceptionally. the market shrank by 11.8% in 2007-2009 because of the worldwide economic recession. but recovered with growth of 26.4% in 2010. The aforementioned annual growth rate is therefore expected to prevail in the medium term. Stainless steel is required for all industrial applications and used in all sectors. which guarantees that this growth will be sustained in the coming years. Although end consumption continues to grow steadily. the fact that this market is largely controlled by independent wholesalers leads to volatility in apparent consumption. reflecting their expectations regarding nickel price trends in the London Metal Exchange (LME) and their ensuing strategies to stockpile or realise inventories.
Fluctuations in the price of nickel also affect consumer demand. Reductions in the price of nickel tend to go hand in hand with short-term drops in demand. Conversely. a rise in nickel prices tends to go hand in hand with higher demand. To counter the risk derived from the fact that independent wholesalers control the majority of the market. the Acerinox Group has developed a sales network that enables it to supply end customers on a continuous basis. by means of warehouses and service centres through which the Group's production is channelled. This policy has enabled the Group to achieve a significant market share among end customers. therefore. stabilise sales. and reduce this risk.
4. Risk of overvaluation of stocks
Maintaining sufficient inventory levels in warehouses entails the risk that these inventories might be recognised above their market price. The Group alleviates this risk by maintaining strict control over inventory levels.
The valuation of raw materials. work in progress and finished goods at average cost also helps to reduce the volatility of costs and. consequently. to decrease the impact of nickel price fluctuations on margins.
Conclusion:
The aforementioned factors (an own sales network. controlled inventory levels. alloy surcharges. average cost valuations. shortening of the production cycle and a policy of acceptance of short-term orders) help to reduce exposure to the main risk. namely the cyclical nature of apparent consumption due to the volatility of raw materials. As this is a factor beyond the Group's control. effective risk management is not always sufficient to eliminate its impact.
4.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the possible loss that could be incurred through failure of a customer or debtor to meet contractual obligations.
The Group's exposure to credit risk is determined by the individual characteristics of each customer and. when applicable. by the risk corresponding to the country where the customer operates. Due to the diversity of its customers and the countries in which the Group operates. credit risk is not concentrated in any individual customer. sector or geographical region. There is no customer in the Group that exceeds 10% of the Group's total sales.
The Group hedges its commercial and political risks either through credit insurance companies. or through letters of credit and bank guarantees extended by banks of recognised solvency located in countries with low financial risk. Credit insurance hedges between 85% and 90% of declared commercial risks. depending on the country in which the customer is located and the insurance company. and 90% of political risks. The Group's main credit insurer has an A2 credit rating from Moody's and an "A excellent" rating from A.M. Best.
In 2019 payouts of 1.482 thousand euros have been collected under the credit insurance policy (1.837 thousand euros in 2018).
A risk committee is responsible for monitoring the Group's credit risk policy. New customers are analysed in accordance to the insurance company who is also responsible for the assignment of a risk coverage. which enables the Group to offer its general payment terms to those that fulfil the necessary credit conditions. Where required. the risk committee also performs an individual analysis of customers' creditworthiness. establishing credit limits and payment terms. Otherwise. payment in cash is required.
The risk committee consists of representatives from the sales. financial and legal departments. The risks of the companies that make up the Acerinox Group are analysed and information is in turn received from the respective risk committees of Bahru Stainless. Columbus. North American Stainless or Grupinox (which represents the sales network in Spain).
129

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Among other duties. the risk committee reviews the status of past-due debts. monitors sales with excessive exposure. and approves internal loans or. depending on the amount. requests approval from the steering committee.

The Group has long-standing commercial relationships with many of its customers. In the event of a late payment. the Group closely monitors future deliveries. payment terms and reviews credit limits.

Where permitted under local legislation in the country in which the customer operates. retention of title clauses are used to secure recovery of goods in the event of default on payment.

Sometimes the Group also uses other financial instruments to reduce credit risk. such as factoring operations. The Group derecognises factored assets when the risks and rewards of these assets have been substantially transferred.

When necessary. the Group makes valuation adjustments to trade receivables based on an expected loss model which analyses the average insolvencies in each of the subsidiaries and the claims incurred on the credit insurance policies taken out. as detailed in note 2.13.2.

In note 12.2.1 details of movement in impairment of trade receivables are provided.

At 31 December 2019. consolidated trade receivables amount to 483.660 thousand euros (524.695 thousand euros in 2018). Revenues for 2019 total 4.753.878 thousand euros (5.010.777 thousand euros in 2018). This means an average collection period in the Group of 37 days (38 days in 2018)

Credit risk insurance has been contracted for 55% of consolidated net sales (52% in 2018). Cash conditions exist for 1% (1% in 2018). Confirmed letters of credit or guarantees are used to hedge credit risk in 2% of consolidated net sales (3% in 2018). Domestic sales by North American Stainless Inc.. which entail a very low risk due to the collection period which is under 30 days. account for 40% of consolidated net sales (39% in 2018). allowing deliveries to be controlled and reducing any impairment losses.

The ageing analysis of receivables is as follows:

(Figures in thousands of euros)

83% 13% 2% 1% 1% 100%

The Group has made provisions for 4.656 thousand euros (4.487 thousand euros in 2018). A provision was made for an amount of 1.109 thousand euros during the year (620 thousand euros in 2018). accounting for 0.023% of sales in 2019 (0.01% in 2018). The Group's expected loss ratio is 0.027%

130

Most of the Group's past-due receivables are insured and generally reflect customary delays in trading activity (76% of past-due receivables are aged less than 30 days). At 18 February 2019. over 89% of the above past-due debt had been collected (88% in 2018).
In view of the default rates in all sectors. we consider that the above figures are highly satisfactory and confirms the success of the Group's credit risk policy.
Any advances to suppliers of property. plant and equipment or intangible assets are hedged through bank guarantees issued by the supplier and confirmed by banks of recognised solvency.
With regard to the credit risk of bank balance. as a general rule. only banks and financial institutions that are rated by an independent third party and with a `Ba3' credit rating from Moody's are accepted. The Group has no significant concentration of risks as the likelihood of a default by the banks and financial institutions that are thus authorised is remote. based on their high credit ratings.
4.3 Liquidity risk
The Group is primarily financed through the cash flows generated in its operations. in addition to loans and financing facilities.
Although access to liquidity has improved considerably over the last two years. the Group ensures its liquidity and flexibility through long-term loans and financing facilities for amounts exceeding the quantities required at any time.
The Group's cash is centrally managed to optimise resources. The Group's net debt is primarily concentrated within the Parent Company (more than 90% of total gross borrowings at year end).
Based on its forecast treasury cash flow and considering its investment plans. the Group has sufficient funding to meet its commitments. and maintains sufficient balances available for drawdown from credit facilities to hedge liquidity risk. In 2019 and 2018 no defaults occurred on the principal or interests of the loans on the Group's financing position.
At year end the Group has been granted short and long-term financing totalling 1.965 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. 1.372 million euros has been drawn down from financing facilities at 31 December 2019 (155 million euros from factoring facilities). In 2018. the Group had cshort and long-term financing facilities of 1.903 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. Drawdowns from financing facilities amounted to 1.402 million euros and drawdowns from factoring facilities amounted to 152 million euros. At 31 December 2019 cash and cash equivalents amounted to 877 million euros (850 million euros in 2018).
The high levels of bank borrowings to guarantee mid-term liquidity along with the ongoing effort to reduce working capital continues to lead to high levels of cash in the Group. Cash balances are available and there is no restriction on their use.
Cash deposits are always short-term ­ never exceeding three months ­ and with banks of recognised solvency.
In addition. the Group continually monitors the maturity of its financial debt. seeking to establish the longest possible maturities.
The most noteworthy financing operations in 2019 were the restructuring and extension of the maturity date of the "Borrowing Base Facility" of Columbus Stainless Pty Ltd. for ZAR 3.500 million and the renewal of the syndicated factoring agreement for 370 million euros. Also worthy of note were the renegotiation of part of the existing debt and the signature of new loans for the purpose of debt rescheduling and to reduce costs. The total volume of these operations was 330 million euros. which include operations relating to existing and new loans. The existing ones include the improvements in Kutxabank's financing conditions and the new ones include the signing of a loan for 160 million euros with Bankia. of which 120 million euros were used to repay the previous loan. a loan for 40 million euros with Unicaja. of which 25 million euros were also used to repay the previous loan. and tow new loans for 15 million euros with Bankinter and 50 million euros with Caixabank. The details of these financing operations are provided in note 12.2.3.
During 2018. a renegotiation of a large part of the existing debt was also carried out. as well as the signing of new loans. with the same objective as that established for 2019. The total volume of these operations was 405 million euros. which included operations relating to existing loans as well as new ones. The existing ones included Banca March. Abanca. Caixabank. Kutxabank and Banco Sabadell. The new one is a 100 million euro loan contract which was signed with the Spanish Official Credit Institute ("ICO").

Payables to public entities are not included in suppliers and other payables. The item "other current financial liabilities" mainly includes advances on grants. deposits and guarantees whose maturity is indeterminate. Future cash flow maturities include the loan principal plus its interest based on contractual interest rates at year end. This item does not include approved investments not capitalised under property. plant and equipment under construction at the reporting date.

4.4 Brexit
Regarding the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. the Acerinox Group does not believe that this will have any material impact on its financial statements. as the Group only has one distribution subsidiary there and it has no productive assets in that country. The subsidiary imports the material that is manufactured in any of the Group's manufacturing plants and sells it in the United Kingdom. The total amount of fixed assets that the Group has in that country is 7.4 million euros (with the Group's total fixed assets being 1.823 million euros). Furthermore. sales made in that country only represent 3% of the Group's total sales. Any flight of customers that may occur as a result of Brexit should not lead to a decrease in the Group's sales. as they can be offset in any other country. given that it is a global market.

4.5 Capital management
The aims of the capital management policy are: - To safeguard the Company's capacity for sustained growth - To provide appropriate returns to shareholders - To maintain an optimum capital structure

132

The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on changes in economic circumstances. To maintain and adjust its capital structure. it can adopt different policies relating to the payment of dividends. the reimbursement of the share premium. share buy-backs. self-financing of investments. non-current borrowings. etc.
Capital structure is controlled using different ratios. such as the net financial debt/EBITDA ratio. understood to be the period necessary for the resources generated by the Company to cover the level of debt; or the gearing ratio. i.e. the relationship between net financial debt and equity of the Company.
Net financial debt is taken to be the sum of current and non-current loans and borrowings. plus notes issued. less cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA reflects operating profit or loss before amortisation. depreciation and changes in trade provisions and impairments.
The net financial debt ratio. 1.36 times (1.15 times in 2018). remains below 2 for the fourth consecutive year. which is a highly satisfactory outcome for a group in our sector.
The Group comfortably complies with all the covenants included in the financing loans. as described in note 12.2.3.
Following the investments of 128 million euros (155.3 million euros in 2018). which are described in the cash flow statement as cash flows from investment activities. this year saw a cash flow of 231 million euros generated. 60 million higher than that obtained in 2018. 171.1 million euros. This significant generation of cash was supported by the reduction in working capital in the sum of 96 million euros during the year. The 231 million euros generated were allotted fundamentally to the remuneration of shareholders. The Shareholders' General Meeting resolved to increase the dividend by 11% or 135 million euros and. in addition. shares were purchased for redemption in the sum of 50 million euros. This totals 185 million euros during a year in which the adjusted net profit without including impairment or the Labour Force Adjustment Plan (ERE) totalled 176 million euros. In addition. 57 million euros was allocated to debt reduction which has reduced the Group's net financial debt by 10%. down to 495 million euros. the lowest figure since 2002.
The gearing ratio. at 25.6%. is also the lowest since the year 2002.
The strategy applied during the year focussed on optimising the funding cost by taking advantage of the market liquidity. extending maturities and increased fixed rate debt given the increases expected over the coming years. 92% of Group loans are at fixed interest rates. Net financial costs fell by 2.5 million euros leading to earnings of 0.4 million euros in the net profit for the year.
As stated in note 12.2.3. the most important financial operations were the renegotiation of the Borrowing Base Facility contract with Columbus Stainless Pty. Ltd. in the sum of 3.500 million rand. together with the extension of the syndicated factoring contract between several Group subsidiaries in the sum of 370 million euros. Additionally. several loans were signed and renegotiations held for a total of 378 million euros.
The volume of investments aligned with the development of our strategic plan is also maintained. The Strategic Plan 2008-2020. reviewed for the period 2016-2020. is not designed using criteria of timeliness but by industrial rationality and long-term efficiency. which supports its maintenance if the Group's financial situation allows. despite temporary adverse economic situations.
The Shareholders' General Meeting held on 11 April 2019 approved a dividend distribution of 0.30 euros/share in cash. paid out on 5 June. Likewise. it was resolved to distribute 0.20 euros/share from the share premium which was paid out on 5 July. Total remuneration therefore shows an 11% increase over the dividend distributed in previous years.
It was also resolved to redeem treasury shares equivalent to 2% of the share capital at that time.
4.6 Insurance
As the Group's three integrated flat product production plants. one cold rolling plant and three long product production plants are located in different regions. an accident would not affect more than one-third of total production. This guarantees the continuity of the business. while adequate co-ordination between the remaining factories reduces the consequences of material damage to any of the facilities.
Sufficient coverage has been contracted for the Group's factories through material damage and loss-of-profit insurance policies. which account for over 58.76% of the Acerinox Group's insurance expenditure. All assets under construction are covered by both the insurance policies taken out by the respective suppliers in addition to a global building and assembly policy.
The Group also has a reinsurance company based in Luxembourg. Inox Re. which manages these risks by assuming a part as self-insurance and accessing the reinsurance market directly.
The Acerinox Group has also arranged general liability. environmental. credit. transport. and group life and accident insurance policies to reduce its exposure to these different risks.

2018

HOLDING COMPANY ACERINOX S,A

5.2 Changes in the consolidated group
This year the Group increased its stake in the Malaysian company Bahru Stainless to 98.15% (compared to 97% at the end of 2018 after the acquisition of 30% from the Japanese equity holder Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd.). This increase is due to the dilution of the minority shareholder's interest as it did not participate in the capital increase carried out in this company in proportion to its interest. as explained in note 5.3
There were no other changes in the scope of consolidation.
In December 2018. Acerinox. S.A. acquired an additional 30% stake in the Group company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. of its shareholder Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. to date also a minority shareholder of the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd by the Japanese company Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation and the restructuring of the Japanese Group. and in exercise of the purchase option provided for in the Joint Venture Agreement of 15 January 2009 entered into by Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. y Acerinox. S.A.. Acerinox acquired a 30% stake in Bahru for 11.9 million USD (10.5 million euros). equivalent at the time to the carrying amount of the shareholding. in accordance with the latest audited accounts. This acquisition increased Acerinox. S.A.'s stake in Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. to 97%.
The Group derecognised the 30% non-controlling interest in the company. The difference between the amount recognised under non-controlling interests and the acquisition value paid was recognised against consolidated reserves amounting to -40.646 thousand euros.

5.3 Capital increases and reductions
The following capital increases or reductions took place during the year:
Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd.
At its meeting held on 26 February 2019. the Board of Directors resolved to carry out a capital increase in Bahru Stainless. with no cash contribution. through the capitalization of USD 332.5 million from the loan granted by Acerinox. S.A. to its subsidiary. Acerinox. S.A.'s stake in Bahru Stainless was 97% prior to the capital increase.

137

Consolidated Annual Accounts
On 22 July. the General Meeting of Shareholders of Bahru was held. which approved the capital increase. In turn. the non-controlling shareholder took part in the increase through a cash contribution of USD 3 million. which diluted its stake to 1.85%.
Acerinox. S.A recognised an increase in its investments in Group companies amounting to 296.663 thousand euros. equivalent to the fair value of the capitalised loan. and which does not significantly differ from its carrying amount at that date.
There were no capital reductions in any of the Group's entities.
The following capital increases took place in 2018:
Peru
In 2018. a capital increase of 256 thousand euros was carried out in the Group company Corporación Acerinox Perú. S.A.C. This company was incorporated in 2012 with a share capital composed of 120.001 shares of 1 Peruvian sol with a nominal value each (58 thousand euros). The accumulated losses of 111 thousand euros and the increase in activity made the capital increase necessary.
Inoxplate
The Group company Inoxplate. Lda with headquarters in Portugal. a wholly owned investee of the Portuguese company Acerol. Ltda. reimbursed in 2018 the supplementary contributions to its parent for the amount of 1 million euros.
5.4 Impairment of investments
At 31 December 2019 and 2018 the Parent Company has analysed the recoverability of its investments in Group companies with indications of impairment to determine whether their carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. Following the analyses carried out this year. the Parent has only recognised impairment on its investment in the company Bahru Stainless. Sdn. Bhd. and of the company Columbus Stainless Pty. Ltd.
·During the year. the Parent Company has recognised an impairment of 237.313 thousand euros of its investment in the company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. because its recoverable amount. calculated on the basis of its fair value less costs to sale. is lower than its carrying amount. At 31 December 2019. this investment has been recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox. S.A. at Euros 86.329 thousand. which is equal to its recoverable amount.
·In the case of Columbus Stainless. Ltd. the Parent has recognised impairment of Euros 104.565 thousand on its investment because its recoverable amount. calculated on the basis of discounted expected cash flows. proved to be less than its carrying amount. At 31 December 2019. this investment has been recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox. S.A. at Euros 175.147 thousand. which is equal to its recoverable amount.
During 2018. the Parent company recognised impairment of 155.454 thousand euros on its investment in the company Bahru Stainless. Sdn. Bhd. which meant that the investment was recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox. S.A. at 26.917 thousand euros. which was equal to its recoverable amount. After the capital increase this year of 296.725 thousand euros. the value of the investment amounted to 323.642 thousand euros.
This impairment does not have an impact on consolidated results as these companies are fully consolidated. There is a detailed breakdown of the analyses performed in the Parent Company's individual report.
NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING
As described below. the Group is organised internally into operating segments. which are strategic business units. The strategic business units have different products and services and are managed separately. Group management reviews internal reports for each unit at least monthly.
The operating segments presented by the Group. associated with the types of products it sells. are as follows:
· Flat stainless steel products: slabs. flats. coils. plates. sheets. circles and flat bars. · Long stainless steel products: bars. angles. wires and wire rods. · Other: other stainless steel products not included in the previous segments.
The "unallocated" segment reflects the activities of the holding company and activities that cannot be allocated to specific operating segments. As described in note 1. the main activity of the holding company. parent company of the Acerinox Group. is the provision of legal. accounting and advisory services to all Group companies. as well as the performance of financing activities within the Group. as it is through Acerinox. S.A.. where all the Group's financing is centralised.
138

Segment results. assets and liabilities include all items directly or indirectly attributable to a segment. No significant assets are shared between segments and. considering the importance of flat stainless steel products. any assets that could be attributed to both segments are assigned to the flat segment.
With regard to the so-called "unallocated" segment. which relates mainly to the holding company's own activities. the result reflects only the expenses corresponding to its activities. since revenues. since they are always with Group companies. have been eliminated in consolidation. The costs are mainly financial since the holding company centralises most of the Group's financing. as can be seen from the amount of the liabilities in the "unallocated" segment.
Revenue and all items reflected in the income statement by segments are presented on a consolidated basis. i.e. after eliminating income and expenses from Group companies. except for sales between segments. which are reflected separately.
Inter-segment sales prices are established in accordance with market commercial terms and conditions governing non-related third parties.
A segment's performance is measured by its gross operating profit and net profit before tax. The Group considers this information to be the most relevant in evaluating a segment against other comparable segments in the sector.

Amortisation for the year is shown under amortisation and depreciation in the income statement.

The research and development expenses incurred by the Group do not meet the criteria for capitalisation and are therefore recognised as expenses. by type. when they are incurred. Research and development and innovation (R&D&I) costs directly recognised as expenses for the year and taken to the income statement amount to 12.035 thousand euros (9.547 thousand euros in 2018).

At 31 December 2019. the Group had entered into contracts for the acquisition of intangible assets amounting to 897 thousand euros. (970 in 2018).

7.1 Goodwill impairment testing
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill on an annual basis. or more frequently. where there are indications of possible impairment. To this end. goodwill is allocated to the company's cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination.
Prior to 31 December 2019. the goodwill. amounting to EUR 69.1 million.and mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless. Ltd. in 2002. This goodwill. amounting to 67.889 thousand euros (allocated to the Columbus cash-generating unit ­CGU-. which manufactures and sells flat products only) has been completely impaired during 2019. as described in this note.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on its value in use. These calculations are based on cash flow projections from the financial budgets approved by Management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond this five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates indicated below. The terminal value is calculated taking into account average values calculated on the basis of figures reached in the past and also in the budget period. allowing the standardising of bull and bear cycles.
As far as the 5-year budgets are concerned. the estimated sales and production volumes are based on current capacities with existing machines and equipment and take into account the evolution of both future demand and prices of stainless steel by market. as estimated by independent industry experts. Management determines production costs taking into account the current situation. the efficiency plans put in place and future price developments.
Price forecasts have been made on the basis of estimates made by the company CRU. which provides its subscribers with an estimate of prices on the various stainless steel markets. Demand estimates are based on ISSF and Oxford Economics publications
The discount rates used are before-tax values and reflect specific risks related to the relevant segments. Other significant assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices refer to values recorded on the most recent market values.
During 2019. Columbus Stainless. Ltd has been affected by the negative evolution of the markets. especially during the last semester of the year. significantly departing from the budgets approved by Management.
For the global stainless steel sector. the year started with an improvement in the demand on all the markets. showing a first half of a great deal of activity. followed by a slowdown during the third quarter and remaining at low levels during the last. Specifically. the South African economy grew slightly in 2019. although at a lower rate than expected (0.2%). yet such increase was not reflected throughout the sector as the apparent consumption of stainless steel contracted around 10% in 2019. in line with the trend of the main consumption sectors. especially the automotive sector. due to a lack of confidence in the market and the shortage of large projects during the year.
Columbus' results this year were also negatively affected by exceptional circumstances arising during the third quarter of the year. Among such exceptional circumstances. the most significant were the lack of supply of gas and problems with the commissioning of certain improvements implemented in some of the machines. The Group does not expect such events to carry over to future years.
The Company is confident that the flows to perpetuity will materialise. mainly in terms of its use of production capacity and margins. maintaining the growth rate (g) used. The growth rates have been calculated using estimated growth rates for the country and sector. and bearing in mind historical growth in the consumption of stainless steel.
The key assumptions used to calculate the value in use are as follows:

Budgeted EBIT margin (*) Weighted average growth rate (**) Pre-tax discount rate applied (***) Post-tax discount rate applied (***)

2019 2.8% 2.5% 16.5% 12.8%

2018 4.5% 2.5% 17.3% 13.1%

(*) EBIT margin. considered equivalent to operating profit/loss (as a percentage of net revenue Average value of the budgeted period. (**) Used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period (***) WACC. Weighted Average Cost of Capital

143

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The discount rate (WACC or weighted average cost of capital) has been calculated considering the reference of the interest rates of the South African sovereign debt (10-year SWAP of the South African Rand). a capital structure. market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
Regarding the terminal value. a normalization exercise has been performed to obtain flows in perpetuity. the amortisations are equalled to the investments and the variation of the working capital is also calculated based on average amounts. deemed consistent in the long term. increased by growth rate (g).
The growth rate (g) remains constant at 2.5%. In 2019 the global stainless steel market continued to consolidate the historical market growth rate of 5.9% for the 1950-2019 period.
Other assumptions are the euro-rand exchange rate (16.28) and the price of raw materials (13.700 USD/MT). which are established when drawing up the budget. Both are extrapolated and kept constant during the period of analysis. The variables used in 2018 were 16.459 for the exchange rate of the Euro with respect to the Rand and 11.200 USD/MT for the price of the raw materials.
Due to the environment of uncertainty that governs the markets in which Columbus operates. the Group has carried out an analysis of the probability of occurrence of the key assumptions. adjusting the expected budgets. as well as those of the terminal year. to average values obtained in the past and considered as normalised for the future.
All things considered. the impairment test performed as of 31 December 2019 reflects a recoverable value of EUR 239.796 thousand (EUR 356.423 thousand in 2018). falling short of the carrying amount. EUR 307.458 thousand (EUR 280.364 thousand in 2018) by EUR 67.662 thousand (an excess of EUR 76.059 thousand in 2018). Consequently. the Group has impaired its goodwill this year in its aggregate amount of EUR 67.9 thousand. No impairment has been recorded on the company's other assets.
Nonetheless. a sensitivity analysis has been conducted within the range of variations that the Group considers possible:

Discount rate (WACC) Perpetual growth rate (g) Averaged budgeted EBIT margin (*)

Variation -6.0% 70.0% 25.0%

Impairment -54,251 -53,341 -53,202

Variation 2,5% -30,0% -9,0%

Impairment -72,736 -72,473 -72,868

The Group has recorded an impairment in the upper range of the analysis

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The difference between " amortisation and depreciation" appearing on the income statement and on the statement of cash flows. and the sum of the provisions reflected in the tables of property. plant and equipment. intangible assets. investment property and right-of-use assets is due to the hyperinflation adjustment made to all the profit and loss items of the Argentine entity and that. in the case of the provision for amortisation. amount to 14 thousand euros.

The impairment of fixed assets recorded by the Bahru Stainless Group company is included. together with the goodwill explained in note 8.1. in a separate heading in the income statement

Investments
Investments in property. plant and equipment and intangible assets for the year amounted to 151.687 thousand euros. of which 50 million relate to recurring investments in maintenance. Also of note are 46 million euros of investments made by the Spanish company of the Acerinox Group Europe and related mainly to the last invoices received to complete the new rolling mill and the fifth annealing and pickling line. which have been brought into operation this year. as explained below. In addition. investments are also being made in a ladle furnace that will enable the company to optimise the steelmaking process. In the North American Stainless Company. investments amounting to 18 million euros were made to renew and improve certain lines. The main investment made this year by the company Columbus was also a ladle furnace and improvements to various lines. for a total of 25 million euros.

During the year the Group obtained loans from the Ministry of Industry under the financial support programme for industrial investment within the framework of the public policy of reindustrialisation and strengthening of industrial competitiveness (REINDUS) amounting to 33.161 thousand euros. This financing relates to the investments made in Acerinox Europe's factories in Palmones and Roldan in Ponferrada in six different projects. These are 10-year loans with a 3-year grace period and an interest rate of 1.6%. for which the Group has had to provide guarantees for 10% of the loans granted.

In 2018 the investments made amounted to 143.896 thousand euros. These included 87.851 thousand euros invested by the Spanish Group company Acerinox Europa mainly in a new cold-rolling mill and a fifth annealing and pickling line. The equipment has the most advanced technological systems and a level of competitiveness that will generate new quality standards. while reducing costs and environmental impact. With this new line. Acerinox Europe offers thinner thicknesses (with a width of 1.500 mm) to its end customers. thus expanding its product range.

Of the total amount recognised under this heading. 25 million euros are recognised in Acx Europe (174 million euros in 2018 corresponding to the new rolling mill and the fifth annealing and pickling line started up in this year) and 14 million euros in the American company North American Stainless. in both cases relating to some of the investments mentioned in the previous section and which are still in progress.

From total "transfers" from property plant and equipment under construction to finished property plant and equipment amounting 232.809 thousand euros. an amount of 150.748 thousand euros correspond to the reclassification made by Acerinox Europa of the investments made in the new rolling mill and in the fifth annealing and pickling line after having reached the optimum production volumes and quality determined by management. The reclassified amount has entailed an increase in depreciation this year of around 7.5 million euros. The amount of 19.471 thousand was also reclassified from property. plant and equipment under construction owing to the renovations made to the AP3 annealing and pickling line.

Changes in accounting estimates
As explained in note 3. the Group periodically reviews estimated useful lives based on the valuations made by experts. During this year the Columbus Stainless Group company reviewed the useful lives of items whose useful life was about to end. extending it in those cases where the items are still in use. This re-estimation has had a negligible impact on the Group's income statement. amounting to 52 thousand euros. As a result of these analyses carried out last year. the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty). Ltd. changed the useful lives of some of its assets. The technological improvements and maintenance plans implemented by the company led us to forecast a lengthening of useful lives of between 5 and 10 years. The Group accounted for the change in accounting estimates prospectively as stipulated in IAS 8. The impact of the change in accounting estimates on profit and loss at 31 December 2018 was 659 thousand euros. due to the reduction in provisions for this year.
Guarantees
At 31 December 2019 and 2018 none of the Group's assets has been pledged to secure loans and borrowings.
Commitments
At 31 December 2019. the Group had entered into contracts to acquire new equipment and installations for 56.295 thousand euros. of which 29.848 thousand euros relate to investments being made by Acerinox Europa and 20.076 thousand made by North American Stainless. At 31 December 2018 the Group had signed contracts to purchase new equipment and facilities amounting to Euro 64.346 thousand. of which Euro 40.615 thousand was also for new investments made by Acerinox Europa to complete its investments in the new rolling mill and the fifth annealing and pickling line.
Capitalised borrowing costs
Borrowing costs of 397 thousand euros have been capitalised in this year for the company Columbus Stainless (40 thousand euros in 2018. mostly corresponding to the company Columbus Stainless). The capitalisation rate in 2019 was 8.95% (8.57% in 2018).
Disposals of fixed assets
The loss on the sale of property. plant and equipment or the removal of assets from service totals 3.501 thousand euros and is recognised under other operating expenses in the 2019 income statement (2.250 thousand euros in 2018). This balance primarily reflects the disposals of property. plant and equipment from Group warehouses. either as obsolete parts or because they have been used for maintenance work.

The gain on the sale or withdrawal of property. plant and equipment recognised in the consolidated income statement in 2019 under other operating income amounted to 7.189 thousand euros. relating mainly to the sale of an industrial plant in California owned by Group company North American Stainless (560 thousand euros in 2018 relating to the sale of two industrial plants in Spain classified as investment property).
Environment
Property. plant and equipment held to minimise the environmental impact of the Group's activities and to protect and improve the environment at 31 December 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Other information At 31 December 2019 and 2018 there are no litigation cases. seizures or similar measures that may affect items of property. plant or equipment.
The Group's companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their property. plant and equipment. The coverage of these policies is considered sufficient.

8.1 Impairment of assets
As established in IAS 36. and as mentioned in the accounting policies. (note 2.12). the Group assesses whether there are any indications of impairment of the assets at each year end. The value of an asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To assess indications of impairment. the Group considers both external sources of information (technological changes. significant fluctuations in market interest rates. market value of the assets) and internal sources of information (evidence of obsolescence. continued losses in the entity. substantial deviation from estimations. etc).
Property. plant and equipment and intangible assets represent 44% of the Group's assets. A breakdown by company shows that 94% of the Group's property. plant and equipment and intangible assets are located in factories. with the remaining 6% held by its 33 other subsidiaries:

The majority of assets do not generate cash inflows independently. as the whole production process needs to be completed. Impairment has therefore not been estimated on an individual basis. but by allocating the assets to cash-generating units. In the case of factories. the smallest cash-generating units that can be considered encompass each factory as a whole.
During this fiscal year there have been indications of impairment at Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd.. Columbus Stainless PTY Ltd. Acerinox Europa S.A.U.. Inoxfil. S.A.. and Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
The indications of impairment are based on the continued losses recorded and/or on the substantial deviation with respect to the estimates made. Following are the details of the main impairment tests conducted:
Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd.
It is the most recently created factory of the Acerinox Group. located in Johor. Malaysia. It operates mainly in markets of the ASEAN area. where there is a significant price gap compared to other international markets largely due to the over-capacity in the Chinese market and the resulting pressure on international markets. especially in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition. the different ASEAN countries and. generally. in Asia. reacted to Chinese over-capacity by instituting anti-dumping or protectionist measures in their local markets.
The aforementioned over-capacity in Asia was the dominating note during 2019. mainly to the new factory of the Chinese producer Tsingshan that broke into the cold rolling mill market at very low prices. . which resulted in lower final prices world-wide and which in turn spread to all Asian market. reaching all-time low prices. With all of this. the Asian market has maintained very low prices during the entire year.
During the first half of the year. there had been no relevant breaches of the budgets. but due to the aforesaid market situation of over-capacity. and consequently very low prices. in addition to the increasing tension and regulatory uncertainty in the international trade flows. the evolution of Bahru Stainless has continued to worsen until year end. preventing the transferring of the cost of the products to the final sales prices.
By sectors. China saw a drop for the second consecutive year in the automotive sector. this time of -7.5% in 2019 according to the CAAM (China Association of Automobile Manufacturers). in contrast with the excellent behaviour in construction of +9.9%. according to data from the NBS (National Bureau of Statistics).
In conclusion. due to the uncertainties of the Asian market. resulting from the installed over-capacity. the low prices sustained over the last years and the increasing instability generated from the international trade flows by the numerous international protectionist measures. the Group has considered that the forecast flows of Bahru are subject to a high level of uncertainty.
In light of all these determinants. the Group has decided to request the support of an independent valuation firm. Along with such firm. the main assumptions of the budgeted flows and the performance of the impairment test calculations have been adjusted.
Within such context. the independent valuation firm has aided in the estimate of the recoverable value (premise of reasonable value less cost of sale) in the context of an analysis of impairment test from the perspective of a market participant.

148

To estimate the fair value of Bahru Stainless. an income approach has been used. based on an analysis of Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) under projections adapted depending on market participants. The initial estimates have been reviewed to adjust them according to performance indicators and market assumptions to approach the perspective of a market participant.
Within the possible range of after tax discount rates (WACC). 9.75% has been considered based on the Beta considered under the approach of a market participant. A finite life has also been considered (25 years) solely projecting maintenance investments. In addition to the projected investments the projected profit and loss statement includes maintenance expenses arising during the finite life.
Negative tax bases and outstanding tax credits have also be considered. in addition to the rights to the land not in use and that could be sellable.
The impairment test conducted as of 31 December 2019 shows a lower recoverable value EUR 389.180 thousand (EUR 633.1998 thousand in 2018) over the carrying amount prior to the impairment. EUR 486.414 thousand (EUR 557.921 thousand in 2018). of EUR 97.234 thousand (an excess of EUR 75.276 thousand in 2018). The after tax discount rate (WACC). 9.75% (8.50% in 2018) and the budgeted EBIT margin. 2.4% (3.2% in 2018) are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analyses. By increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 15.6% to 11.25%. a possible impairment of EUR 149.419 thousand would be reached. Regarding the budgeted EBIT. a 5% drop in each of the years considered (2020-2044). could increase the impairment up to EUR 108 million.
Columbus Stainless PTY Ltd. It has not been necessary to make any impairment of the tangible assets of the company. as evidenced from the analyses shown in note 7.1. although there has been a complete impairment of the goodwill associated with Columbus Stainless.
Acerinox Europa S.A.U. Acerinox Europa (Campo de Gibraltar. 1970) was the first integral stainless steel factory in the world. The plant was built by the Acerinox Group and the knowledge and experience acquired during their design and performance proved to be determinants in the creation of other Company factories.
The plant recently enhanced its array of steel thanks to new equipment fitted with state of the art technological systems and boasting a level of competitiveness that has given rise to new quality standards. giving the products greater added value. quality and reliability. in addition to reducing production costs and the environmental impact.
2019 started off with an improvement in the demand on all markets. completing a first semester of abundant activity followed by a slowing down in the third quarter and with low levels being maintained during the last. All this amidst geopolitical tensions. such as Brexit in Europe or the increasing protectionism worldwide and the frame of US-China relations.
The European market underwent an evolution. in terms of final demand. in line with the economic slowdown in the EU as a whole. and particularly the two main stainless steel markets: Germany and Italy. At the sector level. according to Eurofer estimates. construction growth of 3.8% is worthy of mention. while for both the automotive and electrical appliances. Eurofer downgraded its estimates in January. with drops of -5.9% and -1.4%. respectively.
The definitive safeguard measures adopted in February 2019. modified those imposed primarily in July 2018. establishing annual quotas per country to the main origins (those that accounted for more than 5% of the imports in the three-year period 2015-2017) and a residual quota for the rest. to be revised quarterly.
The 25% tariff was maintained above the quotas. There was also the exclusion of developing countries below the 3% threshold of imports. under the WTO rules. that of countries in the European Economic Area and countries of the preferential trade agreement between the European and Africa was also excluded. including South Africa. Hence our factory. Columbus Stainless. remained unaffected.
In September. a review of the final measures was approved. providing for a reduction of from 5% to 3% of the annual increase in instalments. and the inclusion of Indonesia in the residual quota as of 1 October. for having exceeded its imports as a developing country over the threshold of 3% in 2018. both in cold and hot.
Despite these measures. European producers were unable to prevent the pressure of the imports that. with the US market closed off. found in Europe the main destination of their surplus production. This was reflected in the fact that the imports in Europe was only reduced by 5%. in line with the fall in the market.
The strong increase in imports from Indonesia until it was included in the measures is a fact that must be emphasise. This. together with other imports from Asia. had a very negative impact on prices.
In August. the European Union initiated an anti-dumping investigation for materials from Indonesia. China and Taiwan. followed by the opening in October of an anti-subsidy investigation for materials from Indonesia and China. in both cases for hot rolled flat products.
Within this context. the results for Acerinox Europe deviated from the budgets initially set for this year.
The Group has taken into account all these circumstances. and all the corrections of the macroeconomic forecasts. in preparing the 5-year budgets.
For price forecasts. the estimates made by CRU have been taken into account. which provides its subscribers a price estimate on the various stainless steel markets. For demand estimates. the publications of SMR (Steel Metals and Market Research) and Oxford Economics have been taken into consideration.
The key assumptions of the budgets prepared during this year provide for a slight increase in demand in Europe in 2020 and a larger growth starting in 2021. as determined by the estimates of the ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum) and SMR (Steel Metals and Market Research) in
149

Consolidated Annual Accounts
their last review of November. Regarding prices. sources such as CRU forecast drops in Europe in 2020. and increases as of 2021. The efficiency plans implemented by the Group and for the reduction of fixed costs have also been factors considered in preparing of the budgets.
The recoverable amount of the elements has been determined in accordance with their value in use.
To determine the value in use of the assets. the estimate of future cash flows that the entity expects to obtain from the assets and the discount rate. i.e.. the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). were taken in account.
The discount rate before taxes (WACC) so calculated is of 7.0% (after taxes 5.8%).
To determine such discount rate. the financing or leverage structure has been considered based on market participants hypotheses. the reference of the interest rates of the sovereign debt of Spain (10-year bond) and a capital structure. market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
The impairment test conducted as of 31 December 2019 shows an excess in recoverable value (EUR 1.347.549 thousand) over the carrying amount (EUR 707.990 thousand) of EUR 639.559 thousand. Consequently. no impairment is to be registered. The discount rate (WACC). 7.0%. the growth rate (g). 2.5%. and the budgeted EBIT margin. 4.4%. are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
Following a sensitivity analysis entailing different scenarios . impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 36%. in addition to equalling the growth rate (g) to 0. for the carrying amount to begin to show impairment.
The average budgeted EBIT margin. 4.4%. would have to fall by 42.3% to 2.6%. with the other two assumptions remaining constant. for impairment to occur.
Inoxfil. S.A. Inoxfil. S.A. is one of the long product plants of the Group in Spain and is engaged in the manufacture of stainless steel wire. Located in Igualada (Barcelona. Spain). this company is wholly owned by the Group company Roldan. S.A.. located in Ponferrada (León. Spain). Inoxfil receives the wire rod from Roldán to finish its manufacturing process. This is therefore the final production link in a network starting when Roldan receives the billet from Acerinox Europa. as the only Group plant with a steel mill in Spain.
The long product manufactured by this plan is supplied to both the internal market and to international clients. and its stainless steels are present in some of the most iconic projects worldwide.
The recoverable amount of the elements has been determined in accordance with their value in use.
To determine the value in use of the assets. the estimate of future cash flows that the entity expects to obtain from the assets and the discount rate. i.e.. the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). were taken in account.
To determine such discount rate. the financing or leverage structure has been considered based on market participants hypotheses. the reference of the interest rates of the sovereign debt of Spain (10-year bond) and a capital structure. market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
The discount rate prior to taxes (WACC) so calculated is 7.0% (after taxes 5.8%).
To estimate the future cash flows of this subsidiary. five-year budgets approved by Management have been used. considering as reasonable assumptions and best estimates those based on the information available at the date of the analysis. regarding the economic conditions that would arise over the remaining useful life of the assets. and the objectives marked by Management.
The estimates of the forecasts for the years following the explicit five-year period are extrapolated by using a growth rate to perpetuity of 2.5%.
During this year. there have been no impairment of tangible fixed assets. due to the fact that the value of the business. calculated using the discounted free cash flows method. exceeds the carrying amount of the operating assets.
The impairment test performed on 31 December 2019 shows an excess in recoverable value (EUR 26.824 thousand) over the carrying amount (EUR 11.167 thousand) of EUR 15.657 thousand. The discount rate (WACC). 7.0%. the growth rate (g). 2.5%. and the budgeted EBIT margin. 2.7%. are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
According to the sensitivity analysis performed. the discount rate (WACC) would have to increase by 48.1%. while simultaneously bringing the growth rate (g) down to zero. for the carrying amount to begin to see impairment.
The budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 53.7% to 1.2%. with the other two assumptions remaining constant. for impairment to occur.
Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd This subsidiary markets part of the production of Bahru Stainless in the Malaysian market. and it was affected by low prices in the local market. as mentioned above.
The recoverable amount of the elements has been determined in accordance with their value in use.
To determine the value in use of the assets. the estimate of future cash flows that the entity expects to obtain from the assets and the discount rate. i.e.. the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). were taken in account.
150

To determine such discount rate. the financing or leverage structure has been considered based on market participants hypotheses. the reference of the interest rates of the sovereign debt of Malaysia (10-year bond) and a capital structure. market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
The discount rate before taxes (WACC) so calculated is of 9.7% (9.0% in 2018) and after taxes 8.30% (8.96% in 2018).
To estimate the future cash flows of this subsidiary. five-year budgets approved by Management have been used. considering as reasonable hypotheses and best estimates those based on the information available at the date of the analysis. regarding the economic conditions that would arise over the remaining useful life of the assets. and the objectives marked by Management.
The estimates of the forecasts for the years following the explicit five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate to perpetuity of 2.5%. same as in the year 2018.
During this year. there have been no impairment of tangible fixed assets. due to the fact that the value of the business. calculated using the discounted free cash flows method. exceeds the carrying amount of the operating assets.
The impairment test conducted at 31 December 2019 shows an excess of recoverable value (EUR 36.444 thousand) over carrying amount (EUR 7.880 thousand). of EUR 28.563 thousand (EUR 27.778 thousand in 2018). The discount rate (WACC). 9.7% (9.0% in 2018). the growth rate (g). 2.5% (2.5% in 2018). and the average budgeted EBIT margin. 5.2% (4.8% in 2018) are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
According to the sensitivity analysis performed. the discount rate (WACC) would have to increase by 3.8 times its current value (3.5 times in 2018). while simultaneously bringing the growth rate (g) down to zero. for the carrying amount to begin to see impairment.
The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 74.1% (76.1% in 2018) to 1.4% (1.1% in 2018). with the other two assumptions remaining constant. for impairment to occur.
Impairment analysis conducted in 2018
The companies showing indications of impairment in 2018 were Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. and Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. The analyses conducted during the past year led to a recoverable value of its assets above the carrying amount. Sensitivity analyses conducted also allowed concluding that a substantial change in all assumptions was necessary for impairment to begin to occur.

NOTE 9 INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Investment property includes Group-owned buildings not occupied by the Group which are held to earn a return. either through rentals or through capital appreciation and subsequent disposal of the buildings.

The Group has several industrial bays in Spain and other countries classified in this category. and as investment property in different subsidiaries. These are industrial bays which were used to carry out commercial activity but are currently idle. and the Group thus intends to rent or sell them.

Details of movements in investment property in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

There were no changes in the Group's investment property. whether additions or disposals. In 2018. the Group disposed of two warehouses that had been classified as investment property. the carrying amount of which was 827 thousand euros. The profit for the sale of these warehouses was 507 thousand euros.

151

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Income from the lease of industrial bays amounted to 509 thousand euros in 2019 (523 thousand euros in 2018). The associated operating expenses. including maintenance and repairs. amount to Euros 193 thousand (Euros 194 thousand in 2018).
At 31 December 2019 investment property has a total market value of 21.128 thousand euros (22.849 thousand euros in 2018). This measurement takes into account observable market variables such as offers and prices per square metre of premises available in the geographical area of the Group's investment property and. therefore. the determination of fair value is classified within the LEVEL 2 hierarchy in accordance with the policy established in note 2.13.5.

NOTE 10 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (LEASES)

Right-of use assets have been measured in accordance with the present value of future lease payments. The detail and movement in this period is as follows:

In its initial application of the standard. the Group has recognised right-of-use assets measured for an amount equivalent to the amount of the lease liability.

Interest expense on lease liabilities recognised by the Group at 31 December amounted to 181 thousand euros. The interest rate used is the interest rate implicit in the lease. or the incremental interest rate of the lessee's indebtedness. when that rate is not readily determinable.

The line of "transfers" includes the reclassification of finance leases. which the Group had recorded at the end of last year under property. plant and equipment.

152

The amount of lease expenses relating to low-value assets or short-term leases recognised under "operating expenses" in the income statement amounted to 8,934 thousand euros.

The term of the Group's lease agreements and the amount of the payments remaining from 1 January 2019 are as follows:

2018 359,574 194,410 428,560 35,899
295 1,018,738

Raw materials and other suppliers include 12,249 thousand euros reflecting the valuation of the emission allowances held by the Group at the end of the year (7.951 thousand euros in 2018).

The change in finished goods and works in progress in the year. according to the balance sheet at 31 December 2019 and 2018 shown above. differs from the figure in the income statement owing to translation differences.

The cost of goods sold has been calculated in accordance with the policy defined in note 2.14 and amounts to 4,225 million euros in 2019 (4.368 million euros in 2018).

In 2019 the Group wrote inventories down to net realisable value where this was lower than cost. with a total adjustment of 20.182 thousand euros. The adjustment recognised for 2018 amounted to 21,981 thousand euros.

Commitments

At 31 December 2019 the consolidated Group has commitments to purchase raw materials for Euros 242,877 thousand (Euros 223,657 thousand in 2018). Although no firm sales commitments exist at these reporting dates. there are formal orders for which the Group does not foresee any circumstances that could prevent delivery by the agreed deadlines.

The Group does not have any inventories with a cycle exceeding one year and therefore no borrowing costs have been capitalised.

Group companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their inventories. The coverage of these policies is considered sufficient.

153

Consolidated Annual Accounts

11.1 Emission allowances
Pursuant to the additional provision of Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December. the Group classified emission allowances as inventories.
On 15 November 2013 the Spanish Cabinet approved Acerinox Europa. S.A.U.'s definitive allocation of free-of-charge greenhouse gas emission allowances for the 2013-2020 period. 1.867.754 allowances in total. The yearly distribution of the allowances is detailed below:

2013 248,936

2014 244,613

2015 240,239

2016 235,818

2017 231,350

The following allowances were allocated to the Group company Roldan, S,A,:

2013 26,857

2014 26,391

2015 25,919

2016 25,442

Movement in emission allowances in 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

2018 226,839
2018 24,473

2019 222,272

In 2019. CO2 emissions were made requiring 232,730 allowances. which will be surrendered in 2020 (248.117 in 2018. surrendered in 2018). The Group has not sold its surplus allowances.
The expense for the year in respect of CO2 emissions totals 2,742 thousand euros in 2019 (1.846 thousand euros in 2018) and is included under other operating expenses. This is the value of the allowances surrendered in the year. equivalent to the market value of these allowances when allocated.
Disposals for the year are allowances surrendered for CO2 emissions in the prior year. This information has been audited and approved by an independent expert.
Present conditions pose no significant risk of a shortfall in emission allowances for the 2018-2020 period. The Group does not hold any futures contracts for the acquisition of emission allowances.
No significant contingency exists in respect of fines over emissions.

The amount that appears under receivables from public entities primarily corresponds to VAT settlements to be paid.

As explained in the valuation standards. the Group records accounts receivable at their transaction price as long as they do not have a significant financial component. they are expected to be received in the short term and the effect of not discounting the cash flows is not material.

Impairment of bad debts corresponds entirely to trade receivables. Movements in this account are as follows:

Debt at fixed interest rates only include loans originally arranged at fixed rates (with banks and private placements), and do not include borrowings for which interest rates have been fixed by signing derivatives,

The fair value of fixed rate loans and borrowings and private placements is 705,579 thousand euros at 31 December 2019, and their carrying amount is 676,494 thousand euros, The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2018 was 580,313 thousand euros (carrying amount of 540,000 euros).

Variable interest rates on loans are reviewed less than once a year,.

The weighted average cost of financing instruments in euros at the end of 2019 was 1,40% before hedging, for a total of 1,262.3 million euros, 2,91% for 45,7 million US dollars and 9% for 1,083 million of financing in ZAR, In 2018, the weighted average cost of financing instruments in euros before hedging was 1,40%, for a total of 1,338 million euros, and the average cost of borrowings in US dollars, amounting to 73 million US dollars, was 3,87%, There was no financing drawn down in ZAR in 2018.

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps whereby it can exchange the variable interest rates on its borrowings for fixed interest rates, as described in note 12.2.6.

At 31 December 2019 accrued interest payable in respect of loans and borrowings totals 1,129 thousand euros (1,513 thousand euros in 2018). In addition, accrued interest payable on bonds issued totals 1,634 thousand euros at the 2019 reporting date (1,635 thousand euros in 2018).

Total borrowing costs calculated using the effective interest rate on loans at amortised cost amount to 1,247 thousand euros (1,636 thousand euros in 2018).

At 31 December 2019, the Group has credit facilities with financial institutions with a maximum available limit of 1,965 million euros, of which 1,372 million euros was drawn down at 31 December 2019, At the 2018 year end, the maximum available limit from credit facilities was 1,903 million euros and the amount drawn down on that date was 1,402 million euros.

Certain Group companies have arranged reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage payments to suppliers, Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are recognised under trade and other payables until they are settled or repaid or have expired, The Group uses confirming only as a payment instrument, but not as a financing instrument, Invoices are paid on due date without any advantage being gained from the use of confirming.

Main financing operations undertaken during the year

The most noteworthy financing operations during the year were:

·In 2019, the Borrowing Base Facility of Columbus Stainless Pty Ltd, was restructured and its maturity date was extended, with an amount of ZAR 3,500 million, The transaction, which was originally signed in April 2015 and renewed in 2017 for another two and a half years, was extended for another four years, including modifications in its structure to give Columbus greater flexibility, The participating entities include Deutsche Bank AG, Johannesburg Branch, Bankinter S,A,, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S,A,, FirstRand Bank Limited, Banco Santander S,A,, Banco de Sabadell S,A, London Branch, Caixabank S,A,, Investec Bank Limited, Nedbank Limited and HSBC Bank Plc Johannesburg, The lead arranger of the transaction continues to be Deutsche Bank AG, Amsterdam Branch. This

158

facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under bank borrowings of current liabilities, ZAR 1,083 million had been drawn down from this financing facility at 31 December 2019.

·Another significant operation in 2019 was the renewal of the Syndicated Factoring agreement between several Acerinox Group subsidiaries and Abanca, BBVA, Banca March, Banco Sabadell, Bankia, Bankinter, BMCE International, Caixabank and Santander Factoring and Confirming for 370 million euros until 30 June 2021, with the possibility of a tacit renewal for another year.

·In addition, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism granted several fixed-rate loans to Acerinox Europa S,A, for a total amount of 30,6 million euros and to Roldán for 2,5 million euros.

·In the first half of 2019, four new loans were signed: one with Bankinter for a 15 million EUR bullet for three years, one with Caixabank for 50 million euros for five years with a three-year grace period, another with Bankia for 160 million euros, of which 120 million was used to repay the previous loan, disbursed on 28 June 2019 with final maturity on 28 June 2024, with a three-year grace period and a repayment schedule of five semi-annual instalments of 32 million euros each and one more with Unicaja of 40 million euros (of which 25 million euros was also used to repay the previous loan), All these loans have been granted to Acerinox S.A.

·In addition, a loan signed with Kutxabank amounting to 65 million, of which 15 million euros were new debt, has been refinanced, with extension of its maturity until 2024 and better financing conditions, This loan was also granted to Acerinox S.A.

Regarding debt renegotiations, the Group has evaluated the importance of the amendments made to determine if they are substantially different, in accordance with the criteria established in the evaluation standard defined in note 2.13.3. and has recorded the effects of some of the new agreements as if they were a deregistration and registration of a new loan at the same time, During this fiscal year, the amount of fees recorded as income for the loans signed with Bankia, Kutxabank and Unicaja, which were deregistered from liability, amounted to 266 thousand euros,

The most noteworthy financing operations during 2018 were:

·Signing with the Spanish Official Credit Institute (ICO) of an eight-year loan worth 100 million euros, The loan was paid out at the end of June 2018, and had a final maturity in March 2026, It comes with a two-year interest-only repayment period and will be repaid in four half-yearly instalments of 5 million euros each, starting in September 2020, and eight half-yearly instalments of 10 million euros each, the last falling on the loan maturity date, The loan was awarded to Acerinox S.A. and the Group has committed to fulfil, over the life of the loan, an annual financial ratio between its consolidated net financial debt and its equity.

·The loan of 70 million euros that Acerinox S,A, signed with the European Investment Bank ("EIB") in December 2017 was delivered in June.

·Lastly, and taking advantage of good market conditions, Acerinox S,A, renegotiated five existing loan contracts with Abanca, Banca March, Caixabank, Kutxabank and Banco Sabadell, for a total amount of 305 million euros, improving costs and margins and extending terms.

Acerinox Group has satisfactorily met the repayment schedules for its financial debt.

Long-term borrowings subject to covenants a) Ratios linked to earnings
Currently, no loan agreement signed by Acerinox has convenants linked to ratios that take into account the Group's results.
.b) Ratios linked to equity
None of the new loan agreements signed in 2019 are conditional on the fulfilment of annual financial ratios, The only loans subject to covenants are those detailed below:
At the 2019 reporting date there are three financing contracts subject to covenants, relating to the maintenance of minimum consolidated equity levels, This is the loan signed in March 2017 with Banca March for 50 million euros and transferred to a Securitisation Fund at the time of signature, the loan signed with the European Investment Bank ("EIB") in December 2017 for 70 million euros and the loan signed in March 2018 with the Spanish Official Credit Institute ("ICO") for 100 million euros, This type of ratios is standard market practice in financing with these maturities, as the loan signed with Banca March has a term of 7 years, the EIB one has a term of 10 years and the ICO one has a term of 8 years.
.Additionally, the Group company Columbus Stainless has a structured financing (Borrowing Base Facility) which is also subject to a ratio relating to the maintenance of minimum equity levels in that company, This facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under bank borrowings of current liabilities, ZAR 1,083 million had been drawn down from this financing facility at 31 December 2019. At 31 December 2018 no amount has been drawn down from this facility.
.At the year end (as in 2018) Acerinox, S.A. and Columbus Stainless Ltd comply with all ratios required under the contracts mentioned above.
.12,2,4 Measurement of fair value As established in the accounting policies, the Group measures financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income and derivative financial instruments.
.Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified based on valuation inputs into the following levels:
LEVEL 1: quoted prices in active markets
LEVEL 2: observable market variables other than quoted prices
LEVEL 3: variables not observable in the market

No financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value have been transferred between levels,

In the case of Level 2 financial instruments, the Group uses generally accepted valuation techniques that take into account spot and future exchange rates at the valuation date, forward interest rates, interest rate spreads and credit risk of both the Group and its counterparty, i.e. the financial institutions with which it operates.

12.2.5 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income The shares that the Group does not intend to sell and that it has designated in this category at the initial moment are recognised in this section.

The value of financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income total 10,402 thousand euros at year end, of which 10,115 thousand euros reflect Acerinox's investment in the Japanese company Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (Nippon), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This value corresponds to the fair value of the shares at 31 December 2019 and coincides with their closing price.

The market value at 31 December 2019 of Nippon's shares was 1,654 JPY per share. Acerinox holds 747,346 shares in this company, which represented a negligible percentage ownership in the Japanese group. The amount of the devaluation, recognised this year in other comprehensive income, amounted to 1,112 thousand euros.

In March 2017, Nippon acquired a significant stake in Nisshin Steel Co. Limited (Nisshin), which enabled them to improve their competitiveness. In May 2018, in order to finalise the synergies between the two Groups, the Board of Directors considered it necessary to acquire control of 100% of the shares of Nisshin in order to complete the consolidation process.

Thus, based on the agreements reached at the extraordinary General Meeting called by Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd. it was determined that effective 1 January 2019, a swap of the shares of Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd. would be carried out for shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (Nippon). As a consequence of these Acerinox agreements, it received 0.71 shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation for every share in Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. Nisshin's shares ceased trading on 26 December 2018.

In 2018, the Group determined the fair value of the Nisshin shares to be the market value of the Nippon shares based on the number of shares that would correspond to it as from 1 January 2019. Acerinox owned 1,052,600 shares of Nisshin Steel, Co., which was equivalent, after the exchange equation, to 747,346 shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation. The market value at 31 December 2018 of these shares was 1,892.5 JPY per share. The amount of the devaluation, recognised in other comprehensive income, amounted to -3,248 thousand euros this year.

During this year, the Group has derecognised the shares it held at 31 December 2018 at their fair value at that date (11,227 thousand euros) and initially recognised the new shares for the same amount, since this was the fair value on the effective date of the exchange. The amount of accumulated reserves in other comprehensive income, as a result of the valuation at fair value through other comprehensive income (-5,023 thousand euros) has been reclassified to reserves from accumulated results.

The Group has decided to maintain the classification of this portfolio of shares into financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, since this is a strategic holding that is not held with the intention of selling it. Nisshin Steel has, in turn, a 15.81% interest in Acerinox.

Acerinox S.A. did not purchase or sell any shares in Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited in 2019 or 2018.

Also in 2015, the Group company Acerinox Europa acquired a non-controlling interest of 7.36% in the company Fortia Energía, S.L., whose corporate purpose is the acquisition of electricity on behalf of its shareholders, for 275 thousand euros. The Group's Spanish factories can obtain more competitive electricity prices as a result of this investment. This investment is measured at cost of acquisition, as there is insufficient data to measure it at fair value. In any event, the Group does not consider there to be indications of impairment.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

12.2.6 Derivative financial instruments

As detailed in note 4, in relation to market risk, in its activities the Group is essentially exposed to three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk, The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to certain risks.

The Group classifies derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, Those that qualify as hedging instruments are classified as hedging derivatives and are recognised by applying the measurement criteria defined in note 2.13.4.

Derivative financial instruments classified by category are as follows:

As explained in note 4.1.2, during this year two swap transactions were closed in order to hedge the interest rate risk of debts contracted at a variable interest rate with Caixabank and Bankia in terms and amounts equivalent to the flows derived from the loans associated with each instrument. The notional amount of the loans hedged is 210 million euros. At 31 December 2019, both interest rate derivatives met the conditions to be classified as cash flow hedging instruments.
In 2018, the Group arranged interest rate hedges amounting to 250 million, equivalent to the amount of the new loans arranged with Banca March, Caixabank, ICO and BEI.
Following the repayment last year of the loan granted by the ICO in USD, the cross currency swap derivative financial instrument was cancelled.

Currency risk
The Group operates in a large number of countries and bills customers in different currencies, depending on the country where it is billing. Therefore it uses certain financial instruments to hedge cash flow risks arising from the settlement of balances in foreign currencies. The contracted operations mainly comprise forward sales and purchases in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges with derivative financial instruments a majority of the commercial and financial transactions carried out in a currency other than the functional currency of a country.
Although the entity's business model is to hedge foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments and there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the Group does not formally document the relationship and, therefore, most of the foreign currency insurance contracts arranged by the Group do not qualify as cash flow hedges and are therefore accounted for in accordance with the policy set out in note 2.13.4. Policies that do not comply with these criteria have been accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates that could affect assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency would be offset by a change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. Changes in the derivative are recorded in the income statement, offsetting any changes that occur in foreign currency monetary items.
At 31 December 2019 the effect of measuring these derivatives at market value was negative, i.e. -1,256 thousand euros, which is recognised under remeasurement of financial instruments to fair value in the income statement (positive 12,878 thousand euros in 2018). The exchange gains obtained by the Group in the year amounted to 16,978 thousand euros (455 thousand euros of profit in 2018). The differences between the two amounts are mainly due to the interest rate differentials between the currencies involved in the exchange rate insurance contracted.

162

At 31 December 2019 all exchange rate insurance policies basically cover both receivables (assets) and payables (liabilities) and include both trade and financing transactions between Group companies. At 31 December 2019, the fair value of the Group's exchange risk insurance totalled -262 thousand euros (998 thousand euros in 2018), of which 6,038 thousand euros is recognised under assets and 6,300 thousand euros under liabilities. Of these, there is no exchange rate insurance at year-end 2019 or 2018 that has been recorded in accordance with hedge accounting. In this year, an amount of -157 thousand euros was transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to profit and loss for the year (-154 thousand euros in 2018).

All of the Group's forward currency purchase and sale contracts have a term of less than one year.

At 31 December 2019 the Group has used contracts for foreign currency transactions amounting to 304 million euros for currency sales and 279 million euros for currency purchases.

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, there were no loans with banks in currencies other than the functional currency and, therefore, the Group no longer has derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to both currency risk and interest rate risk.

Interest rate risk
In order to hedge the interest rate risk on a portion of its short and long-term bank borrowings, the Group has entered into the following swaps as of 31 December 2019:

Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate

Notional value contracted
76,13 million euros 30 million euros 70 million euros 50 million euros 100 million euros 50 million euros 160 million euros

The average interest rate of euro-denominated financing hedged by a derivative financial instrument, totalling 464.5 million euros at year-end, is 1.34% (1.97% in 2018). The credit spread has been included in both cases.
At 31 December 2019 and 2018, no interest rate hedges in USD had been arranged.
At 31 December 2019, all interest rate derivatives met the conditions to be classified as cash flow hedging instruments.

The fair value of the fixed interest rate swaps is based on the market value of equivalent derivative financial instruments at the reporting date and amounts to -8,356 thousand euros (-5,484 thousand euros at 31 December 2018), These amounts are recognised in the Group's consolidated balance sheet under the following items:

At 31 December 2019 and 2018 the outstanding derivatives qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and therefore the unrealised loss of -5,430 thousand euros on their measurement at fair value has been recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss of -6,243 thousand euros in 2018).
In 2019, an amount of 2,640 thousand euros was transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to profit and loss for the year (2,072 thousand euros in 2018). Combined with the -157 thousand euros derived from the currency hedges referred to in the previous section, these totalled 2,483 thousand euros, which appear in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (-154 in 2018 and a total of 1,919 thousand euros).
The Group has documented the effectiveness of the derivatives contracted to be recognised as hedging instruments, as detailed in note 2.13.4. Hedging transactions have been contracted for periods and amounts equivalent to the cash flows derived from the loans associated with each instrument. The financial instruments that are considered hedges were not ineffective at any point in 2019 or 2018.

14.3 Reserves
a) Retained earnings

The decrease in translation differences this year (increase in 2018) is mainly due to the reduction in equity of foreign companies as a result of the distribution of dividends (USD 920 million repatriated this year, charged to reserves of the company North American Stainless) and valued in the consolidated accounts at historical exchange rates. According to the translation criteria of the consolidation standards, the reserves of the Group entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency shall be valued at the historical exchange rate Translation differences show the variation between the historical exchange rate and the closing exchange rate. Such reduction in translation differences does not give rise to a reduction of the Group's equity, since it is a transfer from the subsidiary's equity to reserves in the parent company, as reflected in the statement of changes in equity. The difference between the 91,511 thousand euros shown in the table and the 97,173 reflected in "other movements" in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, is due to the difference between the exchange rate at year-end and the exchange rate at which the dividends are received at Acerinox, S.A.

Translation difference resulting from the valuation of equity was positive, due to both the appreciation of the USD and the Rand. The EUR/USD exchange rate applied at the end of 2019 is 1.1234, compared to 1.1450 at the end of 2018 and 15.7773 for the EUR/Rand in 2019, while at the end of 2018 it was 16.4594.

In 2018, the increase in equity, as a result of conversion differences, was mainly due to the appreciation of the USD by 5%. The impact of the Rand, however, was negative, due to its depreciation by 11.2%.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

14.6 Adjustment for hyperinflation
Since July 1, 2018, Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy, having met the qualification requirements of IAS 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina, which is solely dedicated to the distribution of stainless steel in this country, so the amount of its assets, liabilities and its contribution to the Group's results are not significant. The Group has not restated the comparative figures for the previous period as the impacts are not significant for the Group.
The financial statements of Acerinox Argentina for both 2018 and 2019 have been stated in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. The restated cost of each item in the financial statements is determined by applying to its historical cost of said items and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period. The revaluation of non-monetary assets amounted to 270 thousand euros (248 thousand euros in 2018).
The components of owners' equity, except retained earnings and revaluation surpluses, have been restated by applying a general price index to the various items from the dates on which they were contributed or from the date they arose otherwise. The restated retained earnings are the result of applying these indices to the remaining amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The impact on reserves amounted to 198 thousand euros, as reflected in the statement of changes in equity (351 thousand euros in 2018).
All items in the statement of comprehensive income have also been expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. To this end, all amounts have been restated by applying an index calculated on the basis the change in the general price index from the date on which income and expenses were recorded in the financial statements. The amount recognised in the income statement for this item amounted to 263 thousand euros (199 thousand euros in 2018).

14.7 Non-controlling interests
At the end of this year, two companies with non-controlling interests are Columbus Stainless, Ltd, (Columbus) 24% of which is held by the South African group IDC (Industrial Development Corporation) and Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd, (Bahru) whose minority interests have been reduced to 1.85% owned by Hanwa, Co. Ltd.
As explained in note 5.2, at the close of 2018, Acerinox, S.A. acquired from Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. its 30% stake in Bahru Stainless Sdn, Bhd. Since the purchase was made at year-end 2018, the Group recognised the results corresponding to the 30% ownership interest up to the acquisition date as results attributed to non-controlling interests.
There are no rights to protect non-controlling interests that may restrict the entity's ability to access or use assets and to settle the entity's liabilities.
Neither of these companies distributed dividends in 2019 or 2018.
The detail of the main items in the financial statements of Columbus, which is the only Group company with significant non-controlling interests at year-end, is as follows:

When Columbus Stainless was founded, Acerinox signed in December 2001 a Shareholder's Agreement, with the three South African partners, Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Ltd,, Samancor Ltd, who held an interest therein.

170

In clause 9 of that contract it was stipulated that, in the event of a change of control in Acerinox S.A., by virtue of which a shareholder acquires shares of Acerinox, S.A. that gave him a majority of votes in the General Meeting or on the Board, the shareholders may exercise a put option on Acerinox for their interest.
In the 17 years that have passed, two of the three partners who signed the agreement, Highveld and Samancor, have renounced the shareholding, and the third, IDC, a state entity to support industrial development in South Africa, has increased its participation from 12% to 24%, given its interest in supporting the creation of wealth, the maintenance of employment, and the consideration of Stainless Steel as a strategic sector for the country. It has recently declared itself to be its strategic, and long-term involvement.
It is for this reason that the exercise of this option, in the assumption of the mentioned hypothesis, is highly unlikely for the only minority shareholder of Columbus Stainless, since its permanence is not determined, as it was in the other shareholders, by the presence of Acerinox, but by the support to the national industry.

14.8 Distribution of profits
The distribution of earnings of the Parent Company, Acerinox, S.A. for 2019, as proposed by the board of directors, to be submitted to the shareholders for approval at their annual general meeting is as follows:

Basis of allocation: Profit for the year

2019 438,827,598,35

Application: Legal reserve Dividend distribution To compensate prior year losses To distributable reserves

128,597,21 108,218,477,20 186,367,543,13 144,112,980,81

The Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. has decided to propose to the next Ordinary General Meeting of the Company dividend distribution of 0.50 euros per share of which 0.10 euros will be charged to the share premium at their general meeting held on 11 April 2019, the shareholders agreed that the Parent Company's profit for 2018 should be distributed as follows:

Basis of allocation: Profit for the year
Application: Prior years' losses

2018 -125,599,654 -125,599,654

14,9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

(Figures in thousands of euros)
Profit attributable to the Group Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding Earnings per share (in Euros)

-0,22

2018 237,086 276,067,543
0,86

Although as of December 31, 2019 there are other equity instruments that give access to capital, as indicated in note 16.1.3, these do not significantly affect the calculation of earnings per share, therefore diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share.

The defined benefit liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position relates to the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, minus the fair value of the plan assets at that date.
On November 13, the Acerinox Europa´s, S.A.U. representatives and the workers representation entered into an agreement at the Extra-judicial Labour Conflict Settlement Service (SERCLA) of the Court of Andalusia whereby a reduction of the personnel at the Factory at Campo de Gibraltar (Cadiz) by 215 people was established, 183 of whom were for reasons of age and voluntary ascription, and another 32 for lack of multi-skilling, 8 of which joined voluntarily.
The departure of these last 32 employees took place immediately after the referred Agreement and before year end. The expense accrued by such dismissals amounted to EUR 2,802 thousand, included under item "personnel expenses" in the consolidated income statement, as evidenced by note 17.2.
The remaining departures, for age reasons, will take place gradually until the end of 2022, as the employees ascribed to the plan reach 60 years of age.
The Company has conducted an actuarial calculation of the obligations derived from the approved pre-retirement plan, including 183 workers and amounting to EUR 26,016 thousand. This amount has been recognised this year under the item "personnel expenses" of the consolidated income statement. To determine the actuarial valuation, the discount rate used has been of 0%. Considering that the financial duration of the payments valued is of 2.9 years, the discount rate obtained over the 3-year term of the highest credit quality corporate debt (AA) curve would be of -0.072%. Facing such negative rate, the discount rate chosen to be used was of 0.00%. No mortality discount has been considered due to the characteristics of the commitments, as in the event of the death of the employee, the payments due would in any case be collected, either by the beneficiaries of the employee, or recovered by Acerinox.
The Group has proceeded in January 2020 to externalise the commitments with an assurance company, with the payment made being equivalent to the amount registered during such year.
The company has also provisioned EUR 9,254 thousand, corresponding to the contribution to Treasury established in Additional Provision Sixteen of Law 27/2011, pursuant to Royal Decree 1484/2012, accrued upon the presence of certain workers with over 50 years of age. This contribution would be subject to liquidation by the relevant Administration in accordance with the aforesaid regulations. This provision is contained in other provisions which are set out in detail in note 16.2
Therefore, the aggregate cost of the collective discharge is EUR 38.1 million, to be amortised over approximately 3.5 years (including the calculation of the contribution to Treasury and using as reference year that in which the workers would have reached 64 years of age).
The savings obtained from the collective discharge would be increased by the savings derived from the policy of non coverage of vacancies due to retirement, implemented from the month of May until the approval of the employment regulation file, which has implied the amortisation of another 31 work posts.
In addition, there are obligations under from certain retirement contractual covenants agreed with senior management in the amount of 13.1 million euros (11.5 million euros in 2018). In 2019 and 2018, these obligations were properly insured in both 2018 and 2017, and their estimated amount covered by cash flows arising from the insurance policies contracted. As a result, no liability in this connection is recognised.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value are detailed below:

Mortality table CPI Wage growth Social Security growth Retirement age Accrual accounting method

PERM / F2000 P 1.5% 1.5% 1.5%
65 years Projected Unit Credit

Post-employment obligations reflect post-retirement medical care plans provided by Columbus Stainless to specified plan members. No new members have joined the plan. The Company performs actuarial valuations of the obligations every two years. The most recent valuation was performed in 2017. The assumptions used were: discount rate of 9.5%; inflation of medical services 6.75%. The opening balance for the period reconciles with the closing balance as follows:

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The discount rates applied are based on expected growth rates of health insurance. Any change in such fees may have an impact in the recognised obligations or in comprehensive income. An increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would increase the obligation by 1.3 million euros (1.6 in 2018). In contrast, a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate would reduce the obligation by 1.2 million euros in 2019 (1.1 in 2018).

16.1.3 Share-based payment transactions
The Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. held on 22 March 2018 approved a multi-year remuneration plan, or long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which will allow the executive board member and senior managers of the Acerinox Group to receive part of their variable remuneration in shares in Acerinox, S.A. The target amount is 30-50% of their base salary, subject to a personal limit of 200% of the respective target. This plan was subsequently submitted to the Acerinox Shareholders' Meeting held on 10 May 2018, which approved the Plan.
The approved LTIP features three three-year cycles. The First Cycle of the Plan extends from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. The Second Cycle starts on 1 January 2019 and ends on 31 December 2021 and the Third Cycle starts on 1 January 2020 and end on 31 December 2022.
On 1 January 2019, the second cycle of the pluri-annual compensation plan has started, which has a duration of three years.
Under the remuneration plan, employees receive shares of the parent company at the end of each cycle ("Performance Shares"). Delivery of the shares and the number to be delivered are conditional on certain vesting requirements, relating to the employee remaining in service and attaining certain individual corporate objectives.
The Group presumes that the services are to be provided over the irrevocability or vesting period as consideration for the future delivery of the shares. Accordingly, the services rendered are reported on a straight line basis over the period in which the rights to receive those shares become irrevocable.
The Group measures the assets or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at fair value, on the date of the concession agreement for the equity instruments to be awarded.
When calculating this theoretical number of shares, the shares of Acerinox, S.A. will be measured at their quoted price 30 trading days prior to the start of the plan. The resulting number of Performance Shares will be used as the basis for determining the effective number of shares in Acerinox, S.A. to be delivered (if any) on reaching the end of each cycle, depending on attainment with objectives and subject also to compliance with the requirements set out in the regulations governing each plan.
For the calculation of the part of the percentage of objectives achieved, subject to market conditions, an independent expert has been contracted, which using accepted valuation techniques (Montecarlo Method) has calculated the reasonable percentage of shares attributable to each employee subject to the compensation plan. According to such valuation, the number of shares to be delivered in the performance of each of the plan cycles shall be of 78,853 shares, representing at the end of the 3 cycles 0.08% of the capital of Acerinox, S.A.
The expense accrued during this year amounts to EUR 861 thousand (EUR 613 thousand in 2018). The aggregate amount recognised at the end of the year in the item "other net equity instruments" on the balance sheet amounts to EUR 1,446 thousand (EUR 601 thousand last year).

These are provisions for C02 emissions during the year for which the emission allowances have not yet been surrendered at the year end (see note 11.1).

174

Applications for the year are mainly due to the derecognition of emission allowances for 2019, totalling 1,852 thousand euros (1,906 thousand euros in 2018) (see note 11.1). Litigation At the end of 2018, the Group was involved in litigation with the Italian tax authorities concerning transfer pricing adjustments, which are explained in detail in note 19.5. Acting upon the opinion of the experts, the Group had provisioned 7.8 million euros for this item at the end of last year. On 1 January 2019, the Group reclassified this provision, as required by IFRIC-23, from non-current provisions in the balance sheet to deferred tax liabilities since it is a tax payable that is not expected to be settled in the short term. This reclassification was made without changing the comparative data of the previous year. At year-end and following the mutual agreement reached between the Spanish and Italian authorities explained in note 19.5, this provision amounts to 11.2 million euros. Other provisions Other provisions fundamentally cover the valuation by Acerinox Europa, S.A.U of the obligations stemming from the labour force adjustment plan executed this year and those related to the contribution to the Treasury as set forth in Additional Provision Sixteen of Law 27/2011, with regard to Royal Decree 1484/2012. The amount of this obligation, as verified by an independent expert, totals 9.254 thousand euros. When calculating the provision, the characteristics of the employees included in the adjustment plan were considered, together with compliance with the legal requisites and applicable percentages. Note 16.1.2 sets out the details of this labour force adjustment plan. Inoxcenter, S.L.U has also recorded a provision for this item based on the labour force adjustment plan executed in 2013, which totals 386 thousand euros.
16,3 Guarantees provided
At 31 December 2019 the Group has provided guarantees to third parties, mainly government bodies, totalling 18 million euros (23 million euros in 2018). This amount includes the guarantees provided to the Italian tax authorities for the amount of 2.6 million euros, as a result of the assessments arising from inspections that are explained in note 19.5. In addition, guarantees were provided in the amount of 3.7 million euros this year to the Ministry of Industry for loans obtained under the financial support programme for industrial investment within the framework of the public policy for reindustrialisation and strengthening of industrial competitiveness (REINDUS), as explained in note 8. Also this year, following re-evaluations of the authorisations, simplifications and waivers of the Customs Authorities, we have been allowed to reduce the amount of guarantees deposited from 11.2 million euros to 2.5 million euros. Group management does not expect any significant liabilities to arise from these guarantees.
16,4 Contingencies
The company Gas Natural Comercializadora, S.A requested that declaratory proceedings be opened against the Group companies Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A. and Inoxfil, S.A. for an alleged breach of the natural gas supply contracts and requested the payment of the compensation due to unilateral termination, as agreed in these contracts, totalling 8.2 million euros. Gas Natural Comercializadora S.A. submitted a bid in the supply service tender held by Acerinox during 2016 and 2017, but a different company was selected. The claim was resolved in the first instance by means of a judgment dated 18 June of this year rejecting the claim filed by Gas Natural in its entirety, with costs being imposed on the claimant. Subsequently, the Group reached an agreement with the aforementioned company Gas Natural whereby the latter paid the Group a certain amount of costs and undertook not to bring an appeal, making the decision final and the procedure has been definitively dismissed.

This figure includes 138 employees that have taken partial retirement (180 in 2018).

At 31 December 2019 the number of employees in Spain with a disability of at least 33% is 54 (51 male and 3 female) (61 in 2018; 57 male and 4 female).

The decrease in the number of Group employees is mainly due to the decrease in Acerinox Europe's workforce caused by the non-renewal of temporary contracts, the non-replacement through replacement contracts of workers in partial retirement, and the approved workforce restructuring plan, which led to the departure of 32 employees in December. The other workers assigned to the plan will leave the company as they reach the early retirement age set out in the plan.

All the Spanish companies are compliant with the provisions of the General Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and their Social Inclusion, with the exception of Acerinox Europa, S.A.U. whose rates have been affected at the end of the financial year due to the death of one worker and the retirement of another. Work is underway to achieve compliance with the Law.

On November 22, Acerinox Europe's management and the legal representatives of the plant's workers signed the new collective bargaining agreement for a period of four years, which includes a salary increase of 2% per year. The new agreement also establishes, among other measures, social policies for employees aimed at fostering a balance between work and family life, as well as new advantages to proote the training of employees' children.

Interest income mainly derives from term deposits by the Group (note 12). Also, 2,205 thousand euros were recorded in 2018 for tax refunds obtained in both Spain and Germany as a result of the mutual agreements reached between the two countries, which are explained in note 19.5.

Finance costs mainly reflect interest accrued on loans and borrowings and bonds issued, which are explained in note 12.2.3.

Lastly, income from translation differences arise in the Group's trade, financial operations and investments. The Group hedges with derivative financial instruments a majority of the transactions carried out in a currency other than the functional currency of a country. Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates would be offset by a contrary change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. The differences between the two amounts are mainly due to the interest rate differentials between the currencies involved in the exchange rate insurance contracted.

NOTE 19 TAXATION

19.1Legislative amendments
The most significant tax changes affecting the Group during the year are as follows:
-On 27 November of this year, the Protocol Amending the Convention between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation of 1990 entered into force. The protocol amends several articles of the existing Convention, including the one referring to withholding taxes on dividends and interest, so that dividends will not be subject to taxation at source when the parent company holds at least 80% of the voting shares during the previous twelve months, and a series of requirements are also established for the application of this exemption, which the Group meets. As mentioned in note 3, this enabled the Group to reverse the deferred tax liability of 25 million euros that the Group had recognised at 31 December 2018. In December, Acerinox, S.A. received a tax-free dividend of USD 770 million from North American Stainless Inc (EUR 701 million).
-In this year, an amendment to the corporate income tax, applicable from 2020, has been approved in Malaysia, which establishes a limitation on the deductibility of interest from Group companies of 20% of taxable EBITDA. Any interest not deducted in a year may be used in future years, with no limit on the number of years. This is therefore a temporary difference that will generate a deferred tax asset, thus reducing taxable losses. This measure, therefore, has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

178

As far as 2018 is concerned:
-United States: a modification in the state tax of Kentucky, the state in which one of the Group's main subsidiaries, North American Stainless, is located. The main change was a lower tax rate of 5% (down from 6%) and the change made to the factor used to determine the tax base attributable to the State. This measure led to an additional reduction in deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, which has resulted in income of 3,769 thousand euros in 2018 tax, but at the same time, it brought about a reduction in the tax credits capitalised by North American Stainless derived from the tax credits established in this state and explained in note 19.3.2. The impact of this credit reduction amounted to 8,683 thousand euros.
-Spain: A number of changes were approved in 2018 in relation to local corporate income tax law for the regions of Álava, Biscay and Guipúzcoa. The main changes affecting the Group are a reduction in the tax rate from 28% to 26% applicable in 2018 and then 24% starting 2019. The Group recognised in 2018 the impact the rate reduction would have on its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since the Group companies based on those regions have capitalised tax credits, the change had a negative impact on their earnings. The Group recognised an associated expense of 497 thousand euros. The changes included restrictions on the recovery of prior years' tax losses, which are now limited to 50% of the positive tax base generated in the year, while extending the recovery period to 30 years. Despite this limitation, the Group, as explained in note 19.3.3 is confident that it will continue to recover prior years' tax losses within a period of 10 years.
- Malaysia: for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, the main amendment adopted is the time limit on the application of tax loss carryforwards. This limitation is established for a period of 7 years from 1 January 2019. The limitation does not apply to investment tax deductions or to unused temporary differences arising from different accounting and tax depreciation criteria. However, the Group has 296 million euros of unrecovered tax losses in that country, the associated tax credits are not capitalised and, therefore, the Group has not had to recognise any impairment arising from this limitation. Furthermore, Bahru Stainless has tax credits for investments made in the country between 2009 and 2014 amounting to 1,806 million Malaysian Ringgits (393 million euros) which can continue to be applied without limit, as well as unused temporary differences, as a result of the different accounting and tax depreciation criteria (capital allowances) amounting to 390 million euros.
-France: A progressive reduction of taxes has been approved for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The general rate applicable until that year was 33.33%. The reform establishes that for tax benefits not exceeding 500,000 euros (after deduction of tax losses) the applicable rate would be 28% in 2018 (33.33% for the excess), 31% for the excess in 2019, 28% in 2020 for all results generated, 26.5% in 2021 and 25% from 2022. The Group has tax credits in this country and updated them in accordance with the new rates. The negative impact recognised in the income statement for last year amounted to 1,207 thousand euros.
-Sweden: A reduction in the applicable tax rate from the current 22% to 21.4% by 2019 and 20.6% from 2020 has been approved. The Group has tax credits in this country and updated them in accordance with the new rates. The negative impact recognised in the income statement for last year amounted to 255 thousand euros.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

As of 27 November, following the approval of the protocol modifying the double taxation convention between Spain and the United States, the Group no longer supports withholdings on the dividends repatriated by its United States subsidiary North American Stainless, leading the Group to reverse the deferred tax liability recognised in prior years in the amount of EUR 25 million, corresponding to investments in subsidiaries. Note 19.3.1 explains the reasons for the reversal in detail.

The parent company has received dividends from its subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 835 million (17.2 million in 2018), 701 million of which have been exempt of taxation.

Regarding withholdings for the payment of interest, these are deductible on the income tax as a result of the application of the double taxation conventions and reduce the income tax expense.

Several factors have negatively affected tax expense this year:

·Firstly, the impairment of tax credits recognised by the Group amounting to 60,987 thousand euros, which is explained in note 19.3.3. Although most of the tax credits capitalised can be applied for tax purposes without any time limitation, the accounting standard only allows for the capitalisation of those that are expected to be recovered within a reasonable period. The Group deems a period of 10 years to be reasonable.

·Non-deductible expenses include impairment of goodwill and fixed assets, which are not deductible for tax purposes until the related assets are liquidated or realised. Although this is a temporary difference, the Group does not recognise any deferred tax assets in this connection, since it is not known when the difference will reverse, which is why it has had a negative effect on tax expense for the year.

·The Group has not recognised tax credits in subsidiaries with losses where it does not expect to recover them within a reasonable period. This resulted in an expense in the year of 17,372 thousand euros

The tax incentives not recognised in the income statement mainly relate to tax credits for R&D&I activities and tax credits for the elimination of double taxation.

The impacts of the mutual agreements reached between the Spanish and Italian authorities as a result of the open tax inspections, which had a neutral impact on the Group in the year, were recognised in the year. The details of these agreements are explained in note 19.5.

In 2018, deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted to bring them into line with the new applicable tax rates, as explained in note 18.1. The combined impact of these adjustments led to higher expenditure of 6.8 million euros. At the same time, the impact of the agreements reached as a result of the tax inspections completed during the year were recognised, which together amounted to 1.3 million euros in income tax. The details of these settings are explained in note 18.5.

Most of the deferred taxes have a reversal period of more than one year.
As laid down in the income tax measurement criteria (note 2.20), the Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so, the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis.
Notable this year is the increase in deferred tax assets arising from employee benefit plans. This increase is due to the non-deductibility in this year of the provision for obligations arising from the Acerinox Europe workforce restructuring plan. This expense is not tax deductible until the obligations are settled, which will occur as the employees assigned to the Plan reach the retirement age established in the Plan.

181

Consolidated Annual Accounts

This year the Group was able to deduct for tax purposes the financial expenses not deducted in previous years as a result of the limitations established in certain legislation, which prevent the deduction of financial charges when they exceed a certain percentage of the adjusted operating income. This year, the operating income of the Spanish tax group allowed for the deductibility of these expenses owing to the repatriation of dividends by the parent company.
Lastly, deferred tax assets arising from unused tax loss carryforwards decreased due to the impairment of 60,987 thousand euros recorded in the year. However, the Group has recognised deferred tax assets in certain countries where there were sufficient liabilities to offset them or their recoverability was justifiable. Note 19.3.3 details the analysis of recoverability made by the Group.

19.3.1 Deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities recognised in property, plant and equipment are mainly due to the different tax and accounting depreciation criteria permitted by legislation in force in certain countries. These liabilities essentially relate to North American Stainless, Inc. and Columbus Stainless, Ltd.
As regards deferred tax liabilities arising from investments in subsidiaries, as explained in the section on regulatory changes, on 27 November this year the Protocol amending the 1990 Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America to avoid double taxation came into force. The protocol amends several articles of the existing Convention, including the one referring to withholding taxes on dividends and interest, so that dividends will not be subject to taxation at source when the parent company holds at least 80% of the voting shares during the previous twelve months, and a series of requirements are also established for the application of this exemption, which the Group meets. This has allowed the Group to reverse the deferred tax liability of 25 million euros which the Group had recognised at 31 December 2018 for the possible repatriation of reserves from the Group company in the United States, North American Stainless.
Following the approval of the protocol amending the agreement between Spain and the United States, there are hardly any companies in the consolidated group that have significant distributable reserves that will be subject to taxation in the event of their distribution. The Group recognises the tax effect in this connection only when it considers that the distribution of these reserves in the form of dividends will be necessary in the foreseeable future, which will mean the reversal of the temporary difference.
Although the Group does not have a general policy of distributing dividends from subsidiaries to the parent company, every year the Group analyses the net worth of all its subsidiaries, also taking into account existing taxes, in order to determine the advisability of repatriation of reserves through the distribution of dividends.
In April of this year, the parent company received dividends from the Group company North American Stainless amounting to 134 million euros. Since these dividends were distributed prior to the approval of the protocol, they were subject to a 10% withholding tax in the country of origin, which the Group offset by reversing the temporary difference. At year-end, the remaining amount of 11.6 million was reversed, since the withholding tax on dividends for the Group had been eliminated.

19.3.2 Deferred tax assets At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the Group has unused tax credits from tax losses available as follows:

Not all the tax credits shown in the table have been capitalised by the Group, Capitalised tax credits amounted to 84,494 thousand euros in 2019 (123,536 thousand euros in 2018).

The distribution by country of these capitalised tax credits is detailed below:

2018 106,363
3,443 8,293 3,751 1,043
391 252 123,536

For this fiscal year, the caitalised tax assets have decreased mainly due to the accounting impairment recorded by the Group, which is explained in the following note.

The reduction in tax credits in Italy also arises from the mutual agreements reached between Spain and Italy.

Comparing the two tables above, there exist non-capitalised tax credits in the Group in the amount of 143,291 thousand euros, equivalent to tax losses of 595 million euros, which have not been recognised as they did not meet the necessary criteria (74,764 of non-activated tax credits in 2018 equivalent to losses of 319 million euros). From these amounts, 78,209 thousand euros has a recovery period of 7 years, and the rest have an unlimited recovery period.

The Group also has assets for temporary differences not recognised for accounting purposes amounting to 133.8 million euros (48.3 million euros in the previous year), arising from the impairment charges for Acerinox, S.A.'s investments in some of its investees, and the impairment of assets in the current year, which are not deductible until the assets generating the corresponding temporary difference are realised or liquidated.

On 22 June 2015, the Group company Bahru Stainless received confirmation from the Malaysian Ministry of Economy of approval of fiscal aid in respect of investments made in the country from 2009 to 2014. This aid consists of income tax deductions for an amount equal to the investments made in certain items of property, plant and equipment, which amount to 1,806 million Malaysian ringgits (393 million euros). As with tax credits for accumulated losses, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset as it cannot yet estimate its recoverability. At the same time, the Company also has temporary unused differences, as a result of the different criteria for accounting and tax amortisation ("capital allowances") for 390 million euros. These temporary differences have an unlimited utilisation period. Both aids will allow Bahru, not to pay taxes, once it generates tax profits, even considering the limitation introduced to compensate tax losses.

The Group company North American Stainless also has tax credits for investments in assets that contribute to recycling. These credits are deducted from the calculation of the Kentucky state tax and amounted to 520 million euros at the year end. Of all the tax credits, 13 million euros expire in 2020, 21.5 million euros expire in 2028 and the rest are unlimited. Application of these credits is limited to 50% of the tax payable in the state of Kentucky, or an amount of USD 2.5 million/year. The Group only recognises a deferred tax asset for investment tax credits that expire and relate to a specific credit programme approved in 2005 by the state of Kentucky (Major Credits Program). With the 10-year projections made at the close of 2018, the Group estimated that it could use an amount of 5 million euros, which the Group had recognised as deferred tax assets. At the end of this year, the amount recognised as a deferred tax asset amounts to 3.9 million euros.

Deferred tax assets deriving from deductions pending utilisation and that come to 16,737 thousand euros (13,304 thousand euros in 2018) correspond mainly to the Spanish tax group, except for the 3.9 million euros mentioned above for North American Stainless and 460 thousand euros for Columbus, generated this year. The Group has also taken these deductions into consideration when making the recoverability analyses.

19.3.3 Analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets

As stated in the accounting policies, the Group recognises deferred tax assets in the balance sheet, if and when these are recoverable within a reasonable period, also considering legally established limitations on their use. The Group considers a period of approximately 10 years as reasonable if allowed by tax legislation.

To assess the recoverability of tax credits pending compensation, the Group prepares a budget of 5-10 years for each of the companies with capitalised tax credits, and makes the tax adjustments necessary to determine tax bases. The Group also takes into account the limitations on compensation of tax bases established in the respective jurisdictions. The Group also assesses the existence of deferred tax liabilities against which tax losses may be offset in the future.

In the preparation of budgets, the Group takes into account the financial and macroeconomic circumstances and those of the stainless steel market itself, adapted to the operating environment of each entity. Parameters such as expected growth, use of installed production capacity, prices, etc. are therefore projected on the basis of the forecasts and reports of independent experts, as well as historical figures and the targets set by management. Key assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values at the time of the analysis.

183

Consolidated Annual Accounts
As explained above, at the year end, Acerinox Group entities recording capitalised tax credits on its financial statements are the Spanish entities as well as the South African company Columbus Stainless.
·In the case of the Spanish entities, tax credits refers mainly to the tax consolidated Group in Spain, which comprises all Spanish Group companies with the exception of those established in the regions of Alava, Vizcaya or Guipuzcoa. Tax credits derived from tax losses amount to 125 million euros. The tax credits capitalised were the result of the crisis years and the Group has been reducing these credits since 2013. However due to negative market evolution, especially in Europe and the unprecedented drop in prices resulting from the rise in imports, during this year some of the Spanish companies showed negative results for the Group. In addition dividends of 835 million euros repatriated by the head company during the year allowed the deduction of carry-over financing costs from previous years, representing a decrease in the tax bases for the year. As a result tax credits in this year increased by 15 million euros. On the other hand, the mutual agreement procedures reached between the Spanish and Italian Tax Authorities, which completely eliminate double taxation reducing the initial proposed adjustments, imposed in Italy, have also increased net operating losses in Spain, and consequently deferred tax assets in 6 million. These also rose in fiscal 2018 by 3.8 million euros as a result of the Mutual Agreement procedures reached between the Spanish and German Tax Authorities.
It is important to note that the use of negative tax bases is significantly limited in Spain. In the case of the Spanish tax Group, only 25% of positive tax bases generated in one year can be used to set off losses from previous years. In the case of companies subject to provincial systems, the limitation is 50%.
Market uncertainties due to inefficient protection measures and the delay in their recovery has caused a decrease in estimated growth for future years. The Group has taken into account all these circumstances, and all the corrections of the macroeconomic forecasts, in preparing the 5-year budgets.
The key assumptions of the budgets prepared during this year provide for a slight increase in demand in Europe in 2020 and a larger growth starting in 2021, as determined by the estimates of the ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum) and SMR (Steel Metals and Market Research) in their last review of November. As for prices, sources such as CRU project these will decrease in 2020 to once again rise beginning in 2021. Efficiency plans set in operation by the Group and the reduction of fixed costs as a result of the staff regularisation carried out this year were other factors considered in the budget preparation. With all of these considerations, projections for future years hold for positive operating margins, although well below 2018 estimates.
In view of all of the above, the 5 year budgets prepared by the Management and extrapolated at 10 years considering the estimated yields and historic margins justify only the recovery of 64 million euros over the next 10 years and all deductions pending use. Consequently the Group has proceeded to reduce 61 million this year, recognising an expense under "income taxes" of the consolidated income statement.
Since the recoverability of those tax credits is fiscally unlimited in time, if circumstances were to revert in a future year and if budgets allow justifying the recovery of assets in a reasonable period, then the Group could once again proceed to recognise those deferred tax assets.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on those estimates to determine the risk that a change in the assumptions may determine an impairment of an additional amount of those deferred tax assets. Evidently in this year, with tax credit impaired to the limit of estimates, any breach of lowered budgets would cause an additional reduction in tax credits. Within the scenarios of the possible 10 year projections the Group has determined the one considered the most reasonable based on historic factors. If projected income for next 10 years decreases by 10%, then the capitalised tax credits would be recovered at 11 years, instead of 10.
·In the case of Columbus, capitalised tax credits are generated in this year. The company has deferred tax liabilities sufficient to compensate the above assets. These liabilities derive from the different accounting and tax management of amortizations, and therefore revert on a yearly basis. In addition, there are no quantitative or time limitations on the use of tax losses in South Africa. As explained in Note 7.1, Columbus's results for this year were also adversely affected by exceptional circumstances such as the lack of gas supply and problems in starting up certain improvements made to some of the machines. The Group does not expect these events to be carried forward to future years. Estimated results for a 5 year period amply justify the capitalisation of tax credits generated this year.
·With respect to the remaining European companies, capitalised tax credits were the result of the crisis years and since 2013 the amount has been reduced through their use. Transfer price policies adopted by the Group to remunerate and characterise transactions with distributor companies make any losses from those companies difficult. The Group has analysed the recoverability of those tax credits and concluded that based on the estimated results (in line with those obtained during the last 6 years) and given the absence of any limitations, either quantitative or temporal, in those countries, the Group foresees these will be recoverable within a reasonable period never more than 10 years. The existence of a Bilateral Price Agreement with similar companies and different friendly agreements reached in different countries make any significant differences in these companies results from forecasts, therefore no change is predicted in the conclusions reached
184

19.4 Current tax
At 31 December 2019 the Group has a current tax asset of Euros 40,094 thousand (Euros 19,093 thousand in 2018) and a current tax liability of Euros 27,582 thousand (Euros 23,576 thousand in 2018).
The asset balance contains the interim payment of income tax in Spain 29,360 thousand euros as a result of the minimum payment of 23% of the income generated in the period, which included a dividend of 134 million euros received by the parent company. The Group will recover this amount when it submits from July 2020 its corporate income tax return for the year.

19.5 Tax inspections and years open to inspection
19.5.1 Tax inspection
Developments in 2019
· The most significant advance this year was the completion of the mutual agreement procedures between Spain and Italy for the years 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013, which allowed the complete elimination of double taxation between those countries. Initial adjustments for transfer pricing proposed by the Italian authorities, referring to transactions with Spanish companies, were reduced by 51% and were completely accepted by Spain. This represented a return of 5.8 million euros in Spain for taxes paid and the recognition of tax credits in the amount of 5.9 million euros which the Spanish companies affected proceeded to recognise as income this year. The Group is in negotiations with the Italian authorities to extend the agreements to transactions with other related non Spanish companies. Currently there other other Mutual Agreement Procedures presented both in Italy and South Africa to eliminate double taxation. Italian law prevents the execution of the agreement with Spain while others are open, which is the current case. The Group has written off capitalised tax credits in Italy in the amount of 8.3 million euros and increased the provision funded at the en of 2018 by an additional 3.4 million euros; consequently at the year end the provision came to 11.2 million euros

·At the same time and after the signature of the Mutual Agreement Procedure new assessments corresponding to fiscal year 2014 were received in Italy which resulted in taxable income adjustments of 2.3 million, relating to transfer prices and an additional taxable income adjustment of 512 thousand Euros for a provision that the authorities consider as non-deductible in this year creating a temporary difference that is deductible in subsequent years. Payable tax amounts to 954 thousand euros.

The Group is currently in negotiations with the Italian Authorities to extend the Agreements reached via Mutual Agreements Proceedures to the adjustments proposed in the above-mentioned assessment, which should eliminate them in their entirety. If no agreement is reached, the same process would be initiated: the lodging of appeals in Italy, a petition for suspension of the debt and the requests for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Italy.

Since all transfer price adjustments initially imposed with Spain have been eliminated for the years 2011 to 2013, the Group does not consider it necessary to form a reserve in any amount.

·In Malaysia, on 22 January, notification was received from the tax authorities of the completion of the inspection for the years 2010 to 2013, with no adjustments. This inspection began in January 2015.

·In Spain, at the reporting date, the verification and investigation inspection activities in the companies Acerinox, S.A, Acerinox Europa, S.A.U, Inoxcenter, S.L.U and Roldan, S.A. initiated in 2018 have been completed, with no significant adjustments.

The situation with regard to each of the tax inspections that are underway or which have concluded but are being disputed and appealed against at the end of 2019 is detailed below:

On 17 October 2018, notification was received of the commencement of verification and investigation inspections in the companies Acerinox, S.A. Acerinox Europa, Inoxcenter and Roldan of the following taxes and periods:

185

Consolidated Annual Accounts
At the end of the year, the procedures were virtually complete and resulted in no significant adjustments.
On 12 February 2020, Acerinox Europe, Inoxcenter and Roldan signed in acceptance of all the taxes. Signatures on the assessments of the parent company are pending, but will also be signed in acceptance.
On 22 March 2019, notification was received from the tax agency of the commencement of inspection proceedings relating to import duties, import VAT and antidumping for fiscal year 2017 in Acerinox Europa, S.A.U. (Acerinox Europa, S.A.U.). The certificates were signed on 18 July, bringing the procedure to an end.
On 7 January 2016, the Central Economic-Administrative Tribunal issued a ruling upholding in full the submissions filed by Acerinox, S.A. against the assessment decisions arising from the inspection of rights, anti-dumping and VAT for 2009, 2010 and 2011. On 27 April of the same year, agreements to enforce the rulings were received for the amounts of 925 thousand euros in respect of anti-dumping, which had previously been guaranteed, 649 thousand euros for VAT on imports (which had been deducted by Acerinox at the time) and 41 thousand euros in respect of payable external tariffs. The Company filed an appeal against the assessment decisions, contesting the interest calculation. Also, 61 thousand euros relating to guarantee expenses were recovered. On 26 September 2018, notice was received of the payment of 10 thousand euros of additional interest, which end the procedure.
Italy In 2011 the subsidiary Acerinox Italia S.r.l. underwent an inspection of taxes for 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Between 2012 and 2014 the assessment notices for the three years were received, primarily indicating transfer pricing adjustments in relation to sale and purchase transactions between the Company and the Group's factories. The resulting payable tax amounted to 16 million euros, plus 3.5 million euros in interest. No penalties were imposed.
Subsequently, in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and with no prior notice of the commencement of audit work, the Company received transfer price certificates for 2011, 2012 and 2013, with automatic application of criteria similar to those used in the previous audits. These resulted in taxable income adjustments of 4.3 million euros in 2011, 4.9 million euros in 2012 and 3 million euros in 2013 and amounts payable of 1.5 million, 1.6 million and 1 million euros respectively. No penalties were imposed. For all these, the Group lodged appeals with the Milan Provincial Tax Commission within the respective time limits, requesting at the same time the suspension of the debts until the end of the procedures and, in addition, the request was lodged for the elimination of double taxation on the basis of Convention EEC/90/436 of 23 July 1990 with the Spanish and Italian authorities. The Group has presented guarantees of 1.3 million euros to cover stays on the debts in Italy. In addition, in December 2018, the request for the elimination of double taxation with South Africa was presented in Italy for the procedures opened for the years 2011 to 2013.
At the end of 2018, and in view of the agreements that had been reached concerning Germany, and which are explained in the following section, the Group, also based on the opinion of the independent experts that advise it in these proceedings, considered that it was likely that after the negotiation of the agreements, some amount to be settled with the Italian tax authorities would result. Therefore, mainly as a result of the differences in tax rates between the two countries and the transfer pricing adjustments for transactions with third countries, the Group considered it necessary to make a provision of EUR 7.8 million, corresponding to the maximum risk that would result from the proposed adjustments and relating to the years 2007 to 2013.
As explained in note 3.1 and in note 16.2 to these financial statements, the Group reclassified this amount from non-current provisions in the balance sheet to deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with the new IFRIC 23 standard, which will be mandatory from 1 January 2019.
As noted in the advances of 2019, this year saw the completion of the mutual agreements between Spain and Italy for the years 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013, which have allowed for the complete elimination of double taxation between the two countries. The initial transfer pricing adjustments proposed by the Italian authorities, which amounted to 84 million euros in taxable income, have been reduced following the agreements to 41 million euros and have been fully accepted by Spain. This entails the refund in Spain of 5.8 million euros of tax paid and the recognition of tax credits amounting to 5.9 million euros, which the Group has recognised as income in this year. In Italy, all negative tax bases were eliminated after the agreements. The Group has consequently written off activated tax credits in the amount of 8.3 million euros.
Although the agreement reaches only transactions between the Italian company and the respective mills in Spain, the same Agreement should technical transfer to cover transactions with third countries. The Group is currently in conversations with the Italian authorities to transfer the finally accepted treatment in the mutual agreement to the adjustments with third countries. Likewise, the Group maintains a mutual Agreement both in Italy and South Africa for the elimination of double taxation between both countries. It is expected that the execution of the agreements in Italy will be delayed.
In view of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of these agreements, the Group, based on the opinion of the experts advising it in this area, recognised a provision in this year equivalent to the amount that would be payable in Italy if the treatment agreed by the Italian and Spanish authorities were applied to all the adjustments. This amounts to 11.2 million euros, and includes payable tax and late-payment interest, which means an increase in the provision, and consequently and expense recognition of 3.4 million euros in 2019.
The Group has also submitted arguments against the execution of the agreements, since it has not recognised late payment interest for the repayable amount of 5.9 million euros.
186

At the same time and after the signature of the Mutual Agreement Procedure new assessments corresponding to fiscal year 2014 were received in Italy which resulted in taxable income adjustments of 2.3 million, relating to transfer prices and an additional taxable income adjustment of 512 thousand Euros for a provision that the authorities consider as non-deductible in this year creating a temporary difference that is deductible in subsequent years. Payable tax amounts to 954 thousand euros.
The Group is currently in negotiations with the Italian Authorities to extend the Agreements reached via Mutual Agreements Proceedures to the adjustments proposed in the above-mentioned assessment, which should eliminate them in their entirety. If no agreement is reached, the same process would be initiated: the lodging of appeals in Italy, a petition for suspension of the debt and the requests for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Italy.
Since all transfer price adjustments initially imposed with Spain have been eliminated for the years 2011 to 2013, the Group does not consider it necessary to form a reserve in any amount.
Malaysia On 20 January 2015 notification was received of the commencement of an inspection of the company Acerinox SC Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. related to transfer pricing for the years 2010 to 2013. On 22 January of this year, notification was received from the tax authorities of the completion of the inspection for the years 2010 to 2013, with no adjustments. This inspection began in January 2015.
In the case of Bahru Stainless, on 24 and 28 December 2014, notifications were received of the commencement of inspection proceedings for 2010 and 2011. Subsequently, on 4 March 2015, an extension of the inspection procedure to the years 2012 and 2013 was notified. To date, all the requested information has been submitted. On 23 February 2017, notification was received of the resumption of the tax inspections for the years 2010-2014, without there having been any request for additional information since then.
Germany As regards the tax inspections for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 that were initiated in 2011 at the Group subsidiary Acerinox Deutschland, Gmbh, the assessments of the income tax, solidarity surcharge and VAT were received on 8 July 2014. The assessments primarily indicated transfer pricing adjustments to the tax base totalling 58.8 million euros for sale and purchase transactions between the subsidiary and the Group's manufacturing companies. No penalties were imposed. The company filed the pertinent submissions on 8 August 2014.
The amount payable in Germany, as a result of the assessments, was 2,804 thousand euros for income tax plus the solidarity surcharge and 489 thousand euros in interest. All negative tax loss carryforwards yet to be offset were also eliminated. These amounts were paid in 2014. Subsequently, since the adjustments arising from the assessments eliminated all existing tax loss carryforwards, the authorities have claimed taxes on the results generated in all subsequent years. The total amounts paid amount to 8.8 million euros which were recognised in Germany as accounts receivable as they were considered likely to be recovered following the request for elimination of double taxation.
In November 2015 requests were submitted for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Germany. Any adjustment relating to transfer prices for transactions completed with companies resident in Spain is protected by Convention 90/436/EEC on the elimination of double taxation.
On 5 October 2017, we were informed of the finalisation of the mutual agreement procedure and the agreements reached for the years 2007-2010. These agreements entailed a 40% reduction in adjustments relating to transactions between Spain and the German subsidiary. The tax recovered in Spain in 2018, as a consequence of the agreements, amounted to 3.8 million euros, plus 1.4 million euros in interest, all of which was recognised as income. The Group also recognised a total of 3.7 million euros in tax credits recoverable in Spain. As regards Germany, notices of execution of the agreements reached with Spain were received, but without applying the same criteria to transactions with third countries, resulting in a recovery in Germany of 6.4 million euros, which had previously been recognised as an account receivable.
In a meeting with the German tax authorities on 10 December 2018, it was agreed to transfer the agreements reached with Spain in the MAP to transactions with third countries, leading to an additional reduction in adjustments of 1.6 million euros in Germany. The Group estimated that it would recover an additional 2 million euros after these agreements. Receipt of the execution of these agreements is pending. The Group has recognized the account receivable in its financial statements.
On the other hand, on 29 November 2016, notification was given of the commencement of tax inspections for the years 2011-2014. The authorities decided to postpone their proceedings on transfer prices until the proposed mutual agreement has been settled. Following the meeting held in December, it was agreed to close these years without making any additional adjustments.
A bilateral pricing agreement was signed in 2018 between Spain and Germany, covering the period running from 2013 to 2021. If offers the Group complete certainty in relation to the transfer price policy it is to apply to purchase and sale transactions between the Spanish factories and the German subsidiary, thus eliminating transfer price risks with Germany. Under this agreement, the Grupo had to present additional tax returns in Spain for 2013 to 2016, in which it has increased its tax bases by 1.2 million euros. These adjustments generated an additional 124 thousand euros payable in taxes. Meanwhile, the German authorities made the same adjustment, but this time to lower the tax bases declared in the country. As a result, a total of 498 thousand euros in taxes was repaid in Germany.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Portugal
In the year 2011, tax inspections were conducted in the Group company Acerol Ltda., in Portugal, on taxes for the years 2007 and 2008. They resulted in a transfer pricing adjustment for sale and purchase transactions between the company Acerol, Ltda and Group companies, primarily Acerinox, S.A. and Roldán, S.A in Spain. The adjustment to taxable income amounted to 10 million euros. However, as the subsidiary had tax losses of 6.7 million euros pending offset, the amount paid totalled 708 thousand euros. On 31 July 2012 an application was submitted to the Directorate-General for Taxation through the European Arbitration Convention based on Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990. This Convention guarantees the elimination of double taxation due to transfer pricing adjustments within the European Union.

On 28 December 2016, the affected Spanish companies received the notifications relating to the agreement reached between the Spanish and Portuguese authorities that finalised the mutual agreement procedure. On 17 January 2017 the same agreement was received by the Portuguese company. Under this agreement, the Spanish and Portuguese authorities accepted the complete elimination of the double taxation.

Under these agreements, the adjustment made by the competent Portuguese authority to Acerol was reduced to a total of 10 million euros, according to the assessment, to 4 million euros for 2007 and 720 thousand euros for 2008. At the same time, the competent Spanish authorities made a correlative adjustment of the same amount to the various Spanish Group companies affected. In 2016, the Group recognised the refundable amounts in Spain, which amounted to 1.3 million euros, in addition to an increase in tax credits amounting to 179 thousand euros. At the same time, the Portuguese entity recognised a refundable amount of 0.6 million euros.

On June 2017, the Spanish Tax Agency executed the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) reached by which the Group recovered in Spain the amounts provided for, plus 254 thousand euros of interest, which were recognised as income in the year.

In 2018, a payment of 678 thousand euros was received from the Portuguese tax authorities, which included the outstanding principal plus interest. Since the Group had already recognised the amounts to be recovered, the payment had no significant impact on the accounts.

Poland
On 2 December 2016, notification was received of the commencement of inspections of 2015 income tax at the Group company Acerinox Polska S.P. to a close in this period. The corporate income tax inspection was completed in 2018 without any significant adjustments for the Group. The company was required to pay additional tax of 90 thousand euros that year, plus 16 thousand euros in interest.

19.5.2. Years open to inspection
In accordance with current legislation, taxes cannot be considered definitive until the submitted tax returns have been inspected by the tax authorities or until the inspection period has elapsed.

Spain
Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law, tax loss carryforwards declared in the tax returns for years open to inspection become statute-barred ten years from the day following the deadline for filing the tax return or self-assessment for the tax period in which the right to offset arises. Once this period has elapsed, taxpayers must submit the assessment or self-assessment and the accounting records, as well as evidence that they have been filed at the Mercantile Registry during the aforementioned period, in order to demonstrate that these tax loss carryforwards and the amount thereof are appropriate.

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, Acerinox, S.A. and the companies in the consolidated tax group have all the main applicable taxes open to inspection by the tax authorities for the following years:

Tax rate Income tax Value added tax Customs duties Personal income tax

2019 2017 to 2019 2017 to 2019 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2019

2018 2008 to 2017 2015 to 2018 2016 to 2018 2015 to 2018

Other countries
The other Group companies have the taxes for the years stipulated by their respective local legislation open to inspection. The directors of the Company and subsidiaries do not expect that any significant additional liabilities would arise in the event of an inspection.

NOTE 22 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Purchase of VDM Acerinox S.A., has reached an agreement with Lindsay Goldberg Vogel GmbH and Falcon Metals BV, for the acquisition of VDM Metals Holding GmbH (VDM Metals), a company based in Germany and world leader in the production of special alloys. With this operation, the Acerinox Group is diversifying into sectors with greater added value. VDM Metals represents a great opportunity for Acerinox to grow in new markets and growth sectors such as aerospace, the chemical industry, the medical industry, hydrocarbons and renewable energies, water treatment and emissions control. The purchase agreement has been concluded in a transaction worth 532 million euros. Acerinox will pay 310 million euros and assume debt of 57 million euros and pension plans and other obligations of amounting to 165 million euros. Acerinox will use its available financing facilities for this acquisition. The closing of the transaction and therefore the takeover of VDM Metals is subject to the approval of the European competition authorities among others, and is expected to be completed during the end of the first quarter of 2020. The American authorities have already given their approval to the operation. Commencement of inspection activities at Acerinox Europe On February 3, 2020, the group company Acerinox Europa, S.A.U. was given notice of the start of verification activities on import duties and VAT for the 2018 financial year. The procedures will begin in March, although the company does not expect, as in previous years, that any liabilities will arise for the Group as a result of this inspection. Acerinox Europa, S.A.U. employee regulation file In January 2020 the Group proceeded to externalize through an insurance company the agreements derived from the pre-retirement plan approved by Acerinox Europa, which includes 183 workers. The amount of the compromise recognised in these statements, based on the actuarial calculation, comes to 26,016 thousand euros, equivalent to the amount of the payment made to the insurance company. At the date of these annual statements, 20 of the 32 workers object of the collective firing in the employment regulation file approved by Acerinox Europa, S.A. U. have individually challenged their dismissal. The fact that the collective dismissal file was closed with warning and that, even it concluded with a dismissal, this would only require the company to pay the difference between the amount received and the legal maximum amount, so that any result, regardless of amount, would not materially impair the numbers and conclusions reflected in these annual statements.

1. Report from the CEO
We have experienced many challenges in 2019. Political and economic uncertainty and trade tensions among major powers have slowed down the global economy and consumption, affecting the stainless steel industry and impacting the Group's production. Nevertheless, in 2019 Acerinox recognised EBITDA of 364 million euros and a significant reduction in debt.
Our solid international presence has contributed to the obtainment of recurring yields year on year despite the fall in prices of stainless steel in certain markets. In 2019 we took a step further in reaching an agreement for the acquisition of all the ownership interest in the German company VDM Metals, global leader in the production of special alloys, which poses a great opportunity for Acerinox to grow in new higher added-value markets.
Acerinox is known globally as one of the most competitive companies in the world in the manufacture of stainless steel. We are a sound company that is turning 50; this would not be possible without the active involvement of our Stakeholders. Our shareholders, our employees, society and our other stakeholders value our company not only based on economic and financial parameters, but also increasingly on non-financial matters, to which we have always paid attention.
From the very beginning we have been aware that to become sustainable in the long term through the creation of shared and sustained value, it is essential that we bear in mind the social and environmental impacts of our business activities. Sustainability marks the difference of a true organisation with a desire to continue functioning and withstand the test of time. That is how we want to be and how we want to be seen.
Our commitment to sustainability responds to external demands, but it stems from the internal understanding in Acerinox that we must act responsibly and sustainably, adapt to the environment, foresee the future, invest wisely, avoid errors, create a working environment that attracts talent and be mindful of efficiency in the production process. A good example of this is our progress in this connection in 2019, which we present in this report.
We have strengthened the area of sustainability as a strategic element with presence in the senior management committee. In 2018 we began to modify our Corporate Governance model and in 2019 we continued to strengthen the role of the Committees of the Board of Directors and we opted for a Board of Directors in which diversity is one of its attributes, with a majority of independent directors and a greater presence of women.
Furthermore, it is the Board of Directors and senior management of Acerinox who promoted the Risk Management Model to identify, classify and assess potential incidents that may affect the Group and, based on this, manage the risks and provide reasonable assurance on the achievement of the objectives defined. Non-financial risks have been included in this model and this analysis will continue to be strengthened in future years.
In 2019 innovation continued to be one of our pillars which, year on year, increases the value of our activities and products. The launch of the Excellence 360º programme was a milestone for our Group. This programme, which is based on the combination of digital transformation and improvements in internal benchmarking, will not only result in significant economic returns, estimated to total EBITDA of 125 million euros annually from 2023 onwards, but it will also enhance the service offered to customers by strengthening their position as the focal point of the business.
195

Sustainability Report
The programme will also contribute to more efficient consumption of natural resources, to a reduction in waste and the associated emissions, and to redefining the way in which the Group manages demand and the supply chain.
These innovative efforts, which are reflected annually in our R&D&I investment figures, contribute to the Group's solid reputation. We are known by our customers for the quality of our products, which meet the highest standards, and also for the excellence of our processes, which are focused on efficiency through knowledge and substantial investment efforts that have consolidated us as an example of a high-technology company in the manufacture and sale of stainless steel. Adapting to the needs of our customers by providing a value proposition places us in an excellent position to maintain long-term relationships.
Similarly, developing our business activities responsibly involves acting in a context of fair competition and on a level playing field, demonstrating zero tolerance to behaviour, internally or externally, that goes against the commitments we have made through our Code of Conduct and Good Practices and the corresponding policies.
The actions taken by each of the bodies and the people that form Acerinox are regulated by a series of regulations and policies that define our activities. Our Code of Conduct and Good Practices establishes the ethical principles and the general operating standards.
The challenges experienced in recent years and the digital transformation of the business model give rise to the need for constant adjustments, such as adaptation of the personnel structure to ensure stability. Dignified treatment and respect is a fundamental pillar in Acerinox's relationships with its employees. We have a team of more than 6,000 people who demonstrate their professionalism, commitment and diversity and to whom Acerinox provides stable and quality employment. The collective bargaining agreements are a key element in this relationship. In 2019 the collective bargaining agreements of Acerinox Europa and Bahru were renewed with significant social improvements such as reconciling work and family life.
Health and safety has been, is, and will be an indisputable priority for Acerinox. Industrial activities involve a series of risks and the Group, from the highest levels, encourages the control and management thereof to establish conditions that prevent any type of accident. Acerinox Europa's "ACero" campaign and NAS' Job Safety Observation programme reflect this importance.
2019 has also been a year of significant progress with regard to the environment.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25) took place in Madrid in December 2019. The main aim was to review the outstanding matters regarding the the full operationalisation of the Paris Agreement and, thus, continue to advance in helping to limit climate change and in the subsequent and necessary steps to achieve this. In COP 25 we ratified our commitment to achieving climate neutrality before 2050, aligned with the Spanish steel production companies association (UNESID), as one of the key principles in the carrying on of our business activities. We are convinced that this commitment to producing stainless steel with zero net emissions by 2050 is achievable. To meet this commitment the Group will continue to opt for cutting-edge production processes; however it will also be necessary to use electricity that is 100% carbon-neutral and from competitive sources, considering its technical and economic feasibility. Collaboration with the various social players will be key to overcoming possible difficulties in achieving this aim, such as the cost of CO2 that Acerinox assumes and the price of renewable electrictricity. We will do everything we can so that we achieve this. The agreement entered into in December 2019 by Acerinox Europa to purchase 6 MW of renewable energy for a period of 10 years is a good illustration of this.
196

Another fundamental aspect with regard to the environment is the circular economy, which refers to the progression towards a production and consumption model that involves sharing, reusing, repairing, renewing and recycling materials and existing products as many times as possible to create value added. In doing so, the life cycle of the products is extended. We are experts in this field; the material we manufacture, stainless steel, is 100% recyclable and reusable, in addition to having a prolonged life cycle.
We seek to maintain and incorporate suppliers into our supply chain who work with the Group in our creation of value. We are constantly striving to improve operations in the procurement of raw materials and goods and to evolve towards more efficient model-based procurement systems. Planning 360º, which forms part of Excellence 360º, is an excellent example of this. This initiative will enable demand-based planning, adding a competitive advantage when it comes to making the relevant decisions throughout the supply chain that are aligned with market behaviour, and applying artificial intelligence and data analysis to organise the processes.
The actions of our suppliers must be consistent with our ethical, environmental and social principles included in the Code of Conduct and Good Practices and in the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Policy.
All these measures and the results achieved in 2019 were recognised both in Spain and abroad.
We continue to be listed on the FTSE4Good global index, which recognises the companies that act responsibly and sustainably, and we also participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The International Stainless Steel Forum has recognised us as one of the most efficient and committed companies to reducing emissions: -35% less CO2 emissions per tonne manufactured compared to the global average of stainless steel manufacturers and 30% less vapours than the global steel industry average. We are also members of the Worldsteel Climate Action Programme, a programme led by the Worldsteel Association that recognises steel manufacturers who have collaborated in the collection of CO2 emission data in the industry.
Lastly, it should be noted that this Sustainability Report complies with the Global Reporting Initiative standards and also considers the 10 Principles of the Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations.
2020 will be another year of challenges. At Acerinox, we will continue, just as we did 5 decades ago, to contribute to a sustainable and responsible business that integrates all of our Stakeholders.
We are 50 years old, which in itself is evidence of our sustainability, and we are now laying the foundations for the next 50 years.

Sustainability Report

The Group's factories are as follows: Acerinox Europe (Campo de Gibraltar, Spain), North American Stainless (Kentucky, USA) and Columbus Stainless (Middelburg, South Africa) are integral factories, which means that they have meltshops, hot rolling and cold rolling; and Bahru Stainless (Johor Bahru, Malaysia) that only has cold rolling. For the manufacture of long products, the Group has the plants of Roldan (Ponferrada, Spain) and Inoxfil (Igualada, Spain), as well as production workshops in NAS.
The Group's sales network, made up of 18 service centres, 25 warehouses and 35 sales offices, allows it to distribute stainless steel to a total of 81 countries on the 5 continents. In those countries where Acerinox makes sales and does not have sales offices, it has commercial agents.
How do we manufacture our products? Flat products https://www.acerinox.com/es/grupo-acerinox/fabricas/acerinox-europa/esquemas-de-produccion/ Long products https://www.acerinox.com/es/grupo-acerinox/fabricas/roldan/esquemas-de-produccion/
Sustainability strategy Acerinox's vision is to be a sustainable company in the long term, producing stainless and special steels that respond to the challenges of a changing world increasingly concerned about its impact on the environment and with a commitment to maintaining the highest levels of safety, operational excellence and innovation, creating value for society and for customers, investors and employees.
What we do makes us different from the market, but we also want to stand out because of the way we do things. And we do so in a sustainable and responsible way, in the belief that this means adapting to the environment, anticipating the future, investing wisely, avoiding mistakes, creating a working environment full of health and safety, which attracts talent, and taking care of efficiency in the production process. Collaborating with our stakeholders (shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, analysts and investors, media and society in general) in the creation of shared and sustained value.
At Acerinox we understand that a business with a vision of lasting over time is not possible without integrating a sustainable vision into the business itself. Economic sustainability, but also social and environmental sustainability.
Sustainability understood in its three aspects

Financial

Environmental

Social

The Group's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its CSR policy, which aims to foster a culture of social responsibility within the Group, on a global scale, that contributes to improving people's well-being, promoting the economic and social development of the communities in which it is present and creating sustainable value for shareholders and investors, employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, for the territories in which the Group conducts its business, for the environment, for regulatory bodies and for the media.
200

In fact, sustainability itself is integrated in the activities that Acerinox develops, starting with the main material, stainless steel, a 100% recyclable metal with a wide range of applications, fundamental for multiple industries, such as construction or automotive, with the demand for stainless steel, therefore, being crucial for continuing growth. The materialisation of these commitments defined in the CSR policy occurs through the Acerinox Group's 20192020 Corporate Social Responsibility Master Plan. Through this plan, socially responsible actions are promoted in order to respond to the expectations of its stakeholders. The Acerinox Group's 2019-2020 CSR Master Plan has as its main objectives:
­ Establish the strategic lines in Corporate Social Responsibility of Acerinox and its areas for 2019. ­ To coordinate the actions of the whole Group in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility. ­ Reinforce Acerinox's reputation through internal and external communication.
The 2019 information regarding the economic performance, products and services, legal form and organisational structure of the Acerinox Group, is available in the company's Annual Report: https://www.acerinox.com/es/accionistas-inversores/informacion-economico-financiera/informede-auditoria-cuentas-anuales-informe-de-gestion-y-memoria-anual/

3.2 Materiality analysis
Through materiality analysis, Acerinox identifies and prioritises environmental, social and good governance issues relevant to Acerinox and its Stakeholders, so this Sustainability Report informs on and is structured to that end with respect to these issues. This analysis also allows Acerinox to align its strategy and form of action with the demands of its stakeholders. All those persons or groups that maintain a relationship with the Group, exercising their influence on the activities, decisions and management systems, are considered to be stakeholders by Acerinox. Thus, the Group has defined its main stakeholders as its shareholders and investors, customers, employees, suppliers and the media.
Shareholders and investors The Group maintains a direct and close relationship with its shareholders. The aim of Acerinox is to offer them an attractive and sustainable return.
Customers Acerinox obtains the opinion of the customers and their degree of satisfaction with the products and services of the Group through diverse channels.
Employees The people who work in the Group are Acerinox's main asset, so it is essential to promote and guarantee communication with them.
Suppliers Acerinox makes available to its suppliers the Supplier Portal, with information such as general contracting terms and conditions or tenders.
Communications media Acerinox maintains continuous contact with the media, informing them about the latest news of the Group and its products.

"The materiality of information is the core of sustainability reporting."
Global Reporting Initiative - GRI.
For years, Acerinox has reinforced this analysis by incorporating new perspectives. The 2019 materiality analysis is based on that performed in the 2018 financial year, updating and reinforcing it with certain additional external analyses.

External aspect

2018
Internal aspect
Assessment by different professional profiles and Group managers from different departments and geographies with respect to the issues previously identified in the external aspect. In this way, the perception was obtained both at corporate and local level and from different areas that are related to Acerinox stakeholders, such as shareholder and investor relations, finance, commercial or human resources.

2019

The update of the materiality analysis in 2019 has enabled the detection of new material issues and the renaming of previously used terminology. In total, 33 issues were identified of which 19 were chosen due to their greater relevance, both for Acerinox and its Stakeholders, 8 of these 19 issues being especially key for the Group. In addition, 4 are new (Competitiveness, Corporate Governance, Economic Contribution and Human Rights), incorporated in 2019.

Sustainability Report
The Board of Directors approved the Code of Conduct and Best Practices in its different versions and the Group's Crime Prevention Model, following the relevant advice. It is also the editor and approving body of the Rules of Conduct in the stock markets and the Conflict of Interest Prevention Policy.
For their supervisory work in these matters and to verify the implementation of prevention and compliance measures, the Board and the Audit Committee have the Group's internal audit services and the work of a Prevention and Compliance Director. Both bodies appear regularly before the Board and more frequently before the Audit Committee.
Board members can access the essential rules governing these matters at all times through the company's portal or through the Director's Portal, in addition to obtaining any specific information through the usual channels.
Specifically, in 2019 a training action for all the employees of the Group's Spanish companies on the Code of Conduct, criminal compliance and data protection was carried out.
Likewise, another of the most relevant advances in this area during 2019 has been the creation of a training tool and standards repository:" Acerinorm."
Three key features of Acerinorm, the new training tool and standards repository 1. Storage of relevant internal corporate instructions, such as the Code of Conduct. 2. Provide training to new employees, including a record of training statements and knowledge tests. 3. Management of the sending of half-yearly declarations by the employees concerned required by the internal instruction on competence.
Protection of Human Rights
As a Group with a presence in more than 50 countries and a workforce of 5,977 employees with diverse sociocultural contexts, the defence of Human Rights in all the locations where Acerinox operates is fundamental.
Therefore, Acerinox is committed to act in a way that is compatible with the international declarations of Human Rights in all its locations, having developed different policies and plans for this purpose.
The Acerinox Code of Conduct and Best Practices Acerinox expresses its commitment to and involvement with human rights and public freedoms recognised in national and international law, and to the principles upon which the United Nations Global Compact is based, as well as compliance with the provisions of the fundamental conventions of the International Labor Organization.
It also expresses its total rejection of child labour and forced labour.
General Policy on Corporate Social Responsibility of Acerinox The General Policy on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) includes, as one of its general principles of action, support for the integration of the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, as well as other international instruments, especially in the areas of human rights, labour practices, the environment and the fight against corruption, through its adaptation and dissemination.
210

With regard to their employees, Acerinox Group companies must respect the human rights recognised by national and international legislation and, in particular, those whose violation degrades workers (with explicit rejection of child labour and forced or compulsory labour), as well as the rights of ethnic minorities in the places where they carry out their activity.
Adherence to the UN Global Compact initiative The Group is committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which include, among others, the following principles in relation to human rights:
­Principle 1: "Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed Human Rights within their area of influence."
­ Principle 2: "Businesses must ensure that their companies are not complicit in Human Rights abuses."
As regards respect for labour rights, Acerinox's operations in this area are detailed in the chapter on Human Capital and in the chapter on Health and Safety.
During 2019, there were three complaints of harassment in the Acerinox Group. Two are closed, one without action and the other without action and the third is open.
Fight against Corruption & Bribery
Acerinox in all its actions takes into consideration its commitment to zero tolerance of corruption, bribery, fraud or other similar illegal activities. The Council ensures compliance with the policies through the Director of Compliance with the crime prevention model, approved by the Council itself, and the complaint channels as means of detection. In case of detecting any breach, the Crime Prevention Model contemplates the application of the sanctions established in the labor regulations
Information and measures to combat corruption and bribery within the Acerinox Group are fundamentally based on the provisions of the Acerinox Code of Conduct and Best Practices as well as the Crime Prevention Model, which are the main tools for compliance and crime prevention used by the Group and establishes money laundering prevention measures. During 2019, no corruption cases have been collected.
Additionally, in the framework of crime prevention, the Acerinox Group has adopted a number of policies and internal standards designed to prevent criminal and illegal practices from being committed in general and more specifically, crimes by the legal person. .
The Group has a series of policies related to this area, specifically the Acerinox Code of Conduct and Best Practices, the Acerinox Group Crime Prevention Model in Spain, the Acerinox, S.A. General Conflict of Interest Policy, the Internal Code of Conduct in the Stock Markets and other instructions related to authorisations, gifts and invitations, relationship with credit institutions, relationship with public entities and contracts with third parties, among others.

Sustainability Report
4.3 Risk Management
The Acerinox Group has a Risk Management and Control policy that establishes the basic principles and general framework for the control and management of risks of all kinds faced by the Company and the Group.
This policy is available on the website: http://www.acerinox.com/es/contenido-en-detalle/Cdigo-de-conducta-y-buenas-practicas
The Acerinox Group's Board of Directors and Senior Management have promoted the Risk Management Model. This model is designed to identify, classify, and evaluate potential events that could affect all relevant organisational units and functions. The main objective of this model is to manage risks and provide reasonable security in the achievement of its objectives, whether these are strategic, operational, compliance or informationrelated.
The heads of the different areas of the production units are responsible for identifying potential events that entail risks, creating a risk inventory and a taxonomy. An assessment of these risks, in terms of probability and impact, is carried out at least every six months, using qualitative techniques based mainly on the knowledge, judgment and experience of the people involved.
The risks are represented graphically on a heat map, according to their probability of occurrence and impact, and are classified into four categories according to their criticality. The risk map enables the risks of the different production units to be compared, their evolution over time to be seen and analyses and controls to be carried out by category in order to manage them properly. The Executive Committee of Acerinox, S.A. performs a supervision of these evaluations.
Within the section on Regulatory Risks, special attention should be paid to the risk of Undue management of waste, dumping and emissions that would represent a breach of environmental legislation. In this regard, Acerinox policies provide for scrupulous compliance with all applicable regulations.
We should also mention Product Liability Risk. Acerinox's commitment to the quality of its products is total, and Acerinox's policy in this respect is to pursue customer satisfaction, The Group has established a public and transparent procedure for the approval of suppliers to ensure compliance with quality standards. The acceptance of general contracting conditions implies compliance with the initiative UN Global Compact (www. unglobalcompact.org) https://proveedores.acerinox.com/HOMOLOGA/index.html
In the Business risks and strategy section we highlight the risks of Lack of adequate personnel and Loss of key personnel, which could have an impact on production and management of the company. This risk is minimised through a policy of hiring specialised staff and succession and rotation plans for positions of responsibility, which guarantee that employees are properly trained. Another potentially relevant risk is that of Labour conflict and Subcontracting. The Acerinox Group is committed to social dialogue.
212

Among the reputational risks, the Risk of ethical misconduct and/or the commission of crimes by employees has been identified. The Compliance Department ensures adequate training and information for employees in this area With regard to Human Rights, the Acerinox Group's Code of Conduct and Best Practices, which is published on the website, establishes the following: "Acerinox expresses its commitment to and involvement with human rights and public freedoms recognised in national and international law, and to the principles upon which the United Nations Global Compact is based. It also expresses its total rejection of child labour and forced labour."
More information on risk management is available in the company's Annual Report: https://www.acerinox.com/es/accionistas-inversores/informacion-economico-financiera/informede-auditoria-cuentas-anuales-informe-de-gestion-y-memoria-anual/

Relationship with employees AAcerinox promotes the creation of working conditions that contribute to a good working environment for its employees. The Code of Conduct and Best Practices and the CSR Policy are two key elements to this.
The Code establishes the rules and criteria of action that represent the minimum standards of conduct in professional matters, which must be complied with by all employees and directors of the Group and in all activities. For this, Acerinox has established Reporting channels that allow the reporting of any breach or violation of the conduct collected therein.
The CSR policy establishes as one of its principles of action to promote communication and dialogue with its employees, and to encourage relations with them. It also adds a series of commitments that Acerinox assumes with respect to its employees.

CSR Policy
What are the principles in Acerinox's relationship with its employees?
­ Respect for human rights, especially those whose violation degrades workers (with explicit rejection of child labour and forced or compulsory labour) as well as the rights of ethnic minorities.
­ Recruit, select and retain talent with a favourable framework of labour relations based on equal opportunities, non-discrimination and consideration of diversity in all its variables, facilitating measures for the integration of disadvantaged groups and promoting an optimal work-life balance.

218

­ A fair remuneration policy will encourage the recruitment of the best professionals and strengthen the Group's human capital.
­ The training and qualification of workers fosters professional advancement and adapts human resources to function in a diverse and multicultural work environment.
­ A bove all, the Group will maintain and promote a safe and healthy working environment in the workplace and in its areas of influence.
Agreements with our employees The working conditions agreed between the Group and its employees are established, fundamentally, in the collective labour agreements or, where appropriate, in the specific agreements that are carried out individually with the rest of the employees, in both cases providing the basis for the relationship between both parties. In 2019 the collective agreements of Acerinox Europe and Bahru were renewed, with significant improvements in areas such as remuneration or work-life balance. The Group considers it essential to respect the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as the exercise of trade union activity by all its employees in each of the geographical areas where it is located, guaranteeing that the activities carried out are always based on respect for professionals and appropriate to their jobs. To do so, it is essential to maintain a direct and constant relationship, both with the employees themselves and with their representatives at all locations. The use of two-way channels is therefore essential.

Beyond the obligations established at a legislative level, Acerinox provides its employees with social benefits that entail an improvement of such conditions, such as canteen subsidies, aid for workers with spouses or disabled children, school aid for children or facilities in transport to the Group's locations.

Work organisation Acerinox is aware of the benefits for the worker and for the Group of having a balance between the professional and personal responsibilities of its employees. Acerinox therefore endeavours to promote measures to reconcile the personal, family and working lives of all the Group's employees subject, in all cases, to the legal rules and respecting the general provisions in force at any given time.
In view of the Industry's context and the very nature of the activity, the organisation of working time at Acerinox is directly related to manufacturing needs and is therefore complex. Most commonly, shifts, schedules, breaks and other provisions related to work organisation are set out in labour agreements or, where applicable, in agreements established directly with employees.
Acerinox arranges agreements with employees and their respective representatives, in order to comply with both the demands imposed by the production process and the commitments established with employees, facilitating the proper functioning of processes, without neglecting the worker's welfare.

Within large production centres, shifts are usually divided into three groups of eight hours each, or two groups of 12 hours, depending on the agreement reached with the workers' representatives. In this way, the activity of the plants (with few exceptions) never completely comes to a standstill, and such activity is always under the supervision of safety officers and those responsible for ensuring that processes run smoothly.

The Group continues its work to encourage the personal and professional reconciliation of the Group's employees, to incorporate the measures required to enable them to disconnect from work (which are currently not available), provide gestational periods, allow maternity and paternity leave and nursing leave, inter alia.

Sustainability Report

Remuneration system Acerinox strives to maintain a fair and transparent remuneration policy among its employees, without any genderbased distinction, thus committed to an effective remuneration balance between women and men.
The characteristics of the remuneration system are developed within the collective bargaining agreements corresponding to each plant. These agreements set and establish the jobs with their corresponding salary levels (including compensation for responsibility and control) as well as the job conditions. The levels encompass all items of remuneration that workers receive, including the characteristics of the work itself. The remuneration system set out in the agreements is across-the-board for all staff with the same professional classification, having taken into account the levels at which each job can be performed and the conditions of the post, as well as the compensation for responsibility and control.
For the remaining cases not included in the collective bargaining agreements, individual agreements are defined, which in any case are framed within the local context and in compliance with corresponding legislation.

The incorporation of female workers to Acerinox has occurred mostly in recent years, which implies differences in the total remuneration received related to the seniority supplement . Another factor to take into account is the perception of other salary concepts related to turnicity, carried out mostly by men. Likewise, it should be noted that the salary gap data of the Acerinox Group does not take into account the comparison of 100% equivalent professional segments, given that within each labor category there are different levels of responsibility.

Talent development Europe's steel Industry is constantly evolving, both in terms of the development of new products and the use of new manufacturing technologies, in order to respond to new requirements in the broadest sense (price, quality, environmental, social, etc.). Accordingly, to achieve an adequate evolution, we need to rely on quality qualification and training that allows employees to adapt to current needs and to be at the forefront of this technological development.

The Group's employees represent a competitive difference for Acerinox. Years of experience and training are essential, both for the employee to evolve professionally and for Acerinox to achieve a product of the highest quality, optimise production and reduce costs. This is why Acerinox is committed to raising and perfecting the level of employee training, in a constant process targeted at excellence, assimilation of the Group's values and a competitive nature.

Production in the steel Industry largely depends on the qualifications of its employees. Knowledge and learning about new technologies and digitalisation must be one of the cornerstones of training. Steel, the Backbone of Sustainability in Europe. EUROFER.

Acerinox offers stable, high quality employment with promotion opportunities. It is employment with an international outlook and excellent conditions, in which dedication and effort are rewarded and where performance assessments are analysed in detail.
Diversity and Equality The Group operates on five continents. This serves to enrich the Group's workforce, comprising people from a wide range of cultures, religions, orientations and traditions.
Acerinox goes beyond the legal requirements in promoting diversity in all its operations, to this end implementing the undertakings it has assumed in this area, mainly arising from the collective agreements. To this end, various measures are introduced to contribute towards a fair working environment, decent treatment and equal opportunities.
Inclusion and diversity is part of the Acerinox Code of Conduct and Best Practices. The Group promotes non-discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sex, origin, including racial or ethnic origin, marital status, social status, religion or beliefs, political ideas, sexual orientation or status, union affiliation, kinship, language or any other personal, physical or social status of its professionals, as well as equal opportunities among them. The Group recognises its diversity and collaborates with enthusiasm in the agreement and elaboration of any rule which may encapsulate or protect it, or which may protect particularly sensitive groups, according to current legislation.
This top-down diversity starts with the Acerinox Board of Directors, and is a true reflection of the Group's international nature and the success of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee in implementing the diversity guidelines supported by the Director Selection Policy.

Specifically, in terms of gender diversity, the presence of women is generally very low in Acerinox's Industry. Women represent 11% of the workforce.

In the prevention of sexual harassment, the Group has introduced a series of protocols and measures, such as the Reporting channel. This enables those employees who consider themselves affected to report their situation and the Group will carry out the appropriate investigation and make the right decisions. This channel received

last year two complaints of this nature that have been reported in the Human Rights section. Any worker may request precautionary measures to be adopted and these will be implemented automatically while the investigation takes place.
Actually, we are working on the development of equality plans for Acerinox SA, Acerinox SAU, Roldán SA, Inoxfil and Inoxcenter.
In addition, different specific measures are being developed at each plant. We are actually working in the elaboration of Diversity and Inclusion Plans in Acerinox SA, Acerinox SAU, Roldan SA, Inoxfil SA and Inoxcenter. Furthermore, within the employment sphere, Acerinox fosters the care, respect and inclusion of people with different capabilities, thus complying with Royal Legislative Decree 1/2013, of 29 of November, which approves the Redrafted Text of the General Law on Rights of Disabled Persons and their Social Inclusion.
In fact, the collective agreements set out that, in order to keep in work those personnel who, due to insufficient or reduced physical conditions, are unable to achieve normal performance for their classification or category, such persons will be transferred to another job within the Group, with the salary level that he or she had in their previous position.
All the Acerinox facilities and workplaces are enabled to facilitate and improve access for employees, customers, suppliers and whoever might need to access them. In addition to the mandatory compliance with the applicable regulations for that purpose, Acerinox facilitates the carrying out of any necessary reforms, studying improvements to its buildings and workplaces.
In the spanish plants of Acerinox, 54 employees with some recognized degree of disability work.
The Columbus factory in Mpumalanga, Africa, has been independently verified for its contribution to the economic empowerment of the black population. The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) is a set of positive discrimination policies, laws and actions that are intended to benefit and advance the black community in South Africa both economically and socially.
At Columbus Stainless, the economic and social contribution that the Mpumalanga factory produces in the surrounding area is key for the population, so Columbus considers it essential to integrate black workers into the economic activity, in line with the Group's CSR Policy. The contribution that Acerinox makes in this regard is reflected in a certification obtained from an outside agency with respect to compliance with B-BBEE.
Over the last 5 years, a great many projects have been developed in this regard, including the purchase of equipment from local communities, the improvement of schools in the area, the provision of free office and workshop space, as well as measures aimed at economic strengthening of people in the community. This has meant a social investment of 610,000 euros per year.
Specifically, in 2019 the projects developed have focused on 4 areas: ­ T raining. Together with the local Chamber of Commerce, training in business management has been provided to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises.
226

­ D onation of material. One small company has been supported by donating 20 containers for use in the distribution process of its products.
­ Free space. Areas have been set up so that small businesses can develop their business completely free of charge (rent, water, electricity, etc.).
­ A cerinox expertise. The engineers of the Acerinox factory in Mpumalanga have supported a local enterprise in the development of its business, investing a large number of hours in this partnership.
The impact of these initiatives has led to the creation of new jobs and the consolidation of others in local businesses, totalling 100 jobs outside of Columbus either created or consolidated, all in small enterprises and businesses owned by the black community. Acerinox thus actively contributes to the integration of potential suppliers in the business, to strengthening their capacity and competitiveness in quality and price, and to the development of local and sustainable labour relations of mutual benefit.

5.2 Health & Safety
Due to their characteristics, the activities performed by the Group entail potential health and safety risks. Although such risks are inherent to the activity, Acerinox considers this area key when introducing measures that allow a greater control and mitigation of these risks.
The Group structures its management in this area around four fundamental pillars: 1. Reduction of the accident rate. 2. Reduction of absenteeism. 3. Investigation and rapid resolution of issues established in the Health and Safety committees of the Group's different workplaces. 4. Incorporation of the accident rate into the KPIs that define the benefits of certain positions.
Variable remuneration linked to health and safety performance. The variable remuneration corresponding to Acerinox management and plant managers includes compliance with health & safety targets in activities. These targets are monitored by means of key indicators, thus allowing an adequate follow-up and evaluation of their compliance.
Accordingly, Acerinox's commitment to occupational risk prevention extends from the Board of Directors and Senior Management to the management of each plant, employees and Health and Safety Committees, combining efforts to establish those actions required to reduce and mitigate potential risks, as well as their consequences. It also applies to external workers at the Group's facilities, who must integrate Acerinox's own requirements in this area into their activities.
The Group has health and safety management procedures and systems that contribute to more effective control and prevention of occupational hazards and risks. For example, Acerinox Europa has implemented and certified an Occupational Health and Safety Management System pursuant to the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard and has the corresponding occupational risk prevention regulatory audit certificates.
Acerinox constantly monitors the health and safety conditions in the locations where the Group is present. In the event of an incident, the Group applies the various procedures established in order, firstly, to remedy the case and, secondly, to investigate the different factors that led to it and to establish the necessary measures to prevent it from re-occurring. Acerinox's priority is, in any case, to introduce health and safety conditions that help prevent these incidents. The group relies on tools such as SCAT to perform this monitoring of accidents that occur, thus permitting an in-depth investigation.
Through the Health and Safety Committees at the different centres (representing all staff), the needs in this area are supervised and managed at centre level, in addition to being available to employees to provide advice on everything related to the prevention of occupational risks.
One of the key aspects of health and safety -which is in fact dealt with by these Committees- is employee training. The aim is to provide employees with the necessary training and resources to enable them to carry out their duties safely and in a healthy environment, as is the case at the Columbus plant, where all new recruits
228

attend a 10-hour health and safety course before starting their jobs. Meanwhile, employees have a duty to know and strictly meet the standards of occupational health and safety, and to ensure their own safety and that of those people affected by their activities. Acerinox facilities differ greatly depending on whether they are production centres or offices, so training is provided according to the conditions and profiles in each case. During 2019, Acerinox employees received a total of 419,911 hours of training, with Health and Safety issues playing a vital part of this. In addition, as part of the company's adherence to the Luxembourg Declaration and within the framework of the healthy lifestyles and work programmes being implemented by Acerinox, workers will be guaranteed regular monitoring of their state of health according to the work-inherent risks. Defining accident rate targets. The Group constantly seeks to improve its health and safety performance, and to this end the plants define targets that promote excellence in this area. In 2019 Acerinox Europe set targets of an accident rate below 2.25, an OSHA frequency rate of 3.0 and a severity rate below 1.0. All 3 targets were met, and even more ambitious targets have been set for 2020, namely less than 2 for the OSHA incident rate and frequency rate and less than 0.9 for the severity rate. Another example is Bahru. By way of a target, in 2019 it set a goal to reduce the frequency rate of accidents with time lost to below 1, and to reduce the total recordable accident rate to 2 or below. To this end, an action plan was developed focusing on 5 areas (evaluation of health and safety performance, promotion by area managers, awareness, improvement of non-conformities detected in audits, and discipline in the workplace) with their corresponding measures, resources, responsibility, dates and indicators. This has resulted in 50,000 hours of injury-free work with lost time.

Sustainability Report
As for Roldán, the targets defined were: fewer than 39 accidents with sick leave, a lost time accident frequency rate of less than 12, fewer than 6,000 hours lost due to accidents and an absenteeism rate of less than 3.16% (illness and accident). To achieve this, several measures were introduced, such as improving the floor surface in the workshops and the outside areas, signalling the direction of traffic, holding `back' workshops for workers who have suffered accidents affecting this part of the body, providing training in ORP for all office staff, improving the order and cleanliness of the workshops and workstations in general, and re-signalling the traffic routes inside the buildings.
Best Practices
In Bahru, there is a Health and Safety Committee that inspects and assesses potential risks through the General Safety Induction programme to prevent or treat accidents.
As regards Columbus, in addition to developing its own Safety Management System, a programme called "Your Right To Say No" has been implemented, aimed at enabling any employee to refuse to work in a hazardous situation.
Case Study: "AZero" (literally `ACero' = STeel in Spanish)
From 2016 to 2020, Acerinox Europe is developing the `ACero' campaign whose objective is to implement a safety culture, and thus raise awareness of the importance and observance of health and safety rules. This project was developed through various measures focused on:
­ P roject leadership from the management and integration of safety at all hierarchical and organisational levels.
­ A wareness: safety is an essential factor in being a professional at work and allows you to foster pride in belonging.
­ Visibility: signs, messages, videos, campaigns, etc. ­ O rder: eliminate waste and carry out work in an orderly and tidy way, including the
segregation and recycling of waste. ­ A ssessment: an assessment of the employees' health is conducted continuously and
regularly.
Case Study: "Job Safety Observation"
During 2019, NAS has developed an initiative called the Job Safety Observation (JSO) process. This has involved carrying out a job safety analysis by observing the performance of the tasks by employees. Once the observation is completed, the person responsible for it together with the employee reviews the findings and enters them into the JSO system.
In the event of detecting potential deficiencies or improvements, a report is opened to generate an action plan to improve on the findings.
In addition, NAS has developed an initiative to review non-routine tasks by means of a questionnaire to identify actions that help perform these tasks more safely and to raise awareness among employees on a number of issues prior to performing these tasks to address potential risks and thus prevent potential injuries.

Purchasing management model
As part of its business strategy, one of the Acerinox Group's objectives is planning and management of the supply chain, in its commitment to improve operations in the acquisition of raw materials and goods and in the evolution towards production systems based on more efficient models.

With a presence in more than 80 countries and on the 5 continents, in its procurement model Acerinox establishes some general guidelines common to all Group subsidiaries. This is so that, based on these, the subsidiaries are able to develop their own procedures considering the local context.

Given this complexity, it is essential to introduce procedures that assess the performance of suppliers and thus control and ensure a supply chain that meets the requirements demanded by the Group and the legal and regulatory standards, both locally and internationally.

To this end, the selection processes for suppliers is based on the principles of openness, equality and transparency, promoting among its suppliers the same principles that inspire the Group as a responsible company.

It is worth mentioning the risk of product liability. The Group has a public and transparent procedure for the approval of suppliers to ensure compliance with quality standards.

Sustainability and responsibility in the supply chain
Acerinox Group is aware of the importance of its suppliers in its business and in the communities where it performs its activities, so it expects them to act in line with Acerinox's sustainability strategy.
To contribute to a stable and sustainable supply chain, although a purchasing policy is not available, Acerinox relies on its ethical, environmental and social principles, reflected in the approval processes and General Contracting conditions, as well as in the Code of Conduct, which establishes the management style and performance that the Acerinox Group expects from its suppliers.
The principles of this Code govern the professional and sales activity of all persons who work or interact with the Group in all the countries where it operates. In addition, they ensure objectivity and impartiality in supplier selection processes and promote fair competition and transparency in selection processes. In addition, Acerinox has a Reporting Channel that allows suppliers to report any aspect regarding the Code of Conduct.
In its Code of Conduct and Best Practices, Acerinox undertakes:
­ To adapt the selection process for suppliers of goods or services to standards of objectivity and impartiality, and it will avoid any conflict of interest or favouritism in their selection.
­ Internal regulations will promote and require competition in the selection of suppliers and the necessary controls will be introduced so that no person with relevant economic or emotional interests in a current or potential supplier is involved, directly or indirectly, in a decision associated with that supplier.
­ T he information and prices submitted by suppliers in a selection process will be treated confidentially and will not be disclosed to third parties without the prior written consent of the suppliers themselves, unless there is a legal, administrative or judicial authorisation or obligation, or when the openness and transparency of the competitive procedure so requires.

Acerinox has different processes to control the sustainability and responsibility of its suppliers.
In the accreditation Any supplier wishing to be accredited by the Group must comply with a series of requirements defined by each plant, including environmental, health and safety and labour practices, and prove that the actions they take in their activity are compatible with international human rights declarations. In addition, they must be aligned with the 10 Global Compact Principles, which are based on the protection of human rights, minimum working conditions and environmental responsibility.
In addition, as part of the accreditation processes, the express acceptance of the General Procurement Conditions is required.
In the General Procurement Conditions (services and goods) These define the essential requirements to be met by all the Group's suppliers, and include labour contracts and compliance with labour regulations (suppliers must substantiate and guarantee that they comply with all social security and tax obligations in relation to their workers), respect for the environment, contribution to sustainable development and innovation in products and processes, always in compliance with applicable legal regulations.
In periodic assessments The regular checks that Acerinox conducts with accredited suppliers allow us to check whether, inter alia, the quality, environmental and health and safety requirements are maintained. Such a rating will make it possible to confirm or reassess the level of confidence granted by the accreditation. During 2019, 120 audits were performed on suppliers at the Inoxfil and NAS plants. In the rest of companies this type of audit is not carried out.
On the suppliers' own facilities Inspections are carried out at suppliers' premises throughout the year to confirm compliance with good practices linked to the corporate responsibility strategy.

Customers

Acerinox considers it a priority to maintain long-lasting and mutually valuable relationships with its customers. Accordingly, it is committed to offering high quality products through the continuous improvement of its processes and services.

Satisfaction, complaints and claims
To achieve this type of relationship, one of the keys is to listen to the customer. Acerinox relies on several communication and data capture channels.
One of the main sources of information is through Acerinox's own commercial network. To find out the opinion of customers, the Group carries out satisfaction surveys that are sent from the commercial subsidiaries on a regular basis, where information is gathered about the service received, range, quality, product presentation, delivery times, etc.

Number of customers surveyed Satisfaction index *
* De 1 a 5, siendo 5 la nota más alta.

2019 747 3.7

2018 466 3.7

Customer complaints are handled through the Sales Department, either directly from the parent company or by the respective local offices where Acerinox operates. The customer communicates directly with these departments by e-mail or by means of a telephone call to report an incident or complaint. The addresses and telephone numbers of these departments can be consulted in the following link: https://www.acerinox.com/es/ contacto/

The Sales Department records this notification in a specific application for the handling of complaints, in which the customer's details, the product information and a description of the complaint, among other things, are included.

In those cases where the complaint concerns billing or product transport and delivery issues, it is the responsibility of the Sales Department to handle the complaint by following the established procedures.

However, if the complaint concerns technical issues, it is referred to the service centre or plant involved, where a technician is appointed to assess the case and issue a technical report.

247

Sustainability Report
The complaint status is updated on the IT application and, once again, it is the Sales Department that is responsible for informing the customer of this decision, and where appropriate, for proposing or negotiating a solution.
Process and product certifications and controls
All Acerinox Group plants and workplaces comply with the quality and environmental controls required under the legislation of each country, in addition to having Environmental Management Systems according to ISO 14001:2015. In addition, each of the subsidiaries has assumed standards that exceed the legislative requirements in various fields such as quality, safety and the environment.
Moreover, Acerinox undergoes a series of annual external audits of the Group's Information Systems, both at the level of the parent company and of all subsidiaries. These audits are conducted both by external agencies that verify the status of these systems, and by customers, and they review aspects such as cyber security or IT controls.

7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
The Group regards it as essential to expand by contributing to the transition towards a low carbon economy, towards the reuse and recovery of materials and towards the protection of the environment in its broadest sense.
For comparative purposes, the 2018 environmental data did not include information on the Inoxfil and Roldán factories
Specifically, Acerinox's environmental commitment focuses on efficient production in terms of energy consumption and promoting a business model that integrates the circular economy, continuously improving performance and converging with the Group's productivity, competitiveness and environmental goals.
Acerinox's CSR Policy establishes that the conducting of the Group's activities should foster the achievement of its strategic objectives in order to offer high-quality and environmental-friendly products. In fact, one of the principles of action defined in this policy is respect for the environment:
a) T o preserve the biodiversity of the ecosystems and landscapes in which the Group operates and their species.
b) T o prevent pollution by progressively introducing the most efficient and least carbon emission intensive technologies into its facilities.
c) To optimise the management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste by means of systems implemented to set objectives and goals related to, among other purposes, waste reduction, the promotion of good practices and the use of recycled materials.
Furthermore, the Code of Conduct and Responsible Practices establishes the protection of the environment as one of its commitments related to conduct and responsible practices. The Group is committed to maintaining the utmost respect for the environment in the development of its activities, minimising the negative effects that, despite everything, could be caused, and will provide the necessary means and information to minimise or eliminate any impact on the natural environment within the framework of the existing legislation and applying the best available techniques.
The employees play a significant role in this commitment, as they are responsible for contributing to minimising the environmental impact of Acerinox's activities and the consumption of resources such as water, energy, raw materials and consumables, and they must comply with the rules, processes and controls of Acerinox in this regard. In particular, and according to their responsibilities, they must ensure that environmental information reported inside and outside the company is correct.

The identification and management of environmental risks is essential for Acerinox. Beyond the legislative obligations, particularly taken into account in the environmental risks included as operational risks in the Control and Risk Management Policy of Acerinox, S.A., the plants themselves have established environmental risk control procedures that include an assessment of their probability and seriousness. All the Acerinox Group's factories and workplaces comply with the quality and environmental controls required by the legislation in each country, while each of them also implements Environmental Management Systems in accordance with ISO standard 14001:2015. In addition, each of the subsidiaries has assumed standards that exceed the legislative requirements in various fields such as quality, safety and the environment.

Sustainability Report

7.1 Circular Economy
Efficient use of resources and the promotion of initiatives that contribute to a circular economy constitute a key aspect enabling the Group to continue growing in a sustainable and responsible manner.
The concept of the circular economy in itself is implicit in the properties of stainless steel: it can be recycled without any reduction in quality as many times as necessary after having fulfilled its function in any application, with an unlimited useful life under optimal conditions. Due to its properties, this material is an excellent example of recyclability and recoverability, key to contributing to sustainable development. Its life cycle therefore offers multiple opportunities to contribute, in each of them, to the protection and improvement of the environment.

The circular economy, in the Core Business of Acerinox.
Acerinox's activity, by its very nature, contributes to sustainable development and society, and it is doubly respectful towards the environment by generating a product whose life cycle responds to the four Rs of the circular economy (reduce, reuse, re-manufacture and recycle) and by virtue of being used to make recycled material.
The Group firmly believes in the circular economy and its associated advantages. Acerinox signed the Spanish Circular Economy Pact in 2017. This commitment means maintaining the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible, minimising the generation of waste and promoting the proper treatment and recycling of this waste.
One of the principles of action established in Acerinox's CSR Policy is to optimise the management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste by means of systems implemented to set objectives and goals related to, among other purposes, waste reduction, the promotion of good practices and the use of recycled materials.
The Code of Conduct and Responsible Practices establishes a responsibility to contribute to minimising the environmental impact of Acerinox's activities, including the consumption of resources such as water, energy, raw materials and consumables.
"The ultimate goal of steel production management is to ensure that the circular economy is applied to the entire production cycle, promoting synergies with other industries".
Steel, the Backbone of Sustainability in Europe. EUROFER.
Acerinox incorporates scrap metal into its manufacturing processes and the Group thus obtains great value by reintroducing it into the material's life cycle, contributing in turn to reducing the environmental impact of its activities. Foundry and maintenance processes, among others, are involved to achieve the above, allowing its use to continue for centuries.
Acerinox is, therefore, one of the largest scrap recyclers in the areas in which it operates. For example, the Acerinox Europa plant is the largest recycling centre for this material in Spain and, given that Spain is a leader in this aspect in Europe according to the Association of European Producers of Steel for Packaging, this plant has therefore become a benchmark.
The stainless steel coils, strips and bars, among other products, manufactured at Acerinox's factories and transformed into cars, buildings, cutlery, planes, bridges and household appliances ultimately return to the Group's plants in the form of scrap metal to be recast and reused in a circular cycle that could be infinite, due to the qualities of the material.

A project on acid optimisation in the coil pickling has been carried out at the factory in Ponferrada.
Case Study: "Packaging Project"
A project for the elimination of single-use plastic products was implemented at Acerinox Europa in 2019 and, to do so, a campaign for the elimination of these kinds of products was conducted.
This focused on different measures, such as eliminating workers' plastic bottles by giving them 100% recyclable and unlimited-use stainless steel bottles.
At the same time, Acerinox Europa undertook to guarantee selective collection of plastic and other waste. To do so, it provided the factory with sufficient means for proper segregation, specifically establishing clean points throughout the factory's operational area for plastic waste, organic waste, PPE, paper, cardboard, etc.
In addition, an environmental awareness and sensitisation campaign was carried out by means of sustainability posters, in order to involve the employees in the initiative and thus promote their commitment and participation. Training was also provided on the proper separation of waste and good environmental practices during the initial training courses for all the new workers, together with a risk assessment and training on energy efficiency.

 "ComFuturo" Programme The Acerinox Group cooperates with the FGCSIC (CSIC General Foundation) to enhance the talent of new researchers in key areas such as the circular economy. By means of this programme it contributes to promoting high-level young and Spanish research aimed at achieving advances and improvements in areas of exponential concern, including efficiency in the use of raw materials in the production processes and the recovery and reuse of stainless steel.

More specifically, they jointly carry out a project for the recovery of steel slags. The aim of the project is to reuse waste from the metal industry as additives of photocatalytic building materials, in other words, new technology materials that contribute to reducing the pollution of the urban atmosphere and maintaining the aesthetics and functionality of the architecture.

To achieve the above, the pre-treatments required for the conditioning and optimisation of Acerinox's waste, such as steel slag and powder, are evaluated, construction materials with photocatalytic properties with waste additives are designed and manufactured and, finally, the environmental, technical and economic viability of the proposal is validated in each of the potential applications.

The benefits are twofold: the programme contributes to the circular economy by means of the reuse of slags resulting from the manufacturing process and it reduces the levels of pollutant gases.

LCI analysis Within the aim to promote a circular economy and in relation to the use and waste management, it is essential to assess the impact of the entire product life cycle, from the manufacturing process to the end of its useful life. To do this, the Company participates in the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) promoted by the European Steel Association. This is an internationally recognised and structured method to quantify the emissions and the resources consumed, as well as the impact on the environment and health, related to the products placed on the market. The scope of the method encompasses the extraction of the raw materials right through to the useful life of the product.

7.2 Energy and Climate
The stainless steel manufacturing industry has traditionally been linked to high levels of emissions in its production processes that are directly related to its productive capacity. Monitoring and acting in accordance with the intensity of consumption and emissions is therefore essential for contributing to sustainable development.
At all the plants this report covers, Acerinox implements environmental and energy policies that are adapted to the circumstances of each subsidiary. At all of them Acerinox is committed to promoting economically viable best practices in order to control and reduce both energy consumption and atmospheric emissions.
New manufacturing technologies and improvements in the production processes contribute to operational excellence and they are key to enhancing efficiency and competitiveness and providing excellent opportunities to achieve more efficient energy and resource consumption, thus advancing towards carbon neutrality.
In addition, stainless steel, as it is a metal that is almost completely recycled on an indefinite basis, contributes to lower emission levels than other products made from non-reusable materials.
Acerinox is renowned as a benchmark in the fight against climate change due to its implementation of measures to reduce emissions and minimise risks in relation to it.

Sustainability Report

Energy Opting for a perspective of sustainability at all levels is one of Acerinox's principles. At an environmental level, this is clearly reflected in the investments made at the different facilities and we should highlight the efforts made by the Group to increase energy efficiency.
In addition, Acerinox commits to new production systems with the most advanced technologies and systems for efficient energy consumption and the reduction of emissions. This is a criterion taken into consideration in the acquisitions and investments it undertakes.
In December 2019 Acerinox Europa reached an agreement to purchase 6 MW of renewable energy for a period of 10 years.
The measures designed to achieve more efficient energy consumption and, therefore, lower emission levels, cover different areas. ­ Machinery Several programmes are implemented for it to reduce energy consumption, such as replacing conventional
burners with more efficient ones, using recovery boilers or replacing engines with more efficient ones.
­ Processes Energy efficiency in the production processes is a key area for the Group. Several measures are
implemented to achieve the above, such as increasing the continuous load in the hot rolling or increasing the direct annealing in the plate furnace.
­ Awareness Acerinox employees are made aware of the relevance of performing their work in accordance with the
environmental commitments assumed by the Group. At Acerinox this task is facilitated by implementing other measures to reduce pollution, such as replacing conventional lighting with another kind with less impact, such as LED screens and projectors in the offices and laboratories.

Investment in initiatives designed to improve production efficiency and reduce emissions
9.65 millions

Environmental expenditure 100 millions

Best practices
Bahru's Excellent Plan conducts different initiatives designed to reduce consumption of natural gas. For example, the optimisation of the natural gas boiler has prevented the emission of 3,197 Mt of CO2 equivalent and an energy reduction and LED use project has led to the prevention of 11,466 Mt of CO2 equivalent.
Columbus has a Pollution Prevention Plan. This Plan seeks to reduce emissions by 158,475 tonnes of CO2 equivalent during the 2016-2020 period. The measures chiefly focus on reducing electricity consumption, opting for the VSD (variable speed drive) methodology in ventilation, cold rolling and the facilities themselves.

258

Acerinox Europa has an energy and emissions savings panel on which the different actions to be carried out in this area regarding the consumption of natural gas and electricity are planned, establishing an objective, the investment it entails and the corresponding savings for each of the initiatives. The initiatives defined in the 2019 plan entailed an investment of 11.5 million, with annual savings of 1.5 million and a 0 million kWh objective for electricity and natural gas consumption. These initiatives include the regulating of the fans in the cooling towers, the blasting blowers and the pumping of oil in the rolling mills, as well as the recovery of heat from the steel fumes, the replacement of the drive motors, the improvement of the compressed air facilities, a feasibility and sizing project for energy generation by means of renewables and the optimisation of boiler gas consumption (Rafael Naranjo Awards).
Case Study: "Economiser in boiler"
The economiser is a heat exchanger that uses the boiler's exhaust gases to preheat the water entering it. Raising the temperature of the incoming water leads to direct natural gas savings by reducing the temperature gradient. With the installation of these economisers in two boilers, savings totalling 6,453,294 kWh have been achieved in 2019, which means that emissions totalling an estimated 1,231 tonnes of CO2 equivalent has been prevented, thus contributing to reducing the Group's carbon footprint. In addition, it is intended to optimise the consumption of the two boilers by replacing the regulator of the combustion air inlet, which is currently manual and adjusted twice a year, by an electronic regulator with O2 probes. It will thus be possible to optimise the mixture of air and fuel on a constant basis, with estimated savings close to 2.5%.

Sustainability Report

Based on the set of initiatives conducted by the Group, a reduction in energy consumption totalling 9,655,275 GJ has been obtained in 2019. With regard to energy consumption, it should be borne in mind that it varies according to the products and manufacturing techniques used at each plant, as well as the type of fuel used. The energy consumed in 2019 came from natural gas, diesel and electricity.

Buildings with excellent energy efficiency. Acerinox's Marbella building in Madrid is energetically audited by an external audit. Energy audits enable us to analyse the energy costs borne by the different blocs of consumption and, as a result, analyse potentially improvable areas and determine room for improvement in the energy efficiency of our systems and their the operating and behavioural patterns.

Emissions The Group measures its emissions by taking into account the guidelines established by the GHG Protocol, distinguishing between:
­R ange 1. Direct emissions. These are GHG emissions resulting from direct energy consumption from sources controlled by Acerinox (natural gas and diesel).
­R ange 2. Indirect emissions. These are the emissions resulting from the consumption of electricity acquired by the Group.

Objective: Acerinox's Carbon footprint in 2021. In order to monitor the nature, volume and possibilities for action with regard to Acerinox's activities that generate greenhouse gas emissions in detail, Acerinox is committed to publishing the Group's carbon footprint in 2021.

Acerinox Europa forms part of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU RCDE). In order to control and manage the emissions, they are monitored at each of the facilities and their evolution with respect to the defined objectives is assessed. All the equipment at the steel mills has control, measurement and gas filtration systems. Thus, in addition to contributing to the reduction of emissions, it is possible to monitor these levels. In fact, the emissions data are verified by accredited bodies in accordance with ISO 14064.

260

In addition, Acerinox implements the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document on iron and steel and ferrous metals at its factories.

*For the calculation of scope 1 emissions in 2019, the DEFRA 2019 emission factors (Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2019) have been used for diesel fuels, diesel (bioblend), diesel (100% mineral), natural gas and natural gas (100% mineral), in accordance with the cases of each location. In 2018 and 2017, the DEFRA 2017 emission factors (Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2017) for natural gas and diesel (bioblend) were used.
**For the calculation of scope 2 emissions in 2019, the DEFRA 2019 emission factor (Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2019) has been used for electricity. Emissions resulting from consumption of energy from renewable sources have been regarded as zero. In the cases of the 2018 and 2017 emissions, IEA "CO2 emissions from fuel combustion 2017" was used for electricity.

Best practices
In the case of the Columbus factory, energy consumption savings totalling about 14,000 GJ have been achieved by means of the installation of a particle filter in cases such as exhaust pipes on the AP2 annealing and pickling line and the pumps of ZM3 laminated oil, which, in turn, has led to a lower equivalent emissions of CO2.

Case Study: "Protocols during production stoppages"
A new protocol on ZM-4 production stoppages has prevented the emission of 127 tonnes of CO2 equivalent at the Acerinox Europa factory in Cádiz.
The protocols establish procedures in order to ensure that the lines lacking a programme consume as little as possible. Forms are thus established that stipulate the equipment to be stopped in these circumstances.
These protocols evolve in accordance with experience and the best detected practices and they are progressively extended in accordance with their effectiveness on the different production lines. Thus, estimated electricity savings totalling 309,250 kWh were achieved in 2019.

As for NOX emissions, the factories have catalytic towers where these gases are converted into molecular nitrogen, thus reducing emissions of this pollutant.

7.3 Water Consumption and Spillage Management

Water and discharges Water is an essential resource for our activity. Specifically, it is key in our production processes, such as the cooling of machinery and equipment, either directly in the rolling and annealing process or indirectly in closed circuits by means of coils, plates and chambers. In addition, to a lesser extent, it is used in the mixing of baths of chemical treatments and emulsions, the air conditioning at the plants and as sanitary water.
Acerinox therefore assigns significant resources and makes great efforts to reduce the consumption of this resource (and, in turn, the associated costs) and to return as much water as possible to the natural environment, ensuring that it retains similar conditions (purity, quality and temperature) to those in which it is collected as far as possible.

The Acerinox Group plants have strict measures in place to prevent, avoid and resolve spillages from tipping or storing substances should they occur. All the factories have neutralisation plants for treating acidic and basic waters, as well as emergency dams to prevent spillages into the environment and other security mechanisms to eliminate any potential spillages. Similarly, the tanks are also equipped with a rigid inner tank, with an emergency stop function and an emergency cleaning service.
In particular, these measures are reinforced in areas with water shortages in which the Group operates, especially at the Acerinox Europa, Columbus, Roldán and Inoxfil plants.
Acerinox Europe Some of the water used in the process is maintained in constant recirculation. The water that doesn't recirculate and discharged is previously treated (flocculation, decantation and neutralisation) and complies with the conditions on discharges of the IEA (Integrated Environmental Authorisation). This used water is discharged into the sea in the Bay of Algeciras and its properties are constantly monitored.
The discharges totalled 1,434,018 m3 in 2019.
Bahru Stainless All the water collected in Bahru comes from the artificial reservoirs in the area that feed on rainwater, in such a way that the water passes through a treatment plant prior to its use.
With regard to discharges, different treatments such as neutralisation processes are applied at the factory's wastewater treatment plant, in such a way that the final effluent complies with Standard A required by the National Environmental Legislation Requirements.
The discharges totalled 260,824 m3 in 2019.
Columbus Stainless Columbus has made a great effort at the factory in South Africa to adapt to the situation of the local environment, characterised by the scarcity of water in the region, opting for different sources in accordance with the needs and context of the area. To do so it has established a priority-based order of use.
Firstly, the maximum possible amount of water is obtained by means of the reuse of the treated water at the factory's effluent treatment plant, previously applying the appropriate treatment processes, including reverse osmosis and evaporation. In addition, in order to capitalise on the concentrated brine, it is sold as a calcium nitrate product.
Secondly, to promote sustainable use of water in the area, reservoirs have been constructed to allow the collection of a significant volume of rainwater during the wet season and thus supply the factory.
Thirdly, as appropriate, water is obtained from the municipal network.
263

Sustainability Report
It should be highlighted that Columbus is a member of the "Upper Olifants Catchment Management Forum", an association that promotes the application of measures for the sustainable and adequate use of water resources, and that the factory applies a Zero Effluents principle.
The discharges totalled 51,938 m3 in 2019.
Inoxfil All the water consumed comes from the public network that supplies water to the companies on the industrial estate where Inoxfil is located.
The discharges go into the municipal sewerage network having previously being treated by means of coagulation and flocculation processes through a connection point at which the process, sanitary and storm waters converge. In addition, the water entering the factory is subjected to a descaling process. There is also a physical-chemical treatment plant to treat the water from the surface treatment processes.
The discharges totalled 35,500 m3 in 2019.
North American Stainless The water is collected from the river Ohio by means of the corresponding permits obtained by the factory. Prior to its use the water is treated by means of polymers and it passes through sand filters that retain the solid particles. Rainwater is also collected.
Different treatments are applied throughout the production process so as to reuse the water as many times as possible, until its characteristics are no longer suitable for the production process. For example, the water used on the pickling lines is subsequently used in the production of caustic or acid products.
This is when it is returned to the river Ohio with parameters that contribute to preventing any possible environmental impact, in compliance with the current environmental regulations. For this purpose, neutralisation tanks and chromium reduction and nickel precipitate equipment are used, as well as metal extraction, neutralisation processes, etc.
At this factory, as at Acerinox Europa, the quality of water poured into the river is monitored in real time.
The discharges totalled 3,567,580 m3 in 2019.
Roldán The water supply for human consumption comes from the municipal network of Ponferrada and the water used in the industrial process comes from a catchment of the river Sil, authorised by the Miño-Sil Hydrographic Confederation. In addition, by means of the rainwater purification plant, these waters are collected through pipelines and are directed to the rainwater treatment facilities and then discharged into the river Sil.
The different measures to foster efficient water use include the use of closed circuits in such a way that the water, after its use in the production processes, passes through a purification plant to eliminate the suspended solids, fats and oils it contains by means of neutralisation and filtering processes.
264

The discharges go into both the Ponferrada sanitation network and the river Sil. In all cases their qualities are previously measured and the water undergoes neutralisation and flocculation processes. The discharges totalled 388,171 m3 in 2019.
