I INTERVIEW WITH THE CHAIRMAN

Interview with the Chairman

JOSÉ MANUEL ENTRECANALES
CHAIRMAN OF ACCIONA

Our main goal with this 2018 Integrated Report is to describe how we provide solutions to the needs of today's society while not losing sight of the needs of the future, by generating value in the short, medium and long term for all our stakeholders. We want to credibly convey our commitment to sustainable development and our will to be an agent of the environmental and social change that our society needs.
This report is structured around our proposed solutions for sustainable development. These solutions shape our company's business model -- an advanced, forward-looking model that can generate stable, predictable returns going forward.

6

INTEGRATED REPORT
How would you describe ACCIONA? We are a unique company that is inherently oriented towards responding to some of the main challenges facing society. Our business opportunities lie at the intersection between what society needs and what the sustainable future of the planet demands. The challenges we face as a society are urgent and complex, and they involve governments, the private sector, social organisations and citizens alike. They require solutions that can not be addressed in isolation. For that reason, we don't see the company as an activity or set of activities performed in isolation. Our company can not be defined under any single heading. We are, in essence, greenfie d developers and operators of essential infrastructure assets, with a special emphasis on renewable energy. This report aims precisely to probe this issue in depth in order to persuade readers that our company is part of the solution -- and not of the problem -- to the challenges that we, as a society, must face.
What solutions can the company offer? In my view, the challenges facing the planet are set out formally in two recent, closelyrelated milestones: the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. The planet that we leave to future generations depends to a great extent on whether we achieve both goals. Success, which simply means a planet that is environmentally and socially more sustainable, will require combined efforts by governments, business and citizens and an unprecedented mobilisation of resources. Responding to the challenges of sustainable development is at the core of ACCIONA's business model. For that reason, we supply cleaner energy, manage the water cycle, create infrastructures that facilitate the ecological transition, and offer electric mobility services, among others. And for that same reason, we are alert to new opportunities that can help us generate business and contribute to sustainable development. Our close linkage to society's real needs makes us attractive to investors who look to the long term, who see in us a bet not only on the present but also on the future. Our business model also helps us attract the best talent. We at ACCIONA like to know that, through our work, we contribute to building a more sustainable society. I would like to think that our clients see us as a unique company with distinctive value.
7

I INTERVIEW WITH THE CHAIRMAN
How would you describe 2018? We met or exceeded the goals we set ourselves at the beginning of the year. During 2018, the company invested in line with its strategic plans, increased operating cash flow and significant y reduced net financial debt Our business model generates stable cash flows; over 75 % of our EBITDA comes from long-term assets. And 94 % of capital employed is backed by those same assets, a sign of financial pruden e that helps us manage the investment risk. Beyond what this means in the short term -- in terms of financial performance, shareholder remuneration and investor confiden e -- achieving our goals enables us to further our strategy of investing in the planet and responding to the needs of sustainable development.
What makes a company like ours different? Our core skill is in designing, building and operating complex assets for third parties or for our own portfolio. I firm y believe that we are a company with numerous distinctive capabilities, where talent, technical capacity, sustainability and innovation provide the energy that enables us to transform ideas into assets. We are convinced that the future will have no room for business models that do not offer a double dividend: preserving the planet while generating value for investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders. That conviction is what has led us to build a company model that is configu ed to anticipate the needs of tomorrow's society. And that conviction underpins our competitive advantages. And I dare say it will continue to do so for a long time.
To conclude, where is ACCIONA going? We are in a dynamic environment in which the needs of society are changing constantly, but there are trends which are undeniable. Environmental risks were not so important just a decade ago. Now, the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report states that they are the most critical risks for our planet's prosperity. And there is every sign that this situation will persist. Access to energy and water, and infrastructures that improve people's lives, will become imperative needs in the coming decades.
8

INTEGRATED REPORT
In this changing environment, we have continued to advance our solutions, winning new contracts to ensure water supplies in some of the regions with the greatest water stress, current and future, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Also, based on our use of advanced technology with a minimal environmental impact, we are implementing new transport infrastructures in advanced countries such as Norway and Australia. Moreover, we are leaders in decarbonisation through an energy model focused on renewables, where we increased total capacity in 2018 while attaining record levels of competitiveness and availability. The global will to transition towards sustainable growth models will underpin our development going forward. Our opportunity lies in sustainable development, and we pursue it fully aware of our abilities and limitations. We do not know what the future will bring. What we do know is that we will be there wherever there is a need for more sustainable development.

A reality that needs solutions
The world faces a growing number of complex inter-related challenges. Faced with this reality, ACCIONA is part of the solution and turns these challenges into opportunities to improve well-being.

Global challenges
Reduce and combat global warming 1
The increase in temperatures since the pre-industrial era is having a negative impact on people's lives, on economies and ecosystems. As the world heats up, there is a growing likelihood of extreme weather events, such as droughts or floods in coastal regions, becoming more severe, intense and prolonged.
A total of 197 countries approved the Paris Agreement, which defines a roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and measures to adapt to climate change.

Debt performance and projections
Indebtedness was reduced significant y in 2018 and the company's credit quality improved.
Net debt was reduced to 4,333 M (17.1 % less than in 2017) as a result of divestments during the year offsetting capital expenditure. This reduction was also assisted by the increase in operating cash flow to 665 M.

As a result, the net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was 3.48, below the 4.0 target announced at the beginning of 2018. That ratio includes 600 M of debt related to projects under construction. Excluding those projects, the underlying ratio would have been 3.0.

Investing for stable growth
ACCIONA has a balanced portfolio of assets, with returns that ensure its competitiveness and balance sheet strength.
In 2018, capital expenditure totalled 1,023 M, 20.5 % more than the previous year, while gross capital expenditure amounted to 643 M.
The bulk of capital expenditure is concentrated in ACCIONA Energy, where gross capex amounted to 554 M in the year, ensuring the division's growth (in terms of new installed capacity) in the short and medium term, through the construction of new wind farms in Chile, Mexico, Australia and the United States, and photovoltaic farms in Ukraine.
Following the Geotech acquisition in 2017, the Infrastructure division reduced capital expenditure in 2018 to 146 M, of which 33 M were to acquire Andes Airport Services.

Other Activities reduced capex to 28 M, although 100 M were earmarked for ongoing real estate developments.
196 M were used to repurchase own shares.
Asset rotation
In 2018, ACCIONA recycled capital by seizing market opportunities to divest non-strategic or less profitab e assets. Notable divestments included Trasmediterranea, the solar thermal power generation business in Spain, and the stake in Testa Residencial. These operations generated 1,420 M in revenues, which will be reinvested in more profitab e strategic assets.

This support materialised through positions and letters that urge governments, businesses and citizens to legislate, act and promote sustainable development in an urgent and ambitious manner. The main positions and letters were presented before and during the Katowice, Poland, Climate Summit (COP24), a key annual event for addressing issues related to climate change and sustainable development.

ACCIONA´s SUCCESS FACTORS

ACCIONA draws up a risk map for the Group, with domestic and international scope, as well as separate maps for the main business lines. It also performs a quantitative risk analysis by standardising the assessment variables so as to assess the company's risk exposure overall, or by area or division.
A risk tolerance threshold and response plans are established for each business unit, activity or investment project.

The company's risk scenarios are classified into four categories; those relating to finan e and strategy are considered to pose a higher risk, based on the assessment by Group executives.

RISK SCENARIOS

FINANCIAL STRATEGIC OPERATIONAL FORTUITOUS

Fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and financial markets, changes in commodity prices, liquidity, cash flows, bad debts and loss of customers.
Related to attainment of the company's strategic goals.
In connection with the company's processes, people and products: compliance with the law, regulations and contracts; control systems and procedures, supply chain, etc.
Related to damage to assets and civil liability, which may impair ACCIONA's returns. This includes issues related to cybersecurity.

Maintenance to extend useful lives
ACCIONA performs operation and maintenance tasks with an approach that combines preventive measures with prediction of the status of the assets in operation that are owned by third parties. This distinctive management approach helps extend the assets' useful lives and availability, maximising output at a lower operating cost.
In 2018, ACCIONA increased the availability of its own assets to 96.9 %, 0.2 percentage points more than in 2017.
RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTROL CENTRE (CECOER)

40 % of the green energy that the company produces each year in Spain is supplied to wholesale end customers. This reduces the risks associated with volatility in the wholesale market. Electricity supply customers also receive continuous support and can view their consumption history, price projections, and information about the CO2 emissions avoided.
Renewable energy supply business
· 883 customers (875 in 2017).
· 3,140 supply points (2,580 in 2017).
· 6,330 GWh (5,660 in 2017).

The CECOER is the world's largest renewable energy control centre, managing a total of about 14,000 MW. The CECOER currently supervises operation and manages data from more than 400 wind, hydroelectric, photovoltaic and solar thermal facilities in 21 countries; each year it logs more than 500,000 incidents, 60 % of which are resolved remotely, and the remainder in close coordination with maintenance crews in the field

ACCIONA WAS THE FIRST COMPANY IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL TO TRACE RENEWABLE ENERGY USING BLOCKCHAIN

Energy supply
ACCIONA manages the sale of 100 % renewable energy produced by its own facilities. It also manages the sale of renewable energy generated by other independent power producers (IPPs), which benefit from the company's technical capacity and experience and from services adapted to their specific needs.
ACCIONA supplies renewable energy to large consumers in Spain and Portugal, and is the largest supplier of 100 % renewable energy in Spain. In 2018, it supplied 5,648 GWh of electricity with a guarantee of origin certified by Spain's National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), i.e. 13.6 % of the electricity sold to customers in Spain with a guarantee of origin.

62

INTEGRATED REPORT

GREENCHAIN: A PLATFORM FOR TRACING THE RENEWABLE ORIGIN OF ENERGY SUPPLIED
In 2018, ACCIONA developed a tool using blockchain technology that provides customers in Spain and Portugal with real-time information on the origin of the energy they consume.
In 2019, the company will extend the use of this technology to new markets, with a focus on countries that lack an established system for accrediting energy's renewable origin.
The company also pioneered the use of blockchain for ensuring traceability of the renewable origin of energy in generation plants with storage. Specificall , the STORECHAIN project applied this technology in two facilities in Navarra (Spain): a wind farm with storage (Barásoain) and a solar photovoltaic farm with storage (Tudela).

Long-term renewable energy contracts
There is a growing demand for Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) as a result of growing awareness among corporations interested in securing an electricity supply from renewable sources at a competitive price.

At the end of 2018, ACCIONA had a portfolio of 8 corporate PPA clients, to which it supplies about 1,800 GWh of clean energy each year.

Wastewater treatment and reuse
ACCIONA designs optimal wastewater treatment solutions at the lowest possible installation cost with a view to subsequent operation and maintenance. The company has in-depth knowledge of wastewater treatment processes and adapts them to each project's specific circumstances, in terms of population size, seasonal fluctuations, municipal or industrial water, visual and/or environmental impact, and discharge limits, making use of technology and innovation to provide optimal solutions for wastewater treatment.

Maintenance also results in lower energy consumption, ensuring optimal processing performance, controlling water quality, and assuring proper management of sludge, waste and by-products from the treatment processes.
In 2018, ACCIONA continued to increase its O&M backlog by seeking new business opportunities in industries with significant water consumption. At the end of 2018, ACCIONA had over 160 operation and maintenance contracts for water treatment plants, both municipal and industrial.

INTEGRATED REPORT

In Spain, ACCIONA is currently analysing business diversification opportunities in line with the greater opening of the non-residential real estate market.
ACCIONA has made progress in developing projects for urban and social regeneration of areas that were originally on the outskirts of cities and are now isolated in the city core as a result of expanding population. Examples: acquisition of the former power plant in calle Ombú, in Madrid (Spain), a protected building dating from 1903 that is characteristic of industrial construction at the time, whose rehabilitation is currently being studied; and the recent award of a contract to build a dike and undertake infi l works alongside the Deusto canal, reclaiming land from the sea in the latest move to regenerate the ria of Bilbao (this contract entails ACCIONA acquiring land on which approximately 58,000 m2 of housing can be built).
ACCIONA is also committed to sustainability in the design of all its projects, promoting innovative measures not only in the fie d of energy saving and the reduction of CO2 emissions, but also in aspects such as the water footprint, life-cycle analysis, alternative modes of transport, accessibility and occupants' health and comfort. This commitment is expressed through compliance with the leading international standards for sustainability; in 2018, the Adelfas development in Madrid was the first to obtain "Very Good" BREEAM certification, and is the largest development in Spain to be so certified; the Mesena office complex, acquired in 2019, is currently in the study phase with the goal of obtaining LEED Gold environmental certification for the complex as a whole, with some of its buildings aiming for LEED Platinum.
In 2019, the company will begin marketing 1,900 homes, 67 % of which will be located outside Spain.

Market volatility in 2018 resulted in greater uncertainty on the part of clients -- with a consequent reduction in inflows -- and a negative impact on fund yields, in line with the performance of the benchmark indices. Funds under management at year-end amounted to 5,476 M, and rose by 9.6 % in the first quar er of 2019.
Client numbers continue to grow rapidly, to 51,492 investors at the end of April 2019.
Long-term returns and saving
The short- and medium-term strategy is aimed at developing and consolidating a platform that favours growth in the retail segment, where the bulk of savings are concentrated in Spain, and process automation to enhance client care and management in an agile, reliable way at a minimal cost. To this end, in 2018 the company opened new offices in Spain that contribute to positioning it closer to clients. The objective is to help savers build investment portfolios that generate attractive returns, using the right asset class depending on the period of investment: fi edincome funds for the short term, and equity funds for the long term.

Corporate Governance

ACCIONA's ownership structure
On 27 March 2018, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback programme for up to 2,448,480 shares, valid for a period of one year from its approval, under Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse, and its Delegated Regulation, the goal being to reduce share capital by cancelling own shares and, to a lesser extent, to fulfi the obligations that may arise from the Share Ownership Programmes for executive Board directors, executives and employees of the Group.

The Shareholders' Meeting on 30 May 2018 resolved to reduce capital by at most 2,862,978 shares and to empower the Board of Directors to establish the other conditions of this reduction. Using that power, in March 2019 the Board of Directors approved the capital reduction and cancellation of a total of 2,402,897 own shares, as a result of which the capital stock of ACCIONA was represented by 54,856,653 fully-paid uncertifica ed ordinary shares with one euro par value each, all of the same class and serie1.
All the shares representing the capital stock have the same rights, the Articles provide no restrictions on their transferability, and all of them are listed on the Madrid and Barcelona Stock Exchanges.

Corporate Governance
New developments in 2018
· A pproval of an Audit Committee Regulation in accordance with the provisions of CNMV Technical Guide 3/2017 on audit committees at public-interest entities.
· Implementation of a continuous training programme for directors.
· Approval of a Policy for the Prevention of Crime and Bribery.
ACCIONA's corporate governance practices help protect the interests of the company and shareholders.
ACCIONA regularly reviews its terms of reference in order to incorporate best practices in the area of corporate governance, as part of its endeavour to be in the lead in the adoption of recommendations, best practices and trends in corporate governance at a domestic and international level.

In line with the recommendations in the CNMV Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the Technical Guide 3/2017 on audit committees at public-interest entities, in 2018 the Board of Directors approved a specifi regulation for the Audit Committee that addresses the following issues, among others: its composition, requirements for membership, and functions, with a view to fostering its independence.
The Board of Directors is also currently considering the inclusion of the recent recommendations contained in CNMV Technical Guide 1/2019 on nomination and remuneration committees, which was approved in February 2019. ACCIONA had already anticipated and exceeded the requirements of that guide by appointing the Lead Independent Director to chair the committee 4.
ACCIONA is in compliance with 89 % of the recommendations of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies; the only recommendation it has not applied is the separation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee into two separate committees 5.

4 A ccording to the Technical Guide, given the functions attributed to the lead independent director by the Capital Companies Act and the Good Governance Code, it might be meaningful for that director to chair the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.
5 A t present, ACCIONA does not consider it necessary to create two separate committees since it understands that, by retaining a single committee, it avoids potential conflicts of interest in the tasks related to the selection and nomination of candidates for directorships and executive positions and those related to their assessment and remuneration, thus prioritising the necessary coordination between these two functions that are essential for hiring talent. Nevertheless the company's Articles of Association do allow for this possibility, and two separate committees may be created in the future if the circumstances warrant this.

Composition of the Governing Bodies
The composition of the Board of Directors and its committees is based on the principles of transparency and independence, guided by criteria of complementarity, professionalism and diversity.

New developments in 2018
· D ecision not to renew the Executive Committee: Because of its schedule, the Board has been able to perform all the functions in recent years.
· It was decided that the Board committees would have three members each.
· Interaction between committees was encouraged by holding joint meetings of the Audit Committee and Sustainability Committee to discuss non-financia disclosures.

I CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Further information on the Director Selection Policy https://www.acciona.com/shareholders-investors/corporategovernance/corporate-policies-book/
New developments in 2018
· M r. Jaime Castellanos Borrego and Mr. Fernando Rodés Vila reached the end of their term as directors of ACCIONA and were not re-appointed.
· M r. Javier Sendagorta Gómez del Campillo and Mr. José María Pacheco Guardiola were appointed as independent directors in their place.
· Ms. Belén Villalonga Morenés was reclassified as an "Other non-executive" director, as required by the Capital Companies Act, since she had held office as an independent director for 12 years.
Effectiveness of the Board of Directors and its committees
At Board of Directors meetings, directors are encouraged to be critical and to participate actively, with full respect for freedom of opinion. This ensures an effective process for the adoption of decisions by consensus, i.e. the interplay of the directors' opinions based on their experience.
There is also direct fluid communication between Board members and Group executives, who report regularly on company performance, corporate transactions and progress with meeting objectives. In this way, the Board of Directors contributes actively to defining the organisation's strategy and participates in overseeing its implementation. Once per quarter, the Board undertakes an in-depth review of the degree to which the objectives for the year are being achieved.

AN ATTITUDE OF CRITICAL THINKING AND SCEPTICISM IS ENCOURAGED IN BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS TO ENSURE A LIVELY, DYNAMIC DEBATE IN THE COMPANY'S BEST INTERESTS
ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors performed a selfassessment of the quality and efficie cy of its performance in 2018. That selfassessment did not lead to material changes in the Board's internal organisation.
In 2017, ACCIONA engaged an external consultant to assist with the assessment of its governing bodies. Among the main conclusions were that the agenda should provide greater detail of the business to be transacted by the Board and its Committees and that information should be circulated longer in advance. The company is already applying the improvements proposed in the external consultants' report.
MOST OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARISING FROM THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' PERFORMANCE IN 2017 WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 2018

102

INTEGRATED REPORT

Information provided to directors
Before the beginning of each year, the Board of Directors and its committees establish a detailed meeting schedule and an agenda of matters to be discussed in ordinary meetings. Notice of meetings is given at least three days in advance. Notice includes the agenda and the necessary written documentation so that directors can analyse it in depth. Directors are also reminded that they can request the inclusion in the agenda of any business that they consider appropriate and ask for any information they consider to be necessary to supplement that which has been supplied.
Business transacted at meetings is duly minuted.
Director training
In order to provide directors with the necessary familiarity with the company and its group, the Board of Directors has an induction and ongoing training programme. All members of the Board receive daily press dossiers and are informed of significant changes in legislation. Additionally, in 2018 a specific induction and training programmes were established for members of the Audit Committee.
Since 2018, the Board attaches considerable importance to the issue of cybersecurity, and the Internal Audit team, reporting to the Audit Committee, recently hired an expert in IT systems security audits.
The ongoing training programme for Board members will be expanded in 2019 to include sessions on sustainability.
Board members are entitled to request support from outside advisors in legal, accounting, financial or other matters in order to discharge their duties.

The Code of Conduct fosters a form of business conduct that is accepted and respected by all employees and executives.Oversight and compliance with the Code of Conduct are performed by the Code of Conduct Commission, the Whistleblower Channel and the Protocol for action in cases of harassment.
On an operating level, in line with the company's commitment to combat corruption and bribery, a Crime Prevention and Anti-Corruption Model has been implemented. This model establishes the general control environment for the Group in line with international best practices.
In 2018, ACCIONA, S.A. was certified by AENOR to the ISO 37001 standard on Anti-bribery management system and the UNE 19601 standard on Crime compliance management system, which certify that the company has management systems that meet those standards.
With regard to due diligence in connection with third parties, ACCIONA has implemented a tool for properly identifying and obtaining knowledge about third parties with which it interacts. By the end of 2018, over 320 third parties (project partners and commercial consultants) had been assessed.
Training in this area continued in 2018. During the year, 436 senior and middle managers took the Anti-corruption course and 2,965 employees took the Code of Conduct course (which has been taken by 9,143 employees to date).

Ethics and compliance
ACCIONA's guidelines for action derive from the Code of Conduct, the Policy Book, the commitments against corruption and bribery, and respect for free competition. Compliance with these corporate standards is a priority for the organisation. To this end, the Compliance Department and the Corporate Internal Audit Department supervise the effectiveness of ACCIONA's compliance framework. In 2018, the Compliance Director reported twice to the Audit Committee, whose chairman reports to the Board of Directors after each meeting.

I APPENDIX II INFORMATION ABOUT GREEN FUNDING PROJECTS

Appendix II Information about green funding projects

General information In November 2016, ACCIONA arranged a Schuldschein loan for 150 M, which was subsequently expanded by a 17 M tap, to fund renewable energy facilities; the deal was structured in tranches maturing in 3 and 5 years and accrues interest at market rates. The purpose is to fund renewable energy facilities.
Two 100 M loans were arranged with BBVA on April 7th and May 5th in 2017, and a 50 M loan was arranged with Unicredit Bank Austria AG.
Additionally, four private placements were made under the EMTN programme, on November 25th 2016, June 6th and September 20th 2017, and January 26th 2018, for a total of 104.9 M.

Projects and associated indicators:
The funding was used for the San Gabriel wind farm and the El Romero Solar photovoltaic plant, both in Chile, which together represent an estimated investment of 589.6 M USD.
Those projects and their associated social and environmental indicators are shown below.
San Gabriel wind farm
Located in the La Araucania region; construction commenced in November 2017. Its commercial operation date (COD) is projected for 2020. Accordingly, the installed capacity as of 31 December 2018 was 0 MW.
El Romero Solar photovoltaic plant
Located in the Atacama desert, it comprises 776,000 photovoltaic modules. It was built in 13 months and connected to the grid in November 2016.

Independent Assurance Report of the non-financial indicators included in Appendix II "Information about green funding projects" in the 2018 Integrated Report of ACCIONA, S.A.
(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In case of discrepancy, the Spanish language version prevails.)
To the Management of Acciona, S.A.
We have been engaged by Acciona, S.A. (hereinafter, Acciona) to review a report on the non-financial performance indicators included in "Appendix II. Information about green funding projects" within its Integrated Report for the year ended at 31 December 2018 (hereinafter Appendix II), selected from those proposed by the Commission Second-party opinion letter associated with the green bond issued in order to comply with the Green Bond Principles' fourth principle.
Our report is presented in the form of an independent conclusion with a limited assurance indicating that, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, there is nothing that has caught our attention and makes us think that the indicators are not reliable and do not comply, in all its material aspects, with the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards).
The revised information is limited to the content of Appendix II above mentioned, in which Acciona has included selected non-financial indicators to comply with the current and projected progress of the environmental and social performance at San Gabriel wind farm (currently under construction) and El Romero Solar photovoltaic plant, both located in Chile.

Acciona´s management is responsible for the selection, preparation and presentation of Appendix II in accordance with the fourth principle of the Green Bond Principles (Guidelines and procedures for the issuance of green bonds) published by the International Capital Market Association and the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). It is also responsible for the selection and presentation of the non-financial indicators of Appendix II from those proposed by the Secondparty opinion letter associated with the green bond issued, including the establishment and maintenance of the control and performance management systems from which the information is obtained.
These responsibilities include the establishment of appropriate controls where Acciona´s management considers necessary to enable that the preparation of indicators with a limited assurance review would be free of material errors due to fraud or errors.
