RAFAKO S.A. delivers these products and services in the EPC model (end-to-end project management including design, procurement, manufacture, assembly/construction, and commissioning) or in a non-EPC model (design, procurement, manufacture, assembly/construction in various combinations, with procurement and manufacture as mandatory elements).

The Company operates its own production plants. The main plant, manufacturing mainly pressure equipment, is located in Racibórz, along with the plant management office, design and technology offices, as well as five production floors. Electrostatic precipitators and their components are manufactured in Wyry. RAFAKO S.A.'s total production capacity for 2017 was in excess of 1.0 million man-hours per year, with the potential to be increased to over 1.25 million man-hours per year. The Group is currently Poland's and EU's leader in terms of the production capacity for pressure equipment.

RAFAKO S.A. has operated in the power sector since 1949. The Company's product offering, initially comprising mainly steam generators and their components, was gradually expanded to include complete flue gas desulfurisation units, dust extraction units, NOx control systems, etc. From a typical manufacturer, the Company was transformed into a general contractor for power construction projects. In 2014, the Company became one of the few companies offering and delivering power generation units under EPC contracts, when it launched, practically on a stand-alone basis, the construction of a 910 MW unit for the Jaworzno Power Plant (the "Jaworzno 910 MW Project").

Since its inception, the Company has been a leading supplier of steam generators for the country's power and industrial sectors. The combined capacity of RAFAKO-delivered steam generators accounts for a significant part of the total capacity installed in Polish commercial and industrial power plants. The most important facilities which use steam generators delivered by the Company include the power plants in Belchatów, Opole, Turów, Dolna Odra, Rybnik (all owned by PGE), Ptnów-Adamów-Konin, Kozienice (Enea), and the power plants owned by Tauron Wytwarzanie, as well as Warsaw CHP Plants ­ Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie (PGNiG Termika), Wroclaw CHP Plants ­ Zespól Elektrocieplowni Wroclawskich Kogeneracja, Lód CHP Plants ­ Zespól Elektrocieplowni Lód (Veolia), and Zielona Góra CHP Plant ­ Elektrocieplownia Zielona Góra (PGE). The Company has also delivered circulating fluidised bed (CFB) steam generators to the era CHP Plant (PGNiG Termika), Bielsko-Biala II CHP Plant (Tauron Wytwarzanie), Siersza Power Plant (Tauron Wytwarzanie), and Zaklady

Farmaceutyczne Polpharma Starogard Gdaski. In 2016, an OFz-140 fluidised bed boiler was placed in service at Synthos Dwory 7 in Owicim.
In 2008, a 464 MW unit was commissioned at the Ptnów II Power Plant for which RAFAKO S.A., in cooperation with SNC Lavalin, had supplied the steam generator and flue gas delsulfurisation (FGD) unit. The supercritical power generating unit at the Ptnów II Power Plant was the first such project in Poland, both in terms of the capital expenditure incurred and generating capacity delivered. It is a high-efficiency unit, which helps significantly reduce harmful gas emissions.
In 2011, an 858 MW unit was commissioned at the Belchatów Power Plant for which RAFAKO S.A. had been the supplier of the boiler island comprising a steam generator, electrostatic precipitator, and flue gas desulfurisation unit. The newly built unit in Belchatów is the most powerful lignite-fired generating unit in Poland.
Foreign sales account for a significant part of RAFAKO S.A.'s total sales. The largest steam generators manufactured by RAFAKO S.A. operate in former Yugoslavia's power plants; a number of large units have also been delivered to the Czech Republic, China, Turkey, and India. RAFAKO S.A. is also an important player on the European market for steam-generator components. In 2017, RAFAKO S.A. delivered products to customers from such countries as France, Finland, Lithuania, Serbia, and Denmark.
The Company is solidifying its position on the European market of waste incineration solutions. In 2011, RAFAKO S.A. supplied three heat recovery steam generators to a waste incineration facility in Turin, Italy, and further two heat recovery steam generators to Baku, Azerbaijan. In December 2013, a steam generator was placed in service at a municipal waste incineration plant in Roskilde, Denmark. In 2014, we delivered a waste incineration boiler to Billingham, Cleveland County, UK. At the beginning of 2016, a contract for delivery of a boiler for a municipal waste incineration facility in Calvert, Buckinghamshire, UK, was completed. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed a project involving supply, assembly and start-up of a municipal waste incineration boiler for Hereford & Worcestershire in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the Company began to perform a contract for delivery of the process section for two lines of the Thermal Waste Treatment Plant for the Szczecin Metropolitan Area. In December 2017, the commissioning of a municipal waste incineration plant started.
In 2012, a fluidised bed boiler was commissioned at the Jaworzno Power Plant (the Tauron Group). The boiler is fired with biomass only, as opposed to coal-fired and biomass co-fired units already operated at the plant. In 2014, the contract at the Stalowa Wola Power Plant for conversion of an existing PCC boiler into a biomass-fired unit was completed. These innovative projects highlight RAFAKO S.A.'s established position as a supplier of renewable power generation technologies. They are also aligned with Poland's strategy to increase the share of renewables in power generation, as well as with the Company's own pro-environmental strategy.
RAFAKO S.A. is also a leading manufacturer of large environmental protection facilities in Poland. Units of this type have been delivered by the Company to the Jaworzno III Power Plant, Belchatów Power Plant, Ptnów Power Plant, Ostrolka B Power Plant, Dolna Odra Power Plant, Siekierki CHP Plant, Lód CHP Plant, Siersza Power Plant, Skawina Power Plant, Trzebowice Power Plant (for Veolia, the Czech Republic), Kozienice Power Plant, and Polaniec Power Plant.
In 2012, RAFAKO S.A. delivered one of its largest projects, a wet flue gas desulfurisation unit for the Siekierki CHP Plant owned by PGNiG Termika S.A. The unit is among the largest environmental projects in Poland, and is also one of the largest stand-alone structures ever built by RAFAKO S.A. In 2014, RAFAKO S.A. completed an upgrade of the FGD systems on units 5 and 6 at the Belchatów Power Plant. In 2015 and 2016, wet FGD units were placed in service in Gdask, Gdynia, Kraków and Wroclaw, as part of the EDF Group's comprehensive plan of bringing its generation assets in line with new environmental requirements.
In 2007-2008, RAFAKO S.A. commissioned high-efficiency semi-dry flue gas desulfurisation units at the Lód CHP Plant and Skawina Power Plant. The same technology was also used for the construction of a new CHP Plant for Grupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowe Kdzierzyn S.A., completed in March 2017. The semi-dry system, engineered exclusively by RAFAKO S.A., is a more cost-efficient solution than the wet method.
In 2011, the Company gained a foothold in a new area of pro-environmental projects in the power sector, i.e. the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, commencing the manufacture of state-of-the-art SCR units on a turn-key basis. The first such unit was built for the K8 boiler at PKN Orlen, and the construction of another SCR system commenced in June 2011 at the Kozienice Power Plant. With respect to this system, on December 20th 2017 the final acceptance report was signed for Unit 8, which marked the completion of the contract for Enea

Wytwarzanie Sp. z o.o. In 2012, a contract for delivery of catalytic flue gas NOx reduction systems for six power generating units at Elektrownia Polaniec S.A. was signed with GDF SUEZ Energia Polska S.A. (currently Enea Polaniec S.A.). In 2014, a consortium formed by RAFAKO S.A. and OMIS S.A. executed a contract with ENERGA Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A. for the construction of flue gas NOx reduction systems for units 1, 2 and 3 at Elektrownia Ostrolka S.A. In September 2016, RAFAKO S.A. and ENEA Wytwarzanie Sp. z o.o. executed a contract for delivery and installation of a catalytic flue gas NOx reduction system for AP-1650 boilers No. 9 and 10, and for upgrade of electrostatic precipitators at the Kozienice Power Plant.
In 2009, dust extraction equipment, including electrostatic precipitators and bag filters, was added to the Company's product offering. In 2010-2013, a number of electrostaWc precipitators were put in operaWon, including on units 10, 4, 3 and 8 at the Kozienice Power Plant; on BB-1150 steam generator of unit 4 (in 2010) and units K5 and K6 (in 2011) at the Belchatów Power Plant, as well as an electrostatic precipitator with a modernised slag and ash transport system on unit 6-215 MW at the Tuzla CHP Plant (in 2012). In 2014, two electrostatic precipitators were installed by RAFAKO S.A. at the Westfalen Power Plant in Germany and two at the Eemshaven Power Plant in the Netherlands. In December 2016, RAFAKO completed upgrade of electrostatic precipitators at the Morava Power Plant in Serbia.
2014 was a breakthrough year for RAFAKO S.A. A contract was signed for the construction of a 910 MW power generation unit at the Jaworzno III Power Plant, where RAFAKO will execute this turn-key project on a practically stand-alone basis and, in terms of technologies, will supply the entire boiler island.
In February 2014, the long-awaited contract for extension of the Opole Power Plant came into effect. Under the contract, two new supercritical 900 MW power generation units are being built, In what is the largest project in the Polish power sector since 1989. RAFAKO S.A.'s entire scope of work and services under the contract was subcontracted to GE Power Sp. z o.o. (previously Alstom Power Sp. z o.o.).
The projects are based on the state-of-the-art technology of electricity generation in supercritical steam generators and turbines, which increases the efficiency of generating units to 45% or more. The Company has long cooperated with Polish scientists on a concept of generating units with efficiencies in excess of 50% (ultrasupercritical units). The implementation of the concept will mark another milestone in the history of both the Company and the Polish power sector, which cannot afford to discontinue the use of domestically produced coal as the key fuel.
In early 2017, RAFAKO delivered, on an EPC basis, a new CHP plant for Grupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowe Kdzierzyn S.A., comprising a coal-fired generating unit with a high-efficiency steam generator, state-of-the-art flue gas treatment technology and a steam turbine.
In October 2017, the final certificate was signed for a project carried out for Javno Preduzece Elektroprivreda Srbije of Serbia, upon which the warranty period commenced. The project, with a value of approximately EUR 14m, was to replace the component parts of a combustion chamber of steam generator B2 at TENT B Obrenovac.
The Company provides after-sale support and servicing for all products and equipment supplied. The Company also offers upgrades of existing equipment to enhance its operating parameters and mitigate negative environmental impacts.
Certificates held by RAFAKO S.A. (EMAS, AD 2000-Merkblatt HP0, ASME CODE, SVTI / ASIT, EN 1090 and EN 38342) confirm its compliance with the ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004, PN-N 18001 standards, Directive 2014/68/EC and Regulation (EC) 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. They also provide assurance to RAFAKO S.A.'s customers that RAFAKO-manufactured equipment complies with the technical safety requirements applicable in Poland, the EU, and the US.
In 2011, the RAFAKO Group became a part of the PBG Group, with PBG S.A. as the parent. The PBG Group operates on the market for specialist construction services. The key segments of the Group's business currently include the construction of facilities and structures for the power, natural gas, crude oil and fuel sectors. From June 2012, PBG was in company voluntary arrangement. In August 2015, the meeting of PBG's creditors voted on and approved the arrangement. In October 2015, the arrangement was approved by the court. The arrangement became final on June 13th 2016.
For the shareholding structure as at December 31st 2017, see Appendix 9.

3.2. Revenue: amount and structure
In 2017, revenue from sales of products, merchandise and materials was PLN 616,631 thousand, having decreased year on year by PLN 121,596 thousand (or 16.5%). The sales of products and services amounted to PLN 614,071 thousand, of which revenue from construction contracts was PLN 605,745 thousand. Revenue from sale of materials was PLN 2,560 thousand.
The decrease in sales recorded in 2017 was mainly due to lower revenue from sale of generating units and steam generators on the domestic market. The lower sales in this product group were mainly attributable to the completion of the contract to construct a CHP plant at Grupa Azoty ZAK S.A. (value of approximately PLN 320m; revenue in 2017: PLN 19,379 thousand, revenue in 2016: PLN 144,222 thousand) and a decreased share in the Jaworzno 910 MW Project, which generated revenue of PLN 108,601 thousand against PLN 175,868 thousand in 2016. Sales of generating units and steam generators in Poland amounted to PLN 168,638 thousand, down by 54.6% year on year (PLN 371,593 thousand in 2016).
On the domestic market, there was an increase in sales of air pollution control systems. The strong sales of these systems followed mainly from the performance of contracts signed with Enea Wytwarzanie Sp. z o.o. The contracts primarily provided for the construction of an SCR unit at the Kozienice Power Plant and FGD units for the K7 and K8 boilers of the Bialystok CHP Plant. Sales of air pollution control systems in Poland amounted to PLN 254,622 thousand, up by 46.0% year on year (PLN 174,341 thousand in 2016).
Sales of power equipment, machinery and components also increased on the domestic market. Sales in this product range reached PLN 36,477 thousand, having grown by 73.7% relative to 2016, when they amounted to PLN 21,006 thousand.
The share of export sales in total sales was 24.3%, having increased year on year by 2.1pp. In 2017, export sales amounted to PLN 149,754 thousand, down by 8.5% from PLN 163,749 thousand reported in 2016.
A decline in export sales was recorded in air pollution control systems as well as power equipment, machinery and components. Exports of air pollution control systems amounted to PLN 387 thousand (2016: PLN 17,661 thousand), having decreased by PLN 97.8% year on year. Revenue from sales of power equipment, machinery and componentstotalled PLN 73,317 thousand and were down by 22.9% on 2016, mainly due to the sale of the pressure section of a steam generator for a waste incineration plant to CNIM (Constructions industrielles de la Méditerranée). Sales of power generation units and steam generators went up to PLN 23,674 thousand from PLN 12,136 thousand in 2016. In the other product groups, exports grew to PLN 52,376 thousand, mainly on account of the manufacture of pressure parts for Valmet Power OY, Valmet Technologies Inc., and Babcock & Wilcox Volund Aps.

individual projects (customised production). The Company's operations are not affected by limited availability of production materials, supplies or procurement services. Suppliers are chosen based on their ability to provide materials and equipment that meet the relevant technical and quality standards within specified deadlines and in the most cost-effective manner. The procurement process is based on market analysis, with the pool of suppliers including only manufacturers recognised for the quality of their products and compliance with the safety, environmental and other relevant standards.
With some contracts, the list of potential manufacturers and service providers must be approved by RAFAKO S.A.'s employers.

3.4. Related-party transactions
In 2017, the Company did not enter into any material transactions with related parties on non-arm's length terms.
For a detailed list of related-party transactions in 2017, see Note 44 to the full-year financial statements of the Company for 2017.

3.5. Operating expenses: amount and structure. Gross profit/(loss)
In 2017, cost of sales of products, services and materials was PLN 572,644 thousand, with revenue of PLN 616,631 thousand. Thus, the Company posted gross profit of PLN 43,987 thousand, up by PLN 25,464 thousand year on year.
The increase in gross profit was chiefly attributable to a higher weighted average margin on contracts performed in 2017 compared with 2016. However, the higher average margin was accompanied by worse performance under some of the contracts. Following a periodic analysis of costs incurred to perform long-term contracts and a revision of assumptions regarding future revenue and costs, the Management Board of the Company decided to make adjustments to the valuation of those contracts as at December 31st 2017, including adjustments with a negative impact on the net profit. The adjustments included in particular the recognition of a PLN 10m loss incurred in connection with the replacement of some of the equipment under a contract to construct a fluidised bed boiler and the recognition of an additional provision for an expected loss of PLN 9.2m under a contract to construct a flue gas denitrification unit, which may be incurred if a proceed order for the project is issued.
Gross profit margin went up year on year, to 7.1% (2016: 2.5%).
Administrative expenses were PLN 42,893 thousand, having decreased by PLN 1,392 thousand year on year.
Distribution costs were PLN 35,383 thousand in 2017, having increased by PLN 3,805 thousand year on year. Distribution costs net of impairment losses on trade receivables and write-off of previously impaired trade receivables amounted to PLN 32,242 thousand in 2017, and were higher than the previous year's figure by PLN 881 thousand. Impairment losses on trade receivables and write-off of previously impaired trade receivables went up by PLN 2,942 thousand in 2017.
After accounting for distribution costs and administrative expenses, the Company generated a loss on sales of PLN 34,289 thousand in 2017, compared with a loss on sales of PLN 57,340 thousand in 2016. The loss was mainly attributable to relatively low sales, apart from the aforementioned adjustments to the valuation of longterm contracts.

3.6. Other income and expenses and net finance income/costs

3.6.1. Net other income/(expenses)
In 2017, the Company recorded net other expenses of PLN 5,221 thousand (compared with net other expenses of PLN 5,633 thousand in 2016), attributable to:

1. recognition of restructuring provision 2. donations 3. recognition of impairment loss on other receivables

The restructuring provision was recognised in connection with the RAFAKO Management Board's decision to launch the redundancy programme. In addition to the redundancy programme, the restructuring process will involve a number of optimisation measures to be implemented across the organisation, which will help generate the planned cost savings.
Income from sureties was mainly received pursuant to the Surety Agreement executed to secure the liabilities of E003B7 Sp. z o.o. arising in connection with the agreement for issuance of guarantees for the benefit of TAURON Wytwarzanie S.A. in connection with the Jaworzno 910 MW Project.

3.6.2. Net finance income/costs
In 2017, the Company recorded net finance costs of PLN 9,699 thousand (2016: net finance costs of PLN 4,545 thousand), attributable to:

1. net foreign exchange losses 2. interest on financial instruments, including interest on bank loans and
other borrowings, lease, past due liabilities, and bank loan fees 3. interest on employee benefit obligations 4. recognition of provisions for interest expense 6. interest on security deposits provided 7. costs of valuation of long-term settlements 8. negative net balance of other finance income and costs

3.7. Income: amount and structure
In 2017, the Company incurred a loss on sales of PLN 34,289 thousand. After accounting for net other expenses (PLN 5,221 thousand), net finance costs (PLN 9,699 thousand) and income tax (PLN 16,839 thousand), the Company generated net loss of PLN 66,048 thousand, compared with loss of PLN 62,241 thousand reported in 2016. The Company did not publish any financial forecasts or profit guidance for 2017. For the structure and change of pre-tax profit/(loss) in 2017, 2016 and 2015, see Appendix 4.
3.8. Margins and ROE
In 2017, the Company reported an improvement in its operating profit margin compared with a year earlier. Gross profit margin rose to 7.1% and was 4.6pp higher than in 2016, while operating profit margin amounted to 6.4% (compared with -8.5% in 2016). As a result of net loss (PLN 66,048 thousand), return on equity was negative at -15.5%. In 2016, ROE was -18.9%. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 profitability ratios are presented in Appendix 1.
3.9. Financial liquidity
As at the end of 2017, the RAFAKO Group's liquidity ratios changed relative to the end of 2016. The current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) increased by 0.24, to 1.46.

16/39

RAFAKO S.A. Directors' Report on the operations of the RAFAKO Group for the year ended December 31st 2017
Relative to 2016, in 2017 the average collection period and the average collection period for amounts due from customers for construction contract work extended by 20 days (to 112 days) and 9 days (to 93 days) respectively. Inventory turnover changed only slightly and was 8 days. The average payment period extended by 57 days (to 117 days), while the average payment period for amounts payable for construction contract work shortened by 15 days (to 36 days).
In 2017, liabilities to the Social Security Institution (ZUS), State Treasury and employees were settled in a timely manner, although there were delays in payments to suppliers. The Company was able to maintain its financial liquidity chiefly due to the rigorous and consistent application of its rules of payment to subcontractors and efficient collection of receivables from customers.
The Company continued its multi-purpose credit facility agreement with PKO BP S.A. Several annexes to the agreement were signed, the most recent one extending the availability period until June 30th 2018 and amending certain provisions of the agreement. For detailed information on the amendments, see Section III.4 `Other material events' on page 28.
Changes in the facility's interest rate affected the Company's finance costs. Further, the use of the credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate of 1M WIBOR plus margin exposed the Company to the risk of higher interest expenses typical of such financing instruments.
In terms of financial liquidity, the need to engage substantial cash to secure contract bonds (performance bonds and advance payment guarantees), provided by financial institutions, is a significant burden on the Company.
Ultimately, the Company seeks to have all of its contractual obligations secured exclusively with financial guarantees (with assignment of receivables under the contract as security in respect of the Group's obligations towards financial institutions). Such security arrangements will allow the Company to freely manage its own financial resources and avoid using these resources directly as security, which will improve the Company's financial liquidity.
Access to new bank/insurance guarantees will be of paramount importance for the Group to be able to maintain liquidity. Unavailability of a satisfactory amount of guarantee limits may restrict the Company's ability to conclude revenue-generating contracts. In 2017, RAFAKO S.A. secured new guarantee limits totalling PLN 165.1m.
In 2017, the Company carried out a share issue with the main objective of raising funds to finance future foreign contracts and the working capital required for the performance of contracts in Poland (approximately 65.0% of the funds raised from the issue); to finance the Company's own contribution towards putting new products, including polygeneration islands, into production, and towards projects related to gasification of waste and biomass (approximately 25.0% of the issue proceeds); and to finance R&D projects carried out by the Company (approximately 10.0% of the issue proceeds).
The Company is also exposed to currency risk. Changes in PLN exchange rates, especially if frequent and significant, may materially affect both the profitability of contracts and the amount of currency translation differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and translated into PLN.
The Company's currency risk management strategy provides for the use of natural hedging to the extent possible. The Company seeks to achieve the highest possible level of structural matching of income and expenses denominated in the same currency and related to the running contracts. Apart from natural hedging, the Company may hedge between 30% and 70% of its net exposure to foreign exchange risk by means of approved derivative instruments (e.g. FX forwards) available on the market. In the second half of 2017, the Company entered into futures/forward transactions to hedge the USD/PLN exchange rate risk. As at December 31st 2017, the Company had open hedging positions for a total amount of USD 4m.For the objectives and rules of financial risk management, see Note 47 to the financial statements for 2017.
3.10. Debt
In 2017, RAFAKO S.A.'s liabilities towards its creditors decreased by PLN 21,476 thousand. As at December 31st 2017, total non-current and current liabilities were PLN 478,868 thousand, compared with PLN 500,344 thousand as at December 31st 2016.
17/39

RAFAKO S.A. Directors' Report on the operations of the RAFAKO Group for the year ended December 31st 2017 The change was mainly caused by a decrease of PLN 18,531 thousand in short-term liabilities, attributable primarily to a PLN 50,544 thousand decrease in bank and other borrowings and a PLN 43,581 thousand decrease in liabilities, provision for construction contract work, and deferred income. At the same time, trade payables increased by PLN 65,049 thousand. In 2017, non-current liabilities fell by PLN 2,945 thousand year on year. As at December 31st 2017, the Company's assets not encumbered with on-balance-sheet (non-current and current) liabilities amounted to PLN 426,074 thousand, compared with PLN 328,760 thousand as at December 31st 2016. The debt (non-current and current liabilities) to assets ratio declined to 52.9%, from 60.3% in 2016. The change results mainly from an increase in the value of assets. Debt to assets ratio does not take account of the Company's contingent liabilities under bank and insurance guarantees (mainly performance bonds and advance payment guarantees granted on the Group's instructions; such guarantees are typical for RAFAKO S.A.'s business and the market of power generation equipment), letters of credit and promissory notes issued as security. As at December 31st 2017, the Company's contingent liabilities under these instruments totalled PLN 1,629,882 thousand (PLN 1,602,229 thousand as at December 31st 2016). The main item of these liabilities was a surety of PLN 1,294,375 thousand issued for the benefit of financial institutions which provided financial security in respect of the Jaworzno 910 MW Project; the surety was provided to secure proper discharge of obligations by the Jaworzno project SPV in connection with financial guarantee agreements. In the first three months of 2017, guarantees (mainly performance bonds of PLN 142,678 thousand and bid bonds of PLN 47,716 thousand) were issued by banks and insurance companies to the Group's trading partners at the request of the parent. In this category of liabilities, the largest item was a performance bond of PLN 11,972 thousand, issued in May 2017. In connection with its ongoing contracts, besides contingent (off-balance-sheet) liabilities, the Company also had contingent receivables, which amounted to PLN 201,584 thousand as at December 31st 2017 (PLN 233,779 thousand as at December 31st 2016). The main item among these receivables was bank and insurance guarantees totalling PLN 182,715 thousand. In 2017, the value of guarantees received was PLN 73,707 thousand. For details of changes in contingent receivables and liabilities, see Note 40 to the financial statements for 2017. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 liquidity and debt ratios are presented in Appendix 1.

A decrease was, however, recorded in a deferred tax asset (PLN 17,036 thousand) and in gross amount due from customers for construction contract work and prepayments related to accounting for the contracts (PLN 13,602 thousand).
Long-term capital (equity plus non-current liabilities) covered the full amount of non-current assets and 31.5% of current assets.

As at December 31st 2017, the assets financing structure was as follows:
1. non-current assets of PLN 265,443 thousand were fully financed with long-term capital, 2. current assets (and non-current assets held for sale) of PLN 639,499 thousand were financed with:

3.12.1. Structure of non-current assets
The structure of non-current assets changed as a result of execution of investment projects, sale of assets, retirement or disposal of redundant property, plant and equipment, remeasurement of assets, and changes in the deferred tax asset. As at December 31st 2017 and December 31st 2016, it was as follows:

The most important item of non-current assets was represented by land and buildings, which accounted for 33.4% of non-current assets and about 9.8% of total assets. Other significant items included plant and equipment and other financial assets. At the end of 2017, these accounted for 17.4% and 15.4%, respectively, of total assets. Plant and equipment include mostly machinery, equipment and apparatuses used in manufacturing processes, as well as computer hardware.
In 2017, non-current assets decreased by PLN 6,614 thousand (2.4%) compared with the previous year. The change in non-current assets was attributable to a PLN 17,036 thousand decrease in a deferred tax asset, a PLN 7,604 thousand decline in property, plant and equipment, and a PLN 6,020 thousand increase in other noncurrent financial assets. Other non-current financial assets consisted mainly of bonds worth PLN 24,769 thousand which the Group acquired in 2017 as part of the conversion of receivables from PBG S.A. For details, see section III.4.
3.12.2. Key investments in property, plant and equipment
In 2017, the Company incurred capital expenditure on non-financial non-current assets of PLN 2,896 thousand, including:
· PLN 2,132 thousand on property, plant and equipment, · PLN 764 thousand on intangible assets.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment primarily involved purchase of plant and equipment, including IT hardware, and upgrades to buildings and structures.
Expenditure on intangible assets was incurred mainly in connection with the implementation of a new controlling system, upgrade of the server rooms, and implementation of a document workflow system.
The expenditure was financed with internally generated funds and through lease agreements.
3.13. Current assets
In 2017, current assets increased by PLN 82,351 thousand, to PLN 639,391 thousand.
The change in current assets is primarily a consequence of a PLN 93,039 thousand increase in cash and cash equivalents, to PLN 158,921 thousand. Another major contributing factor was a decrease in gross amount due

20/39

RAFAKO S.A. Directors' Report on the operations of the RAFAKO Group for the year ended December 31st 2017
from customers for construction contract work and prepayments related to accounting for the contracts (PLN 13,602 thousand), and income tax receivable (PLN 10,918 thousand).
Material receivables included deposits provided as security for contract guarantees (issued mainly by banks on the Company's instructions). At the end of December 2017, the amount of deposits provided as security for guarantees was PLN 62.2m (PLN 68.1m at the end of December 2016).

Statutory reserve funds of PLN 69,061 thousand (a PLN 62,240 thousand decrease was attributable to
the allocation of the 2016 net loss to statutory reserve funds); 4. Accumulated losses of PLN 71,222 thousand; 5. Exchange differences on translating foreign operations of PLN (-)337 thousand.
In 2017, the Company did not acquire its own shares.

III. Key events and developments in 2017 and in the period from the end of the financial year to the date of the report
The key events and developments related to the activities of RAFAKO S.A. are presented below.
1. Contract with TAURON (Jaworzno Power Plant)
On April 17th 2014, RAFAKO S.A., acting as the leader of a consortium with Mostostal Warszawa S.A., executed a contract with Tauron Wytwarzanie S.A. for the construction of a power generation unit at the Jaworzno III Power Plant - Power Plant II. The value of the contract is PLN 4.5bn. The subject matter of the contract is design and delivery, on a turn-key basis, of a supercritical 910 MW power generation unit consisting of a steam generator, turbine generator set, main building, and electrical and I&C systems.
The coal-fired unit will be one of the most advanced facilities of this kind.
Key parameters

Supercritical pulverised-fuel, tower-type, oncethrough steam generator, Unit's nominal output (gross) ­ 910 MW, Generator's rated thermal input ­ 1,832 MWt, Rated capacity ­ 2,390 t/h, Temperature of steam at outlet (live/superheated) ­ 603/621°C, Pressure of live steam at outlet ­ 28.5 MPa, Pressure of superheated steam at outlet ­ 6.2 MPa, Efficiency in standard conditions >95%, Availability > 95%, Net generation efficiency > 45.91%.

Unit's components
Superheated steam generator,
Steam turbine powering the electricity generator,
Feed water pump system, Systems designed to meet the sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide and dust emission standards specified in the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED),
Systems for disposal of combustion waste, as well as for delivery and preparation of various auxiliary media.

The Jaworzno unit will be a high-efficiency base-load electricity generation facility operating within the power system. The operating life of the unit will be at least 200 thousand hours or 30 years.
Environmental implications:
According to the project owner's estimates, once the project is complete, sulfur dioxide emissions will be sixteen times lower than from the 120 MW units which are to be decommissioned, nitric oxide emissions will be more than five times lower, and dust emissions will be reduced eleven times. Carbon dioxide emissions will be cut by nearly two million tonnes a year.

Key events in 2017 and 2018

2017

January

Delivery of the turbine island. On March 1st, RAFAKO S.A. and Mostostal Warszawa signed annex 5 to the contract for the Jaworzno 910 MW Project with Tauron Wytwarzanie (the employer).

March

Under the annex, the contract price was increased by PLN 71.05m due to the need to change the design and place the structure accommodating the power generating unit on deep foundations; and also to account for the additional work commissioned from the contractor (i.e. the parent and Mostostal Warszawa S.A.) which involves laying the foundations in the fifth zone (the electrostatic precipitator zone) and extension of the electrostatic precipitator switchgear building. The additional works will enable the employer to bring the unit partly in line with future requirements of the BAT Conclusions. The employer did not acknowledge the claims arising from changes in the design standards (Eurocodes) as valid.

Under the annex, the contract completion deadline was extended by eight months and five days, and therefore the unit commissioning report will be signed by November 2019.

Execution of the annex will result in amendments to the project financing documentation, contract performance timetable, project budget and the subcontractor agreement between SPV Jaworzno and the parent.

(Polimex) for erection of the boiler's pressurised section, performance of tests and participation in the start-up, in connection with the Jaworzno 910MW Project. The contract's value was PLN 118,750 thousand. The Management Board of RAFAKO S.A. believes that the termination of the contract does not give rise to any negative consequences for SPV Jaworzno or RAFAKO S.A. as the contract was terminated at Polimex's request and on the date of the termination SPV Jaworzno and Polimex signed with Polimex's subcontractors (Przedsibiorstwo Modernizacji Urzdze Energetycznych REMAK S.A. and JWW Invest S.A.) agreements providing for replacement of Polimex by SPV Jaworzno. Completion of erection of the load-bearing structure of the bunkering room with the coal conveyor over the bunkers.

IV. Growth prospects
1. The RAFAKO Group's strategy
Considering the shifts and trends prevailing in the Company's core market, including declining investment in conventional energy projects (chiefly in new large generating units in Poland), at the start of 2018 RAFAKO decided to update its strategy and expand its operations to include EPC and general contracting services for the oil and gas upstream and downstream sectors. This growth direction is to diversify revenue sources and ensure further development of the Group's business. Following this decision, the RAFAKO Group's core and strategic business segments comprise the power construction segment and the natural gas, crude oil and fuels segment. RAFAKO's strategy is to deliver long-term growth in the Company's value by building the largest Polish engineering and construction group and an important international player, offering specialist construction services for the heat and power sector and for the oil and gas upstream and downstream sectors. The Group conducts its business taking into account its corporate social responsibility, with respect for the natural environment, in compliance with ethical principles, and with care for the employees' and customers' satisfaction. The Group's strategic objectives are to: a) Strengthen its position in the domestic power construction market by delivering and participating in
the largest capital investment projects in Poland, capturing a market share in the market for services related to the modernisation of heat and power infrastructure, and ensuring compliance with BAT regulations; b) Enter the natural gas, crude oil and fuels sector by leveraging the capabilities, experience and credentials of the PBG Group; c) Expand the business in foreign markets in both of the Group's core segments; d) Develop the Group's solutions, especially its proprietary technologies; e) Capture a market share in industrial construction; f) Optimise contract financing and contract performance security; g) Improve profitability through control and mitigation of project risks; h) Achieve dividend distribution capacity in 2020. These objectives are feasible provided the Group is properly organised and focused on the provision of EPC project management and general contracting services in both strategic business segments. Internal reorganisation of the Group will, on the one hand, involve acquisition of EPC capabilities in the natural gas, crude oil and fuels sector, and on the other ­ separation of services from manufacturing through planned spin-off (within the RAFAKO Group) of an organised part of business, namely the Steam Generator Plant, and RAFAKO's subsequent in-kind contribution of the organised part of business to a subsidiary. The acquisition of competences in the oil and gas segment will take place through the merger of RAFAKO Engineering with PBG Oil and Gas. Additionally, PGL Dom Sp. z o.o. will be included in the transaction, with a view to strengthening the balance sheet and thus the borrowing capacity of the combined entity, in which RAFAKO will acquire a majority interest. This will increase the RAFAKO Group's capacity to bid for and deliver projects within the areas of its expanded capabilities and will naturally facilitate its business growth by leveraging synergies between the merged companies. The spin-off of the Steam Generator Plant within the RAFAKO Group is designed to better orient this business towards the market, enhance competitiveness through rightsizing, and streamline the organisational structure.

Power construction segment
RAFAKO has been operating in the power sector since 1949, designing, manufacturing and supplying steam generators and environmental protection facilities, including under EPC contracts, for this sector. RAFAKO owns a comprehensive technology for the construction of traditional generating units and is among Europe's largest manufacturers of steam generators and environmental protection facilities for the power sector. RAFAKO is the undisputed leader of the Polish market for power generation equipment. In line with the adopted strategy, the operations of the RAFAKO Group in the power sector will significantly boost the Group's revenue. In the near future, the Group intends to focus on further developing and improving its competences relevant to EPC and general contracting services in the power sector through the participation in and execution of the largest projects in Poland, as well as participation in project execution on foreign markets. Given the Group's experience as well as the solutions and technologies it has on offer, the Group also plans to actively participate in the market for modernisation of heat and power infrastructure, in particular 200 MW and smaller generating units, and in the market for modernisation of environmental protection facilities in accordance with the IED (Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions) and BAT (Best Available Techniques). Given its proprietary technologies and credentials, RAFAKO is well prepared to take part in such tenders and meet market expectations.
In 2018, in the power sector, the RAFAKO Group plans to bid for contracts on the Polish and foreign markets with a total value of over PLN 4.44bn, and assumes to secure contracts for at least PLN 500m by the end of 2018. In these tenders, contracts are to be awarded for the construction of generating units and waste thermal treatment plants, construction and delivery or modernisation of steam generators and related facilities, as well as construction and upgrade of existing flue gas desulfurisation, denitrification and dust removal units.
Oil and gas segment
The reasons for RAFAKO's entry into this strategic segment of the PBG Group's operations include primarily the market environment, growth prospects, and opportunities to use of the Group's potential. The experience, credentials and know-how acquired by PBG during more than 20 years of its operations in this specialist construction services market will be concentrated within the RAFAKO Group. Historically, the PBG Group was the leader of this market in Poland and the implementation of multi-billion projects enabled the Group to obtain unique credentials that can be now used in tenders and which represent an added value for the entire Group. The credentials include experience as a general contractor in turnkey projects covering the design, delivery, assembly, construction and commissioning of the complete LMG (Lubiatów-Midzychód-Grotów) oil and gas production facility, a power plant worth PLN 1,397m (VAT exclusive), and unique experience in implementing a turnkey project to construct an LNG terminal with a value of PLN 2,368m (VAT exclusive). The LMG facility is the largest oil and gas production facility in Poland with production capacities reaching 1,300 tonnes of crude oil per day and 35,000 Nm3 of gas per hour. Since 2013, PBG Oil and Gas has also been playing an important role in the PBG Group's operations in the gas and oil upstream and downstream segment. In the last five years (from 2013 to 2017), PBG Oil and Gas generated revenue totalling over PLN 400m and gained credentials relevant for construction, modernisation and upgrade of gas pipelines and expansion of underground gas storage facilities. In 2017, PBG Oil and Gas successfully completed the construction of the Radoszyn production facility. It is the third largest oil and gas production facility in Poland, with the production capacity reaching 80 tonnes of crude oil per day. Thanks to its active participation in the market and contract performance, PBG Oil and Gas has the competencies in managing projects at each stage of execution. These competences include planning of design, production and construction work necessary to execute an entire project, and comprehensive management of the supply chain and logistics to ensure timely delivery and high quality of products and services. The company also has the important experience and competencies related to the start-up and commissioning of projects.
The RAFAKO Group intends to actively participate in the market of investment projects related to gas and oil production and to the development and modernisation of gas networks in Poland and abroad. The Group is interested in participating in projects of key importance to Poland's energy security, related to the expansion of underground gas and oil storage facilities and distribution infrastructure, including gas compressor stations. In 2018, in the gas and oil upstream and downstream sector, the RAFAKO Group plans to bid for contracts in the Polish and foreign markets with a total estimated value of almost PLN
33/39

RAFAKO S.A. Directors' Report on the operations of the RAFAKO Group for the year ended December 31st 2017
3.2bn, and assumes to secure contracts for at least PLN 400m by the end of 2018. Tenders in this segment mainly relate to installations for liquefying natural gas and LNG storage, compressor stations, gas pipelines, gas production facilities, and modernisation of existing installations and facilities.
Foreign operations
The RAFAKO Group plans to increase its activity in foreign markets in both of its strategic business segments, i.e. the natural gas, crude oil, fuels and the power construction segments, including in markets where:
· the Group has maintained a continuous presence;
· the Group was present in the past and where it intends to return, i.e. on Asian markets (India, etc.);
· the Group has never been present to supply its products and services, in particular Central Asia, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Indonesia.
In the countries where RAFAKO was active in the past, mainly as a subcontractor for steam generator facilities (e.g. in West European countries), the Group plans to continue cooperation with the customers who purchased steam generators and pressurised sections manufactured by the Company's Boiler Production Plant in the past. In addition to supplying steam-generator components, the Group will also be involved in the execution of projects to upgrade power facilities using the technologies provided in the past by RAFAKO. A new business area in the EU countries are installations for gas, oil, and fuel segment operators, which are an element of strategic plans to end the EU countries' dependence on oil and gas supplies from countries east of Poland.
In expanding back into the foreign markets where the Group was present in the past and where it intends to return, the Group plans to develop its business by collaborating with both international players and selected local partners.
As many countries have made commitments to bring their coal-fired generation plants and industrial enterprises in compliance with the increasingly stringent environmental protection requirements, the Group may now more easily enter the market for environmental protection facilities, including in the countries where RAFAKO was present as a supplier of steam generator systems in the past (e.g. India). The Group's proprietary technologies and credentials based on which local strategic partners may carry out projects give the Group a competitive advantage for building its presence on those markets. The Group will focus here on exporting technologies as a consortium or technology partner, including issuing contractor licences to local businesses.
In Central Asia, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Indonesia, the Group plans to develop its operations by collaborating with strong local partners who know the local markets and can guarantee access to local contractors. With regard to new markets, the Group ­ in addition to cooperating with local entities ­ relies on the expertise of internationally recognised legal, tax, and financial advisers.
The Group also has the benefit of being able to win contracts based on a greater use of the financial instruments offered by the companies of the PFR Group, which in 2017, through Fundusz Inwestycji Polskich Przedsibiorstw, acquired a significant equity interest in RAFAKO.
The potential of foreign markets for the Group is as follows: Indonesia ­ approximately USD 7.5bn; Mongolia ­ approximately USD 1.2bn; Balkans ­ approximately PLN 0.55bn; Turkey and India ­ USD 0.82bn; Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, other post-Soviet states, Central and Eastern Europe ­ EUR 500m; Iran and Persian Gulf countries ­ approximately PLN 4.1bn.
Development of the Group's solutions, especially proprietary technologies
The RAFAKO Group's critical competitive edge lies in the wide array of technologies enabling it to flexibly respond to market expectations, including to developments in the power sector. The Group has engaged in a number of research and development projects designed to: · modify and improve traditional products, such as steam generators and environmental protection equipment,
34/39

RAFAKO S.A. Directors' Report on the operations of the RAFAKO Group for the year ended December 31st 2017
· develop new products, including a programme to improve the flexibility of 200 MW generating units, together with a comprehensive upgrade offering, polygeneration islands (the POLYGEN project), CO2 methanation, and electromobility (the innovative school/city bus project). Dividend policy The Company's objective is to regain its dividend payment capacity in 2020. The dividend policy will be defined following the completion of the project to construct the 910 MW supercritical power generating unit at the Jaworzno Power Plant.
2. Factors and developments relevant for the Company's prospects in 2018
In 2018, the following factors and developments will have the greatest bearing on the Company's development and prospects:
· securing financial liquidity and obtaining access to new bank/insurance guarantees that will enable the Group to perform new contracts,
· making good progress on the construction of a 910 MW supercritical power generating unit at the Jaworzno Power Plant,
· making good progress on the construction of a biomass-fired co-generation unit in Vilnius (Lithuania),
· start of construction of two coal-fired steam units (2x50 MW) on Lombok Island, Indonesia, · performance of a large number of significant contracts in the Polish and European markets,
including construction of modern steam generators, flue gas desulfurisation and NOx reduction units, municipal waste treatment and incineration systems, as well as pressurised parts of supercritical boilers, · performance of new contracts in the natural gas and oil segment, including fuel storage depots and gas transmission installations, · acquisition of new material contracts, · adjusting the level and costs of employment at the Company to the conditions prevailing in the market where it operates.
The capital expenditure to be made in 2018 on property, plant and equipment will mainly be incurred to purchase or upgrade plant and equipment and to modernise production buildings. Expenditure on intangible assets will involve the purchase of software and licences. The Company also plans substantial spending on property, plant and equipment related to research and development work, mainly the `E-bus ­ an innovative small electric bus' project. The capex projects will be financed primarily with internally generated funds, and also through external means (e.g. leases). The Company's Management Board continues its efforts to win new contracts and believes that the key assumptions underlying its financial projections will materialise, ensuring the Company's liquidity in 2018.

Position of the Management Board and Supervisory Board of the Company regarding the qualifications expressed by the auditor in the audit report
a) Quantitative and qualitative effect on the full-year financial statements, including on the results and other financial data, of the matter subject to qualification, in each case with a presentation of materiality assessment The Company holds bonds (described in detail in Note 26 to the Company's full-year financial statements for 2017), which were issued by the parent and offered to creditors who are to be satisfied in accordance with the Terms of the Arrangement. The bonds are secured bonds within the meaning of the Bonds Act of January 15th 2015. In line with IAS 39, the Company classifies the above assets as `financial assets held to maturity' and measures them at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. At the end of each reporting period the Company assesses whether there is any objective evidence that the financial assets are impaired, and recognises an impairment loss if needed. In the opinion of the Management Board, the carrying amount of the bonds presented in the full-year financial statements, of PLN 30.1m, has been calculated correctly and is equal to the recoverable amount. As at the date of this report, the Company's Management Board is not able to estimate the effect of this matter on profit or loss. However, the maximum effect could be PLN 30.1m. Profit before tax, net profit and equity would decline accordingly. b) Measures taken and planned to be taken by the Company in view of the situation described above Reasons for the auditor's qualification in the reporting period may be removed if the parent (of the Group) presents the security and documents confirming cash flows that will guarantee payment to the parent of the liabilities under the bonds in issue throughout the life of the asset. This is clearly beyond the control of the Company's Management Board. In assessing the probability of recovering the amounts due to the Company under the bonds issued by PBG S.A., the Company's Management Board takes into account not only the present value of the security created for the issuer's bonds, but also the market prospects for the entire PBG Group. The Company's Management Board believes that the risk of non-recoverability of those assets is minimal. c) Opinion of the supervisory body The Company's Supervisory Board, exercising ongoing supervision over the Company's operations, has repeatedly addressed the issue of recoverability of amounts due to the Company under the bonds issued by PBG S.A. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, proving that the recoverability of amounts due under the bonds issued by PBG S.A. is sufficiently secured is beyond the control of the Company's Management Board, and therefore removal of the reason for the qualification is also beyond its control.
