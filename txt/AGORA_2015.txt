Dear shareholders,
in 2015 Agora continued on with effective implementation of Agora's Development Plan for the Upcoming Years announced in March, 2014. The actions undertaken are designed to allow the Group to increase the scale of its operations through growth of revenues, while at the same time improving profitability.
Initiatives implemented in 2015 had an amazing effect. Agora Group not only noted an increase of revenues, but also improved its profitability. This was primarily the result of record-breaking results of selected segments of the Group as well as improvement of profitability of all businesses. What is more, the Press segment continues its digital transition with the result of over 77 thousand paid subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza at the end of 2015. This number is even more pleasing knowing that we have delivered the target a year sooner than planned. This is a good signal confirming the right choice of how to change the business model of our press activity. We are gradually strengthening Agora's presence in the television market. Stopklatka TV, our joint business, maintains the level of 1% audience. We shall work on its further development. The next step in building our position in the television market was winning the concession to broadcast universal television channel with lifestyle profile on the eighth multiplex of digital terrestrial television which according to the announcement is to be launched in autumn 2016.
The results of 2015 confirmed the effectiveness of the way of development we have chosen. Therefore, in the near future we shall continue to carry out the tasks we planned with even greater determination. 2016 will be the first year in which we will finalize part of large projects and start our own activity on the television market.
Agora's priority remains the successful transformation of the press activity. It is based on two main assumptions: improving the profitability of our newspapers in their traditional form and building a solid base of digital subscriptions. The next step is its effective monetization. Another ambitious goal that we have set within this process is to achieve the level of 90 thousand paid digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza at the end of 2016.
We want to strengthen the Agora's position in television market. In the near future we will focus on activities which shall give the opportunity to increase Stopklatka TV's audience and its business performance. However, our main goal for 2016 is to increase our presence in the market through the launch of new digital terrestrial television channel on multiplex 8.
Priority for Group's Internet business is the intensive development in the area of mobile services, video, and further diversification of the revenue sources. We plan to invest in content and applications of our major brands. We dynamically develop advertising brokerage services which become an important source of revenues for the segment.
As far as our cinema activity is concerned, we continue to develop Helios cinemas ­ in 2016 new Helios cinemas will be opened. We shall also continue film distribution cinema and film production. In 2016 we plan to introduce to cinemas 8 new films, of which three will be co-produced by Agora and one in which Agora will be a leading producer.
Agora Group's priority in the outdoor market is strengthening its position in the segment of premium panels. In 2016 we plan to complete the construction of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw. We believe that this is a landmark project in the Polish outdoor advertising market. AMS has the chance to shape this market in the upcoming years, and we plan to participate in similar projects in other Polish cities. Additionally, the Outdoor segment already in 2015 achieved a profitability level planned for 2017.
The ultimate goal of our radio activity is to improve profitability and the ratio planned in 2014 by the Management Board as the target for 2017 was achieved already in 2015. In addition, we launched a new music station Radio Pogoda due to acquisitions. We want to develop it as part of our portfolio. Further organic development of the radio business depends on the number of frequencies available in Poland. The Group's objective is to acquire as many concessions as possible in order to expand the technical range of the stations currently operating. In 2015 we were able to increase the range potential of radio and music stations.
One of the objectives announced by the Group was to optimize the cost of common services and infrastructure. In 2015, due to optimization measures we have made a significant progress in achieving this goal and almost achieved planned ratio in 2015.
In our opinion, positive effects of the implementation of Agora's plans for the upcoming years are already visible. We are sure that consistent implementation of the entire plan will enable Agora Group not only to improve the efficiency and increase the scale of operations, but above all it will ensure value growth for the shareholders.
Executing our business and financial goals, we would like to become the first and natural choice for its users and business partners, to whom our media and our businesses deliver credible information and quality entertainment, as well as innovative solution for business partners to reach their clients.
On behalf of the Company, I would like to thank all the shareholders, clients and employees for support and trust in Agora, and the readers, users, listeners and viewers - for your interest.
Bartosz Hojka
President of Management Board of Agora S.A.

(g) Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 1 April 2016.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union. Information about standards and interpretations, which were published and become effective after the balance sheet date, including those awaiting endorsement by the European Union, is presented in point (ae).
(b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures. All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the companies from continuing their business operations. The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2014, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2015, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effecitve: 1) IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies; 2) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements 2011-2013.
The application of the amendments have no impact on the unconsolidated financial statements.
(c) Basis of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities, which are controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group due to its involvement in an investee is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group has power over an investee when the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, ie the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.
The acquitision method of accounting is applied to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control commences until the date that control ceases to exist. Contingent consideration is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the value of the contingent payment liability is recognised through the income statement Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

(ii)Joint ventures and associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and other shareholders on the basis of a statute, company's act or other agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases to exist. The investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. An interest in a joint venture or associate is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture or associate. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.
(iii)Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the joint venture.
(iv) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equal to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point w).

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is usually as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 5 - 8 years 2 - 20 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, except for some special projects related to distribution and co-operation rights for movies and computer games, in case of which the consumption of economic benefits may significantly differ from the straight line approach and the pattern of consumption of economic benefits in particular periods can be reliably determined based on generated revenue and it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets (apart from acquired magazine titles) are usually between 2 and 15 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash in transit and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.

(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised. At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses, whether there is objective evidence of impairment of financial assets. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset`s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted with the effective interest rate. Changes in impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises.

(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine ­ which functional currency is hryvnia). Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses. Inventories comprise goods for resale, materials, finished goods and work in progress, including production cost of own movies.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i) Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.

(ii) Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii) Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv) Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses, including reserve capital accumulated from prior years profits. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as described below and the recognition of the put option given to the non-controlling shareholders.
In the Agora Group the share incentive plans based on Agora S.A.'s shares were carried out, which ended in the first half of 2013. According to these plans, which were share-based payments settled in financial instruments, eligible employees were entitled to purchase investment certificates in closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates was determined by applying valuation model, which took into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates was included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates was established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates were purchased. The costs were recognized over the vesting period.
(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.
Deferred income tax is provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method. Changes in the value of the liability are recognized in profit or loss, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants for the acquisition of fixed assets
The grants received for financing the acquisition of fixed assets are recognized, when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto. The grants are initially recognised at fair value as deferred income and credited to the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.
(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).
(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 17

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over its useful life, but no longer than the lease term. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets as described in point (d).
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.
(z) Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
Within the Agora Group there are 3-Year-Long Incentive Plans carried out, described in note 27B. One of the components of the plans is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. These are cash-settled plans with rules based on inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In this plans, eligible employees of the Agora Group (the Management Board) are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The value of the provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are included in staff costs.
(ab) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac) Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.

(ad) Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operates in a Special Economic Zone. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption is recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits entitled Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015 or later)
The amendments apply to contributions from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the existing defined benefit plan has no contributions from employees.
2) Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015 or later)
The changes arising from annual improvements to standards. The Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 contain 8 amendments to 7 standards, with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group does not expects those changes to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3) Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments provide guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business under MSSF 3 and related disclosures.
The Group does not expects those changes to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, because the Company is not involved in joint arrangements, which meet such criteria.
4) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments clarify that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. For intangible assets this presumption can be rebutted in certain limited circumstances.
The Group does not expects those changes to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
5) Improvements to IFRS (2012-2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The annual Improvements to IFRSs (2012-2014) contains 4 amendments to existing standards (IFRS 5, IFRS 7, IAS 19, IAS 34), with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
6) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture - Bearer Plants (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments change the financial reporting for bearer plants. Under the new requirements, bearer plants should be accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment in IAS 16.

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments introduce an option for the entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements, in addition to the existing cost and fair value options.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
8) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure initiative (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments clarify requirements related to presentation and disclosures in financial statements. An emphasis is placed on materiality. Specific single disclosures that are not material do not have to be presented ­ even if they are a minimum requirement of a standard.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later, however the European Commission decided not to endorse this interim standard and to wait for the final standard)
The interim Standard that permits first time adopters of IFRS to continue to use its previous GAAP to account for regulatory deferral account balances both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements.
The standard will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, because the Company has no regulatory accounts.
2) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The Amendments remove the acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is contributed to an associate or a joint venture concerning the recognition of profit or loss on the loss of control of subsidiary and require a full gain or loss to be recognised when the assets transferred meet the definition of a business under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later)
The amendments relate to financial reporting of investment entities and will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
4) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later).
The new standard replaces the guidance included in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a model for calculating impairment losses. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of three categories:
- financial assets measured at amortized cost;
- financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or
- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).
The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. In respect of the financial assets

impairment requirements, IFRS 9 replaces the "incurred loss" impairment model in IAS 39 with an "expected credit loss" model. Under the new approach, it will no longer be necessary for a loss event to occur before an impairment allowance is recognized.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
5) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
The Standard provides a framework that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in IFRS. Under the new standard, entities will apply a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue, and at what amount. The model specifies that revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled. The Standard includes new qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements to enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
6) IFRS 16 Leasing (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. The Standard eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees and instead requires companies to bring most leases on-balance sheet under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Bringing operating leases in balance sheet will result in recognizing a new asset ­ the right to use the underlying asset ­ and a new liability ­ the obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This will result in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when they pay constant annual rentals.
Lessor accounting, however, shall remain largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases will be retained.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 or later)
The amendments clarify that unrealized losses related to debt instruments measured at fair value in the financial statements, but whose tax base is their original cost, can give rise to deductible temporary differences. The amendments also give more guidance on assessing whether taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences could be utilized.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
8) Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows - Diclosure initiative (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 or later)
Pursuant to the amendments, an entity shall provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. One way to fulfil the above disclosure requirement is by providing a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities.
The Group expects, that the application of the amendments may result in additional disclosures of changes in financing liabilities as required by the amendments.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996.
IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Company to be restated by applying the general price index.
Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Company with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount.
Consequently, the restatement of share capital due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Company, only the structure of the equity is affected.

Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies).

For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services.
Since January 1, 2014, the Group activities are divided into six reportable operating segments as follows:

Tomasz Jagiello received also remuneration as the President of the Management Board of Helios S.A. in the amount of PLN 352 thousand (in 2014: in the amount of PLN 351 thousand) . The other members of Agora's Management and Supervisory Board did not receive any remuneration for serving as board members in subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates.
The impact on staff costs of the incentive plan for the Management Board of Agora S.A. based on financial instruments is described in note 27.

27. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Starting from the third quarter 2013, eligible employees of the Company (Management Board members of the Company) participate in an incentive program ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan" for the period of 2013-2015), which till the end of 2014 was based on two components described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The target depends on the achievement of certain EBITDA level for 2014 ("the Condition"). If the Condition is not fulfilled, the target is based on the accumulated operating EBITDA (excluding some adjustments) to be reached in the years 2013-2015. The amount of potential reward depended on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and was determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the period of 2013-2015. If the stage of achieving the target will be below 70% or if the Condition will be fulfilled, the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan,
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan will depend on the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2016 till March 31, 2016 ("the Reference Share Price") adjusted by: (i) the accumulated dividend per one share, to which the shareholders will be eligible in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 and (ii) the adjustments resulting from the share buy-back program in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 ("the Share Price for Reward Calculation"). If the Share Price for Reward Calculation will be lower than PLN 9.9, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan.
The reward for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of other conditions, which are non-market conditions (for example: continuation of the employment within the Agora Group, holding the post of Management Board member of the Company).
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are described in the Supervisory Board resolution.
At the end 2014, the Condition based on the achievement of certain Group EBITDA level for 2014 (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation) was fulfilled. As a result, the liability relating to the EBITDA target component of the Plan accumulated so far has been reversed. The impact of this reversal on the Income Statement was compensated by an increase of the accrual for cash motivation plans.
As a result, starting from the first quarter of 2015, the potential reward resulting from the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan is based only on the percent of Company's share price increase.
The fair value of the provision for the cost of potential reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan, that is from December 1, 2013 (the grant date) till June 30, 2016 (the vesting date). The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the cost to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:

33. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On January 14, 2015, the meeting of shareholders of TV Zone Sp. z o.o. adopted the resolution to increase the share capital by 1,000 new shares with nominal value of PLN 50 per share (in total PLN 50 thousand). Agora S.A. covered 1,000 new shares with PLN 50 thousand contribution. After the registration of the share capital increase it amounts to PLN 55 thousand and is divided into 1,100 shares with nominal value of PLN 50 per share. After the registration of the share capital increase, Agora S.A. owns 1,100 shares, which translates into 100% of the company's share capital and 100% of votes at shareholders' meeting. The District Court for Warsaw, XIII KRS Commercial Division, registered the increase of the share capital of TV Zone Sp. z o.o. on February 25, 2015.

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk.
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, granted loans and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 % of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by diversification of its investments in investment funds, which invest in different classes of debt instruments. The Group does not acquire securities directly, but only through investment funds. At the same time, the Company invest only in liquid securities.

Guarantees
The information on guarantees and promissory notes are descibed in note 37.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2015, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 14.
On December 5, 2014 the Company concluded an agreement regarding an implementation of liquidity management system in the Group ("the Cash Pooling Agreement"). The Cash Pooling Agreement was signed between Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. and the following companies from the Group: Agora S.A., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o., Agora TC Sp. z o.o., Grupa Radiowa Agory Sp. z o.o., Doradztwo Mediowe Sp. z o.o., Inforadio Sp. z o.o. and IM40 Sp. z o.o. and Ad Taily Sp. z o.o. (since August 7,2015). The Cash Pooling Agreement aims to optimize cash liquidity and the most efficient management of cash for entities participating in the cash pooling system. Agora S.A. acts as a cash pool leader within the system. The settlements between Agora S.A. and its subsidiaries resulting from cash pooling agreement are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, during 2015 the Group used services of factoring with a recourse on the basis of an agreement signed between AMS S.A. and mFaktoring S.A. with a financing limit of PLN 15,000 thousand. The agreement was secured by a blank promissory note issued by AMS S.A. and guaranteed by Adpol Sp. z o.o. On 23 December 2015 the factoring agreement was terminated.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises and credits which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 396 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2014: PLN 821 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 8,530 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2014: PLN 15,991 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 6,659 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2014: PLN 7,684 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to three months.
Agora S.A. has not been or was in 2015 engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).
Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.

Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.
Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2015, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the impact of changes in fair value of financial instruments is estimated at the level of net loss/profit of PLN 546 thousand (as at December 31, 2014: PLN 298 thousand).
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables, payables and bank loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2015, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to impact the net profit/loss in the amount of PLN 171 thousand (as at December 31, 2014: PLN 739 thousand).

Key assumptions that are most significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include discount rate and the estimated level of the EBITDA. In case of the put option granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., an increase of the estimated EBITDA level over the period specified in put option conditions by 10%, would cause an increase of put option liability by ca PLN 2,000 thousand, while an increase of the discount rate by 1pp, would cause a decrease of the liability by ca PLN 840 thousand.

Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to PLN 727 thousand in 2015 and PLN 818 thousand in 2014.

38. COMMITMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases (including the lease of outdoor locations for advertising panels, Helios cinemas, buildings and other) are summarised as follows:

Within one year Between one and five years More than five years Total

31 December 2015 83,809
213,826 264,120 561,755

31 December 2014 79,815
208,922 204,019 492,756

The amounts disclosed above include VAT that the Group will be able to recover. The value of net minimum lease payments denominated in EURO amounted to EUR 87,388 thousand (2014: EUR 72,755 thousand).
Annual payments of the Group related to the perpetual usefruct of land amount to PLN 1,393 thousand (2014: PLN 1,505 thousand).

41. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the value in use for the relevant cash generating units was determined. There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets: 1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and 2) pre-tax discount rate.
Basic information about the method applied is summarized below:

Goodwill related to activities in Trader.com (Polska) Internet

Goodwill related to activities in particular magazine titles

Goodwill related to
radio activities

Goodwill related to activities in outdoor segment

Goodwill related to activities in cinema market

Goodwill allocated to activities in press segment

43. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Acquisition of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o.
On January 25, 2016 Agora S.A. acquired 106 shares in the share capital of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. ("GoldenLine") with its registered seat in Warsaw, from shareholders of that company, for the total price of PLN 8,480 thousand. Before the conclusion of the above agreement, Agora was already in possession of 72 shares of GoldenLine, which represented 36% of the share capital and gave the right to 72 votes, constituting 36% of the votes at the shareholders meeting of the company, and which were acquired on 29th of December, 2011. As a result of the transaction on January 25, 2016, Agora S.A. currently owns 178 shares in the share capital of GoldenLine, with the nominal value of PLN 1,000 each and the total nominal value of PLN 178 thousand, which represent 89% of the company's share capital and 89% of the votes at the shareholders' meeting.
The minority shareholder of the GoldenLine remains G.C. Geek Code Ltd, controlled by Mariusz Gralewski - the main founder of GoldenLine. G.C. Geek Code Ltd holds 22 shares in GoldenLine, which represents 11% of the share capital and gives the right to 22 votes at the general meeting of shareholders and represents 11% of the votes at the general meeting of shareholders. The sale agreement provides that after the transaction principles of cooperation between Agora and G.C. Geek Code shall be stated. In case there is no agreement in this respect, G.C. Geek Code will be entitled to sell its shares in the share capital of the Company to Agora, within 3 months from the date of the share purchase agreement, the terms and conditions being the same as in the contract of January 25, 2016.
Obtaining control over GoldenLine enables the Group to concentrate its activities in the field of recruitment services and employer branding in that company. Therefore, in the near future Agora plans to dispose of, to GoldenLine Sp. z o.o., Centrum Kompetencyjne Praca being organizationally, functionally and financially separate internal organizational structure of Agora S.A. and a set of tangible and intangible assets (including liabilities) for (i) maintaining the service GazetaPraca.pl and (ii) selling, through an organized, dedicated and deployed in Poland department of sales, recruitment solutions, including sales recruitment advertisements on the internet and in the press, advertising sales recruitment in the media owned by the Company and (iii) services related to building the employer's brand (ie. employer branding activities) on the basis of consent granted by Resolution No. 6 of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Agora S.A. of 24th of November, 2015. With this transaction, Agora will strengthen its market position in the category "Work" and will provide comprehensive solutions in the rapidly growing market of recruitment services. The effective combination of the capability of GazetaPraca.pl addressed to candidates actively seeking employment and recruitment and social capabilities of GoldenLine.pl which specializes in recruiting passive candidates together with the power of advertising of the media of Agora Group, shall in the opinion of the Management Board of Agora S.A. allow the Company to fight to strengthen its position in the attractive and rapidly growing recruitment services market and Employer Branding area, which in the longer term should have a positive impact on revenues generated by the Group.
Business combination accounting
As a result of the above mentioned transaction, the Group has obtained control over the company GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. Since the date of its acquisition the company is fully consolidated. The Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquired company at the non-controlling interest`s proportionate share of the acquiree`s identifiable net assets.

AGORA GROUP MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(MD&A) FOR YEAR OF 2015 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REVENUE PLN 1,189.3 MILLION NET PROFIT PLN 15.3 MILLION
EBITDA PLN 120.7 MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 111.1 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2015, while comparisons refer to 2014. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP [1]
In 2015, the Agora Group (the "Group") revenues amounted to PLN 1,189.3 million and increased by 7.9% yoy. This was due to the positive revenue dynamics recorded by Agora Group in every quarter of 2015. The increase in the Group's revenues in 2015 resulted primarily from a 22.0% increase in the inflows of the Movies and Books segment, totalling PLN 345.1 million. Record-high revenues were also recorded by the Internet and Radio segments. In 2015, total revenues of the Internet segment increased by 18.4% yoy, amounting to PLN 150.5 million. Revenues of the Radio segment also increased dynamically -- by 23.2% yoy, amounting to PLN 107.7 million. In 2015, revenues of the Outdoor segment went up by 4.2% yoy, totalling PLN 156.1 million. Revenues in the Press and Print segments went down, amounting to PLN 300.8 million and PLN 164.7 million, respectively.
In 2015, the Group's operating cost increased by 4.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,170.6 million. The highest increase in operating cost -- up by 19.3% yoy to PLN 321.5 million -- was visible in the Movies and Books segment. It was related mainly to the amortisation of the co-production contribution to the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, payments to the producer of the game, as well as higher costs of film copy purchase and costs of promotional campaigns for films introduced to cinemas as part of the segment's film activity. In 2015, the operating cost of the Internet segment increased by 18.7% yoy to PLN 126.3 million. This resulted mainly from higher costs related to the brokerage of display advertising of other web publishers, as well as higher staff costs. The increase in the operating cost of the Radio segment up to PLN 94.3 million was mainly related to the cost of advertising services provided in Helios cinemas since 2015, a higher cost of air time purchase in third-party radio stations due to the brokerage activities, as well as an increase in staff cost and promotion and marketing cost. Operating cost decreased in the Press, Print and Outdoor segments. A significant decrease in operating cost visible in the Print segment was associated with a lower yoy volume of orders. In the Outdoor segment, a reduction in operating cost by 3.2% yoy was made possible due to lower yoy system maintenance cost. Lower cost in the Press segment -- totalling PLN 283.6 million in 2015 -- were related to lower cost of materials, energy, goods and printing services. It should also be noted that in 2014 both the operating cost of the Press segment and its operating result were affected by an impairment loss amounting to PLN 15.1 million, concerning two monthlies published by the Magazines and Free Press division.
Owing to a systematic improvement of Agora Group's operating results in most quarters of 2015, the Group's EBITDA for 2015 increased to PLN 120.7 million, and the operating profit at the EBIT level went up to PLN 18.7 million. In 2015, the Group recorded a net profit of PLN 15.3 million, while the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent company amounted to PLN 12.7 million.

(1) particular sales positions, apart from ticket sales and printing services, include sales of Publishing House and film activities (co-production and distribution in the Movies and Books segment), described in details in point IV.B in this report.

In 2015, the Group's total revenues amounted to PLN 1,189.3 million (up by 7.9% yoy).
In the period since January to December 2015, the Group's advertising revenues increased by 5.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 562.4 million. The highest growth in advertising revenues was recorded in the Internet and Radio segments. The advertising revenues in the Outdoor and Movies and Books segments also increased.
The value of revenues from copy sales amounted to PLN 144.8 million and increased by 6.9% yoy. This resulted from higher sales generated by Agora's Publishing House, including the sales of the film Bogowie on DVD, and a 2.6% increase in copy sales revenue in the Press segment, related mainly to a greater number of issues of the daily available in the dual price offer and a copy price increase introduced in October 2014.
In 2015, the revenues from tickets sold in Helios cinemas increased by 13.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 162.2 million. In the reporting period, the number of tickets sold in Helios cinemas amounted to 9.3 million, which meant a yoy increase by 11.2%. In the same period, the overall number of cinema tickets sold in Poland amounted to ca. 44.7 million and increased by 10.5% yoy [10].
Revenues from the sales of printing services in the Group amounted to PLN 156.2 million and decreased by 5.5% yoy.

(1) the amount in 2014 includes impairment losses of two monthlies published by Agora S.A.

In 2015, the Group's net operating costs increased by 4.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,170.6 million. When comparing these figures with those for 2014 it should be noted that in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Group's operating cost was affected by impairment loss amounting to PLN 15.1 million, concerning two monthlies published by the Magazines and Free Press division.
The increase in the cost of external services recorded in 2015, resulted, among other things, from payments to the producer of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, higher costs of film copy purchase in the Movies and Books segment, increased cost of brokerage services and computer services in the Internet segment, and cost of panel renovation in Outdoor segment.
The Group's staff costs increased by 5.0% yoy to PLN 317.3 million in 2015. This cost item went up in most of the Group's operating segments. In the Radio segment it was connected with the strengthening of the sales force and launching new radio stations, and in the Movies and Books segment -- with the expansion of the Helios network. In the Internet segment, an increase in this cost item resulted from higher yoy cost of civil law contracts and remuneration under full-time employment contracts. Additionally, the cost item increased as a result of recognising reserve for the costs of incentive plans in the costs of the Group's individual operating segments. In the Outdoor segment, this value was lower throughout 2015. The reduction of these costs resulted from the group lay-off process carried out by AMS in the second half of 2014.
The Group's headcount as at the end of December 2015 amounted to 3,004 full time employees and decreased by 63 FTEs yoy.
The Group offers varied incentive plans to its employees (for example: cash motivation plans, incentive plans in sales departments, motivation plans for management board members and top managers etc.), whose cost is charged to the staff cost.
The decrease in the cost of materials and energy consumed, and goods and materials sold as compared to 2014, results mainly from a lower volume of printing services.
The Group's cost of promotion and marketing increased in 2015 by 19.9% yoy to PLN 87.4 million. This resulted from intensified promotional activity in all of the Group's segments except for Print segment.
3. PROSPECTS
3.1. Revenue
3.1.1 Advertising market [3]
In 2015 the advertising market in Poland grew by almost 4.5% yoy. Advertisers spent ca PLN 7.8 billion yoy to promote their products and services.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 9

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only

In every quarter of last year, advertisers spent more on promoting their products and services than in the corresponding periods of 2014 (up by 4.5%, 3.0%, 6.0% and almost 4.5%, respectively). As estimated by the Company, in 2016, the value of advertising spending in Poland should increase from 3% to 5% as compared to 2015. Data on specific dynamics of ad spending, in total and broken down by individual media, are presented in the table below:

Total advertising expenditure
3%-5%

Television 4%-6%

Internet 8%-10%

Magazines (7%)-(10%)

Radio 3%-5%

Outdoor 2%-4%

Dailies (9%)-(12%)

Tab. 5 Cinema 4%-6%

3.1.2 Copy sales
In 2016, negative trends relating to copy sales of dailies and magazines in their print versions will continue, however, their dynamics should be lower than in previous periods. The Company is working on growing the sales of its digital content. At the beginning of 2014, Agora implemented a new model of access to the digital content of Gazeta Wyborcza and a digital subscription offer. As at the end of 2015, the number of paid digital subscriptions to Gazeta Wyborcza exceeded 77 thousand. The Company aspires to achieving a base of 90 thousand paid digital subscriptions as at the end of 2016. In the Company's opinion, such activities, together with other factors, should stabilise the Press segment's financial results in the long term.
3.1.3. Ticket sales
The most significant factor affecting attendance in Polish cinemas is the repertoire. Based on the available information, the number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas in 2015 was record-high, amounting to almost 44.7 million, which constitutes an increase by 10.5% yoy [10]. The Company's Management Board is of the opinion that it would be difficult to expect a similar growth rate in the sales of cinema tickets in 2016. However, taking into account available repertoire for 2016 it seems possible to maintain a similar level of attendance as in 2015.
3.2 Operating cost
In 2016, the Group is planning to continue its development projects in selected business segments, which may result in an increase in operating cost. Segments with the largest projects to be executed include Outdoor as well as Movies and Books. It should also be noted that the Company will incur costs associated with launching its own TV channel in the second half of 2016. The channel is to be broadcast via digital terrestrial television in multiplex 8.

3.2.1 Costs of external services
The costs of external services will largely depend on the cost of brokerage services (in particular in the Internet and Radio segments), costs of film copy purchase related directly to the level of revenues from cinema ticket sales, and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. In addition, the increase in this cost item will be affected by opening of new cinema facilities planned for the fourth quarter of 2016, fees for film producers related to the Group's film distribution business and execution of other development projects.

3.2.2 Staff cost
Staff costs will increase yoy due to the execution of development projects in the Group. In the Internet segment, the increase in staff costs may be connected mainly with the development of selected web portals of the Gazeta.pl group and mobile applications, and with strengthening the sales force team. In the Radio segment, the increase in this cost item is associated with strengthening the sales force and launching a new radio station under the brand of Radio Pogoda. In the Movies and Books segment, this increase will be connected with the expansion of the Helios network by opening new facilities and with other development activities.
3.2.3 Promotion and marketing cost
In 2016, Agora Group is planning to continue its development activities, which also include promotional activities. The dynamics of changes in individual media, the number of launched development projects, including film co-

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
production and distribution activity, as well as market activities and projects of the Group's competitors may affect the level of these expenses. Considering the above factors, the Company estimates that in 2016 this cost item may increase as compared to 2015.
3.2.4 Cost of raw materials and energy
According to the Company's estimates, the level of this cost position in 2016 will be shaped by similar market trends as in 2015. The Group's Print segment has the largest impact on this cost position, especially the cost of production materials, the volume of production and the EUR/PLN exchange rate.
4. THE GROWTH DIRECTIONS OF THE AGORA GROUP
The primary objective of Agora is the growth in media sector. Agora Group wants to achieve the objective by the growth of revenues and profitability improvement according to the medium term development plans announced in March 2014. The key to success is execution of four main tasks: 1) digital transformation of print media operations, 2) building position in the TV market, 3) profitability improvement of the Group's key business segments, 4) cost optimization of the Group's shared functions and infrastructure. Due to the implementation of the metered paywall on Gazeta Wyborcza's website in February, 2014 the process of digital transformation significantly accelerated in the Agora Group. In order to achieve that goal, the Group supports development of quality journalism and builds necessary technological tools. At the end of 2015, the number of paid digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to 77.4 thousand. This means that the Company achieved its objective of building a base of approximately 75 thousand paid subscriptions one year earlier than initially estimated. On March 15, 2014 the Agora Group entered the TV market launching Stopklatka TV - a TV channel created together with Kino Polska TV S.A. Agora's objective is a quick success of the digital film channel and its aspires to build a significant position in the TV thematic channel market in the long term perspective. In 2015, Agora won the concession proceedings and in Autumn 2016 it plans to launch a TV channel broadcast via digital terrestrial platform in signal of eighth multiplex. Agora develops its other business segments. The Group aims to grow its cinema network Helios and increase the scale of operations in the field of film distribution and co-production. In 2015 Helios network grew by four new cinemas. In the outdoor business Agora wants to strengthen its position in the premium segment ­ at the end of 2015 895 out of 1,580 bus shelters with citylight panels were visible in the streets of Warsaw. The priority for the Group's online operations is an intensive growth in mobile and video as well as further diversification of revenue streams. The Group's objective in the radio business is to successfully acquire the largest possible number of licences in order to grow technical reach of current radio stations and optimization of music formats. In 2015 the radio business created a new radio stations under the name Radio Pogoda. The Agora Group undertook optimization initiatives related to the Group's cost of shared functions and infrastructure in order to simplify and unify internal processes. As a result the share of the cost of shared functions and infrastructure decreased.

2.3. Sales and markets
Over 90% of the total sales of the Group were related to sales in domestic market. Sales to foreign markets are realized mainly through the sales of printing and advertising services to foreign customers and sales of publications (including foreign subscription).

The Group does not depend on one particular customer. The biggest customers of the Group (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). In 2015, the value of transactions with none of the distributors exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.4. Suppliers
The Group does not depend on one particular supplier. Newsprint and printing services are important cost items of the Group. Newsprint used for printing services for external customers and in order to print the Group's own titles is purchased from several suppliers. In 2015, the value of transactions with none of the suppliers exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.5. Finance cost, net
Net financial activities of the Group, in 2015, were influenced mainly by interest from bank deposits as well as cost of commissions and interest on the bank loans and lease liabilities.

3.1. Non-current assets
The increase in non-current assets, versus 31 December 2014, resulted mainly from new investments in property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which were, to some extent, compensated by depreciation and amortisation charges and a decrease in long-term receivables, because part of the cash collateral provided by the subsidiary AMS S.A. was reclassified to the short term receivables.
3.2. Current assets
The increase in current assets, versus 31 December 2014, results mainly from the increase in accounts receivable (including trade receivables and short-term receivables related to the cash collateral provided by AMS S.A.) and higher balance of short-term securities, which was, to some extent, compensated by lower balance of cash and cash equivalents.
3.3. Non-current liabilities and provisions
The increase in non-current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2014, stems mainly from the increase in long-term loans and finance lease liabilities as well as an increase in other long-term liabilities resulting from receiving by the subsidiary Green Content Sp. z o.o. a license to broadcast a television programme via digital terrestrial platform in signal of eighth multiplex. The above change was, to some extent, compensated by the decrease in deferred tax liabilities and lower other financial liabilities.
3.4. Current liabilities and provisions
The increase in current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2014, stems mainly from the increase in accounts payable and tax liabilities as well as higher accruals. Moreover, there has been an increase in short-term loans and other financial liabilities.

1. REVENUE
In 2015, total revenues of the Press segment decreased by 1.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 300.8 million. This was mainly due to a 5.8% yoy decrease in advertising revenues. However, the value of the segment's revenues was positively affected by a 2.6% increase in copy sales, mainly owing to higher revenues from copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza.
1.1. Revenue from copy sales 1.1.1. Copy sales and readership of Gazeta Wyborcza [4]
In 2015, Gazeta Wyborcza maintained its leading position among the opinion-forming dailies. The average payable distribution of Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to 178 thousand copies and decreased by 7.2% yoy. In the analysed period, the revenue from copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza increased by 2.3% yoy, which was possible due to an increase in the basic price of daily issues of Gazeta Wyborcza in October of 2014 and a higher number of issues in the dual price offer. In the period under discussion, the weekly readership of Gazeta Wyborcza stood at 8.5% (2.6 million readers; CCS, weekly readership index), which placed it as the second daily among nationwide dailies.
1.1.2. Copy sales of Agora's magazines
In 2015, revenues from the sales of magazines decreased by 8.0% yoy and amounted to PLN 16.2 million. This was due to a decrease in the average number of copies sold by Agora's monthlies, which amounted to 308.3 thousand copies (down by 10.0% yoy).
1.2. Advertising sales [3] 1.2.1. Advertising sales of Gazeta Wyborcza
In 2015, Gazeta Wyborcza's net advertising revenue from all of its advertising activity (including display advertising, classifieds, inserts and other advertising services) amounted to PLN 104.5 million (down by 7.4% yoy). The above figures include a portion of revenues from dual-media advertising offers (published both in the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza and on the GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl vertical portals and the Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website), which is allocated to the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza. In 2015, the ad spending in Polish dailies decreased by ca. 11.5% yoy. In the analysed period, Gazeta Wyborcza's revenue from display advertising decreased by ca. 8.0% yoy, and its estimated share in display ad spending in dailies increased by almost 1.5pp yoy, amounting to almost 37.5%. The joint share of Gazeta Wyborcza and Metrocafe.pl grew by almost 1.5pp yoy. In 2015, Gazeta Wyborcza's share in ad spending in national dailies amounted to ca. 46.0% and increased by almost 2.5pp yoy. During this period, Gazeta Wyborcza increased its share in ad spending in Warsaw-based dailies' by ca. 1.0pp yoy, while the joint share of Gazeta Wyborcza and Metrocafe.pl in this expenditure declined by nearly 0.5pp yoy. At the same time, Gazeta Wyborcza's share in ad spending in local dailies (excluding Warsaw) did not change yoy and the joint share of Gazeta Wyborcza and Metrocafe.pl increased by over 0.5pp yoy. One should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to a significant discounting pressure on the part of advertisers. Once the Company has more reliable market data, it may adjust the ad spending share estimations in the consecutive reporting periods. In 2015, the share of ad pages in Gazeta Wyborcza's total pagecount amounted to ca. 26.6%, while the average number of paid-for ad pages published daily in all local and national editions of Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to ca. 91 and was lower by ca. 4.0% yoy.
1.2.2. Advertising sales of Metrocafe.pl [3], [4]
In 2015, Metrocafe.pl's total advertising revenues declined by 7.9% yoy, including a display advertising revenue drop by almost 12.0% yoy. At the same time, total display ad spending in all daily newspapers decreased by ca. 11.5% yoy. As a result, Metrocafe.pl's share in advertising spending in all dailies decreased slightly and amounted to ca. 6.0%. In the analysed period, Metrocafe.pl maintained its share in advertising spending in national dailies,
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 19

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
while increasing its share in advertising spending in local dailies by nearly 0.5pp. Metrocafe.pl decreased its share in Warsaw-based dailies by over 1.0pp yoy to approx. 26.0%.
1.2.3 Advertising sales of Agora's magazines
In 2015, the advertising sales of Agora's magazines decreased by 4.0% yoy to PLN 21.8 million. At the same time, advertisers limited their expenditure in the magazines by 8.5% yoy. Agora had a 3.3% share in total national magazines advertising spending (based on rate card data) [7] and a 6.7% share in monthlies advertising spending (based on rate card data) [7].
2. COST
In 2015 the segment's operating costs declined by 3.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 283.6 million. Lower costs of materials, energy, goods and printing services, and a lower volume of dailies published in the segment contributed to a decrease in the segment's operating costs in 2015. However, promotion and marketing cost was higher yoy mostly due to a higher number of issues of Gazeta Wyborcza in the dual price offer, promoting various distribution channels for Gazeta Wyborcza and the events organised by the segment, including the Olsztyn Green Festival and the Co Jest Grane European Music Fair. Staff cost also increased yoy, mainly as a result of new development initiatives in the segment. It should be noted that in 2014, the operating cost of the segment was affected by impairment cost of two monthlies published by the Magazines and Free Press division, totalling PLN 15.1 million.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2015, Gazeta Wyborcza continued to expand its offer, both paper and digital. In April 2015 Wysokie Obcasy, Gazeta Wyborcza's Saturday's weekly, changed its layout and format and started cooperation with new writers on the occasion of the weekly's 16th birthday and in response to the needs of readers.

In 2015, the segment recorded improved operating results. The operating result at the EBIT level increased by 76.1% yoy and amounted to PLN 23.6 million, while the segment's EBITDA increased by 52.9% yoy and reached PLN 60.4 million [1]. The improvement of the operating result in 2015 resulted from an increase in attendance in Helios cinemas, which translated into higher ticket sales and higher concession sales. The operating result of the segment was also positively affected by the Publishing House's participation in the co-production and distribution of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt [1]. Agora's Publishing House closed 2015 with a result at the EBIT level of PLN 5.9 million. This result was higher by PLN 5.2 million than the one recorded in 2014 [1].
1. REVENUE [3]
In 2015, the total sales of the Movies and Books segment increased by 22.0% yoy and amounted to PLN 345.1 million. During this period, the number of viewers visiting Helios cinemas amounted to 9.3 million people and increased by 11.2% yoy. Higher attendance in Helios cinemas ensured higher revenues from ticket sales in the amount of PLN 162.6 million and higher revenues from concession sales in the amount of PLN 59.5 million. In 2015, the segment's total revenues from film co-production and distribution amounted to PLN 17.8 million, showing an increase by 1.7% yoy. This increase results from the fact that NEXT FILM released more new productions for cinema distribution in 2015 and rights to film distribution in other channels were sold. In 2014, the level of revenues from film activity was significantly affected by the distribution and co-production of the film Bogowie. In 2015, the Special Projects division recorded revenues from the co-production of the following films: Disco Polo, Bogowie, Karbala, Ziarno Prawdy, Drogówka and Baby s jakie inne in connection with their distribution in cinemas, on DVDs and following the sale of rights to their distribution in other channels.
In 2015 the revenues of Agora's Publishing House amounted to PLN 64.3 million, having more than doubled yoy. The growth of this revenue item was positively affected by participation in the co-production and distribution of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which contributed PLN 25.8 million. In 2015 Agora's Publishing House issued 53 new books, 13 musical publications and 6 film publications. As a result, during the analysed period, the Publishing House sold approximately 1.0 million books and books with CDs/DVDs.
2. COST
In 2015, the segment's operating costs amounted to PLN 321.5 million and increased by 19.3% yoy.
The increase in the segment's operating costs was affected by the amortisation of the co-production contribution and settlement with the producer of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Higher cost of film copy purchase and value of goods and materials sold result from higher ticket sales and concession sales in cinemas. The increase in costs of materials and energy and staff costs is related mainly to the expansion of the Helios network. Higher depreciation and amortisation costs resulted from the co-production of the following films: Karbala, Ziarno Prawdy, Disco Polo and Obce Niebo, while higher promotion and marketing costs are related, among other things, to film distribution.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2015 Helios cinema network opened four new cinema locations in: Jelenia Gora, Lodz, Bialystok, and Wroclaw. Thus, Helios operates 37 cinemas with 2016 screens and almost 43 thousand seats, total.

In 2015 the increase in the segment's revenues by 4.2% yoy and the reduction of its operating cost by 3.2% yoy caused the EBIT of the segment to increase materially to PLN 17.1 million. The segment's EBITDA increased to PLN 30.3 million and the EBITDA margin increased by 4.2pp yoy to 19.4%.
1. REVENUE [8]
In 2015 outdoor advertising spending increased by almost 2.5% yoy. The growth of advertising sales recorded by AMS group in 2015, exceeded the growth dynamics of the outdoor market reported by IGRZ and amounted to 4.1% yoy.
A more dynamic revenue growth for the entire 2015 than that recorded by the market was mainly achieved based on advertisers' spending on citylight and backlight panels.
2. COST
In 2015 the segment's operating costs declined by 3.2% yoy and amounted to PLN 139.0 million, mainly owing to lower cost of system maintenance as well as depreciation and amortisation. A reduction of system maintenance costs by 3.7% yoy in the analysed period results from effective optimisation consisting in adaptation of the portfolio of advertising panels to the market needs, and a decrease in rental fees for selected groups of panels. Staff costs decreased in 2015 by 2.0% yoy as a result of group lay-offs executed by AMS in the second half of 2014. Depreciation costs, which were lower than in 2014, contributed to a decrease in the segment's operating cost. This decrease results from, among other things, the adjustment of D&A rates to the estimated useful life of certain groups of advertising panels.

3. NEW INITIATIVES
At the beginning of 2015, AMS expanded its offer by exclusive backlight panels. Due to unusual light effects using LED technology it is possible to introduce the image in motion, which further attracts the attention of consumers. In September, 2015, during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the company, AMS for the first time presented the prototype effect of augmented reality (AR) in a bus shelter. It does not require the use of any application or mobile device. This allows the recipient to have fun with a variety of images that "appear" in the shelter environment and thus "extend" the surrounding reality In October 2015, AMS expanded its portfolio of premium media. Premium Citylight panels which until now were available only in Warsaw, are now also in Krakow. Thus, AMS launched the execution of the Krakow contract ­ within 15 years 600 bus shelters with approximately 1,600 advertising pages will be built. Krakow is the second city, after Warsaw, where AMS develops the strategy of premium citylights in bus shelters. Just as in Warsaw, those bus shelters eventually will offer interactivity at different levels, from the QR codes to wifi (gateway gateams.com). At the same time throughout the whole 2015 AMS realized the process of building shelters in Warsaw, developing Warsaw Premium Citylight offer. By the end of 2015, on the streets of Warsaw there have already 895 shelters been built, and nearly 800 of them were included in AMS' offer.

(2) including, among others, allocated revenues from the dual media offer (i.e. published both in Gazeta Wyborcza, as well as on GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl verticals and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website).

In 2015, EBIT of the Internet segment increased by 16.9% yoy, reaching an all-time high, i.e. the amount of PLN 24.2 million. During the same period, EBITDA increased by 14.7% yoy, amounting to PLN 29.6 million [1].
1. REVENUE
In 2015 the total revenues of the Internet segment increased by 18.4% yoy, closing at an all-time high of PLN 150.5 million. The increase in revenues was significantly influenced by higher yoy sales of Internet display advertising and services provided by the sales team and the advertising networks of the Gazeta.pl group.
In 2015 the inflows from web display advertising sales increased by 24.3% yoy, while the revenues amounted to PLN 123.8 million. The increase in the segment's advertising revenues was significantly influenced by higher yoy sales of web display advertising and services provided by the sales team and the advertising networks of the Gazeta.pl group.
In 2015 sales of ads in vertical portals went down by 6.3% yoy. This change was mainly caused by lower sales of ads in recruitment (GazetaPraca.pl) and real estate (Domiporta.pl) portals. An improvement in revenues from ad sales in verticals was recorded by the automotive portal Autotrader.pl.
2. COST
In 2015, the rate of increase in operating cost was 18.7%, up to the amount of PLN 126.3 million. The increase in the operating cost was substantially affected by the growth of the rental cost of advertising space, i.a, in advertising networks and on websites belonging to business partners (e.g. Kwejk.pl) reported under external services. Apart from the costs of advertising brokerage, the external services item includes: marketing services

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 26

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
costs, costs of Internet links and IT services. The increase in this cost item was compensated by growing revenues from advertising brokerage services which contributed to the growth of the segment's total revenues. In 2015 staff costs increased by 7.3% yoy. This was mainly due to higher cost in the Epic Makers network and in the Gazeta.pl portal, as well as a higher headcount in AdTaily. In 2015 promotion and marketing expenditure in the Internet segment increased by 5.3% yoy. The increase in expenditure was mainly affected by outlays on the promotion of the websites forming part of Gazeta.pl group, including video and sports websites. In 2015 the segment's total operating costs were reduced by damages paid to Agora S.A. by Business Insider Inc. in connection with termination of the agreement under which Agora S.A. was to run a business/technology portal, which also contributed to an improved operating result of the segment.

1. REVENUE [3]
In 2015, the revenues of the Radio segment increased by 23.2% yoy and amounted to PLN 107.7 million.

Apart from the advertising brokerage cost and the cost related to sales of advertising services in Helios cinemas, the external services item also includes rental fees, production services as well as operator fees.
An increase in staff costs was mainly related to a higher headcount in sales departments and with launching a new radio station under the Radio Pogoda brand.

NOTES
[1] EBIT and EBITDA of Press, Internet, Movies and Books as well as Print segments are calculated on the basis of cost directly attributable to the appropriate operating segment of the Agora Group and excludes allocations of all Company's overheads (such as: cost of Agora's Management Board and a majority of cost of the Company`s supporting divisions), which are included in reconciling positions. [2] the data on ticket sales in the cinemas comprising Helios group come from the accounting data of Helios reported in accordance with full calendar periods. [3] The data refer to advertising expenditures in six media (press, radio, TV, outdoor, Internet, cinema). In this MD&A Agora has corrected the numbers: for cinema advertising market in the third quarter of 2014 and for the first nine months of 2015, for TV advertising market in the third quarter of 2015, for the Internet advertising market in the second quarter of 2015 and for the outdoor advertising in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, press and radio advertising market data referred to herein are based on Agora's estimates adjusted for average discount rate and are stated in current prices. Given the discount pressure as well as advertising time and space sell-offs, these figures may not be fully reliable and will be adjusted in the consecutive reporting periods. In case of press, the data include only display advertising, excluding classifieds, inserts and obituaries. The estimates are based on rate card data obtained from the following sources: Kantar Media monitoring, Agora S.A. monitoring. Presented TV, Internet and cinema figures are based on Starlink media house estimates; TV estimates include regular ad broadcast and sponsoring with product placement, exclude teleshopping and other advertising forms. Internet ad spend estimates include display, search engines (Search Engine Marketing), e-mail marketing and video advertising. Outdoor advertising figures are based on Izba Gospodarcza Reklamy Zewnetrznej estimates prepared in cooperation with Starlink company [8]. The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on the average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media. [4] The data on the number of copies sold (total paid circulation) of daily newspapers is derived from the National Circulation Audit Office (ZKDP). The term "copy sales" used in this MD&A is consistent with the sales declarations of publishers to the National Circulation Audit Office. The data on dailies readership are based on PBC General, research carried out by MillwardBrown on a random, nationwide sample of Poles over 15 years of age. The CCS index was used (weekly readership index) - percentage of respondents reading at least one edition of the title within 7 days of the week preceding research. Size of the sample: nationwide PBC General for January-December 2015: N=20,033; data prepared by Agora.

11. INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Information about financial statements in respect of:
risk: price risk, credit risk, material disruptions to cash flow and risk of liquidity problems, on which the Group is exposed and objectives and methods of financial risk management
is disclosed in notes 34 and 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk
Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2015, advertisers spent almost 4.5% yoy more on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in almost all advertising market segments. The erosion of advertising expenditure was observed only in press.
It should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.
Polish economy is sensitive to coutries political situation and looping risk of abrupt legislative chcanges, whose full impact on the conditions of running business activity in Poland is hard to foresee.
Seasonality of advertising spending
The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's advertising revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 48

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarters.
Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market
The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting over half of the advertising market expenditure (51.5%) in 2015. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 23.0% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted 6.5% and 3.5% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2015, 6.0% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted 8.0% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2015 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.
Abrupt changes to law regulations in particular business areas may affect not only macroeconomic situation in Poland but also the propensity and the way advertisers (including state owned companies) spend advertising budgets.
Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content and on February 4, 2014 the Company introduced system of metered paywall on websites related to Gazeta Wyborcza. Nowadays, it is hard to evaluate the impact of new access system on the Group's revenue. The Group also publishes a free daily ­ Metrocafe.pl. We cannot predict how the global changes occurring on the press market will influence the free press position and consequently, the position and the results of the Group.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive and influenced by consolidation processes. Number of internet users in Poland is not growing so fast as in the past. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged. Additionally, online advertising market is undergoing transformation. Search advertising, dominated in Poland by one player, is becoming more popular among advertisers. The Group's main source of Internet advertising revenue is display advertising. Video and mobile advertising are growing their share.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 49

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Maintenance of the strong position in rapidly changing market requires investment in advanced technological solutions. Due to that fact there is no guarantee that the Group will be able to compete with national and foreign players with larger financial resources.
Outdoor
Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
On September 11, 2015 selected regulations on strengthening landscape protection changed. On its basis the local governments acquired rights to regulate the distribution of visual advertisement and small architecture in public space and charging adequate fees. It is really hard to estimate the impact of this regulation on the Agora Group's results. Till the day of this publication no local government introduced new rules of charging fees.
In 2014, execution of the contract to construct of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw commenced. The investment process shall last 3 years. The estimated cost of the bus shelters' construction amounts to ca PLN 80 million. The duration of the contract is nearly 9 years. The timely execution of the contract carries risk related to the necessity of acquiring a number of approvals and administration decisions. Additionally, in such a competitive and changing environment the macroeconomic and market assumptions necessary for the project success may not materialize.
Cinema
Helios opens new cinemas in shopping and entertainment centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping and entertainment galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators.
Additionally, the available repertoire affects results of cinema business. Lack of interesting movies, abilities to promote movies or the quality of movies may negatively affect cinema admissions. Moreover, economic downturn may translate into lower expenditure on entertainment which may result in lower revenues from ticket sales and willingness to buy food and beverages in cinema bars.
Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, in Internet.
Risks of running licensed business
The Group has been running its activities in radio market for years and since 2014 it started to operate in TV market. Radio and TV operations are licensed activity in Poland. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted.
There is a risk that demand, from radio and TV audience, for a certain radio or TV format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
Radio stations
Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora Group's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
Television
Due to the purchase of 41.04% stake in Stopklatka S.A. by Agora on March 12, 2014 the Group entered television market. Our television channel competes with existing television broadcasters and potential new market entrants.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 50

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2015 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Among Stopklatka TV competitors there are larger broadcasters with better brand recognition and financial resources than us. The increasing success in Poland of DTH, cable and DTT providers will likely result in the increasing fragmentation of Polish TV viewing audiences, which may make it more difficult for us to persuade advertisers to purchase airtime in Stopklatka TV. The results of Stopklatka are consolidated on the equity basis. In 2015, a subsidiary company of Agora S.A. ­ Green Content won a concession proceedings for broadcasting a TV channel via digital terrestrial platform in signal of eighth multiplex. The probable time of TV channel launch is said to be Autumn 2016. There is no certainty that the programme offer of our new TV channel will be attractive for a sufficient number of viewers. A proper share in TV audience is a key parameter taken into account in the process of allocating advertising budgets of the largest advertisers.
Movie business Movie distribution and co-production is of project nature, which may result in volatitility of its results ­ it may also impact the Group's results. The majority of costs incurred, especially those related to movie co-production, burdens the Group results long before the profits related to that fields of operations. The impact of this activity on the Group's results depends also on the popularity of given film production.
Impairment tests Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.
Currency risk The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the production materials and services and IT services, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
Interest rate risk The changes in interest rates may influence the level of the Group's financial cost related to the Group's debt.
Risk of losing key employees The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
The risk of collective dispute On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., AMS S.A., Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o. and Grupa Radiowa Agory Sp. z o.o. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.

In case a member of the Board is appointed by way of co-option, the Management Board is obliged to include in the agenda of the nearest general meeting of shareholders an item concerning confirmation of appointment of a new member of the Board by way of co-option and propose an appropriate draft resolution. Should the general meeting of shareholders not accept the appointment of the new member of the Board by way of co-option, such Management Board member's mandate expires on conclusion of the general shareholders meeting.
