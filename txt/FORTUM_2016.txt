CEO Letter 2016

Join the change

Dear stakeholders,
2016 was a fascinating year of learning for one who came from outside the energy industry. Ten years in telecom and a little more in technology and machine building gave me valuable tools that are useful in the ongoing energy transition. However, a significant part of the utility business logic will continue to be industry specific.
Fortum has in the past few years made several important strategic decisions. The divestment of the distribution business was, without a doubt, the most significant one. In February 2016, we published a high-level strategy framework describing our way forward. During the Capital Markets Day in November our priorities, growth drivers and planned capital allocation were expanded in more depth.
Fortum's strategy
CO2-free power generation and deep knowledge about how to operate generation assets is in the very core of Fortum's DNA. It is complemented by our thorough understanding of power markets and trading as well as our deep expertise in combined heat and power production. This is the solid foundation that we build our future on.
There are four growth areas in our strategy and they have a clear priority order. Growth engine number one and our first priority is to drive productivity and industry transformation. Growth engine number two and our second priority is solutions for sustainable cities. Growth engines three and four ­ growing in solar and wind and building new energy ventures ­ are targeting to secure our long-term competitiveness in the future energy system.
The timing of our growth efforts and the redeployment of cash will take place in two phases, and a significant part of the redeployment is expected to take place during 2017. Our objective is to maximise our cash flow, while targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5. We believe that the European power generation industry will consolidate and we want to have a significant role in driving the change. Broadening the scope of our City Solutions business will also offer growth opportunities.

We will utilise the competencies we have today in our combined heat and power production and in the acquired Ekokem business, and build on these combined strengths. The acquisition of Ekokem, was therefore an essential step in implementing our strategy. The cash flow generated as a result of phase one will be used for 1) securing a competitive dividend; and 2) investments into phase two.
Phase two comprises growth engines three and four as described above. We have already started investments in solar and wind, in the Nordics, Russia and India. They are lower in priority when it comes to capital allocation, but we have a clear target to accumulate a gigawatt-scale portfolio in the coming years.
The final priority is New Ventures, in which we will allocate approximately EUR 100-200 million into new innovations and startups with disruptive potential. This is very important for our longterm competitiveness, since many parts of the energy system of the future will be significantly different from the one known today. Here, too, we have already acted by investing in companies like Info24, Chempolis and Exeger, which are small investments, but have good potential for the future and are a good fit with Fortum's business.
Vision and Mission
We updated our vision and mission during the autumn of 2016. Our updated vision ­ `For a cleaner world' ­ goes beyond just clean energy production, it expresses our commitment to fuel and resource efficiency and how we enable our stakeholders, customers and society to make sustainable choices. Also here our acquisition of Ekokem plays an important role. We wanted to create a vision that clearly incorporates also the circular economy aspects, including its connections to the energy system. It's not only about energy production, it's also the wider added value potential of fuels like biomass and waste. Our new strategy clearly pronounces our commitment and the continuous alignment of our actions with the principles of the UN Global Compact and Caring for Climate initiatives.
In our mission we state that "we engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a cleaner world." In saying

so, we invite all our stakeholders ­ society, our employees, our shareholders and our partners ­ to join us in the change. Still today approximately 80% of the world's primary energy demand is based on fossil fuels, so decarbonisation needs to be a process. Our role is to accelerate the change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions for the future. More and more of this will be digitally-enabled. And naturally we believe that we can do this in a way that delivers excellent shareholder value.

Megatrends
The global megatrends affecting our industry are quite wellknown and impact many other businesses as well: climate change, urbanisation, digitalisation and active customers. Climate change and the need for decarbonisation and resource efficiency is the one changing our industry in a profound way.
The Paris Agreement sets a target to limit global warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. The International Energy Agency has estimated that in order to fulfil the targets of the Paris Agreement, approximately USD 16,500 billion will have to be invested in the world's energy system. It's obvious that that money will not come from government budgets alone. We strongly believe that the only way forward will be market mechanisms that remunerate private investments. We continue to advocate for market-based, technology-neutral solutions and efficient carbon pricing as tools for decarbonisation.
The progress in renewable energy technology is very encouraging. The investment cost of new renewables is declining rapidly and is causing fundamental changes in the energy system. The cost of solar has dropped approximately 80% in five years, and we have seen recent drops in the levelised cost of electricity for onshore wind.
In addition, recycling and the circular economy create opportunities for companies like Fortum. The amount of waste the world is producing is roughly expected to double between 2015 and 2025. In the growing megacities of Asia, waste is a massive and rapidly growing problem that will create additional opportunities. Also, in the EU alone, about 30% of municipal waste today goes to landfills, which will be restricted in the future.
A third very big shift will be the role of active customers and, in particular, the role of the retail electricity business model. Digitalisation enables new scalable services to consumers, and the growth of decentralised generation means that many consumers will become "prosumers" with their own production as well as consumption. Consumers will also play an important role in balancing the increasingly intermittent energy system.

Our operating market in 2016
2016 was a challenging year in many respects. The beginning of the year was characterised by increased commodity market volatility; especially coal and oil prices were very low. Nordic water reservoirs were clearly above the long-term average, creating pressure on electricity prices, and the British EU exit vote also created uncertainty.
From the second quarter onward, the power market started showing positive signs, mainly driven by the improving commodity market prices. Commodity prices increased throughout the year and are now clearly higher than at the end of 2015. In the Nordic system the role of hydro-power is very important. Typically, the annual hydro-power production is around 200 terawatt hours (TWh), but it can vary by 40 TWh in either direction between wet and dry years. These changes have been quite fast. At the beginning of 2016 Nordic water reservoirs were 15 TWh above the long-term average, and by the end of 2016 they had dropped 23 TWh to 8 TWh below the long-term average. There is a direct correlation to how much we can produce. In 2016, our hydro production was almost 20% lower than the year before. The varying hydrological situation in combination with the changes in commodity prices caused very high volatility in power forwards, especially for 2017.
Our comparable operating profit for continuing operations was EUR 644 million, down 20% from 2015. The decline was mainly due to significantly lower hydro-power production and the lower achieved power price.
Operationally, the year met our expectations, as availability in our plants was good and ongoing projects progressed as planned. We completed our extensive investment programme in Russia in spring 2016, and the new capacity has been the key driver for the earnings growth in the Russia division.
Also positive was the Swedish political agreement on energy policy in June and the government's budget proposal in September. The budget proposal included the timetable for lowering the real-estate tax on hydro assets and for phasing out the nuclear capacity tax over the coming years. We are very pleased with the swift decision and the finalisation of the timetable, which gives regulatory stability to operate the plants and plan the necessary safety investments. This is completely in line with what we have been advocating for: a regulation and taxation policy where the different forms of CO2-free production are treated more equally.

Going forward
The number one priority for Fortum going forward is to ensure a controlled transition towards a low-carbon energy system. Accordingly, our CO2-free production should increase. It is important to recognise that the development is not necessary linear. Sometimes it may seem that we are taking one step back before taking two steps forward.
To the extent we have fossil production, our goal and strategy is, of course, to make it as efficient as possible. Our specific CO2 emissions from power generation, measured as grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour produced (gCO2/kWh), puts us among the lowest emitters of all utilities in Europe. In 2016, 96% of our power generation in the European Union was CO2-free. Including the Russian power generation, which is mainly gas-based, and our Indian solar power, 62% is still CO2-free, and our specific CO2 emissions of 173 gCO2/kWh puts us in the category of one of the cleanest utilities in Europe.
The energy sector is among the key sectors that can contribute to this mitigation, but the focus should not be solely on electricity generation. We at Fortum have decided to take an active role in mitigating climate change also by creating solutions for sustainable cities, by developing new products and services to help our customers mitigate their carbon footprint, and by building new energy ventures that we believe will play an important role in the future sustainable energy system.
We do this because it is the right thing to do for society, for our customers and for our shareholders. By being at the forefront of creating the new sustainable energy system, I am confident we will create value, stronger earnings per share, and a good platform for producing stable, sustainable and over time increasing dividends.
I would like to thank all our employees and partners for their excellent work in 2016. Thank you also to our customers and shareholders for your continued trust in us. I look forward to continuing to work together with all of you for a cleaner world.

Megatrends and the energy industry
The world we live in is changing at an ever-increasing pace. Staying competitive requires companies to be very aware of the underlying megatrends and to take an active role in driving the change for a better future.
This is especially true for the energy industry, as decarbonisation of the energy system plays an essential role in meeting the environmental targets of society. Only by working actively to decarbonise the energy system, significantly expand the share of renewable energy in the energy markets, reduce the emissions, increase the efficiency of older assets, and increase the amount of flexibility in the system can we mitigate climate change.
There are four megatrends that shape the energy sector: Climate change and resource efficiency, Urbanisation, Digitalisation & new technologies, and Active customers. These megatrends will bring profound changes not only to how energy is produced and sold to customers, but also to how it is consumed. The megatrends will also push to maximise the value of resources, such as waste and biomass.
Climate change and resource efficiency
Climate change and global warming is one of the largest challenges facing mankind. The problem is global, and global efforts and commitment are required in order to solve it. Discussions about climate change have been ongoing for decades, but actions have not been sufficient, due to lack of commitment, although positive developments have been seen in some regions.
With the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, mitigation of climate change rose to the top of the agenda all over the world. The commitment to mitigate climate change in order to limit global warming is now so widely spread that it affects every industry. The effects can be seen everywhere, e.g. the increase in low- or zero-emission housing, better fuel efficiency, the increase in the number of electric vehicles, the rapid growth in solar and wind power production, fuel switches to more environmentally friendly fuels, increased resource efficiency and waste recycling.
The whole energy industry is very heavily affected by this megatrend. This can be seen in the transition to low-carbon and renewable generation, which increases the share of intermittent

power production and the need for demand response and flexible generation capacity. The increased need for resource efficiency paves the way for circular economy solutions.
Urbanisation
The second megatrend is urbanisation. Over the last decades an ever-increasing share of the world's population has moved to urban areas and the trend is continuing. This megatrend is very evident in the emerging markets of Asia, where an increasing share of the global GDP growth comes from the growing urban areas.
For many people in developing countries urbanisation might also mean electrification as 1.2 billion people still lack access to electricity. Increased urbanisation creates a demand for sustainable, efficient and reliable utility services. In many areas of the world the current heating, cooling and energy production is based on old technologies with high emissions and low efficiency. The increasing urbanisation creates a demand for utilities with efficient solutions for heating, cooling and electricity production.

New solutions are also needed for transportation and waste management. The amount of waste is expected to nearly double between 2015 and 2025. Even with the increase in recycling and waste-to-energy solutions, the global municipal solid waste going to landfills is projected to grow over the coming years.
Digitalisation & new technologies
Technology development has always been a driver for change. Digitalisation as a megatrend is further fuelled by the accelerated pace of commercialisation and adoption of new technologies. The processing power of devices is increasing and the amount of connected devices is growing exponentially. This in combination with an ever-increasing amount of data readily available for consumers and businesses creates the perfect breeding ground for innovation.

2/3 of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050
Source: World Urbanization Prospects by United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2014
This megatrend affects all companies and businesses. One example of how technological innovations can quickly transform industries is Uber and its impact on the taxi business. Rapid technological development and high adoption rates quickly drive down the costs for new technologies.
In the energy sector the cost of wind and solar power is decreasing. In the next 25 years the amount of solar power is expected to grow 12-fold and wind power more than 3-fold. This development leads to an increasing share of intermittent power production and fewer running hours for traditional baseload power. This challenges the way the energy system has been functioning, where production has been able to adapt to the changing power demand of customers.

Digitalisation opens up for new storage and demand-response solutions, which could change the way the customer interacts with the market. There will be new ways to produce, market, sell and deliver products and services offered by utilities, start-ups and new market entrants. Through these services, customers can take an active part in balancing a future power system that is heavily dependent on intermittent power production.
Active customers
As new technologies are creating a market for new products, there is another megatrend driving the change: Active customers. Customers are becoming more conscious about their choices and how they affect society. Customers are more willing to participate in the energy markets, they are aware of what the new technologies enable, and they are demanding services and solutions for that, e.g. home automation, electrical vehicles with smart charging solutions, local power production and storage as well as demandresponse solutions.
The market for prosumers (consumers who produce some of their own energy) is growing rapidly. They require solutions for storage and two-way power flows to/from their house, as they act both as consumers and producers of energy. This challenges how the energy markets traditionally have worked and offers great potential for innovation and growth.
The large majority of customers are not yet demanding these types of services; but as the services emerge, they can be expanded to the masses on a large scale, which will have profound effects on the whole market.
Twenty years ago, less than 3 percent of the world's population had a mobile phone; now two-thirds of the world's population has one, and one-third of all humans are able to communicate on the Internet.

Market Development
In early 2016, many commodity prices reached long-term low price levels. This marked the bottom of a downward trend that had continued for many years. In February, coal prices1 were as low as USD 36.50 per tonne. Since the price of coal is one of the main drivers for European power prices, this also heavily impacted Nordic power prices with the Nasdaq OMX forward price for 2017 dropping to as low as EUR 16.30 per MWh.
From February to December the markets were characterised mainly by increasing prices and high volatility, as markets peaked in early November. Coal prices almost doubled (USD 70.25 per tonne at year end), resulting in increasing power prices. At the same time, prices for CO2 emission allowances (EUA) fluctuated between EUR 4 and 6 per tonne for most of 2016 and ended at EUR 6.5 per tonne at the end of the year, down from EUR 8.1 per tonne at the beginning of 2016. This added to the price volatility on the Nordic power market.
The hydrological situation changed to the drier during 2016 due to low precipitation in the Nordic area and high hydropower production mainly in Norway. Precipitation in Sweden was low

during 2016 resulting in lower hydropower production compared to 2015. At the beginning of 2016, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 98 TWh, which is 15 TWh above the long-term average and 18 TWh higher than a year earlier. By the end of the year, reservoirs were 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23 TWh lower than at the end of 2015.
The Nordic spot power prices at the beginning of 2016 were lower than in 2015. Due to increasing coal prices and the tightening hydrological situation the spot prices increased above the 2015 levels from the middle of the second quarter and stayed above the 2015 levels throughout 2016. The average system spot price during 2016 was EUR 26.9 per MWh, with the area price in Finland at EUR 32.4 per MWh and in Sweden SE3 (Stockholm) at EUR 29.2 per MWh. The increase was especially evident in the third quarter when the system spot price almost doubled from the exceptionally low level in 2015. The very low prices in 2015 were caused by high inflows and late snow melt.
Nordic electricity consumption in 2016 increased by 8 TWh to 390 TWh, mainly due to closer to long-term average temperatures compared to the warmer year in 2015; however, a modest basic demand growth seen in the Nordic countries also contributed to the increase in consumption.

In early 2016, many commodity prices reached long-term low price levels. This marked the bottom of a downward trend that had continued for many years.

Strategy
We are ready to take the lead in driving the transformation towards a cleaner world
Our vision "For a cleaner world" reflects our ambition to drive the transformation towards a low-emissions energy system and optimal resource efficiency.
Our mission is to engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a cleaner world. Our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions. This way we deliver excellent shareholder value.
Fortum's strategy
Fortum's strategy has four cornerstones: 1) Drive productivity and industry transformation, 2) Create solutions for sustainable cities, 3) Grow in solar and wind, and 4) Build new energy ventures.
Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy. The tight link between business operations and corporate responsibility underscores the importance of sustainability as a competitive advantage. In our operations, we give balanced consideration to economic, social and environmental responsibility.
Drive productivity and industry transformation As the entire energy sector is transforming, our first priority is to participate in the consolidation of the generation business in Europe. This includes at least one sizable acquisition targeted to take place during 2017. This will maximise our opportunities for growth and value creation.
To ensure our competitiveness, we will continue to optimise our cost structure and asset portfolio in all businesses. We aim to reduce the fixed cost base according to our earlier announced plan, by EUR 100 million by the end of 2017. The progress so far has been good.
Create solutions for sustainable cities The scope of our City Solutions has broadened to include efficient resource management within the circular economy. The Ekokem acquisition offers us a good platform for new types of solutions outside the traditional energy sector. Further organic- and/or

acquisition-based growth of City Solutions will also be considered, mainly in Europe.
Growing cities and urban areas are facing multiple challenges, such as high emissions from inefficient heating, cooling and electricity production, increasing amounts of waste, and high traffic pollution and noise. Fortum aims to use its expertise and experience to help cities solve these challenges sustainably and to support the building of a circular economy.

Grow in solar and wind To secure our longer term competitiveness, we will continue to develop the solar and wind business. In wind, we will focus on areas closer to our current home markets in the Nordics and in Russia. In solar, the immediate focus is in India. The next step will focus on system integration, combining solar with other components, such as new consumer solutions, demand response, electric vehicles and storage.
We target a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio. These technologies are rapidly maturing. At the same time, utility

competences are becoming increasingly important as subsidy schemes are gradually being phased out and renewable energy production is becoming more market-based.
Build new energy ventures We will acquire and invest in start-ups and funds that focus on energy-related technologies, because technological and digital disruption accelerate energy sector transformation. Start-ups have an increasingly important role in innovating both new technologies and business models in the changing energy industry landscape. Digitalisation will enable productivity improvements in the existing businesses and development of new customer offerings.
Our goal is to be in the forefront of energy technology and application development. To accelerate innovation and commercialisation of new offerings, we will strengthen our inhouse focus on innovation and digitalisation, partner with global

leading suppliers, promising technology companies and research institutions, as well as make direct and indirect investments in start-ups with encouraging new innovations.
Our next strategic steps, in two phases
The execution of our strategy and the redeployment of cash will take place in two phases. A significant part of the redeployment is targeted to take place during 2017.
In the first phase, the goal is to maximise cash flow through balance sheet redeployment. Our first priority is to participate in the consolidation of the generation business in Europe. This will include at least one sizable acquisition targeted to take place during 2017. This is the area we know best, and we believe that this move will maximise our opportunities for growth and value creation.
We plan also to invest to broaden the City Solutions business scope, mainly in Europe ­ organically and/or through acquisitions.

The Ekokem acquisition in 2016 offers us a good platform for new types of circular economy solutions, while maintaining a strong connection to our traditional core, the energy system.
The resulting cash flow will be used to enable a competitive dividend and for investments into longer term competitiveness. In addition, Fortum will continue its cost structure and asset portfolio optimisation in all divisions.
The second phase of strategy implementation will focus on securing Fortum's longer-term competitiveness. This has already started through wind investments in our Nordic and Russian home markets and solar investments in India. The next steps will include solar-enabled system solutions, maximising the added value from waste and biomass, and minimising fossil emissions. In addition, new digital services, active consumers, electric traffic, new storage solutions and other potentially disruptive innovations will be included in Phase 2.

The Fortum Transformation
Sustainability and CO2-free power generation have been part of Fortum's strategy for several decades. We believe that the energy system needs to transform to a system with substantially lower emissions, higher resource efficiency and a higher share of power generation based on renewables. In implementing our strategy we have worked to increase our CO2-free power generation. We also have generation capacity based on fossil fuels, located mainly in Russia, and we have worked to increase its efficiency and reduce its specific emissions. We are focusing on increasing our solar and wind power capacity heavily over the coming years, and we are targeting a gigawatt-scale portfolio in solar and wind power.
Long-term focus on increasing CO2-free power generation
Over the past decades Fortum has been working for a more sustainable world. We have increased our annual CO2-free power generation from around 15 TWh in 1990 to 46 TWh in 2016. The development has not always been linear, as annual variations in hydropower production have a significant impact.
We have been advocating for market-based solutions to drive the necessary change in the energy system. We were among the early proponents for a market-based price on CO2. In our own operations we have invested in CO2-free power generation, and the carbon exposure of our production in Europe is among the lowest in Europe at 28 gCO2/kWh in 2016. The respective figure for the Fortum overall was 173 gCO2/kWh in 2016.
Increase efficiency and reduce specific emissions
In 2016, Fortum finalised the investment programme in Russia. Thereby our Russian power and heat generation capacity has increased substantially. By investing in high-efficiency combined power and heat plants, we have increased the power and heat output and at the same time substantially decreased the specific CO2 emissions from our Russian power and heat production.
Fortum is now operating a fleet of power and heat plants with efficiency and emissions ranking among the best of our peers in Russia.

Grow in solar and wind
In addition to CO2-free hydro and nuclear power production, we believe that solar and wind power will play an essential role in the future. Solar power is becoming one of the most competitive forms of new power generation in many parts of the world, and we are targeting investments of EUR 200-400 million in solar power in India.
The market conditions in the Nord Pool area and in Russia are more suitable for wind power, and Fortum is increasing its investments heavily. Fortum is currently building the country's largest wind farm in Russia. In Sweden, Fortum is participating in the Blaiken wind park that is already operational and in the Solberg wind farm, that is due to be commissioned in 2018. In Norway, Fortum announced the purchase of one operational wind farm and two wind farm projects to be commissioned in 2018 and 2019, pending final investment decisions.
Our target in wind power is up to 1,000 MW in the Nord Pool area and up to 500 MW in Russia.
The growth target in solar and wind is substantial compared to the current solar and wind capacity of slightly less than 60 MW and would represent a more than 10% increase in Fortum's current total power generation capacity of more than 13,000 MW.

We believe that the energy system needs to transform to a system with substantially lower emissions, higher resource efficiency and a higher share of power generation based on renewables.

2016 was a challenging year in many respects. The beginning of the year was characterised by increased commodity market volatility; especially coal and oil prices were very low. Nordic water reservoirs were clearly above the long-term average, creating pressure on electricity prices, and the British EU exit vote also created uncertainty. Late in the year, however, some positive signs were seen on the power market, mainly driven by improved commodity and emission prices, although the overall business environment still continued to be demanding. Although some European economies have started to recover, the industry's power demand is still too weak and commodity prices are too low and volatile to support a material increase in electricity prices.
A positive development in 2016 was the Swedish government's budget proposal in September; it included the timetable for lowering the real-estate tax on hydro assets and for phasing out the nuclear capacity tax over the coming years. We are pleased with the swift decision and the finalisation of a timetable, which gives regulatory stability to operate the plants and plan the necessary safety investments. This is completely in line with what we have been advocating for, a regulation and taxation policy where the different forms of production are treated more equally.
Operationally, the year met our expectations, as availability in our plants was good and ongoing projects progressed as planned. We completed our extensive investment programme in Russia in the spring 2016, and the new capacity has been the key driver for the earnings growth in the Russia division.
In February, we published the key high-level elements in our strategy. We also adjusted our operational model to better enable strategy implementation. During the year we screened opportunities in line with our strategy. The acquisition of the Polish electricity and gas sales company DUON, wind power investments in Sweden, Norway and Russia, and the acquisition of Ekokem, a leading Nordic circular economy company, are important steps in the implementation of our strategy and give us access to new revenue streams independent of the Nordic power

price. In addition, as we are continuously looking to optimise our production fleet, we divested the Tobolsk power plant in Russia.
We updated our vision and mission in the autumn. Our vision and mission go beyond just clean energy production, they express our commitment to fuel and resource efficiency and how we enable our stakeholders, customers and society to make sustainable choices. Our updated vision ­ `For a cleaner world' reflects our ambition to drive the transformation towards an low-emission energy system and optimal resource efficiency. Our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions.
We expect the energy sector transformation to accelerate in the future. At the same time as we lower the cost and improve the productivity of our existing operations, we will focus on additional organic and M&A growth opportunities. We have two phases in our capital redeployment. Priority one in phase one is generation consolidation in Europe ­ consolidation of assets and businesses within our core competence and giving us direct access to cash flows. Priority two in phase one is to take the competencies that we have today in our combined heat and power production and in the acquired Ekokem business, and widen the City Solution's scope. The overall goal of phase one is to maximize our cash flow to enable both a competitive dividend and "phase two" investments into the future energy system. Phase two involves growing in solar and wind, and new internal or external energy ventures to take care of our long-term competitiveness.
Fortum's vision, strategic cornerstones and updated financial targets
In February 2016, Fortum launched its new vision, strategic cornerstones and updated financial targets. The new vision and strategy target growth and continued profitability with a strong focus on clean energy, customers and shareholder value creation.
The long-term financial target for return on capital employed (ROCE) was revised to at least 10%, while the target for comparable net debt to EBITDA, around 2.5 times, remained unchanged. The dividend policy also remained unchanged.

Fortum's strategy has four cornerstones: (1) enhance productivity of the current fleet and drive industry transformation, (2) create sustainable solutions for growing cities and urban areas, (3) increase investments in solar and wind power, and (4) build new energy ventures.
At Fortum's Capital Market Day in November 2016, the strategy execution plan was expanded in more depth. The redeployment of cash and the execution of Fortum's strategy will take place in two phases, and a significant part of the redeployment is targeted to take place during 2017.
Phase 1: The goal for the first phase is to maximise cash flow through capital redeployment. The priority is consolidation of the generation business in Europe. After this, and subject to the remaining financial headroom, also further organic growth and/ or acquisition-based growth of City Solutions will be considered, mainly in Europe. The resulting cash flow will be used for two purposes: 1) implementing Fortum's dividend policy; and 2) investments into Phase 2 as described below. In addition, Fortum will continue its cost and asset portfolio optimisation in all divisions, informing the market about these as they advance.
Phase 2: The goal for the second phase is to secure Fortum's longer-term competitiveness. This has already started through wind investments in our Nordic and Russian home markets and through solar investments in India. The next steps will include solar-enabled system solutions, maximising the added value from waste and biomass as well as minimising fossil emissions. In addition, phase 2 will also include new digital services, services for active consumers, electric traffic, new storage solutions, and other potentially disruptive innovations.
Fortum also updated its vision and mission to cover a broader scope. "For a cleaner world" reflects the company's mission "We engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a cleaner world. Our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions. In this way we deliver excellent shareholder value."

Reorganisation of operations
Fortum reorganised its operating structure in April 2016. The target of the new organisation is to enable the implementation of the company's new vision and strategy. The new organisation consists of three business divisions: Generation, City Solutions and Russia. In addition, two development units focusing on growing new businesses were established: (1) M&A and Solar & Wind Development, and (2) Technology and New Ventures.
The changes to Fortum's segment reporting were minor. The company continues to have four segments. The segments as of the second quarter of 2016 are: Generation (mainly the former Power and Technology); City Solutions (mainly the former Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions); Russia; and Other, under which M&A, Solar & Wind Development, and Technology and New Ventures, as well as corporate functions are reported. Some businesses were repositioned due to the reorganisation, but because of the minor financial impact, the comparable segment information for 2015 has not been restated.
Following the divestment of the Swedish distribution business, Fortum no longer has electricity distribution operations. The Distribution segment was reclassified as discontinued operations as of the first quarter of 2015.

New Finnish GAAP requirement for financial derivatives
A new requirement issued by Finnish Accounting Board relating to accounting for financial derivatives was published 13 December 2016. The requirements have to be applied in 2016 separate financial statements for Finnish companies. Based on this requirement Fortum has chosen to apply IFRS principles for accounting financial derivatives in Fortum Oyj and its Finnish subsidiaries.
Applying IFRS principles means that financial derivatives are fair valued at each balance sheet date, which may create volatility in income statement and equity. The changes due to the new requirement has no effect to Fortum Group, but had a minor effect to net profit and equity of Fortum Oyj in 2016.
Comparability of information presented in tables and graphs
Fortum has restated the financial information in prior years as follows: · Distribution segment is treated as discontinued operations in
2015. The comparative period information for 2014 was restated accordingly, but information in the tables and graphs presented for year 2013 or earlier is not restated due to reclassification of discontinued operations. Financial results discussed in this operating and financial review are for the continuing operations of Fortum Group. See additional information in Note 14 Discontinued operations. · Furthermore, information in the tables and graphs presented for year 2012 or earlier is not restated due to the adoption of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. Adoption of standards influences treatment of Fortum's holding in AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholms stad in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, as of 2014, presented figures have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the sum presented. Figures in brackets refer to the comparison period unless otherwise stated.

In 2016, sales were EUR 3,632 (3,459) million. Comparable EBITDA totalled EUR 1,015 (1,102) million. Comparable operating profit totalled EUR 644 (808) million and reported operating profit totalled EUR 633 (-150) million. Fortum's operating profit for the period was impacted by items affecting comparability, including sales gains, Ekokem transaction costs, updated provisions and an IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for hedging Fortum's power production, as well as nuclear fund adjustments for continuing operations, amounting to EUR -11 (-958) million ( Note 5 and Note 6). The year 2015 included a EUR -794 million impact from the decision on the early closure of two nuclear units in Sweden ( Note 5 and Note 7).
The share of profit from associates was EUR 131 (20) million, of which Hafslund represented EUR 51 (39) million, TGC-1 EUR 38 (32) million, Fortum Värme EUR 66 (47) million and OKG EUR -30 (-107) million. The share of profit from Hafslund and TGC-1 are based on the companies' published Q4 2015 and Q1­Q3 2016 interim reports ( Note 20). The OKG impact comes from the new technical plan for nuclear waste management ( Note 30). Year 2015 was affected by the decision on the early closure of two nuclear units in Sweden, which impacted the share of profit from associates by EUR -116 million ( Note 7). In addition, Fortum Värme's share of profit in 2015 was lower mainly due to the paid compensation for refinancing the interest-bearing loans from Fortum.
Net financial expenses were EUR -169 (-175) million and include changes in the fair value of financial instruments of EUR -2 (-18)
6

million. In 2015, net financial expenses included compensation of EUR 37 million from the prepayment of loans by Fortum Värme ( Note 12).
Profit before taxes was EUR 595 (-305) million. Year 2015, was impacted by EUR -910 million due to the decision on the early closing of the two nuclear units in Sweden. Taxes for the period totalled EUR -90 (78) million. The effective income tax rate according to the income statement was 15.2% (25.4%). The comparable effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of the share of profit from associated companies and joint ventures as well as non-taxable capital gains, was 20.0% (23.5%) ( Note 13).
The profit for the period for continuing operations was EUR 504 (-228) million. Earnings per share for continuing operations were EUR 0.56 (-0.26), of which EUR -0.02 (-0.97) per share relates to items affecting comparability. In 2015, the impact of the decision on the early closure of two nuclear units in Sweden was EUR -0.82 per share.

Cash flow
In 2016, net cash from operating activities from continuing operations decreased by EUR 607 million to EUR 621 (1,228) million, mainly due to EUR 87 million lower comparable EBITDA, EUR 151 million higher income taxes paid, EUR -182 million lower realised foreign exchange gains and losses, and an EUR 131 million increase in working capital. The increase in working capital is mainly due to the daily cash settlements for futures in Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe ( Additional cash flow information). In

June, Fortum paid income taxes in Sweden totalling EUR 127 million regarding tax disputes. The appeal process is ongoing and based on legal opinions, no provision is made, and the payment is booked as a receivable ( Note 38). Realised foreign exchange gains and losses of EUR 110 (292) million relate to the rollover of foreign exchange contract hedging loans to Fortum's Swedish and Russian subsidiaries.
Capital expenditures increased by EUR 72 million to EUR 599 (527) million. Net cash used in investing activities increased to EUR 1,701 (35) million, due to the acquired shares of EUR 695 (43) million related mainly to acquisitions of Ekokem and DUON. The increase in other interest-bearing receivables of EUR 340 million during 2016 relates mainly to cash collaterals, given as trading collaterals to commodity exchanges.
Cash flow before financing activities was EUR -1,080 (7,650) million. In 2015, the impact from discontinued operations was EUR 6,457 million.
Fortum paid dividends totalling EUR 977 (1,155) million in April 2016. Payments of long-term and short-term liabilities totalled EUR 1,031 (1,040) million including repayment of a EUR 750 million bond and EUR 115 million Ekokem loans. The net decrease in liquid funds was EUR 3,064 (increase of 5,490) million.

Key figures
At the end of 2016, the comparable net debt to EBITDA was 0.0 (-1.7). Gearing was 0% (-16%) and the equity-to-assets ratio 62%
(61%). Equity per share was EUR 15.15 (15.53). Return on capital employed for year 2016 totalled 4.0% (22.7%).
Market conditions
Nordic countries
According to preliminary statistics, electricity consumption in the Nordic countries increased in 2016 by 9 TWh to 390 (381) TWh, mainly due to closer-to-long-term average temperature compared to the warmer year in 2015, although modest demand growth was seen in the Nordic countries.
At the beginning of 2016, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 98 TWh, which is 15 TWh above the long-term average and 18 TWh higher than a year earlier. By the end of the year, reservoirs were 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23 TWh lower than at the end of 2015. Reservoir levels have decreased due to low precipitation in the Nordic area and high hydro production mainly in Norway during 2016.
In 2016, the Nord Pool average system spot price was EUR 26.9 (21.0) per MWh, with the area price in Finland at EUR 32.4 (29.7) per
8

MWh and in Sweden SE3 (Stockholm) at EUR 29.2 (22.0) per MWh. Nordic reservoirs turned from a 15 TWh surplus to an 8 TWh deficit during the year. 2016 was again warmer than normal, but less so than in 2015.
In Germany, the average spot price in 2016 was EUR 29.0 (31.6) per MWh.
The market price of CO2 emission allowances (EUA) was EUR 8.1 per tonne at the beginning of the year. Throughout most of the fourth quarter and the whole calendar year the price fluctuated between EUR 4 and 6 per tonne and ended at EUR 6.5 per tonne at the end of 2016.
Russia
Fortum operates both in the Tyumen and Khanty-Mansiysk area of Western Siberia, where industrial production is dominated by the oil and gas industries, and in the Chelyabinsk area of the Urals, which is dominated by the metal industry.
According to preliminary statistics, Russian electricity consumption was 1,027 (1,007) TWh and the corresponding figure in Fortum's operating area in the First price zone (European and Urals part of Russia) was 787 (772) TWh in 2016.
In 2016, the average electricity spot price, excluding capacity price, increased by 4.3% to RUB 1,204 (1,154) per MWh in the First price zone.

European business environment and carbon market
Carbon pricing and emissions trading
The ratification of the global climate agreement adopted in Paris 2015, entered into force in November 2016. Preparation of implementation rules will take a couple of years, and the impact on the energy industry will become concrete only via legislation in different countries. The EU ratified the Agreement, but Russia's ratification is not expected before 2020. Carbon pricing schemes are being planned in several countries. The start of the Chinese ETS in 2017 is expected to double the coverage of emissions subject to carbon pricing globally.
The EU Commission released an announcement on the implications of the Paris Agreement for the EU climate policy. The EU decided not to revise its climate target for 2030. Basically all EU climate regulation to implement the 2030 target was under review in 2016. The revision of the emissions trading directive (ETS) was under discussion in the Parliament and the Council, but adoption isn't expected until late 2017 at the earliest or in 2018. Fortum and the electricity industry as a whole have highlighted the need to increase the ETS ambition and strengthen the market stability reserve mechanism.
Progress in implementation of the Energy Union
Year 2016 was the EU Energy Union's "year of delivery" with the release of three major legislative packages. The in early 2016 released "winter package" focused on security of supply and on heating and cooling (H&C). The new EU H&C strategy underlined the importance of decarbonisation of heating and cooling and the improvement of energy efficiency in the residential sector. The "summer package" contained a proposal for sharing the burden in the non-ETS sectors, i.e. binding national targets for member states to cut CO2 emissions in transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management in 2021­2030. The strategy has a strong focus on electrification of the transport sector while also recognising

the role of biofuels. A broader "winter package" (Clean Energy for all Europeans) released in late 2016 completed to a large extent the legislative work in the field of energy. The winter package includes a renewal of the internal electricity market legislation, as well as energy efficiency and renewable energy directives with the intention to implement the related EU 2030 targets.
Swedish energy policy and taxation
The focus of the energy policy in 2016 was on the parliamentary energy commission's work with the aim of developing a longterm energy policy for the period after 2030. In June, a broad parliamentary agreement for long-term Swedish energy policy was presented by the government and parts of the opposition. The agreement aims at a 100% renewable energy system by 2040, but with no actual limits regarding nuclear generation. The electricity certificate system will be prolonged providing for an additional 18 TWh of electricity from renewable energy sources during 2020­2030. The progress of the energy agreement will be followedup every second year starting in 2018.
One of the key elements of the parliamentary agreement was the proposal that taxation of different energy production forms should be more equal, and that the tax burden of nuclear and hydro should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The tax on installed nuclear capacity will be reduced starting in July 2017 and totally abolished as of 2018. The regulatory framework for investment of the nuclear waste funds' assets is suggested to be expanded to provide for a better long-term yield. The real-estate tax rate on hydro assets will be reduced from current 2.8% to the regular tax rate of 0.5% on real estate in four steps by 2020. In addition, a proposal for new hydro legislation is being prepared and is expected to be handed over to the parliament in autumn 2017.

Finnish energy policy and taxation
In late 2016 the Finnish Government published its energy and climate strategy in order to implement both the national energy and climate policy objectives of the Government's strategic programme, as well as the EU 2030 energy and climate targets. The key elements are: increase the share of renewable energy to a minimum of 50% with a strong focus on bioenergy, launch of a limited support scheme for renewable electricity (2 TWh of electricity production is auctioned, based on technology neutral tendering, in 2018­2020), 30% biofuel blending obligation and some incentives for electric vehicles as well as a ban on the use of coal in energy production by 2030.
In addition, the Finnish Government decided to increase the tax on heating fuels from 2017 onwards. However, CHP continues to pay only 50% of the CO2 tax component, while the original aim was to increase it to 100%. The agreed tax model increases the tax on both the CO2 and the energy content components. The Government also decided to make an assessment during 2017 concerning the possibility to apply real estate tax rates applicable to power plants also to wind power. Currently windmills below 3 MW are in the scope of lower tax rates. The earlier announced mechanism to offset the indirect costs of the EU Emissions Trading System for energy intensive industries was also approved.

1) The Nordic power sales income and volume includes hydro and nuclear generation, excluding minorities. It does not include thermal generation, minorities, customer business or other purchases.
2) Power plants are often built jointly with other power producers, and owners purchase electricity at cost including interest cost and production taxes. The share of profit/loss is mainly IFRS adjustments (e.g. accounting for nuclear-related assets and liabilities) and depreciations on fair-value adjustments from historical acquisitions ( Note 20).

In 2016, the Generation segment's comparable EBITDA was EUR 527 (680) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 417 (561) million. The decline was mainly due to the lower achieved power price and lower hydro volumes. The decline was partly offset by higher nuclear volumes and lower fixed costs.
Operating profit of EUR 338 (-396) million was affected by sales gains, the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives, mainly used for hedging Fortum's power production, and by nuclear fund adjustments, amounting to EUR -79 (-958) million ( Note 5 and Note 6). Year 2015 included EUR -794 million from the decision on the early closure of two nuclear units in Sweden ( Note 5 and Note 7).

In August, Fortum finalised the acquisition of Ekokem Corporation. The transaction was originally announced in May 2016. Ekokem has been integrated as a business area into the City Solutions division and has been consolidated into Fortum Group from the end of August 2016.
In 2016, sales increased to EUR 1,424 (1,187) million, mainly due to the consolidation of DUON and Ekokem. Heat sales volumes

of the City Solutions segment amounted to 8.7 (7.8) TWh. Power sales volumes from CHP production totalled 2.8 (2.5) TWh during the same period.
Comparable EBITDA increased, and totalled EUR 238 (209) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 112 (108) million. The main drivers for the improvement were the consolidations of DUON and Ekokem. The full year result was burdened by an unfavourable fuel mix and the lower achieved power price. In addition, the use of more accurate consumption estimates had a one-off, positive impact on electricity sales in 2015.
Operating profit of EUR 145 (105) million was affected mainly by sales gains, Ekokem transaction costs and the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives totalling EUR 33 (-3) million ( Note 5).
The share of profits from associated companies and joint ventures totalled EUR 76 (59) million, including mainly the share of profit from Fortum Värme ( Note 20).

After the completion of the multi-year investment programme in March 2016, Fortum has 2,268 MW of new capacity i.e. generation capacity built after 2007, which under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA ­ "new capacity") receives guaranteed payments for a period of 10 years after the commissioning of each new unit.
The received capacity payments vary depending on the age, location, type and size of the plant, as well as on seasonality and availability. The CSA payments can also vary somewhat annually, as they are linked to Russian Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years' maturity. In early 2016, the System Administrator of the wholesale market published data on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the consumer price index (CPI) for 2015, which was used to calculate the capacity price on CSA in 2016. The CSA payments were revised upwards accordingly to reflect the higher bond rates. In addition, the regulator will review the guaranteed

CSA payments by re-examining earnings from the electricity-only market three and six years after the commissioning of a unit, and may revise the CSA payments accordingly.
All of Fortum's capacity generation built prior to 2008 (CCS ­ "old capacity"), totalling 2,214 MW in December 2016, was allowed to participate in the Competitive Capacity Selection for 2016, and the majority of Fortum's plants were selected. The volume of Fortum's installed capacity not selected in the auction totalled 175 MW, for which Fortum has obtained forced mode status, i.e. it is receiving payments for the capacity.
In 2016, the Russia segment's power sales volumes amounted to 29.5 (29.4) TWh and heat sales volumes totalled 20.6 (25.4) TWh. Electricity volumes increased mainly due to the commissioning of two new units in Chelyabinsk. The divestment of the Tobolsk CHP plant in February 2016 decreased the growth impact on both electricity and heat volumes.
The Russia segment's comparable EBITDA was EUR 312 (267) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 191 (201) million, including CSA provision releases of EUR 2 (52) million. The positive effect came from operationally good performance and high utilisation rates in the power plants, the commissioning of new units as well as from the higher received CSA payments following the adjustments of the WACC component in the CSA prices. The Russian rouble had a negative effect of EUR 13 million.
Operating profit was EUR 226 (203) million, including sales gains of EUR 35 (1) million ( Note 5).
The share of profits from associated companies and joint ventures totalled EUR 38 (32) million ( Note 20). The operating profit (EBIT) for the whole Russia segment, which includes the share of TGC-1, totalled RUB 19.5 billion in 2016, including a sales gain RUB 2.6 billion on the sale of Tobolsk.
Fortum started receiving capacity payments under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) for Chelyabinsk GRES unit 2 as of 1 March 2016. Fortum's extensive investment programme in Russia that started in 2008 was completed during 2016, as the final unit of the programme started its commercial operation.

In February, Fortum agreed to sell its 51.4% shareholding in the Estonian natural gas import, sales and distribution company AS Eesti Gaas. Fortum finalised the transaction in March 2016.
In March, Fortum completed the acquisition of 93.35% of the shares in the Polish electricity and gas sales company Grupa DUON S.A. In April, Fortum announced that it had purchased the remaining shares through a mandatory squeeze-out procedure, after which the extraordinary meeting of shareholders of Grupa DUON S.A. decided to delist the company from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
In May, Fortum signed an agreement with the four biggest owners of Ekokem Corporation, representing approximately 81% of the shares, to acquire their shareholding in the company for approximately EUR 470 million. This corresponded to a debtand cash-free purchase price of approximately EUR 700 million for 100% of the company, as Fortum made a tender offer to all remaining shareholders at the same price (EUR 165 per share). Fortum obtained the required competition clearances in July. Having reached the necessary ownership thresholds, Fortum has started a minority redemption process. At the end of 2016, Fortum's total ownership was approximately 98%.
In December, Fortum finalised the acquisition of 100% of Turebergs Recycling AB's shares from Turebergs Åkeri AB with an enterprise value of up to approximately EUR 11 million. The main business of Turebergs Recycling is environmental construction, recycling and processing of bottom ash from waste-to-energy plants.

Research and development
Sustainability is at the core of Fortum's strategy and, alongside Fortum's current businesses, the company is carefully exploring and developing new sources of growth within renewable energy production.
Fortum's goal is to be at the forefront of energy technology and application development. To accelerate innovation and the commercialisation of new offerings, Fortum strengthens its inhouse innovation and digitalisation efforts and builds partnerships with leading global suppliers, promising technology companies and research institutions. Fortum makes direct and indirect investments in start-ups with promising new innovations that focus on connectivity, have disruptive potential and accelerate the transition towards a circular economy. Fortum also invests in technologies that support better utilisation of the current asset base, and can create new markets and products for Fortum. The company is continuously looking for emerging clean energy solutions and for solutions that increase resource and system efficiency.
During 2016, Fortum's R&D focused on new urban, rural and industrial business concept studies as well as on the sustainability, quality and handling of mixed biofuels and biofuel availability. Another very important area is how to increase energy system flexibility throughout the energy value chain, from energy production to consumers as well as customer solutions. As part of this study Fortum developed a virtual power plant pilot in order to optimise the system by using household water heaters as well as household solar panels together with battery storage.
In nuclear R&D, a key objective is to enable growth of the nuclear services business. In 2016, focus was also on future nuclear technologies like Small Modular Reactors, and on further development of the safety and efficiency of Fortum's nuclear power plants. Virtual Reality was developed for control room validation and radiation safety training purposes. The NURES product for purification of radioactive liquids was further developed to ensure our competitiveness.
In 2016, Fortum also invested in a Finnish biorefining technology company (Chempolis Oy) specialised in providing

innovative and sustainable carbon-neutral biorefining technologies for the biomass, energy, oil, paper, alcohol, sugar and chemical industries. Fortum is a significant user of biomass in its own operations, and it has promoted the importance of resource efficiency in the use of biomass and common sustainability criteria for biomass. The company believes that biomass could be used more efficiently for creating higher value products. Fortum also invested in the Swedish solar technology company, Exeger Sweden AB (Publ). The company is specialised in developing and producing novel printable solar cells for use in consumer electronics, on buildings and in other applications.
The Group reports its R&D expenditure on a yearly basis. In 2016, Fortum's R&D expenditure was EUR 52 (47) million, or 1.4% (1.4%) of sales.

Sustainability
Fortum strives for balanced management of economic, social and environmental responsibility in the company's operations. Fortum's sustainability targets consist both of Group-level key indicators and division-level indicators.
The Group-level sustainability targets emphasise Fortum's role in society and measure not only environmental and safety targets, but also Fortum's reputation, customer satisfaction, employee wellbeing, and the security of production of power and heat. At the beginning of 2016, the Group-level target-setting was changed by taking work wellbeing, measured as a percentage of sicknessrelated absences, as a new Group target. In terms of specific carbon dioxide emissions (gCO2/kWh), Fortum focuses on measuring Group-level specific emissions from total energy production.
The achievement of the sustainability targets is monitored in monthly, quarterly and annual reporting. Sustainability target-setting and follow-up, as well as the approval of Fortum's Sustainability Policy, and the review of Fortum's Sustainability Reporting, are included in the working order of the Board of Directors. Complete data on Fortum's sustainability performance is published in Fortum's Sustainability Report.

Investor information

The company is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange and is included in the STOXX Global ESG Leaders, OMX GES Sustainability Finland, and ECPI® indices. Fortum is also ranked in category A- and as the top Nordic company in the utilities sector in the annual CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) rating 2016, and it has received a Prime Status (B-) rating by the German oekom research AG.
In 2016, integration of Ekokem and Duon operations into Fortum's sustainability approach and data compilation systems were started. Sustainability information relating to DUON's operations is included in sustainability reporting from 1 April 2016 and Ekokem's operations from 1 September 2016.
Economic responsibility
For Fortum, economic responsibility means competitiveness, performance excellence and market-driven production, which create long-term value for our stakeholders and enable profitable growth. Satisfied customers are key to Fortum's success. Fortum aims to manage its supply chain in a responsible manner.
Fortum's goal is to achieve excellent financial performance in strategically selected core areas through strong competence and responsible ways of operating. Fortum measures financial performance with return on capital employed (target: 10%) and capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA around 2.5). In addition, Fortum has used the applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 indicators for reporting economic responsibility as of 1 January 2014.
Targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored annually. Company reputation among the key stakeholders in the One Fortum Survey in 2016 improved to 72.5 points (on a scale of 1-100 points) and exceeded the target of 72.0 points. The Group target (70-74 points) for customer satisfaction was achieved in all business areas except electricity sales for business customers.
Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct. Fortum assesses the performance of its business partners with supplier qualification and supplier audits. In 2016, Fortum audited 13 (9) suppliers in China, India, Russia, Poland,

Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. In September 2016, Fortum signed a contract with an external service provider for conducting supplier sustainability audits.
Fortum as a tax payer
Fortum supports social development and wellbeing of the areas of operations by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum produces to society include not only corporate income taxes borne EUR 48 (106) million but also several other taxes. In 2016, Fortum's taxes borne were EUR 365 (413) million. Taxes borne include corporate income taxes, production taxes, employment taxes, taxes on property and cost of indirect taxes. Production taxes include also taxes paid through electricity purchased from associated companies.
In addition, Fortum administers and collects different taxes on behalf of governments and authorities. Such taxes include e.g. VAT, excise taxes on power consumed by customers, payroll taxes and withholding taxes. The amount of taxes collected by Fortum was EUR 376 (352) million.
Environmental responsibility
Fortum's aim is to provide its customers with environmentally benign products and services. Circular economy, resource and energy efficiency, and maximising the added value of waste and biomass are key priorities in Fortum's environmental approach. In addition, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of environmental impacts are emphasised in Fortum's environmental responsibility. The company's know-how in CO2-free hydro and nuclear power production and in energy-efficient combined heat and power production, investments in solar and wind power, as well as solutions for sustainable cities play a key role in this.
Fortum's Group-level environmental targets are related to CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents. At the end of 2016, 99.9% of Fortum's power and heat production worldwide had ISO 14001 certification.
Fortum's climate target over the next five years is for total specific CO2 emissions from both electricity and heat production in all countries to be below 200 g/kWh. The target is calculated

By 2020, Fortum's target is to achieve energy savings of more than 1,400 GWh annually, compared to 2012. At the end of 2016, about 1,372 GWh had been achieved. Among the projects executed in 2016 were nuclear plant refurbishments in Finland, hydropower plant refurbishments in Finland and Sweden, and gas turbine plant refurbishments in Russia.
Fortum's target was fewer than 23 major EHS incidents annually. In 2016, 22 (18) major EHS incidents took place in Fortum's operations: the incidents included 11 non-compliances with environmental permits, seven fires, one leak and three explosions. These incidents did not have significant environmental or financial impacts.
Social responsibility
Fortum's social responsibility emphasises the secure supply of electricity and heat, creating solutions for sustainable cities, operational and occupational safety, employee wellbeing, as well as ethical business operations and compliance with regulations. At the end of 2016, OHSAS 18001 certification covered 99.9% of Fortum's power and heat production worldwide.
The average energy availability of Fortum's CHP plants in 2016 was 97.4% (96.4%), clearly above the annual target level of 95%.
The total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) for Fortum employees in 2016 was 1.9 (1.6) per one million working hours, which is better than the Group-level frequency target ( 2.5). Fortum's target for the lost-workday injury frequency (LWIF) for own personnel was 1.0 and it was achieved (1.1). The lost-workday injury frequency for contractors was 3.0 (2.7), which is at the set target level. The number of serious occupational accidents was 13 (14).
Implementation of the agreed actions to improve contractor safety will continue with a specific focus on contractor safety and

the integration of the Ekokem and Duon operations. As of 1 January 2017, Fortum has changed the definition of the severity of workrelated accidents and is now focusing on the consequences or potential consequences of an accident rather than the length of the sick-leave. The Group target for 2017 is  5 severe accidents. By 2020 our target is to reduce severe accidents to zero.
The percentage of sickness-related absences in 2016 was 2.4 (2.4), which is at the target level.
Changes in Fortum's Management
In February 2016, Fortum announced that it will reorganise its corporate structure effective 1 April 2016. The target of the new organisation is to enable the implementation of the company's new vision and strategy, which were announced on 3 February 2016. The new organisation comprises three business divisions: Generation, City Solutions, and Russia. In addition, two development units focusing on growing new businesses have been established: M&A and Solar & Wind Development, and Technology and New Ventures. The new organisation will also have four staff functions: Finance; Legal; Strategy, People and Performance; and Corporate Affairs and Communications.
Fortum's Executive Management Team, as of 1 April 2016:

To be elected as new members; Mr Matti Lievonen as Deputy Chairman and as member Ms Anja McAlister.
In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board will propose that the annual fees paid for the term remain unchanged and to be as follows: Chairman: EUR 75,000, Deputy Chairman: EUR 57,000, and members: EUR 40,000. The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, if he/she is not simultaneously acting as Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Board: EUR 57,000/year.
Outlook
Key drivers and risks
Fortum's financial results are exposed to a number of economic, strategic, political, financial and operational risks.
One of the key factors influencing Fortum's business performance is the wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic region. The key drivers behind the wholesale price development in the Nordic region are the supply-demand balance, the prices of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances, and the hydrological situation.
The continued uncertainty in the global and European economies has kept the outlook for economic growth unpredictable. The overall economic uncertainty impacts commodity and CO2 emissions allowance prices, and this could maintain downward pressure on the Nordic wholesale price of electricity. In Fortum's Russian business, the key drivers are economic growth, the rouble exchange rate, regulation around the

heat business, and further development of electricity and capacity markets. In all regions, fuel prices and power plant availability also impact profitability. In addition, increased volatility in exchange rates due to financial turbulence could have both translation and transaction effects on Fortum's financials, especially through the Russian rouble and Swedish krona.
In the Nordic countries, the regulatory and fiscal environment for the energy sector has also added risks for utility companies. The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment develops in a way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare for. In response to these uncertainties, Fortum has analysed and assessed a number of future energy market and regulation scenarios including the impact of these on different generation forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum's strategy was renewed in 2016 to include broadening the base of revenues and diversification into new businesses, technologies and markets.
For further details on Fortum's risks and risk management, see the Risk management section of the Operating and financial review and Note 3 Financial risk management.
Nordic market
Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, electricity is expected to continue to gain a higher share of total energy consumption. Electricity demand in the Nordic countries is expected to grow by approximately 0.5% on average, while the growth rate for the next few years will largely be determined by macroeconomic developments in Europe, and especially in the Nordic countries.
During 2016, oil and coal prices increased, while the price of CO2 emission allowances (EUA) declined. The price of electricity for the upcoming twelve months appreciated in the Nordic area as well as in Germany, and both are now on higher levels than at the end of 2015.
In mid-January 2017, the quotation for coal (ICE Rotterdam) for the remainder of 2016 was around USD 74 per tonne and for CO2 emission allowances for 2017 around EUR 5 per tonne. The Nordic system electricity forward price in Nasdaq Commodities for the rest of 2017 was around EUR 26 per MWh and for 2018 around EUR 23 per MWh. In Germany, the electricity forward price for the rest of 2017 was around EUR 34 per MWh and for 2018 around EUR 30 per

MWh. Nordic water reservoirs were about 9 TWh below the longterm average and 19 TWh below the corresponding level in 2016.
Generation
The Generation segment's achieved Nordic power price typically depends on such factors as the hedge ratios, hedge prices, spot prices, availability and utilisation of Fortum's flexible production portfolio, and currency fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects from changes in the power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change in the Generation segment's Nordic power sales achieved price will result in an approximately EUR 45 million change in Fortum's annual comparable operating profit. In addition, the comparable operating profit of the Generation segment will be affected by the possible thermal power generation volumes and its profits.
As a result of the nuclear stress tests in the EU, the Swedish nuclear safety authority (SSM) has decided to propose new regulations for Swedish nuclear reactors. The process is ongoing. Fortum emphasises that maintaining a high level of nuclear safety is the highest priority, but considers EU-level harmonisation of nuclear safety requirements to be of continued importance.
The Swedish Government increased the nuclear waste fund fee from approximately 0.022 to approximately 0.04 SEK/kWh for the 2015­2017 period. The impact on Fortum is approximately EUR 25 million annually. The process to review the Swedish nuclear waste fees is done in a three-year cycle. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co (SKB) will update the new technical plan in early 2017 for SSM to review. The final decision on the new nuclear waste fees will be made by the Swedish Government in December 2017. However, as a result of the decision on early closure of nuclear power plants, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, SSM, recalculated the waste fees for the Oskarshamn and Ringhals power plants.
In September 2016 the Swedish government presented the budget proposal for the coming years; One of the key elements was the proposal that taxation of different energy production forms should be more equal and the tax burden of nuclear and hydro should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The budget states that the nuclear capacity tax will be reduced to 1,500

SEK/MW per month from 1 July 2017 and abolished on 1 January 2018. In 2017, the tax is estimated to decrease by approximately EUR 32 million to EUR 52 million due to the tax decrease and by another EUR 5 million due to the premature closure of Oskarshamn 1 in the middle of the year. In 2018, there is no capacity tax.
A decision was also made to decrease the hydropower realestate tax over a four-year period beginning in 2017, from todays 2.8% to 0.5%. The real-estate tax on hydro will, as stated in the government's budget, be reduced in four steps: in January 2017 to 2.2%; in January 2018 to 1.6%; in January 2019 to 1.0%; and in January 2020 to 0.5%. In 2017, the tax is estimated to decrease by approximately EUR 20 million to approximately EUR 95 million.
In addition to the decrease in the tax rate, the hydropower real-estate tax values, which are linked to electricity prices, will be updated starting in 2019. The real-estate tax values are updated every six years. With the current low electricity prices the tax values in 2019 will be clearly lower than today. The process for renewing existing hydro permits will also be reformed.
The tax reductions will be financed through a higher electricity consumption tax that will mainly affect households. Electricityintensive industries will be exempt.
In October 2016, the Swedish Energy Agency presented a concrete proposal on how to increase the production of renewable electricity by 18 TWh in 2020­2030 within the electricity certificate system, as part of the Energy Agreement. The government is expected to decide on the proposal in late March 2017.
In 2015, OKG AB decided to permanently discontinue electricity production at Oskarshamn unit 1 and to start decommissioning after the permission for service operation has been granted by the relevant Swedish authorities. The date for discontinued production and the start of decommissioning has been set to 30 June 2017. Oskarshamn unit 2, which has been out of operation since June 2013 due to an extensive safety modernisation, will stay out of operation. The closing processes are estimated to take several years.

City Solutions
In May, the Finnish Government decided to increase the tax on heating fuels by EUR 90 million annually from 2017 onwards. The negative impact on Fortum is estimated to be approximately EUR 5 million per year.
Russia
The Russia segment's new capacity generation built after 2007 under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) is a key driver for earnings growth in Russia, as it is expected to bring income from new volumes sold and also to receive considerably higher capacity payments than the old capacity. Fortum will receive guaranteed capacity payments for a period of 10 years from the commissioning of a plant. The received CSA payment will vary depending on the age, location, size and type of the plants, as well as on seasonality and availability. CSA payments can vary somewhat annually because they are linked to Russian Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years' maturity. In addition, the regulator will review the earnings from the electricity-only market three years and six years after the commissioning of a unit and could revise the CSA payments accordingly.
The Competitive Capacity Selection for generation built prior to 2008 (CCS) takes place annually. The long-term CCS for 2017­2019 was held at the end of 2015, and the long-term CCS for 2020 was held in September 2016. The majority of Fortum's plants were selected. The volume of Fortum's installed "old" capacity not selected in the auction totalled 175 MW (out of 2,214 MW), for which Fortum has obtained forced mode status, i.e. it will receive payments for the capacity.
In December 2016, a bill draft containing the main principles of the heat reform, approved by the Russian Government in 2014, passed its first reading in the Russian Parliament. The draft contradicts the Roadmap in some crucial points, e.g. it does not

include the requirement of the price liberalisation across the whole country. Instead it requires the consent of both the regional and the local authorities before starting the reform in certain pilot regions. If implemented, the reform should provide heat market liberalisation in 5 or 10 years, depending on the Governmentimposed criteria.
The targeted operating profit (EBIT) level of RUB 18.2 billion in the Russia segment is expected to be reached during 2017­2018. The segment's profits are impacted by changes in power demand, gas prices and other regulatory developments. Economic sanctions, the currency crisis, oil prices and the inflation have impacted overall demand. As a result, gas prices and electricity prices have not developed favourably as expected. The Russian annual average gas price growth was 3.6% in 2016. Fortum estimates the Russian annual average gas price growth to be 2.0% in 2017.
The euro-denominated result level will be volatile due to the translation effect. The income statements of non-euro subsidiaries are translated into the Group reporting currency using average exchange rates. The Russia segment's result is also impacted by seasonal volatility caused by the nature of the heat business, with the first and last quarter being clearly the strongest.
Capital expenditure and divestments
Fortum currently expects its capital expenditure, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately EUR 800 million in 2017. The annual maintenance capital expenditure is estimated to be below EUR 300 million in 2017, well below the level of depreciation.
Taxation
The effective corporate income tax rate for Fortum in 2017 is estimated to be 19­21%, excluding the impact of the share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures, non-taxable capital gains and non-recurring items.

Hedging
At the end of 2016, approximately 60% of Generation's estimated Nordic power sales volume was hedged at EUR 30 per MWh for the 2017 calendar year and approximately 35% at EUR 26 per MWh for the 2018 calendar year.
The reported hedge ratios may vary significantly, depending on Fortum's actions on the electricity derivatives markets. Hedges are mainly financial contracts, most of them Nasdaq Commodities forwards.

Risk management

Risk management framework and objectives
Fortum's Risk Management framework is comprised of the Group Risk Policy and supporting documents. The Group Risk Policy includes an overview of Fortum's risk management systems consisting of the general principles of risk management and the main features of the risk management process. The objective of the risk management framework and processes is to; · support the development of the Group strategy, · support strategy execution, · support the achievement of agreed targets within acceptable
risk levels so that the Group's ability to meet financial commitments is not compromised, · ensure the understanding of material risks and uncertainties affecting Fortum's earnings, and · ensure understanding and support the prevention of accidents that can have a severe effect on the health and safety of employees or third parties, and from incidents that can have a material impact on Fortum's assets, reputation or the environment.
Risk management organisation
The main principle is that risks are managed at source meaning that each Division, Development Unit and Corporate Function Head is responsible for managing risks that arise within their business operations. However, in order to take advantage of synergies, certain risks are managed centrally. For example, Group Treasury is responsible for managing financial risks and information security risk are managed by Corporate Security. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is responsible for monitoring the efficiency of the company's risk management systems and for annually reviewing the material risks and uncertainties. Corporate Risk Management, a function headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reporting to the CFO, provides instructions and tools which support the Group in running an efficient risk management process.

Management is responsible for assessing and reporting maturity of risk management in Divisions, Development Units and Corporate Functions and for providing independent monitoring and reporting of material risk exposures to Group Management and the Board. Risk control functions and controllers in the business monitor and report risks to the CRO according to instructions and approved models.
Risk management process
Fortum's risk management process is designed to support the achievement of agreed targets by ensuring that risk management activities are consistent with the general principles of risk management and that risks are monitored and followed-up in a prudent manner. The main features of risk management process

consist of event identification, risk assessment, risk response and risk control. Identification is carried out according to a structured process and risks are assessed in terms of impact and likelihood according to a Group-common methodology. Impact is assessed in monetary terms, but also in terms of health and safety, the environment and reputation where applicable. Risk response actions are defined and implemented by the business and operational management and can include to avoid, mitigate, transfer or absorb the risk. Risk control processes, which include monitoring and reporting of risks, are designed to support compliance with approved instructions, manuals and guidelines and to ensure that risk exposures remain within approved limits and mandates.

Investor information

Fortum's Board of Directors annually approves the Group Risk Policy and the CEO annually approves Group Risk Instruction covering commodity market and fuel risks, counterparty credit risks, financial risks and operational risks. There are also other Group policies and instructions covering e.g. sustainability and information security risks which are aligned with the Group Risk Policy. Risk mandates or limits are defined for commodity market and fuel risks, counterparty credit risks and financial risks.
Risk factors
Strategic risks
The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment develops in way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare for. In response to these uncertainties, Fortum has analysed and assessed a number of future energy market and regulation scenarios including the impact of these to different generation forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum's strategy was renewed in 2016 to include broadening the base of revenues and diversification into new businesses, technologies and markets.
Risks which could hinder Fortum in executing this strategy have been identified as part of the strategy development and led to, among other things, the creation of the five must-win battles. Risks include an inability to identify and carry out successful investments and acquisitions with the related project and integration risks, inability to manage and respond to changes in energy policy and the regulatory environment, and inability to manage and respond to changes in technology.

Investment and acquisition risks
Fortum's strategy includes growth of operations, including in new businesses, technologies and geographies, and any future investment or acquisition entails risk, including: · increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources; · the need to understand the value drivers and their uncertainties
in investments or potential acquisition targets; · the need to understand and manage the new markets and
different cultural and compliance requirements; · the need to understand and manage subcontractor risks and
related sustainability and safety issues.

These risks are managed as part of the investment process which is being further developed to improve how we identify and assess opportunities and how we integrate new businesses.
Energy policy and regulation risks
The energy business is subject to energy policies and regulations, and Fortum's strategy has been developed based on scenarios of the future development of the regulatory environment in both existing and potential new businesses and market areas. The overall complexity and possible changes to regulations in the various countries and regions pose a risk if we are not able to identify and manage them efficiently.
Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in the development of laws and regulations in order to manage these risks and proactively participate in the development of the energy policy and regulatory framework.
Nordic/EU Fortum's strategy in the power sector is based on a market-driven development, which would mean more interconnections and competition supported by policy harmonization. Even if the Nordic power market has a long tradition of harmonization, national policies vary considerably when it comes to generation (e.g. taxation, permitting and subsidies) as well as consumption (e.g. unbundling, taxation and market model) indicating that risks are also national. Potential risks within the policy framework include; 1) the electricity market model where the EU is currently
discussing capacity remuneration mechanisms that could change the market model, 2) targets for future climate change mitigation where the specific details of targets for CO2 emissions, renewables and energy efficiency for 2030 are under discussion, 3) renewable energy where the Commission aims at presenting a legislative proposal on sustainability criteria for solid biomass at the end of 2016 and, 4) the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Sweden with potential effects on capacity and costs related to hydro power production.

The inter-linkage of these issues as well as national measures such as taxation create uncertainty and changes in policies in one area could undermine the effects of policy changes in other areas.
As part of the Circular Economy package, the EU waste legislation will set more ambitious recycling targets for waste. This will have a market impact, but possibly also a tax impact, on the amounts of non-recyclable waste that can be used for energy production. The implementation of EU's heating and cooling strategy through energy efficiency and renewable energy directives will likely give policy direction towards better-functioning heat markets and district heating systems. However, heating and cooling, being local businesses, are primarily subject to local legislation and regulations and thereby treated very differently in different countries.
Russia Russia is exposed to political, economic and social uncertainties and risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation, economic and social upheaval and other similar factors. The current economic sanctions may be enlarged and/or extended having direct and indirect impacts on the business environment. The main policy-related risks in Russia are linked to the development of the whole energy sector, part of which, like the wholesale power market, is liberalised while other parts, like gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. The wholesale power market deregulation in Russia has been implemented to a large extent according to original plans. However, regulated sectors are inherently always exposed to a risk of regulatory changes which could affect Fortum's operations.
Technology risks
Fortum's strategy includes developing or acquiring new technologies. Fortum's R&D activities focus on the development of the energy system towards a future solar economy. Fortum is, for example, developing circular economy, bioeconomy and other renewable energy concepts as well as innovative solutions for its customers. New technologies expose Fortum to new types of risks such as risks related to intellectual property rights and viability of

technologies. Technology risks are managed primarily through developing a diversified portfolio of projects consisting of different technologies.
Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development are integral parts of Fortum's strategy. Fortum gives balanced consideration to economic, environmental and social responsibility. Changes to laws, regulations and the business environment can pose a risk if not identified and managed effectively. Same applies to changes of views of our main stakeholders. In order to foresee and manage these risks, Fortum endorses a number of international voluntary charters, standards and guidelines in the area of sustainability, conducts stakeholder surveys annually and has defined internal policies and instructions of how to conduct business. Corporate Sustainability unit assesses sustainability risks related to the Group's operations annually. Risks identified by Corporate Sustainability are assessed by Divisions and mitigation actions are defined.
Environmental, health and safety and social risks
Operating power and heat generation plants involves use, storage and transportation of fuels and materials that can have adverse effects on the environment and expose personnel to safety risks. Assessment of environmental risks and preparedness to operate in exceptional and emergency situations follows the requirements set in ISO 14001 standard. The same approach based on the requirements set in OHSAS 18001 standard applies to risks related to occupational health and safety and actions in emergency situations.
Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social risks related to Fortum's supply chain are evaluated through supplier qualification, internal and external audits and risk assessments. Corrective and preventive actions are implemented when necessary. EHS related risks together with social risks arising in investments are evaluated in accordance with Fortum's Investment Evaluation and Approval Procedure. Environmental

risks and liabilities in relation to past actions have been assessed and provisions have been made for future remedial costs.
Tax risk
Fortum operates in a number of countries and is therefore exposed to changes in taxation and how tax authorities interpret tax laws. Changes in the international fiscal environment have created a tax environment that is leading to new or increased taxes and new interpretations of existing tax laws. This has led to challenges for Fortum and how its operations are taxed as the predictability and visibility around taxes has decreased.
Fortum's tax policy aims to identify simple and cost-efficient solutions to manage taxes in a sustainable manner. Artificial or other aggressive solutions are not used and legality and honesty are seen as a high value together with transparent and open information. Fortum is continuously following the development of tax related issues and their impact on the Group and maintains an active dialogue with tax authorities in unclear cases. Tax-related issues are communicated both internally and externally. Fortum's tax footprint is published annually.
Business ethics and compliance risks
Fortum's operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations set forth by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory bodies in all markets in which Fortum operates. Fortum's ability to operate in certain countries may be affected by future changes to local laws and regulations.
Fortum has an established Code of Conduct to enhance the understanding of the importance of business ethics for all Fortum employees, contractors and partners. The supplier code of conduct sets sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and services.
Fortum systematically identifies, assesses, mitigates and reports compliance risks including risks related to sustainability and business ethics. Internal controls are implemented to minimise the possibilities of unauthorised activities or noncompliance with Group policies and instructions.

Investor information

Financial risks
Market risk
Fortum's business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and availability of commodities used in the production and sales of energy products. The main exposure is toward electricity prices and volumes, prices of emissions and prices and availability of fuels. Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity market risks in accordance with annually approved Hedging Guidelines, Strategies and Mandates. For further information on hedge ratios, exposures, sensitivities and outstanding derivatives contracts, see Note 3 Financial risk management.
Electricity price risks In competitive markets, such as in the Nordic region, the price is determined as the balance between supply and demand. The short-term factors affecting electricity prices and volumes on the Nordic market include hydrological conditions, temperature, CO2 allowance prices, fuel prices, economic development and the import/export situation.
Electricity price risks are hedged by entering into electricity derivatives contracts, primarily on the Nasdaq Commodities power exchange. Hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as electricity and other commodity market prices, the hydrological balance and other relevant parameters change. In Russia, electricity prices and capacity sales are the main sources of market risk. The electricity price is highly correlated with the gas price and prices are fixed through bilateral agreements limiting exposure. In India, the electricity price received from solar production are fixed through long term power-purchasing agreements.
Emission and environmental value risks The European Union has established an emissions trading scheme to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions. In addition to the emissions trading scheme, there are other trading schemes in environmental values in place in Sweden, Norway and Poland. Part of Fortum's power and heat generation is subject to requirements of

these schemes. There is currently no trading scheme in Russia for emissions or other environmental values.
The main factor influencing the prices of CO2 allowances and other environmental values is the supply and demand balance. Fortum hedges its exposure to these prices and volumes through the use of CO2 forwards and environmental certificates.
Fuel price and volume risks Power and heat generation requires use of fuels that are purchased on global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are natural gas, uranium, coal, various biomass-based fuels and waste. The main risk factor for fuels that are traded on global markets such as coal and natural gas, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely affected by demand and supply imbalances that can be caused by, for example, increased demand growth in developing countries, natural disasters or supply constraints in countries experiencing political or social unrest. For fuels traded on local markets, such as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms of availability of the raw material of appropriate quality is more significant as there may be a limited number of suppliers. Due to the sanctions and economic development in Russia, the risks related to imported fuels from Russia have increased.
In the Nordic market, exposure to fuel prices is limited due to Fortum's flexible generation capacity which allows for switching between different fuels according to prevailing market conditions. In some cases, the fuel price risk can be transferred to the customer. The remaining exposure to fuel price risk is mitigated through fixed- price physical delivery contracts or derivative contracts. The main fuel source for heat and power generation in Russia is natural gas. Natural gas prices are partially regulated, so the price risk exposure is limited.
Liquidity and refinancing risks
The power and heat business is capital intensive and Fortum has a regular need to raise financing. Fortum maintains a diversified financing structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt instruments and geographical markets. Fortum manages liquidity

and refinancing risks through a combination of cash positions and committed credit facility agreements with its core banks.
After the Distribution divestments, Fortum has a large cash position. The credit risk of this position has been mitigated by diversifying the deposits to high-credit quality financial institutions and issuers of corporate bonds.
Currency and interest rate risks
Fortum's debt portfolio consists of interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives on a fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing maturity profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt portfolio through use of different types of financing contracts and interest rate derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps.
Fortum's currency exposures are divided into transaction exposures (foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash flows and balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates will have an impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation exposure (foreign exchange exposure that arises when profits and balance sheets in foreign entities are consolidated at the Group level). The main principle is that all material transaction exposures should be hedged while translation exposures are not hedged, or are hedged selectively. The main translation exposures toward the EUR/RUB and EUR/SEK are monitored continuously. When these currencies are weak they affect Fortum's profit level and equity when translating results and net assets to euros.
Counterparty risks
Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a contractual arrangement with an external counterparty including customers, suppliers, partners, banks and trading counterparties.
Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative instruments are often volatile. Although the majority of commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges, derivatives contracts are also entered into directly with external counterparties. Such contracts are limited to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the financial or commodity markets.
Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity, Fortum has counterparty credit exposure to a number of banks

and financial institutions. This includes exposure to the Russian financial sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions as well as to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and contracting parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated to the most creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks. Limits with banks and financial institutions are monitored so that exposures can be adjusted as ratings or the financial situation changes, and Fortum is following the development of economic sanctions against Russia as part of the monitoring process.
Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across a wide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is higher than in the Nordic market.
In order to manage counterparty credit risk, Fortum has routines and processes to identify, assess and control exposure. Credit checks are performed before entering into commercial obligations and exposure limits are set for all larger individual counterparties. Creditworthiness is monitored through the use of internal and external sources so that mitigating actions can be taken when needed. Mitigating actions include demanding collateral, such as guarantees, managing payment terms and contract length, and the use of netting agreements.
Operational risks
Operational risks are defined as the negative effects resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or equipment, or from external events. Process-related risks are assessed and controls for the most relevant risks are defined and implemented as part of the internal controls framework. Equipment and system risks are primarily managed through monitoring and maintenance planning.

Production risks
CHP CHP production involves the use, storage and transportation of fuels. Leakage of fuels and contamination of the surrounding environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party liabilities. An explosion or fire at a production facility could cause damages to the plant or third-parties and lead to possible business interruption. These risks are mitigated by condition monitoring, preventive maintenance and other operational improvements as well as competence development of personnel operating the plants.
Hydro power Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can lead to physical damages, business interruptions, and thirdparty liabilities. A long-term program is in place for improving the surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme flood situations. In Sweden, thirdparty liabilities from dam failures are strictly the plant owner's responsibility. Together with other hydro power producers, Fortum has a shared dam liability insurance program in place that covers Swedish dam failure liabilities up to SEK 10,000 million.
Nuclear power Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority interests in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power companies. At the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and improvement of nuclear safety is a continuous process performed under the supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland (STUK).
Third-party liability relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the plant operator's responsibility and must be covered by insurance. As the operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a statutory

liability insurance policy of 686M SDR (Special Drawing Right) and the same type of insurance policies are in place for the operators where Fortum has a minority interest.
Under the Finnish law, Fortum bears full legal and financial responsibility for the management and disposal of nuclear waste produced by the Loviisa power plant. In both Finland and Sweden, Fortum bears partial responsibility, proportionate to the ownership share, for the costs of the management and disposal of nuclear waste produced by co-owned nuclear power plants. The future costs of the final disposal of spent fuel, the management of low and intermediate-level radioactive waste and nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by state-established funds in Finland and Sweden to which nuclear power plant operators make annual contributions.
Information security and IT risks
Fortum's business operations are dependent on well-functioning IT and information management systems and processes. Due to the nature of the business, large amounts of data are processed, often in real-time, and used for decision-making and in internal and external communication and reporting. Securing information and availability of the systems are essential for Fortum. Information security risks, including cyber security and privacy, are managed centrally by Corporate Security. Group instructions and procedures set requirements for managing and mitigating information risks.
IT functions in the business, support functions and outsourcing partners are responsible for identifying and mitigating operational IT security related risks as well as managing IT security incidents. IT functions are also responsible for IT service continuity.

Authorisations from the Annual General Meeting 2016
In 2016, the Annual General Meeting decided to authorise the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase and disposal of the company's own shares up to a maximum number of 20,000,000 shares, which corresponds to approximately 2.25 per cent of all the shares in the company. The authorisation is effective for a period of 18 months from the resolution of the General Meeting. The authorisation had not been used by the end of 2016.
Dividend policy
The dividend policy ensures that shareholders receive a fair remuneration for their entrusted capital, supported by the company's long-term strategy that aims at increasing earnings per share and thereby the dividend. When proposing the dividend, the Board of Directors looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, balance sheet strength as well as future investment plans. Fortum Corporation's target is to pay a stable, sustainable and over time increasing dividend, in the range of 50­80% of earnings per share, excluding one-off items.

The distributable funds of Fortum Oyj as at 31 December 2016 amounted to EUR 5,203,674,879.03 including the profit of the financial period 2016 of EUR 779,867,542.66. After the end of the financial period there have been no material changes in the financial position of the Company.
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 1.10 per share be paid for 2016.
Based on the number of registered shares as at 1 February 2017 the total amount of dividend proposed to be paid is EUR 977,203,749.50. The Board of Directors proposes that the remaining part of the distributable funds will be retained in shareholders' equity.

Components of Consolidated statement of comprehensive income (OCI) are items of income and expense that are recognized in equity and not recognized in the consolidated income statement. They include unrealized items, such as fair value gains and losses on financial instruments hedging future cash flows. These items will be realized in the Consolidated income statement when the underlying hedged items is recognized. OCI also includes gains and losses on fair valuation on available for sale financial assets, actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans, items on comprehensive income in associated companies and translation differences.
Fair valuation of cash flow hedges mainly relates to electricity prices in future cash flows. When electricity price is higher (lower) than the hedging price, the impact on equity is negative (positive).
Translation differences from translation of foreign entities, mainly RUB and SEK.

Translation differences
Translation of financial information from subsidiaries in foreign currency is done using average rate for the income statement and end rate for the balance sheet. The exchange rate differences occurring from translation to EUR are booked to equity. Translation differences impacted equity attributable to owners of the parent company with EUR 335 million during 2016 (2015: -188). Translation differences are mainly related to RUB and SEK. Part of this translation exposure has been hedged and the foreign currency hedge result, amounting to EUR 5 million (2015: 8), is included in the other OCI items.
For information regarding exchange rates used, see Note 1 Accounting policies. For information about translation exposure see Note 3.6 Interest rate risk and currency risk.

Cash flow hedges
The impact on equity attributable to owners of the parent from fair valuation of cash flow hedges, EUR -188 million (2015: 54), mainly relates to cash flow hedges hedging electricity price for future transactions. When electricity price is lower/higher than the hedging price, the impact on equity is positive/negative.

Realised foreign exchange gains and losses relate mainly to financing of Fortum's Russian and Swedish subsidiaries and the fact that the Group's main external financing currency is EUR. The foreign exchange gains and losses arise from rollover of foreign exchange contracts hedging these internal loans as major part of the forwards are entered into with short maturities i.e. less than twelve months.
Capital expenditures in cash flow do not include not yet paid investments. Capitalised borrowing costs are presented in interest paid.

Fortum is hedging electricity production and retail portfolios mainly with derivatives in Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe. For these transactions Nasdaq requires collaterals. In 2016 Nasdaq moved from bank guarantees to cash collaterals due to EMIR requirements. The cash collaterals are included in the short-term interest-bearing receivables, see Note 22 Interest-bearing receivables.

In the end of 2016 Nasdaq's market making for forwards ended and the trading moved from forwards with cash collaterals to futures with daily cash settlements. In Fortum's cash flow the daily cash settlements for futures are shown as change in working capital whereas the changes in cash collaterals for forwards are in change of interest-bearing receivables. The Nasdaq futures settlements had a negative impact in working capital (Change in interest-free receivables) of EUR 139 million in 2016.

In the commodity derivatives and commercial paper market, there are a number of counterparties not rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's. For these counterparties, Fortum assigns an internal rating. The internal rating is based on external credit ratings from other credit agencies. The rating from Soliditet is used for Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish counterparties and for other counterparties the rating from Dun & Bradstreet is used. Governments and municipal companies are typically not rated, and are shown separately. This rating category does not include companies owned by governments or municipalities.

the FEM that have defined contribution arrangements, the maximum pension premium percentage can be 25% of the salary. Members, who have joined Fortum prior 1 January 2009, are participating in defined benefit pension arrangements, where the benefit is 60­66% of the final pensionable salary with the pension provided by an insurance company or Fortum's Pension Fund.
A pension liability of EUR 2,070 thousand (2015: 2,444) related to the defined benefit plans for FEM members has been recognised in the balance sheet. The additional pension arrangement for the President and CEO is a defined contribution pension plan and thus no liability has been recognised in the balance sheet.
In the event that Fortum decides to give notice of termination to the President and CEO, he is entitled to the salary for the notice period (6 months) and a severance pay equal to 12 months' salary. Other FEM members' termination compensation is equal to 6 to 12 months' salary.

Effective income tax rate and total tax rate are impacted by gains or losses on sale of shares. In

37

many countries like in Finland, Sweden and Netherlands income on capital gains and losses is treated

38

as tax exempt. The purpose of this is to tax the operative income of the company and avoid taxing the

same income twice in case of the sale of the shares. Taxation of capital gains or losses is in line with the

40

taxation of dividend income.

Fortum has a material deferred tax liability owing to its investments in non-current assets. These

assets are depreciated more rapidly for tax than for accounting purposes resulting in lower current

profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends

14

on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the classification

15

of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.

16

17

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS

18

A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of

19

selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are

20

designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either

21

22 held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the closing date.

profit or loss' category is included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances.
The Group assesses at each closing date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss ­ measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss ­ is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities. The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements. Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39. All other net-settled commodity contracts are measured at fair value with gains and losses taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); 2) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or 3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Derivatives are divided into non-current and current based on maturity. Only for those electricity derivatives, which have cash flows in different years, the fair values are split between non-current and current assets or liabilities.

4

CASH FLOW HEDGE

5

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify

6

as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is

7

recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in

8

the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance

9

when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that

10

is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory) or a liability,

11

the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in

12

the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedge no longer meets the

13

criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity is recognised in the

14

income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately also recognised in the income

15

statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain

16

or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised in the income statement.

17

18

FAIR VALUE HEDGE

19

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded

20

21 in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that

22

are attributable to the hedged risk. 23

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount 24

of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss for the

25

period to maturity.

26

27

NET INVEST MENT HEDGING IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

28

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain

29

or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity;

30

the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

31

Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation

32

is disposed off.

34

DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING

35

Certain derivative instruments hedging future cash flows do not qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value

36

changes of these financial derivative instruments are recognised in items affecting comparability in the

income statement.

approximate their fair values.

16

17

FAIR VALUES UNDER LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY

18

The fair value of financial instruments including electricity derivatives traded in active markets (such as

19

publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices

20

21 at the closing date. Known calculation techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used
22 to determine fair value of interest rate and currency financial instruments. The fair value of interest-rate
23 swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward
24

foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the closing date. Fair

25

values of options are determined by using option valuation models. The fair value of financial liabilities

26

is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that

27

is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. In fair valuation, credit spread has not been

28

adjusted, as quoted market prices of the instruments used are believed to be consistent with the objective

29

of a fair value measurement.

30

The Group bases the calculation on existing market conditions at each closing date. Financial

31

instruments used in Fortum are standardised products that are either cleared via exchanges or widely

32

traded in the market. Commodity derivatives are generally cleared through exchanges such as for

33

example NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and financial derivatives done with creditworthy financial

34

institutions with investment grade ratings.

18 Intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at the historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are amortised on a straight-line method over their expected useful lives.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred when bringing the software into use. Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to five years).
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES Trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, as applicable. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and licences over their estimated useful lives (15­20 years).
CONTRACTUAL CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value on acquisition date. The contractual customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at costs less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected duration of the customer relationship.
GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and tested yearly for impairment. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

the Group already holds allowances to cover emission costs, the provision is measured at the carrying

13

amount of those allowances. Any shortfall of allowances held over the obligation is valued at the current

14

market value of allowances. The emission cost is recognised in the income statement within materials and

15

services. The sales gains and losses of emission allowances not used for covering the obligation from CO2

16

emissions, are reported in other income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

19

ASSIGNED VALUES AND USEFUL LIVES IN ACQUISITIONS

20

21 In an acquisition acquired intangible and tangible assets are fair valued and their remaining useful lives

22 are determined. Management believes that the assigned values and useful lives, as well as the underlying
23

assumptions, are reasonable. Different assumptions and assigned lives could have a significant impact on 24

the reported amounts.

25

The Group has significant carrying values in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and

26

participations in associated companies and joint ventures which are tested for impairment according to

27

the accounting policy described in Note 19 Property, plant and equipment.

1) 2015 includes depreciations related to discontinued operations (see Note 14 Discontinued operations).

The increase of goodwill arises from the acquisition of Ekokem Corporation and Grupa Duon S.A. in City Solutions segment during 2016. Total goodwill also includes the goodwill from the acquisition of OAO Fortum in the Russia segment. The goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing recoverable amounts of the net operating assets, including goodwill, with their carrying amounts. The recoverable amounts were determined on the basis of value in use, applying discounted cash flow calculations.
See Note 40 Acquisitions and disposals for additional information on the acquisition of Ekokem Corporation and Grupa Duon S.A.
See also Note 19 Property, plant and equipment for information about impairment testing. The main items in other intangible assets are customer contracts, costs for software products and software licenses, bought emission rights and emission rights received free of charge, which are recognised to the lower of fair value and historical cost.

buildings, transmission lines, tunnels, waterfall rights, district heating network and buildings and

10

machinery as well as landfill sites and treatment areas used in waste treatment operations. Property,

11

plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated

12

impairment losses as applicable in the consolidated balance sheet. Historical cost includes expenditure

13

that is directly attributable to the acquisition of an item and capitalized borrowing costs. Cost may also

14

include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency

15

purchases of property, plant and equipment. Acquired assets on the acquisition of a new subsidiary are

16

stated at their fair values at the date of acquisition.

17

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as

18

appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to

19

the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenses

20

21

are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

22

Additionally the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the estimated cost of its

23

dismantlement, removal or restoration.

24

25

Nuclear related assets and liabilities, for information about provisions for decommissioning nuclear power

27

Land, water areas, waterfall rights and tunnels are not depreciated since they have indefinite useful

28

lives. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to

29

their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Hydro power plant buildings, structures and machinery Thermal power plant buildings, structures and machinery Nuclear power plant buildings, structures and machinery CHP power plant buildings, structures and machinery Substation buildings, structures and machinery Distribution network (related to discontinued operations) District heating network Other buildings and structures Other tangible assets Other machinery and equipment Other non-current investments

The cash flows used in determining the value in use for each cash generating unit are based on the most recent long-term forecasts and are determined in local currency. The period covered by cash flows is related to the useful lives of the assets being reviewed for impairment. The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flow projections until the end of assets' useful lives is in line with the assumed inflation. In Russia the generation capacity built after 2007 under the Russian Government's Capacity Supply Agreements receives guaranteed capacity payments for a period of 10 years.
The discount rate takes into account the risk profile of the country in which the cash flows are generated. There have not been any major changes in the discount rate components or in the methods used to determine them. The long-term pre-tax discount rate used for Russia was 11.1% (2015: 11.1%).
The net operating assets of OAO Fortum, including fair value adjustments and goodwill arising from the acquisition of the company are tested yearly for possible impairment. As of 31 December 2016, the recoverable values were greater than their carrying values and therefore no impairments were booked.
The Group has considered the sensitivity of key assumptions as part of the impairment testing. When doing this any consequential effect of the change on the other variables has also been considered. The calculations are most sensitive to changes in estimated future EBITDA levels and changes in discount rate.
Management estimates that a reasonably possible change in the discount rate used or in future earnings would not cause Russian cash generating unit's carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
Based on the sensitivity analysis done, if the estimated future EBITDA were 10% lower than management's estimates or pre-tax discount rate applied was 10% higher than the one used, the Group would not need to recognise impairment losses for property plant and equipment or goodwill.

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, they are stated at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest cost over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method. Borrowings or portion of borrowings being hedged with a fair value hedge are recognised at fair value.

as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using interest rates of high-quality corporate

bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. In countries

22

where there is no deep market in such bonds, market yields on government bonds are used instead. The

plan assets for pensions are valued at market value. The liability recognised in the balance sheet is the

recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

Finland - The discount rate which is used to calculate the defined benefit obligation (according to IFRS) depends on the value of corporate bond yields as at reporting date. A decrease in yields increases the benefit obligation that is offset by increase in the value of fixed income holdings.
Sweden - The discount rate which is used to calculate the defined benefit obligation (according to IFRS) is derived from market rates on Swedish covered bonds with an equivalent duration to the pension obligation, and the company therefore has a risk in the development of the bond market.

41.3 Associated companies and joint ventures
In the ordinary course of business Fortum engages in transactions on commercial terms with associated companies and other related parties, which are on same terms as they would be for third parties, except for some associates as discussed later in this note.
Fortum owns shareholdings in associated companies and joint ventures which in turn own hydro and nuclear power plants. Under the consortium agreements, each owner is entitled to electricity in proportion to its share of ownership or other agreements. Each owner is liable for an equivalent portion of costs regardless of output. These associated companies are not profit making, since the owners purchase electricity at production cost including interest costs and production taxes.
For further information on transactions and balances with associated companies and joint ventures, see Note 20 Participations in associated companies and joint ventures.

Segment key figures

Following the acquisition of the Russian company, OAO Fortum, Fortum changed its segment reporting during 2008. Comparison numbers were restated in 2008. Fortum renewed its business structure as of 1 March 2014. The reorganisation lead to a change in Fortum's external financial reporting structure as previously separately reported segments Heat and Electricity
Sales were combined into one segment: Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions. Fortum has applied new IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements from 1 January 2014. The effect of applying the new standards to Fortum Group financial information relates
to AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholm Stad (Fortum Värme), that is treated as a joint venture and thus consolidated with equity method from 1 January 2014 onwards. Before the change the company was consolidated as a subsidiary with 50% minority interest.
Information for 2013 has been restated to reflect both the change in business structure and adoption of new IFRS standards. Fortum announced the sale of Swedish Distribution business in March 2015. After the divestment of the Swedish Distribution business Fortum does not have any distribution operations and therefore Distribution segment has been treated as discontinued operations starting from 2015 with restatement of year 2014, according to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued operations. Fortum has reorganised its operating structure as of 1 April 2016. The segments are: Generation (mainly the former Power and Technology); City Solutions (mainly the former Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions) and Russia. Because of the minor financial impact, the comparable segment information for 2015 has not been restated.

Notes to the parent company financial statements, FAS

1 Accounting policies and principles
The financial statements of Fortum Oyj are prepared in accordance with Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS).

Change in the accounting principles of financial derivatives and interestbearing liabilities at fair value in the 2016 financial statements
A new requirement issued by Finnish Accounting Board (KILA 1963/2016) relating to accounting for financial derivatives was published 13 December 2016. The requirements have to be applied in 2016 separate financial statements. Based on this requirement Fortum has chosen to apply IFRS principles for accounting financial derivatives in Fortum Oyj.
Applying IFRS principles means that financial derivatives are fair valued at each balance sheet date, which may create volatility in income statement and equity. The changes due to the new requirement had a minor effect to net profit and equity of Fortum Oyj in 2015 and 2016.
For year 2015 adopted balance sheet and restated balance sheet including the impact from new accounting principles have been presented. Income statement and notes for 2015 are not restated. New notes for financial derivatives have been disclosed for year 2016. Additional information regarding financial instruments for 2015 can be found in Note 3, Note 16 and Note 17 in the Consolidated financial statements.

1.6 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation

Buildings and structures Machinery and equipment Other intangible assets

15­40 years 3­15 years 5­10 years

1.7 Pension expenses
Statutory pension obligations are covered through a compulsory pension insurance policy or Group's own pension fund. Costs for pension fund are recorded in the income statement based on contributions paid pursuant to the Finnish pension laws and regulations.

1.8 Long-term incentive schemes
Costs related to the Fortum long-term incentive plans are accrued over the vesting period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.

1.9 Provisions
Foreseeable future expenses and losses that have no corresponding revenue to which Fortum is committed or obliged to settle, and whose monetary value can be reasonably assessed, are entered as expenses in the income statement and included as provisions in the balance sheet.

Fortum received an income tax assessment in Finland for 2007 in December 2013. Tax authorities claimed in the transfer pricing audit that detailed business decisions were done by Fortum Oyj and therefore re-characterized the equity Fortum has injected to its Belgium subsidiary Fortum Project Finance NV not to be equity, but funds to be available for the subsidiary. Tax authorities' view was that the interest income that Fortum Project Finance NV received from its loans should be taxed in Finland, not Belgium. The tax authorities claimed an additional tax of approximately EUR 136 million for the year 2007. Fortum considered the claims unjustifiable both for legal grounds and interpretation. Fortum appealed the decision.
The Board of Adjustment of the Large Taxpayers' Office approved Fortum's appeal for the year 2007 on 21 August 2014. The Board of Adjustment's decision is in line with the principle adopted in the Supreme Administrative Court's precedent in June 2014, according to which, under transfer pricing rules, the nature of business cannot be re-characterized for tax purposes, but can only adjust the pricing of goods

or services. Despite the new precedent, the Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit within the tax authorities appealed this decision to the Administrative Court in Helsinki. In May 2016 the Administrative Court announced its decision in the case. The court ruled in Fortum's favour and rejected the appeal of the Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit. The Tax Recipient's Legal Service Unit appealed the Administrative Court's decision to the Supreme Administrative Court in July 2016.
In November 2016 the Supreme Administrative Court decided not to grant a permit to appeal. Thus the decision favourable to Fortum of the Board of Adjustment of the Large Taxpayer's office from August 2014, remains in force and is final. No additional tax is to be paid for the year 2007 based on the abovementioned audit.
In December 2014 Fortum Oyj received a non-taxation decision from the large Taxpayers' office for the years 2008­2011 regarding the activities in the Belgian and Dutch financing companies. The decision was given due to the transfer pricing audit carried out in 2013­2014 and was in line with the Board of Adjustment's decision with respect to Fortum for the year 2007. The Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit has appealed the decisions in February 2015 to the Board of Adjustment of the Large Taxpayers' office. According to the claim of correction an additional tax of approximately EUR 406 million for the years 2008­2011 was claimed. In December 2016 the Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit cancelled its appeals for the years 2008­2011. In January 2017 the Board of Adjustment of the Large Taxpayers' office declared the cases for 2008­2011 annulled. Thus the non-taxation decision from August 2014 from the large Taxpayers' office remains in force for the years 2008­2011. No additional tax is to be paid for the years 2008­2011 based on the above-mentioned audit.

Auditor's report

To the Annual General Meeting of Fortum Oyj
Report on the Audit of Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Forum Oyj (business identity code 1463611-4) for the year ended 31 December, 2016. The financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as well as the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements.
In our opinion · the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's financial performance
and financial position in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and · the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter
Valuation of fixed assets and goodwill
Refer to Notes 2, 18 and 19.
· The consolidated balance sheet includes property, plant and equipment amounting to EUR 9 930 million and goodwill amounting to EUR 353 million.
· The main assumptions used in the valuation of energy production property, plant and equipment and goodwill relate to the estimated future operating cash flows and the discount rates.
· In acquisition the assumptions relates to determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.
· The potential indicators for impairment are among other things changes in electricity and fuel prices, regulatory/political changes relating to energy taxes and price regulations.
· The assumptions used in the valuation of the balances in question require management judgment.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have evaluated the process how management has assessed the indicators for potential impairment. We have performed audit procedures on impairment models relating to material cash generating units.
· We obtained entity's impairment testing documentation for goodwill and energy production assets when tested and evaluated the rationale of key assumptions applied by management, including commodity price forecasts, profit and cash flow forecasts, terminal values, foreign exchange rates and the selection of discount rates.
· We have compared, that the forecasts used in the impairment testing calculations are based on long term forecast approved by management.
· We challenged management's assumptions and judgments with reference to historical data and, where applicable, external benchmarks.
· We assessed the models used in the impairment testing and carried out our testing for the sensitivity calculations.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Associated companies and joint ventures
Refer to Notes 2, 20 and 38.
· Fortum participates in a number of associated companies and joint ventures with a total carrying amount of EUR 2,112 million in the consolidated financial statements.
· The assessment of the recoverable value of the associated companies and joint ventures incorporates significant management judgments and estimates.
· The associated companies and joint ventures are joint contractual arrangements, which include several complex accounting, regulatory and legal aspects as described in note 38. These aspects may have significant impact on Fortum's financial reporting.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have reviewed and evaluated the management's process to monitor and control the significant associated companies and joint ventures as well as to follow the related legal cases.
· We have assessed and challenged the management judgment and assumptions used determining the recoverable amount for associated companies and joint ventures. We have also evaluated the accuracy of the calculations prepared to quantify the recoverable amount.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Fair value measurement of derivatives and hedge accounting
Refer to Notes 3, 6, 8, 16 and 17.
· In Fortum's 2016 consolidated financial statements total derivative assets amounts to EUR 545 million and total derivative liabilities amounts to EUR 658 million. The net effect of changes in fair values of derivatives hedging future cash flow amounts to EUR -65 million in items affecting comparability in the consolidated income statement and the cash flow hedges in other equity components amount to EUR -115 million.
· The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined through the application of valuation techniques which often involve management judgment. Fortum's business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and availability of commodities used in the production and sales of energy products. The main exposure is toward energy prices and volumes. Electricity price risk is hedged by entering into electricity derivative contracts. Fortum uses hedging instruments to reduce the effect of electricity price volatility.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· Our audit procedures included an assessment of internal controls over the hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing, measurement of fair value measures, and evaluating the methodologies, inputs, judgments made and assumptions used by management in determining fair values.
· For Fortum's fair valuation models, we evaluated rationale of the models and accounting treatment applied. We compared observable inputs against independent sources and externally available market data.
· We have assessed the existence and completeness of outstanding derivative contracts as of 31 December 2016 by requesting confirmations from the counterparties.
· We have assessed that financial instruments included in hedge relationships are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
· We have assessed the adequacy of the presentation for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting applied in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Nuclear related assets and liabilities
Refer to Note 30.
· Nuclear related assets and liabilities in consolidated balance sheet amount to EUR 830 million.
· Fortum's nuclear related provisions and the related part of the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund are both presented separately as disclosed in note 30.
· Fortum's share in the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund is accounted for according to IFRIC 5 which states that the fund assets are measured at the lower of fair value or the value of the related liabilities.
· Due to complexity and materiality, the accounting treatment for nuclear decommissioning is complex and requires application of special accounting practice and management judgment when forming estimates for the basis of accounting such as technical plans, timing, cost estimates and discount rate.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have assessed Fortum's accounting manual and principles for Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting, whether they are in line with IFRS accounting principles.
· We have assessed the assumptions and judgments made and adopted by the management in the accounting for the nuclear waste provisions and share in state nuclear waste management fund have been based on current legislation and decisions set by Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Income taxes
Refer to Note 29 and 38.
· Fortum has several tax assessments ongoing.
· The accounting treatment and disclosing of tax cases require management to make judgments and estimates in disclosing and accounting tax contingencies and receivables as described in note 29.
· Ongoing tax assessments are lengthy and at various stages from preliminary discussions with tax authorities through to court proceedings, where obtaining the final tax assessments can take a number of years prior to concluding.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We performed testing regarding Fortum's tax positions in the significant tax jurisdictions in which Fortum operates.
· We assessed the rationale of management's assumptions and challenged the management judgment applied in relation to disclosing and accounting the tax contingencies and receivables of the tax cases. Together with our tax specialist we have also assessed the company's external opinions which have been used to support the management's assumptions.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO for the financial statements
The Board of Directors and the President and CEO are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the President and CEO are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the President and CEO are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities in the audit of financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.

· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the President and CEO use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to Operating and Financial Review, our responsibility also includes considering whether the Operating and Financial Review has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
In our opinion, the information in the Operating and Financial Review is consistent with the information in the financial statements and the Operating and Financial Review has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in of the information included in the Operating and Financial Review, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Other opinions
We support that the financial statements should be adopted. The proposal by the Board of Directors regarding the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet is in compliance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. We support that the Board of Directors of the parent company and the President and CEO should be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.

Corporate Governance Statement 2016
Fortum Corporation (FORTUM) has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki since 18 December 1998. Fortum's industrial sector, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland is the majority owner in Fortum with 50.76% of the shares as of 31 December 2016.
Corporate governance at Fortum is based on Finnish laws and the company's Articles of Association. Fortum complies fully with and has prepared this corporate governance statement in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2015. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors.
Fortum prepares consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act as well as the appropriate Financial Supervision Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki's rules.

Governing bodies of Fortum
The decision-making bodies managing and overseeing the Group's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its two Committees, the

Audit and Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Executive Management.
Fortum also has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims to advance Fortum's businesses by facilitating a dialogue and exchange of views between Fortum and its stakeholders. During 2016, the Advisory Council consisted of 14 representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups and three employee representatives.
As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy, the highest decision making of these issues falls on the duties of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility on sustainability matters. Therefore Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for decision making on economic,

Each share is entitled to one vote. A shareholder who is present at the General Meeting of Shareholders also has the right to request information on matters to be considered at the meeting. Before the end of each financial year Fortum states on the Annual General Meeting website and in the Investor Relations calendar the date by which a shareholder must declare his/her proposals to the General Meeting.
Decisions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such decisions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividends, discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, appointment of the Board of Directors and the external auditors, and deciding on their remuneration.
In accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no more than three months and no less than three weeks before the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the company's website or in two newspapers chosen by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is to be held once a year, in June at the latest.

The main features of the Internal Control and Risk Management Systems
The internal control and risk management systems relating to financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and aim to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Risk management systems
Fortum's Board of Directors approves the Group Risk Policy that defines the objective, main principles and division of responsibilities for risk management. The Group Risk Policy also includes a description of the main features of the risk management process which is applicable to all processes including financial reporting.
Internal controls in relation to financial reporting
Fortum's internal control framework includes the main elements from the framework introduced by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The controls for processes, including financial reporting controls, have been defined based on the main risks in the process.

Control environment
The standards, processes and structures in internal control are set through Group policies, Group instructions and the Fortum internal control framework. Fortum's internal control framework is designed to support regulatory compliance and reliability of the financial reporting. In the internal control framework, the key controls and minimum requirements for the controls in key processes are defined. Corporate Accounting and Control is responsible for the overall control structure of the financial reporting process. The control process is based on instructions and guidelines relating to financial reporting defined in the Fortum Controllers' manual which is reviewed and updated regularly.

Fortum's organisation is decentralised, and a substantial degree of authority and responsibility is delegated to the divisions in the form of control responsibilities. Fortum's control governance follows the so-called "Three lines of defense" as illustrated in the graphic.
Risk assessment
Risks are continuously identified and analysed as part of the risk management process. Material risks and uncertainties, that might, if realised, have financial impact or lead to non-compliance are reported at least annually, and the follow-up of actions and improvements are integrated in operational management. The risk assessment in the

Internal Controls Quality Programme and continuous improvement identify the needs for changes in the internal controls.
Control activities
Control activities are applied in the processes and, from the financial reporting perspective, they ensure that errors or deviations are prevented or detected and corrected.
The Corporate Accounting and Control unit determines the control requirements, the scope and the design of the control points covering the financial reporting process. Divisions and units define their controls based on these common requirements. Responsibilities are assigned for performing the controls and also for ensuring that the control coverage is in accordance with the defined requirements and scope.
Control requirements for the financial reporting process include controls regarding the initiation, recognition, measurement, approval, accounting and reporting of financial transactions as well as disclosure of financial information. The general IT controls support the completeness of financial reporting controls in areas like access and back-up management.
Responsibilities are assigned to finance functions and business controllers ensuring that analyses of the business performance, including analyses on volumes, revenues, costs, working capital, and asset values are performed in accordance with the control requirements.
Information and communication
The Controllers' manual includes the Fortum Accounting manual, Investment manual and reporting instructions, and other instructions relating to financial reporting. Regular core controllers' meetings, headed by the Corporate Controller, steer the Group's development projects within the Finance function. The regular Accounting Network Forum meetings are to inform about upcoming changes in IFRS, new accounting policies and other changes in reporting requirements.

Monitoring and follow-up
Financial performance and the key short-term risks and uncertainties related to business operations are reported monthly to the Fortum Executive Management.
As part of the Fortum internal control framework, divisions and units regularly assess the maturity of the controls they are responsible for including the financial reporting process controls. The Head of Internal Controls reports the results of the maturity assessments and improvement actions to the management and to the Audit and Risk Committee. Internal control design and operating effectiveness are also assessed as part of the audits by Corporate Internal Audit. Audit results, including corrective actions and status, are regularly reported to the management and to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Auditing
Internal Audit Fortum's Internal Audit is responsible for assessing and assuring the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls in the Group. Furthermore, it evaluates the effectiveness and adequacy of the business processes and risk management as well as compliance with laws, regulations and internal instructions and guidelines. The Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Audit form the basis for the work of Internal Audit.
External Audit The company and the Group has one external auditor, which shall be an audit firm certified by the Central Chamber of Commerce. The external auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting for a term of office that expires at the end of the first Annual General Meeting following the election.

Code of Conduct and Total Compliance Programme
Fortum's Code of Conduct is based on the shared corporate values of accountability, creativity, respect and honesty, which form the ethical basis for all work at Fortum. Fortum's updated Code of Conduct was implemented in the fall of 2015 (originally launched in 2007) and is published in ten languages. The Code of Conduct has been approved by the Board of Directors. Fortum employees are responsible for reporting any suspected misconduct to their own supervisors, to other management members or, if necessary, directly to Internal Audit. Additionally, Fortum employees and partners can report suspicions of misconduct can be reported confidentially to the Fortum Head of Internal Audit via the "raise-a-concern channel" on Fortum's internal and external web pages. The report can be submitted in several languages and anonymously if necessary. In Russia, Fortum even has a separate compliance organisation with compliance officers in place.
Prevention of corruption is one of the Code of Conduct's focus areas. Fortum has procedures for anti-corruption including prevention, oversight, reporting and enforcement based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. Fortum also has a country and partner risk evaluation process to support the understanding and management of compliance needs at the local business and partner level. These also cover export control and anti-money laundering aspects.
During 2016, Fortum has launched a Total Compliance programme which covers key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics. It is managed with risk-based prioritisation. Internal Controls are integral part of the Total Compliance and both the Group Compliance Officer and the Head of Internal Controls report to the General Counsel independently of the business.
The Code of Conduct and compliance topics and instructions are communicated through internal and external communication

channels. Alignment is enforced by top management with their full commitment.
Insider Administration
Fortum complies with the EU regulation No. 596/2014 on market abuse (MAR) and EU regulation No. 1227/2011 on wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and related regulation. Fortum complies also with the Guidelines for Insiders issued by Nasdaq Helsinki.

Remuneration 2016

Remuneration Statement 2016

Dear Shareholders,
2016 was an intensive year for Fortum. In the beginning of the year, we redefined the company's strategy, which continues to focus on clean and efficient power generation, while securing a fair remuneration to our shareholders. Fortum also changed the organisational structure to enable the successful implementation of the new strategy and to utilise the possibilities the changing market environment presents.
The whole energy industry is in an exciting development phase. We are positioning Fortum to be successful also in the future. To achieve that, we are investing in businesses and competencies that are needed in the future. The financial headroom created by the sale of the distribution business in 2014­2015, puts Fortum in a unique position to participate in the European consolidation and restructuring development. The redeployment of funds is guided by our strategy with the aim to maximise cash flow while at the same time safeguarding our long-term competitiveness and profitability. Fair remuneration of all employees is an essential part of securing our future success. We want to ensure that we have the right people with the right skills in the right places, that our employees are committed and performing on a high level and that excellent performance is acknowledged and rewarded.
Our approach is to encourage and reward high performance delivered in line with the strategy, culture and values of our organization. We encourage sustainable long-term performance. With our reward and incentive programmes we seek to attract and retain employees of the highest calibre and to support creation of shareholder value.
Remuneration for the members of the Fortum Executive Management is determined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and subject to approval by the Board of Directors. Remuneration for the Board of Directors is proposed by the

Shareholder's Nomination Board and approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Over the year our management and employees have worked hard on delivering the business strategy. The year was challenging for the whole industry due to the low market prices. Fortum's results were further burdened by low hydro production volumes due to low precipitation. However, the financial targets in the short-term incentive (STI) plan were reached since our performance under the prevailing market conditions was good.
Due to satisfactory performance during the earnings period 2013­2015 the 2013­2018 long-term incentive (LTI) plan exceeded the minimum performance criteria and vested at 42%. This resulted in approximately 260,000 shares being awarded to eligible participants in 2016. The performance for the earnings period 2014­2016 was lower but exceeded the minimum performance criteria and the 2014­2019 LTI plan vested at 27%.
During 2016, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviewed the structure of LTI arrangement for key employees and executives to ensure that it meets the guidance set out in the latest Government Resolution on State-Ownership Policy, European best practices and that it continues to support the business strategy. As a result of this review an amended LTI programme was approved by the Board of Directors in December. In this programme the approach to performance measures, the release of shares and the share ownership requirement for the Fortum Executive Management have been updated. These changes will take effect from the 2017­2019 LTI plan.
We have also made some changes to the presentation of the Remuneration Statement to improve transparency and usability. The Statement is presented in three parts: (i) our approach to the governance of remuneration at Fortum; (ii) the remuneration policy which sets our remuneration principles and a summary of the remuneration framework for Fortum Executive Management

and (iii) the annual report on remuneration, which sets out how the Board of Directors and Fortum Executive Management were remunerated in the year under review. The Remuneration Statement has been prepared in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code and we welcome any feedback that you have and will continue to develop our reporting procedures further.
Sari Baldauf Chairman of the Board of Directors Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Governance

The Shareholders' Nomination Board, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), the Board of Directors and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee are all involved in the preparations and decision-making regarding remuneration at Fortum.
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Principles
At Fortum, we strive for a performance-focused culture where our people understand: · the company, its strategy and performance targets, · how they as individuals can impact the results, · the link between business performance and remuneration, and · the importance of delivering sustainable business results.

This philosophy underpins our remuneration principles which are designed to encourage and recognise high performance and behaviour in line with Fortum's values.
Terms of employment for President and CEO Pekka Lundmark
The notice period for both parties is six months. If the company terminates the contract, the President and CEO is entitled to the salary for the notice period and a severance pay equal to 12 months' salary. If the President and CEO's contract is terminated before retirement age, he is also entitled to retain the funds that have accrued in the pension fund.
The current salary of the President and CEO Pekka Lundmark is EUR 80,000/month including free car allowance and phone allowance as fringe benefits.

Remuneration Key Principles

Effective performance leadership

We motivate our people by setting challenging targets. We encourage initiative taking, active leadership of own and team performance as well as collaboration to enable desired behaviour and achieve business success. We emphasise setting and cascading clear targets aligned with Fortum's strategy as an essential part of good leadership on all levels. We emphasise cross-unit and cross-function collaboration in reaching our business objectives, also reflected in target setting. Rewarding is tightly linked to the overall performance leadership in Fortum.

Performance driven remuneration

We reward concrete achievements in implementing Fortum's strategy and achieving business targets and desired change. We differentiate performance and pay for real achievement. Both low and high performance have consequences.

Competitive remuneration Effective communication Integrity and compliance

We take into consideration relevant market and industry practices as well as different business models and their needs when defining the level and nature of compensation and benefits, aiming to be an attractive employer for the relevant persons with needed skills and competences.
To gain full advantage of the compensation and benefits programs, we emphasize clear, transparent and regular communication about the company's as well as the individual's performance, in particular clarifying the link between performance and variable compensation. We invest in developing managers' knowledge of performance and reward practices and programmes.
We run our performance and reward processes and programmes with high integrity and follow local legislation in each country where we operate. We follow the Corporate Governance Code for Finnish listed companies as well as the guidelines regarding remuneration for the management of state-owned companies. We don't accept any kind of compliance breach.

The awards for the members of the Fortum Executive Management are based on the achievement of divisional targets, Group financial performance as well as individual targets. The performance criteria used are agreed upon in a performance

discussion held at the beginning of the year. The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the President and CEO and the members of the Fortum Executive Management on a regular basis.
Awards for other employees are based on a combination of Group, divisional, functional and personal targets. The targets are set in annual performance discussions held at the beginning of the year.
Awards under the STI programme are paid solely in cash.
Long-term incentives (LTI)
The purpose of Fortum's long-term incentive programme is to support the delivery of sustainable, long-term performance, align the interests of management with those of shareholders and assist in committing and retaining key individuals.

Fortum's LTI programme provides participants with the opportunity to earn company shares. Subject to the decision of the Board of Directors, a new LTI plan commences annually.
The Board of Directors approves the Fortum management members and key individuals entitled to participate in each annually commencing LTI plan. Participation in the LTI plan precludes the individual from being a member in the Fortum Personnel Fund.
Each LTI plan begins with a three year earnings period, during which participants may earn share rights if the performance criteria set by the Board of Directors are fulfilled.
If the minimum performance criteria are not exceeded, no shares will be awarded. If performance is exceptionally good and the targets approved by the Board of Directors are achieved, the combined gross value of all variable compensation cannot exceed 120% of the person's annual salary in any calendar year.
After the earnings period has ended and the relevant taxes and other employment-related expenses have been deducted, participants are paid the net balance in the form of shares.
For LTI plans commencing in 2013 onwards, any shares awarded to Fortum Executive Management members are subject to a three-year lock-up period in accordance with the State-Ownership Guidelines in force at the time the LTI plan was introduced. Subject to a decision by the Board of Directors, the lock-up period can be reduced to one year for those Fortum Executive Management members whose aggregate ownership of Fortum shares is greater than or equal to their annual salary. For other participants (i.e. below the Fortum Executive Management), the lock-up period is one year. For LTI plans commencing prior to 2013, the lock-up period is three years for all LTI plan participants.
If the value of the shares decreases or increases during the lock-up or retention period, the participant will carry the potential loss or gain.
To reflect the recent changes in the State-Ownership Guidelines, for LTI plans commencing in 2017 and beyond, no lock-up period will be applied for any participants. However, Fortum Executive Management members whose aggregate ownership of Fortum shares does not yet fulfil the shareholding requirement are required to retain at least 50% of the shares received until the required level of shareholding is met.

Remuneration that has been paid out without grounds shall be reclaimed in accordance with the regulations on returning an unjust enrichment and remuneration. A payment which has been influenced by the recipient's unethical conduct, may be recovered based on the terms of the LTI Programme.
Aon Hewitt and PCA Corporate Finance acted as advisers for the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in planning the amended LTI programme valid from 2017 onward.
Pensions
Members of the Fortum Executive Management in Finland participate in the Finnish TyEL pension system, which provides a retirement benefit based on earnings in accordance with the prescribed statutory system. Under the Finnish pension system earnings include base pay, annual bonuses and taxable fringe benefits, but gains realised from the LTI plans are not included in that definition. Members of the Fortum Executive Management outside Finland participate in pension systems based on statutory pension arrangements and market practices in their local countries.
In addition to the statutory pensions, the members of the Fortum Executive Management have supplementary pension arrangements. The Group principle is that all new supplementary pension arrangements for the President and CEO as well as the Fortum Executive Management are defined contribution plans.
The retirement age for Fortum's President and CEO is 63, and for the other members of the Fortum Executive Management the retirement age varies between 60 and 65. For the President and CEO and other members of the Fortum Executive Management, the maximum supplementary pension premium is 25% of the annual base salary. For the members joining the Fortum Executive Management after the end of the year 2016 as well as for those current members to whom the premium has been below 20% of the annual salary, the pension premium is 20% of the annual base salary as of 1 January 2017. Members of the Fortum Executive Management, who joined Fortum prior to 1 January 2009, are entitled to a supplementary defined benefit pension plan in which the benefit is 60% or 66% of the final pensionable salary. In these cases, the pension is provided by an insurance company or Fortum's Pension Fund.

Tax Footprint 2016

Fortum as a tax payer 2016

As set out in our tax policy below, we aim to identify simple and cost-efficient solutions to manage our taxes in a sustainable manner. The goal is to allow the business to continue to invest, to operate flexibly and efficiently, and to safeguard returns to our shareholders.
The energy sector, including Fortum, is in the middle of a transition. Global megatrends, such as climate change, emerging new technologies, changes in consumer behaviour, and questions regarding resource efficiency, have a major impact on the energy sector globally. As Fortum is operating in a capital-intensive sector,

it is important to have predictability to be able to operate and finance our operations in an efficient and safe manner.
Fortum operates in more than 15 countries. Our business is based mainly on local fuels and energy sources, local production, local distribution of heat, and sale of energy to customers locally. Therefore our profits are typically also generated locally.
Taxation is always a consequence of business operations and is therefore always based on business decisions and needs. For us this means that our investments with long lifetimes, price levels set locally and the efficiency of financing always have tax impacts.

Taxes cover the entire value chain

Fortum pays transfer taxes related to
certain transactions
Fortum pays taxes based on the use of
natural resources

Fortum pays insurance premium taxes included in insurance payments

Fortum pays property taxes based on real estates and buildings

Fortum pays employment taxes and collects payroll taxes based on salaries

Fortum pays di erent kinds of production-
related taxes

Fuels/Energy Sources

Energy Production

Distribution and Sales

Fortum pays income taxes based on taxable
profit

Customers

Fortum pays custom duties based on importation

Fortum pays waste taxes based on
certain by-products

Fortum collects VAT related to sales

It is important that we can efficiently operate and finance our businesses, carry out investments and manage financing risks in all the countries where we operate. Financing, which underpins all our operations, is one of the very few truly international aspects of Fortum's tax profile. Taxes are paid locally on profits that are generated locally, and this applies to all our operations, including financing. Therefore predictability and stability of our operating environment are crucial for us.
The extent and nature of the taxes Fortum pays is shown by our total tax contribution. In 2016, it was EUR 741 (2015: 765) million of which EUR 365 (2015: 413) million was related to taxes borne and EUR 376 (2015: 352) million to taxes collected. Finland, Sweden and Russia are our biggest production countries. In 2016, the taxes borne in Finland were EUR 101 (2015: 130) million, in Sweden EUR 201 (2015: 210) million and in Russia EUR 23 (2015: 23) million.
Taxes borne include corporate income taxes (excluding deferred taxes), production taxes, employment taxes, taxes on property, and the cost of indirect taxes. Taxes collected include VAT, payroll taxes, excise taxes and withholding taxes.
While income taxes are paid on taxable profit, Fortum also pays other taxes based on, for example, fuel usage, waste, production capacity, and the value of real estate.

Fortum has local operations and tax contribution in more than 15 countries.
As a major part of our taxes are not based on profits, our total taxes borne in relation to our accounting profit (total tax rate) will increase if the profit level decreases. With the current low electricity prices, these non-profit-based taxes account for a more significant share of costs of operations than before. This was the actual situation in 2016. Such a large tax burden, which is unrelated to profitability, can present a real obstacle to operating an economically viable business.

Demanding and uncertain tax environment in 2016
The operating environment was affected by the global macro economic problems and the related challenges to public financing. In many of the countries in which Fortum operates, taxes on the energy sector have been increased and tax laws changed faster than in the past. Energy sector taxes, such as real estate and production taxes are not based on profits and are one of the biggest costs of power production. Combined with low electricity prices, significant increases in these taxes threaten to reduce the profitability of utilities companies, including Fortum. In some cases, very high levels of non-profit-based taxes could make some operations financially unsustainable.
The changing regulation and focus on so-called aggressive tax planning is decreasing the predictability and stability of all business operations. For example, the OECD's BEPS work, the EU Commission's anti-tax avoidance directive (ATAD), and the EU Accounting directive work are changing existing rules, policies and even fundamental aspects of taxation. This creates challenges, especially for long-term business such as ours, as there is no clarity on how the rules will be interpreted. Getting guidance or certainty on the tax treatment of particular items can, in the worst case scenario, take years. The purpose of much of the new regulation is not primarily focused on Fortum's type of business, with profit generation already by nature being local. Nevertheless, we are affected by the new rules. Fortum is managing the challenge of these new rules by further developing risk identification tools, improving our tax audit readiness already in the early phase of business processes, and creating better communication with tax authorities.
Fortum's approach to taxation ­ our tax policy
Fortum's tax policy is based on the fact that taxes should be handled as part of the business process. Therefore, taxes are managed based on Fortum Group's operating strategy with a focus especially on the protection of the parent company's dividend distribution capability to meet our dividend policy.
Tax planning is managed to support business efficiency and profitability in order to create shareholder value, but with respect to existing regulation. This ensures that we appropriately assess,

In 2016, more than half of Fortum's taxes borne (EUR 192 million of the total EUR 365 million) related to the real-estate tax and nuclear capacity tax in Sweden, but this will change due to the Swedish government's budget proposal in September 2016.
The budget proposal included a timetable for lowering the real-estate tax on hydro assets and for phasing out the nuclear capacity tax over coming years. The real-estate tax rate on hydro assets will be reduced in four steps by 2020 and the nuclear capacity tax will be reduced starting in July 2017 and totally abolished as of 2018.
report and pay our taxes to the tax authorities to the benefit of our stakeholders and wider society.
We always operate within the law and on the basis of being open and transparent with tax authorities in all the jurisdictions where we operate. We also follow guidelines set out by the Ownership Steering Department in the Prime Minister's Office. Predictability and transparency of both national and local legislation as well as interpretations and decisions by tax authorities on all levels are critical to us, as all our investments have a long lifetime and our operations are capital intensive. We respect existing regulations, such as market-based pricing in internal transactions (the arm's length principle). We pay taxes in the country where our business operations are located and where the value added is generated, in accordance with the local regulations.
Tax risk management ­ We regularly assess the uncertainties related to taxation in our business and we report tax risks and how they are managed and assured annually to the Audit and Risk Committee. The risk analysis done in 2016 indicated that, in particular, the new compliance burden around transfer pricing, developments in the Finnish real-estate tax as well as the internal controls need more focus in the future. To mitigate risks, we aim to make tax issues, and especially compliance issues, an integral part of the business processes, improve communication around taxes, and raise management's awareness of them.

Our Corporate Tax Team manages and mitigates tax-related uncertainties by targeting predictability in the taxes for business operations in all our operating countries. This means that in unclear cases we discuss with tax authorities or look for advice from experts to clarify interpretations. We also pay special attention to the correctness and transparency of our tax returns, and we discuss our positions with tax authorities.
Tax governance ­ The group Head of Tax owns and implements our tax approach and is responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures that support the tax approach are in place, maintained and used in the same manner in all countries. Furthermore, the Head of Tax is responsible for ensuring that the Corporate Tax Team has the proficiency and experience to implement it appropriately.
The Head of Tax reports to the CFO. Furthermore, tax issues, such as tax strategy, legal processes and tax-related risks are followed on a regular basis in the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors. The chart on this page presents the different tax functions within the Corporate Tax Team.
Transparency and relationships with governments ­ In Fortum's tax reporting we are committed to ensuring that stakeholders are able to understand the important elements of our tax position and that the information provided is fair and accurate. We have published our tax footprint as part of our annual reporting since 2012. As the Finnish state is the majority shareholder in Fortum, we apply in our tax reporting the 2016 guidelines of the Ownership Steering Department of the Prime Minister's Office for statemajority-owned companies. We strive for effective collaboration with authorities to clarify existing rules, so that we can respond to potential challenges in a timely manner and avoid surprises.
We believe that transparency is crucial both for our external and internal stakeholders. Open, transparent and consistent communication guides our tax footprint reporting. To create the best possible understanding of us as a tax payer and of the impact of taxes on our business and on the societies we operate in, we continue to develop our tax footprint report.
At Fortum, we recognise the demands of our stakeholders for more information on tax and our disclosures reflect this. We

report both our effective tax rate and total tax rate. In line with the 2016 tax reporting guidelines for state-owned companies in Finland, we apply the principle of materiality in our financial reporting, i.e. we publish tax information on the most significant countries, and we publish more detailed information about taxation for the majority of the countries in which Fortum operates in this report. Furthermore, we publish information about our companies registered in countries that are considered by the EU, the OECD and the Global Forum to be tax havens. We disclose all significant tax-related decisions concerning, for example, tax audits and appeals.
Legal structure and intra-group financing
To support our strategy and dividend policy, Fortum's legal structure is designed to mitigate various financial risks in our

operations, ensure sound and efficient financing of operations and investments, and safeguard the parent company's financial strength and dividend distribution capability in accordance with Fortum's dividend policy. Financing and holding of our operations are located in the EU area, in countries where the operating environment is predictable. Our Finnish operations are owned through the parent company, our Swedish operations by our Swedish holding company and our operations in other countries mainly by our Dutch holding company. The taxes are, however, paid in the country where the revenue is generated independently of ownership structure.
We are constantly developing our legal structure to reach efficiency, certainty and cost savings. As part of this work in 2016 we have or are about to wind up and dissolve companies for example in Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Poland and Ireland.

Fortum publishes tax information as part of its financial statements. Income taxes and deferred taxes in the balance sheet are included and explained in the tax notes of the financial statements. The most relevant parts of these tax notes are reproduced below, with some commentary to explain some of the drivers of the numbers. See Note 13 Income tax expense and Note 29 Income taxes in balance sheet for further information.
The table below explains the difference between the statutory tax rate in Finland compared to the rate at which Fortum is effectively taxed as per the tax charge on the income statements.

The effective income tax rate according to the income statement was 15.2% (25.4%). The tax rate used in the income statement is always impacted by the fact that the share of profits of associates and joint ventures is recorded based on Fortum's share of profits

after tax. The share of profit of associated companies and joint ventures during 2016 reduced the effective income tax rate by 5%.
The comparable effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding the impact of the share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures as well as non-taxable capital gains, was 20.0% (2015: 23.5%).

The effective income tax rate and comparable effective income tax rate reflect the income tax expense recognised in the income statement including changes in deferred taxes. When the pretax profit is close to null or negative, the total tax rate does not illustrate the tax contribution in an informative way. Therefore, we use "not applicable" for total tax rate in 2015.

Deferred taxes in the balance sheet
Deferred taxes illustrate timing differences between the treatment of costs under accounting and tax rules. The timing differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the most significant of which for Fortum are explained below.

Deferred tax liabilities in 2016 mainly relate to property, plants and equipment in Finland, Sweden and Russia. During 2016 entities primarily in Sweden and Russia used a portion of the deferred tax asset relating to tax loss carry forwards. The deferred tax asset in Sweden was recognised for the taxable loss in 2015, which was mainly due to the write-down related to the early closure of the O1 and O2 nuclear units in Oskarshamn.

Case:
Timing of income taxes paid Investments ­ Tax depreciations. We invest in production assets and depreciate them for accounting purposes evenly over the lifetime of the assets, which can be many years. In some countries, the cost of the asset is deducted for tax purposes over a shorter time period, or a larger proportion of the cost is deducted in earlier years and less in the later years of the asset's life. This reduces tax costs in the early years of an asset's life, but increases them as the asset ages. This acceleration of tax depreciation provides an incentive for capital expenditure, but matches the payment of income tax with the long-term investment earnings over the entire lifetime of the asset. The fact that more tax will be paid in the later years of an asset's life is recognised by booking a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.
The timing of tax depreciation may lead to certain projects paying little tax in their early years, but will increase taxable profits in later years. The tax contribution of capital expenditure should therefore be considered over the whole life of an asset rather than over one or a few years.
Tax losses and other impacts. If a company has poor profitability, it may make tax losses that cannot be utilised in the period in which they arise, but can be carried forward and used to offset taxable profits in the future. A concrete example of tax losses is the one-time write-down of the two reactors at the nuclear power plant OKG in Sweden during 2015; this gave rise to significant losses that will only be utilised once the Swedish operations return to profit. It may take many years to fully utilise the losses. The future benefit of these losses is booked as a deferred tax asset (or reduction of deferred tax liability) in the balance sheet.
In years in which the tax loss is utilised, the company will have taxable profits, but will pay no tax, as the losses from previous years are used to offset the taxable profits arising in the current year.

Fortum's tax indicators and country-by-country taxation
In line with the 2016 guidelines of the Ownership Steering Department of the Prime Minister's Office for state-majority-owned companies, Fortum has selected key indicators that reflect the nature of its business operations and the related tax. As Fortum's

operations are capital-intensive and have a long lifetime, the net assets has been selected as the best determinant of our value creation in each country. Our operations are not labour-intensive, nor is revenue the most relevant base for a value creation indicator. Therefore, for our operations, the table below presents assets used in operations along with taxes borne and taxes collected for the

nine of the most significant countries of operation. To ensure a good understanding of our value creation, we also present interestbearing loan receivables, as financing is crucial for the success of our operations. We trust this is the best determinant of value creation for our operations.

The table above reflects the current challenging power and financial markets as well as tax environment. The high total tax rates in Sweden and Finland reflect lower profits in those countries, driven by the current price of power and the significant amounts of taxes that are not based on profits. We have organised the financing of our operations so that it also protects our capability to distribute dividends. This simultaneously also protects the tax base in Finland. As some of the markets risks have realised, it results in lowered taxes for our financing. The tax rates in Luxembourg and Ireland reflect one-off charges resulting from the reorganisation of the Group's financing operations.

Other payments to the public sector
In addition to taxes borne and taxes collected, we make other compulsory tax-like payments to the public sector, payments that are not compensation for goods or services received. For example, in 2016 we paid EUR 38 (2015: 39) million in employer's statutory pension contributions.
We are also a significant dividend payer. Fortum's Board of Directors proposes to the 2017 Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 977 (2016: 977) million be paid for 2016. The Finnish State's share of this would be about EUR 496 (496) million.

Ongoing tax appeals
As explained in the box below, lack of clarity in tax legislation and changes in the interpretation of tax rules can result in a long delay between a transaction taking place and its tax treatment being agreed with the relevant tax authority.
Fortum had several tax audits ongoing during 2016. Fortum has received income tax assessments in Sweden for the years 2009­2014, in Finland for year 2007 and in Belgium for the years 2008­2012. Fortum has appealed all assessments received. Fortum has in December 2016 received a positive final decision in Finland in line with our expectations. Based on legal analyses, no provision has been accounted for in the financial statements related to the tax audits. See Note 38 Legal actions and official procedings for more information.

Information about companies registered in countries considered to be tax havens
The EU, the OECD and the Global Forum have established a blacklist of countries considered to be tax havens. Fortum has a fully-owned captive insurance company in Guernsey, for insurance reasons; it also has a stake in Nature Elements Asia Renewable Energy and Cleantech Fund L.P., which makes research and development investments and is located in the Cayman Islands. Fortum's earnings from both companies are subject to normal taxation in Finland and the taxes borne on these operations were EUR 33,000 in 2016 based on 20% tax rate.

Fortum operates internationally and, therefore, our international financing operations are located in EU countries with stable operating environments and predictable taxation. We have financing and leasing companies in Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg. In the recent tax management debate, Luxembourg and Ireland have also been mentioned as tax havens. We pay taxes in each of these countries of operation based on local rules and normal tax rates (Netherlands 25%, Luxembourg 29%, Belgium 33.99% and Ireland 12.5%). Fortum's subsidiary companies are listed by country in the Note 42, Subsidiaries by segment, of the consolidated financial statement.

Case:
Investments ­ controversy costs and tax deductibility of interest expense For Fortum to operate efficiently and minimise its financing risks, it needs to have certainty as to how its investments and related financing will be taxed. The international, long-term and capital-intensive nature of Fortum's operations can make this certainty harder to achieve, particularly as regards the tax treatment of interest on loans used to finance investments.
In recent years, the tax treatment of interest costs has received much attention both locally and internationally. This has led to uncertainty in defining the correct tax treatment for interest, even in traditional businesses and investments.
These unclear and changing rules, combined with even less clear interpretations and a lack of advance rulings on tax treatment, result in an increased likelihood of tax assessments and costly controversy processes. The final position may be agreed only 8 to 9 years after deciding on the investment or filing the tax return to which the uncertainty relates. The risk of double taxation is increasing. Ideally, a business needs to be able to have predictability in applying tax rules when initially planning an investment.

Uncertainty over the tax treatment regarding investments can take ten years.

We have defined our most important sustainability focus areas in the areas of economic, social and environmental responsibility.
Our focus areas are based on Fortum's and our stakeholders' views of the significance of the impacts on the company and its ability to create value for its stakeholders and on the environment. Our understanding of stakeholder views is based on the results of the extensive stakeholder survey, One Fortum survey, conducted annually as well as on information gained through other stakeholder collaboration.
In 2015, a total of 2,133 stakeholder representatives, more than 60% of them representing personnel, participated in our latest

separate sustainability survey. In the 2015 sustainability survey for stakeholders, decision makers, organisations, employees and the general public put special emphasis on the significance of security of supply of heat and electricity, management of sustainabilityrelated risks, and sustainable ways of operating. Our personnel emphasised the safety of operations. The general public considered the use of renewable energy sources as important.
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee and are part of Fortum's short-term incentive scheme. In addition to the Group-

level targets, divisions have their own targets. Fortum's Board of Directors annually decides on the sustainability targets to be included in the incentive scheme. In 2016 the incentive scheme included the injury frequency for Fortum employees and for contractors and the number of serious occupational accidents. The injury frequency for Fortum employees and for contractors will be included in the 2017 incentive scheme. The weight of the sustainability target in the incentive scheme is 10% (2016: 10%).

Successes and development needs:
· Our reputation amongst the most important stakeholder groups in the One Fortum survey improved in 2016 and exceeded the target. The target for customer satisfaction was achieved in all business areas, except in electricity sales to business customers.
· We achieved our target in specific carbon dioxide emissions. In 2016, specific emissions from total energy production were 184 gCO2/kWh.
· The replacement of the Loviisa nuclear power plant's two highpressure turbines and the Suomenoja power plant's new district heat storage improved the energy efficiency of our production in Finland. Refurbishment of the Chelyabinsk CHP-3 unit's gas turbine improved energy efficiency in Russia. Through the projects implemented, an annual energy savings of about 245 GWh was achieved.
· We strive to be a safe workplace for own and our contractors' employees. In 2016, we achieved the lost workday injury frequency target for our own and our contractors' employees, but there were still too many serious accidents. There were no injuries leading to a fatality during the year.
· In 2016 we signed an agreement for an external service provider to conduct supplier audits; the first audit performed by an external actor was carried out in December. In 2016 we focused on auditing fuel suppliers in particular. We audited a total of 13 suppliers in seven countries.

Our targets for 2017
Our sustainability targets are based on continuous operational improvement. In our target-setting for 2017 we have taken into consideration the potential occupational safety impacts of Fortum's growth strategy and business acquisitions. It is likely that, until Fortum's occupational safety practices have been integrated in the new functions, the acquisitions will temporarily weaken Fortum's current good level of occupational safety.
There are still too many serious injuries occurring in our operations. Starting in 2017 the focus of our monitoring is on accidents that have serious consequences, rather than on the length of the sick-leave. These include accidents leading to a fatality or permanent disability and accidents that could have caused serious consequences.
A new indicator we will track in 2017 is the quality of the investigations of occupational accidents, serious EHS incidents, and near misses. The goal is that the investigation of each incident is done in accordance with guidelines, and more than 90% of the corrective actions are implemented on schedule (target level 1.0). By 2020 the goal is for 100% of the corrective actions to be implemented on schedule, the investigations to use experts from across division boundaries and the lessons learned from the incidents to be actively shared (target level 1.5).

Governance and management
Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-driven and is based on the company's values, the Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct and the policies and their specifying instructions
defined at the Group level. We comply with laws and regulations. All of our operations are guided by good governance, effective risk management, adequate controls and the internal audit principles supporting them.
Fortum's goal is a high level of environmental and safety management in all business activities. Calculated in terms of sales, 99.9% of Fortum's electricity and heat production operations at the end of 2016 were ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified. The divisions and sites develop their operations with internal and external audits required by environmental, occupational safety and quality management systems.
Responsibilities
Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy and the highest decision-making authority in these issues is with the Board of Directors, which has joint responsibility in matters related to sustainability. For this reason, Fortum has not designated a Sustainability Committee for decision-making on economic, environmental and social issues. The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters, when necessary.
The Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability approach and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual planning. The targets are ultimately approved by Fortum's Board of Directors. Fortum Executive Management monitors the achievement of the targets in its monthly meetings and in quarterly performance reviews. The achievement of the targets is regularly reported also to Fortum's Board of Directors.
Fortum's line management is responsible for sustainability management, and realisation of the safety targets is part of Fortum's incentive system. Fortum's Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordination and development of sustainability at the Group level and for maintaining an adequate situation awareness regarding sustainability.
Sustainability management by topic
Sustainability management in the areas of economic responsibility, environmental responsibility and social responsibility is described in more detail in the Appendix 1. Additionally, more detailed information about the management of different aspects and impacts is presented by topic in this Sustainability Report.

Policies and commitments
Fortum is a member of the UN Global Compact initiative and the UN Caring for Climate initiative. Fortum supports and respects the international initiatives and commitments, and national and international guidelines listed in the table, and they guide our operations in the areas of economic, environmental and social responsibility.
In December 2016, Fortum's sustainability policy was updated to be in line with our new strategy. Group-level EHS instructions and minimum requirements set requirements for all the operations for which we have operative responsibility. In 2016 we updated these requirements and published a revised version of the Corporate Safety and Security handbook together with an e-learning.
We report on the training related to the updated instructions in the sections Business ethics and compliance, Occupational and operational safety and Supply chain management.
The company's Group-level policies are approved by Fortum's Board of Directors. The Group-level instructions are approved by either the President and CEO or the Fortum Executive Management.
Fortum's main internal policies and instructions guiding sustainability are listed in the Appendix 2.

Business ethics and compliance

We believe there is a clear connection between high standards of ethical business practices and excellent financial results. As an industry leader, we obey the law, we embrace the spirit of integrity, and we uphold ethical business conduct wherever we operate.
Code of Conduct sets the basic requirements
The Fortum Code of Conduct and Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct define how we treat others, engage in business, safeguard our corporate assets, and how we expect our suppliers and business partners to operate.
Fortum's Board of Directors is responsible for the company's mission and values and has approved the Fortum Code of Conduct. The online training on the Code of Conduct is part of the induction programme for new employees. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and has been approved by the Head of Procurement in collaboration with the purchasing steering group.
About 95% of Fortum's total purchasing volume, excluding purchases by Ekokem and DUON, is purchased from suppliers with a purchasing volume of EUR 50,000 or more. Geographically they target mainly suppliers in Finland, Sweden, Russia and Poland. The Supplier Code of Conduct is part of purchase agreements exceeding EUR 50,000.
In line with the Code of Conduct, Fortum has zero tolerance for corruption and fraud and does not award donations to political parties or political activities, religious organisations, authorities, municipalities or local administrations.
Compliance risks
The compliance risks related to our business operations include the potential risk of bribery or corruption, fraud and embezzlement, non-compliance with legislation or company rules, conflicts of interest, improper use of company assets, and working under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Compliance risk management is an integrated part of business operations, and key compliance risks, including action plans, are identified, assessed and reported annually. This applies also to the management of risks related to sustainability. During 2016, Fortum has launched a Total Compliance programme which covers key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics.
Training
As part of the Total Compliance programme, an training plan is developed annually.
In 2016, training on compliance with regulations was provided in Russia and India. The new Fortum employees acquired through an acquisition in Poland received Fortum's Code of Conduct training related to business ethics.
Training on the new Market Abuse Regulation and insider regulations was provided for certain management teams. Training on internal controls was also arranged for divisionlevel management teams. Training on competition law issues was provided for the functions responsible for sales and for the individuals joining Fortum through acquisitions.
The pre-selection process for Fortum's goods and service suppliers was renewed in spring 2016. Related training was provided for procurement personnel in all countries, except Poland and Russia. The training will be arranged in Poland during spring 2017. The pre-selection process will be taken into use in Ekokem's procurements during autumn 2017.
Reporting misconduct
In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum has an external "Raise a concern" channel. The same mechanism is used for
reporting any suspected misconduct relating to the environment, labour practices or human rights violations, and it is available to all stakeholders. In Russia, Fortum has a separate compliance organisation in place and employees there are encouraged to use

the channels provided by the compliance organisation. They may, however, also use the "Raise a concern" channel should they so wish.
Suspected misconduct and measures related to ethical business practices and compliance with regulations are regularly reported to the Fortum Executive Management and to the Board's Audit and Risk Committee.
Suspected cases of misconduct
A total of 149 reports of suspected misconduct were made. Of these cases, 72 led to an investigation; at the end of the year, there were four ongoing investigations. About one third of the investigated cases were related to non-compliance either with laws and regulations or with company rules which constituted majority of the cases. In these cases, corrective action was taken by reviewing and developing existing processes and instructions and by providing training for employees.
Fortum has zero tolerance towards alcohol and drug use. About a fifth of the cases were related to alcohol abuse by either Fortum's or contractors' employees during working hours.
As a result of the investigations, four employment contracts were terminated either by immediate dismissal or by mutual agreement, and four written warnings were given. There were 13 cases of misconduct reported to the police. There was no cause for action to be taken in 16 of the cases investigated.
Three cases of suspected corruption or bribery related to Fortum's operations were investigated in 2016. Misconduct was not detected in the investigations.
Fortum also requires its goods and service suppliers as well as its business partners to comply with a zero tolerance policy towards corruption and bribery. As part of supply chain management, we requested a report from the goods and service suppliers we had knowledge of possible cases of misconduct. We requested the reports to include information about e.g. the corrective measures

taken related to the supplier's own operations. The reports were considered sufficient and didn't lead to the termination of a contract. Other misconduct led to the termination of a contract with one goods and service supplier.
We deal with potential cases of corruption in a professional manner, in accordance with the defined compliance investigation process, in line with applicable laws and with respect to the rights and personal integrity of all parties involved.
Restricting competition
There were three ongoing investigation cases in Russia in 2016, one of which was completed during the year. The court found no violation of competition law.
During the year Fortum was not subject to any significant monetary fines for competition law violations.
Other significant fines
There were no other significant fines.

Stakeholders

Our way of operating responsibly includes continuously identifying the views of our stakeholders and finding a balance between the different expectations our stakeholders have. Dialogue, feedback and good collaboration are the key ways to promote a mutual understanding with our stakeholders.
Stakeholder collaboration
Collaboration with different stakeholder groups helps Fortum to assess and meet the expectations that stakeholder groups have towards the company. We engage in an active dialogue with the different stakeholders associated with our operations. We conduct annual stakeholder surveys. We monitor and assess the public dialogue in the countries where we operate, and we have increased the dialogue with our stakeholders also through social media channels. Feedback from customers drives the development of our products and services. Additionally, our activities in national and international organisations help to deepen our understanding of global sustainability issues and their connections to our business.
Management of stakeholder collaboration at Fortum is assigned particularly to communications, corporate relations, human resources, the sustainability unit, the functions responsible for electricity and heat sales and energy production, as well as many of our experts. Responsibilities for managing stakeholder collaboration are primarily determined by stakeholder group or interaction theme. Key interaction areas, e.g. public affairs, and corporate communications, have annual plans that guide the activities.
Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims to increase the dialogue and the exchange of views between the company and its stakeholders.
Information through surveys
In collaboration with third parties, we annually conduct surveys regarding stakeholder collaboration. The aim of these surveys is

to help Fortum assess and respond to the important stakeholder groups' expectations of the company. The surveys also measure the success of our stakeholder collaboration. Additionally, the surveys provide information about emerging sustainability trends and risks we should acknowledge. We use the survey results in business planning and development and in identifying material aspects in corporate responsibility.
The One Fortum survey and its results in terms of customer satisfaction and reputation are presented in the section
Customer satisfaction and reputation. As part of the One Fortum survey, we regularly survey what our stakeholders consider to be the most important areas of sustainability.

Feedback from customers drives the development of our products and services.

Most important concerns of stakeholders in 2016
Coal use With the Paris Agreement on climate change, the use of coal has become a topic of active discussion. Several countries (including Finland) have announced their discontinuation of coal use for energy production in the upcoming decades. Implementation of this, however, is challenging, and a total ban may lead to claims for compensation. The energy sector considers a ban on use as negative for competition and for the sector's business operations, and it sees emissions trading as the primary mechanism for steering energy choice.
An increasing number of investors are paying attention also to the carbon risk of their investment targets and have initiated actions to reduce it by, e.g., announcing that they will divest their holding in companies in which sales of coal-based production exceed the investor-defined limit. Discontinuing the use of coal has long been on the agenda of environmental and non-governmental organisations. 4% of Fortum's electricity production and 17% of its heat production was based on coal in 2016.
Biomass fuel use Increasing the use of biomass fuels plays a central role in achieving the EU's climate and energy targets. The sustainability of biomass fuels has been actively discussed in the energy sector in recent years. In November 2016 the EU Commission published its proposal on legislation that would extend the current regulations on liquid biofuels to cover also solid biomass.

Fortum's position, whereby common, binding sustainability criteria are needed for all biomass fuels, aligns with the Commission's view.
Environmental organisations have expressed their concern related to increasing the use of biomass fuels. The organisations have put particular emphasis on the threat of forest biodiversity degradation and the diminishing carbon sinks.
Taxes The country-specific reporting of taxes has become an important topic in international and national public and political discussions. The aim of public, country-specific tax reporting is to impact primarily so-called aggressive tax planning. Fortum has published its tax footprint since 2012. Our tax report has received both praise and criticism. Our tax report has been criticised for not containing information about all the companies in line with the principle of materiality we apply and for including also other taxes beyond income taxes. Fortum's taxation has been discussed publically also in terms of Fortum's various tax processes.
It is important for us that our tax reporting creates an understandable, comprehensive picture of Fortum as a tax payer. This requires the reporting of material income taxes and also the reporting of other non-income taxes as well as the publishing of taxation-related principles. For the sake of transparency, information about various tax processes of significance must also be disclosed. We engage in dialogue with non-governmental organisations and continuously develop reporting to improve understandability.

Economic impacts

Fortum is a significant economic actor in Finland, Sweden, Russia, Poland and the Baltic countries. We continuously monitor the impact and well-being generated by our operations to our stakeholders. The key stakeholders include lenders and shareholders, customers, personnel, suppliers of goods and services, and the public sector.
The most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum's operations come from sales revenue from customers, procurements from suppliers of goods and services, compensation to lenders and dividend to shareholders, growth and maintenance investments, employee wages and salaries, and taxes paid.
Our operations also have indirect economic impacts. The Finnish State owns 50.8% of Fortum's shares, and we contribute to a functioning society by, among other things, paying taxes and dividends. These secure society's basic functions and build wellbeing. Investments and the procurement of goods and services provide employment both locally and outside our operating areas. New investment proposals are assessed against sustainability criteria. In terms of suppliers of goods and services, we also assess the global impacts, paying particular attention to suppliers of goods and services operating in risk countries. The wages and taxes paid have a positive impact on local communities.

Customer satisfaction and reputation

For Fortum, customer satisfaction and reputation are a top priority in implementing the company's strategy and in growing the business. We have set Group-wide targets for customer satisfaction and for our reputation.
Customer in the centre
The Group-wide Customer in the centre development programme was launched in 2015 with the aim of promoting a customer-centric culture in our company. The programme continued in 2016. Our new strategy, published in February and further defined in autumn, also put customers in sharper focus. In conjunction with the publication of the strategy, we launched five must-win battle (MWB) development programmes, one of which is "Put the customer in the centre". The programme contains specific projects to improve the customer experience and our offering, e.g., by utilising the opportunities brought by digitalisation. In our development efforts, we are engaging in increasingly closer collaboration with our customers.
One Fortum survey provides information about all stakeholder groups
We use the extensive One Fortum survey to annually measure customer and stakeholder satisfaction as well as changes in the company's reputation and the factors that impact it. The survey covers customers, public administrations, capital markets, non-

governmental organisations and opinion makers as well as Fortum's personnel. In Finland and Sweden, we also survey the views of the general public and media.
We conducted the survey in 2016 in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, the Baltic countries, Russia and India. Over 4,000 customers and nearly 3,300 other stakeholders were interviewed for the One Fortum survey. In addition, we added a new component to our research side: in autumn we conducted a follow-up survey among customers so that we can indentify our customers' changing needs even faster. We also monitor other publically available research sources, but we define Group targets and our identified development areas on the basis of the One Fortum survey results.
Customer satisfaction
In the annual survey conducted in spring 2016, our customer satisfaction remained very stable in virtually all customer segments. The autumn follow-up survey brought slightly more changes, as satisfaction among electricity sales customers in Sweden, particularly in the consumer side, was clearly slipping. However, at the same time, we succeeded in increasing the satisfaction among district heat business customers in several countries ­ and in Finland and Lithuania we achieved our best-ever result. Our customer satisfaction is at a good level in most countries and customer segments.
Our Group-level target for all business areas is to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of "good", i.e. 70­74, in the One

Fortum survey. Customer satisfaction in 2016 was at a good level in all business areas, except electricity sales to business customers. The results of the One Fortum survey clearly indicate that these days customers are looking for advice and additional services related to their energy use.
Other public customer satisfaction results
The international and independent EPSI Rating annually surveys the level of satisfaction of electricity retail company customers in Finland, Sweden and Norway. Our customer satisfaction dropped in all three countries, particularly in Sweden.
In 2016 a customer satisfaction survey using the same format was conducted for the first time in Ekokem in all operating countries. Ekokem's overall rating in the survey was 4.1 on a scale of one to five; this result is considered as good.

Reputation
Our reputation is strongest among public administration, opinion makers and nongovernmental organisations. Among the latter group, our reputation index grew significantly compared to the previous year. The biggest drop occurred in the capital markets stakeholder group, where our reputation index fell to the same level as the rating given by media. Our reputation continues to be weakest among the general public. Based on the survey results, we should continue our efforts to improve social responsibility and customer centricity.
The Group-level target for our reputation in 2016 was a rating of 72.0 in the One Fortum survey, measured as the average rating given by public administration, opinion makers, nongovernmental organisations, and personnel. In 2016, we achieved a rating of 72.5 among these stakeholder groups. The target set for 2017 (70.7) includes the above-mentioned stakeholder groups as well as the opinions of representatives of media, capital markets and the general public. The reference value is the reputation index (69.7) given by these stakeholder groups for 2016. Rankings given by customers are not included in the reputation index calculation, because we treat customer satisfaction as a separate entity.
Brand
In addition to our reputation, we also monitor brand development, i.e. what impression the general public has about our brand. The survey includes the measurement of e.g., recognition, preference and brand attributes. Fortum is very well recognised in Finland, but less so in our other operating countries; we are working to boost our recognition. At the same time, our aim is to change our brand image and to enhance our attractiveness among various stakeholder groups.

Supply chain management

Fortum is a significant purchaser of goods and services. We actively strive to reduce the environmental impacts caused by our operations and to improve economic and social wellbeing. We also manage risks related to our supply chain. The aim is that open and efficient collaboration creates value for both parties.
Fuel purchases and investments in a significant role
Fortum's purchasing volume in 2016 was EUR 2.5 (2015: 2.2) billion. Fuel purchases, investments, and electricity purchased by the Electricity Sales business area from the Nordic wholesale electricity market for retail sales accounted for the majority of Fortum's purchases.
Fortum's fuel purchases in 2016 totalled EUR 531 (2015: 567) million. We purchase fuels from international and local suppliers. Our fossil fuel purchases totalled about EUR 454 (2015: 482) million, biomass fuels about EUR 39 (2015: 46) million, and nuclear fuel about EUR 38 (2015: 39) million.
Of our purchases, EUR 599 (2015: 527) million targeted various investments. The biggest investments, EUR 214 million, were made in Russia. A large share of the investments are contracted out in full with materials, installation and other service as well as contractor work included in the total purchase.
The rest of our purchases, EUR 1.4 (2015: 1.1) billion, consist of other goods and services. The figure includes electricity purchased by the Electricity Sales business area from the Nordic wholesale electricity market for retail sales. The other goods and services purchases were related to operation and maintenance as well as to other functions, such as IT solutions, marketing and travel.

Purchases, EUR million

Investments, 599 Fuels, 531 Other purchases, 1,412

Half of purchases from Europe
About half, i.e. 52%, of the purchasing volume was purchased from suppliers operating in Europe, mostly in Finland, Sweden and Poland. This does not include electricity purchases from the Nordic wholesale market. 46% of Fortum's purchases were from risk countries. The majority of these purchases were from Russia.
Violations related to work conditions and human rights are more likely in risk countries than in non-risk countries. Fortum's risk-country classification is based on the ILO's Decent Work Agenda, the UN's Human Development index and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions index.
In 2016 we had about 15,000 (2015: 9,700) suppliers of goods and services. The increase in the number of suppliers was impacted by Fortum's acquisition of Ekokem and DUON. About 1,600 of the suppliers were in risk countries. Excluding the Russia Division's local suppliers, there were about 270 suppliers in risk countries.

Sustainable fuel purchasing
The most significant environmental impacts of our supply chain are related mainly to fuels, particularly to coal and biomasses. There are significant environmental aspects associated with openpit coal mining, including natural resource efficiency, emissions to air, water and soil, and impacts on biodiversity. Significant occupational health and safety risks can be related to working in underground mines. The sustainability aspects of biomass sourcing are related primarily to biodiversity, but risks particularly outside the EU can also include, for instance, illegal logging or human rights violations.
In fuel purchasing, special attention is paid to the origin of the fuel and to responsible production. In 2016 we had 170 suppliers in our fuel supply chain, 6% of them operated in risk countries.

1) The biggest countries of origin in 2016

Natural gas
The natural gas used in Russia, the Baltic countries and Finland originated from several suppliers in Russia. The natural gas used in Poland was purchased mainly from Poland.
Coal
The coal used in Finland originated from Russia. The coal used in Poland originated mainly from Poland. The power plants in Russia used coal originating from Russia and Kazakhstan.
In Finland, we have a legal obligation to have an amount of fuels in reserve equivalent to three months of average electricity production. There are no similar legal obligations in other countries, but we do maintain sufficient reserves for uninterrupted energy production in all countries where we operate.
Fortum is a member of the Bettercoal initiative, and uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain.

Biomass
The biomass we used consisted mainly of forest residue chips, chips from roundwood and industrial wood residues that originated from Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries and Poland. About 60% of the forest biomass used by Fortum in 2016 originated from certified, sustainably managed forests or from the sphere of the FSC Controlled Wood system. The share was over 80% in Finland.
Our goal in 2016 was to define minimum requirements related to legality and traceability for wood-based biomass and to set a target for increasing the share of certified forest biomass. As the work advanced, we decided to combine these two goals, and in 2017 we will examine the opportunity to apply for Chain of Custody certification for the Fortum's wood-based biomass purchases.
The bio-oil plant integrated with Fortum's Joensuu power plant has a sustainability system approved by The Finnish Energy Authority. The system is used to prove compliance with nationally legislated sustainability criteria for bio-oil.
Uranium
The fuel assemblies used at the Loviisa power plant in Finland are completely of Russian origin. The fuel supplier acquires the uranium used in the fuel assemblies from Russian mines in accordance with Fortum's agreement. In 2016, the uranium originated from the Krasnokamensk, Khiagda and Dalur mines.
Both ARMZ Uranium Holding Co., a uranium producer, and TVEL, which is responsible for refining and manufacturing uranium, have environmental and occupational safety systems in place in all their plants. All three uranium mines have ISO 14001 environmental certification. The Khiagda mine has also an OHSAS 18001 certified occupational health and safety management system. The zirconium material manufacturing plant and the plant responsible for manufacturing uranium oxide pellets and fuel assemblies have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification and OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety management system certifications.

We regularly assess the quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management systems of our nuclear fuel suppliers and the manufacturing of nuclear fuel assemblies. In summer 2016 Fortum's representatives assessed the operations of Fortum's Russian fuel supplier's uranium enrichment plant. The plant was in good condition technically, and its quality, environmental, occupational health and safety management systems were certified.

Sustainable supply chain
We expect our business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct. Fortum's key tools in supply chain management are country and counterparty risk assessments, pre-selection of suppliers and supplier audits.
Codes of conduct cover basic requirements
The Fortum Code of Conduct forms the foundation for ethical business conduct and defines how we treat others, engage in business, and safeguard our corporate assets.
The Supplier Code of Conduct includes the sustainability requirements for suppliers of services and goods. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact initiative and is divided into four sections: business practices, human rights, labour standards, and the environment. The country and counterparty risk assessment follows the same basic structure with regards to sustainability, and addresses issues like the implementation of the guiding principles of human rights.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is used in all our countries of operation and is included in all purchase agreements exceeding EUR 50,000. The Supplier Code of Conduct was updated at the end of 2014; by publication date of this report, the training related to the updated Supplier Code of Conduct had been held in all our operating countries, except Norway and Russia.

Pre-selection of suppliers
We assess the level of operations of our business partners through pre-selection and supplier audits. The pre-selection process was renewed during the spring 2016. The related training has been arranged in all our operating countries, except Poland and Russia. In Poland the training will be held in spring 2017. The pre-selection process will be taken into use in Ekokem's procurements during autumn 2017.
The pre-selection is made whenever the purchase volume exceeds EUR 50,000. During the first phase of the pre-selection, the credit check is made, and the supplier is sent a short written questionnaire. The questionnaire surveys the supplier's possible operations in risk countries, certified management systems, and the occupational safety level of the contractors. We pay special attention also to anti-corruption practices.
If potential risks in the supplier's operations are identified through the questionnaire, a more extensive self-assessment questionnaire may be sent or a supplier audit is conducted. The extensive self-assessment questionnaire is always sent to fuel suppliers and the suppliers of Fortum India.
The Russia Division uses its own supplier pre-selection process. Pre-selection is done in accordance with Russian procurement law, and bidding is open to all companies. In the Russian operations, we set supplier requirements for business principles and ethics.
Supplier audits support assessments
In supplier audits, we assess the supplier's compliance with the requirements in Fortum's Supplier Code of Conduct. Audits are always done on-site, and they include production inspections,

employee interviews, and reviews of documents. If noncompliances are found, the supplier makes a plan for corrective actions and we monitor the implementation of them.
In 2016 we signed an agreement for an external service provider to conduct supplier audits; the first audit performed by an external actor was carried out in December. By collaborating with an international auditing company, we aim to utilise the expertise of the local auditors and, if necessary, increase the number of audits. Fortum's personnel will also continue to conduct supplier audits, especially in Fortum's own operating countries.
During the year we audited a total of 13 (2015: 9) suppliers in China, India, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. Our goal in 2017 is to audit 20 suppliers.
In 2016, most of the non-compliances identified in the audits were related to occupational safety, overtime hours, remuneration, and management of the suppliers' own subcontractors. The audits conducted did not reveal non-compliances related to freedom of association, discrimination, or child or forced labour, but we issued a recommendation to a Chinese supplier to strengthen its practices to prevent the potential use of child labour and to ensure the non-discrimination of employees in the recruiting process. Recommendations given in environmental issues are related to the establishment of environmental systems and the defining of environmental targets.
Fortum uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain. Bettercoal audits are always conducted by a third, accredited party. In 2016, one of Fortum's Polish coal supplier was audited. One of Fortum's Russian coal suppliers was audited in 2015.

Environmental impacts
Some of the environmental impacts of energy production are global or wide-reaching, some are regional or local. In terms of Fortum's operations, the key environmental aspects include: · Climate change · Use of renewable energy sources · Circular economy · Flue-gas emissions · Hydropower's environmental impacts and biodiversity · Fuel procurement
Climate change mitigation
We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by increasing carbon dioxide-free energy production and the use of renewable energy sources, and improving energy efficiency of production. 62% of the total electricity we produced in 2016 was carbon dioxide-free. We made several investment decisions that will significantly grow our wind and solar power production in the years ahead.
Circular economy boosts resource efficiency
We recycle significant amounts of waste and energy production by-products generated in our operations. Additionally, our circular economy services separate from municipal waste streams substances that can be utilised as materials and for energy production.
The continuous improvement of resource and energy efficiency is important in terms of the sufficiency of natural resources and climate change mitigation. In improving the energy efficiency of our own production, we have gained expertise that we have put to use in providing energy efficiency services to other energy companies.

Advanced combustion technology
Fuel use generates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particle emissions that degrade air quality and cause acidification of soil and water systems. These emissions can be effectively reduced with various flue-gas cleaning technologies. Special expertise in combustion technology is one of Fortum's strengths, and we have supplied our own power plants and many other energy companies with combustion technology solutions to reduce nitrogen oxide.

Mitigation of hydropower's environmental impacts
Damming rivers and regulating water systems change the natural water levels and discharges and cause changes in aquatic habitats. We actively take part in research activities in the sector and implement voluntary and permit-based measures to develop the biodiversity, fish populations and the multi-use of water systems where we produce hydro power.
Environmental impacts by production form

New combined heat and power plant in Zabrze, Poland
2016 marked the beginning of an intensive construction phase for Fortum's new combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Zabrze, Poland. The plant is planned to start commercial operations by the end of 2018, providing district heating to some 70,000 households in Zabrze and Bytom. The new plant has a capacity of max 75 MW electricity and 145 MW heat and will replace two coal-fired units from the 1950s.
The plant will be primarily fuelled by refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and coal, but it can also use a mixture of fuels and, with a small additional investment, biomass. The amount of RDF can be up to 40% of the total fuel usage. The investment is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of operations and to reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions, such as nitrogen and sulphur oxide emissions. The new power plant complies with high environmental standards and with principles of best available techniques.
New technical solutions significantly reduce the workers' exposure to harmful conditions and decrease the probability of accidents at work for own personnel and contractors. More than 300 contractors' employees work at the construction site every day. About 2,000 workers have received safety training. Thanks to the high safety standards and excellent cooperation between Fortum and the contractors, there has been only one minor accident over the course of 420,000 working hours.

Sustainable energy production

Our energy production is based primarily on carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power and on energy-efficient combined heat and power production. In line with our strategy, we are targeting a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio.
Fortum's power generation in 2016 was 73.1 (2015: 75.9) TWh and heat production 27.8 (2015: 32.2) TWh. 62% (2015: 64%) of our power generation was carbon dioxide-free and 30% (2015: 34%) was produced from renewable energy sources. About 7% (2015: 8%) of our heat production was produced from renewable, carbon-free energy sources.
Power generation and heat production by energy source are presented in the accompanying tables. The tables have been consolidated in accordance with the boundaries applied in financial reporting. The figures for power generation include also production shares in the hydro, wind and nuclear power plants of associated companies.
New, energy-efficient production capacity
In Russia, the second new CHP unit at the Chelyabinsk GRES power plant was completed in March 2016. Fuelled by natural gas,

its electricity production capacity is 248 MW and heat production capacity 174 MW. The first power plant unit of the same size was completed in late 2015.
In Russia, the modernisations of the Nyagan GRES power plant's second unit increased production capacity by about 30 MW in autumn 2016. Similar modernisations of the first unit were completed in autumn 2015.
Construction of the new multi-fuel CHP plant in Zabrze, Poland continued, and the plant is scheduled for completion in 2018. In Russia and Poland, investments will improve the efficiency of electricity and heat production and reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions into the environment with relation to produced energy.
Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland introduced 9.5 MW of new, renewable electricity production capacity. Two high-pressure turbines at the Loviisa nuclear power plant were replaced during the 2016 annual outage and, together with smaller improvements made, increased the electricity capacity by 12 MW.
The 13-MW district cooling project was started in Tartu, Estonia.

Energy production from waste
Fortum acquired the Nordic circular economy company Ekokem Corporation in August 2016. The circular economy business is specialised in waste and material treatment, recycling and combustion, final disposal solutions, soil remediation and environmental construction services.
Fortum's new circular economy business operates hazardous waste treatment and combustion facilities in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The waste-to-electricity capacity in Riihimäki, Finland, is 18 MW and heat production capacity 90 MW, in Kumla, Sweden, 9 MW and 35 MW, respectively, and in Nyborg, Denmark, 16 MW and 19 MW.
More solar energy
Fortum currently has 15 MW of solar capacity in India. Two solar energy projects were launched in India in 2016: the 70-MW Bhadla solar power plant in Rajasthan and the 100-MW Pavagada solar power plant in Karnataka. The projects are expected to be completed in 2017. In addition to the large-scale solar energy plants in India, Fortum offers its customers solar energy kits in the Nordic countries.
Solar power is proceeding in India
Fortum is targeting a gigawatt-scale wind and solar power portfolio. India is the first country we have decided to enter in solar power, as the country offers one of the best solar resources and sound government support for the development of the solar sector. Fortum's ongoing projects will generate about 370 GWh annually and in total will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 350,000 tonnes.
The 70-MW project in Bhadla, Rajasthan, is being executed by Tata Power Solar, which was selected following Fortum's supplier pre-selection process. Both a desk review of Tata's practises as well an audit of its ongoing construction site were carried out to see how Tata would comply with Fortum's requirements. After the work was awarded, both Tata Power Solar's and Fortum's top management participated in person at the project's kick-off meeting in India to emphasise the importance of safety and good working conditions for Fortum.
This project has set an example for good working and living conditions in India: proper employee facilities with kitchen and hygiene stations are provided to the construction employees as well as drinking water and shelters from the sun and heat during employee breaks. The site's EHS procedures are very robust with good access control and training, visual materials and safety talks, as well as supervision and observations with safety walks.

More wind power
Fortum invested actively in wind power in 2016. At the Blaiken wind farm, 22.5 MW of capacity was commissioned, and Fortum's share of ownership was 3.4 MW.

Climate change mitigation

Our vision ­ For a cleaner world ­ defines our ambition to move towards a low-emission energy system and optimal resource efficiency. Our main tools in climate change mitigation are increasing renewable energy production, improving energy efficiency and providing smart energy solutions for our customers.
Climate change is a threat and an opportunity
We believe that our know-how in carbon dioxide-free hydro, nuclear, wind and solar energy, and in energy-efficient CHP production will prove to be a competitive advantage for the company. We expect the concern about climate change to increase the demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient energy products and solutions. Our developing circular economy services also meet this demand, as the use of non-recyclable waste in energy production replaces fossil fuel and reduces the formation of greenhouse gases at landfills.
Our operations are exposed to physical risks caused by climate change, including changes in weather patterns that could alter energy demand and, for instance, hydropower production volumes. Higher precipitation and temperatures may affect hydropower production, dam safety, and bioenergy supply and availability. In addition to climate change mitigation, we are also adapting our operations to the changing climate and taking it into consideration, for example, in production planning and in evaluating growth projects.
Towards low-emissions production
In Europe, we produce carbon dioxide-free electricity with hydro, nuclear and wind power and at combined heat and power (CHP) plants that utilise biomass, bio liquids and waste-derived fuels. In the EU area, 96% (2015: 97%) of our electricity production was carbon-free in 2016. The rest of the electricity was produced mainly with coal. We produce solar power in India.
Our electricity production in Russia is based entirely on fossil fuels, mainly on natural gas. Our new plant units in Russia are

based on gas turbine technology, which represents the best available technology in natural gas combustion. 62% (2015: 64%) of our total electricity production was carbon dioxide-free.
The following projects, among others, directly or indirectly reducing carbon dioxide emissions were completed in 2016: · Refurbishment of Chelyabinsk CHP-3 unit's gas turbine in Russia · Replacement of two high-pressure turbines at Loviisa nuclear
power plant in Finland · Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland · Optimisation of energy production and a new thermal energy
storage at Suomenoja power plant in Finland · Replacement of the heavy fuel oil with wood pellets at the
Kivenlahti heat plant in Espoo, Finland · Implementation of new district cooling in Tartu, Estonia We have calculated that these projects will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 48,000 tonnes.
Sustainable energy production section describes the power plants under construction and the decided new power plant projects.
Climate-benign products and services
We offer our customers a range of energy products and services to help them improve their energy efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint: · CO2-free electricity products · Real-time monitoring and optimisation of electricity consumption · Solar panel kits · Electric vehicle charging systems We are expanding our offering also by investing in startups that are developing new technologies. For example, in 2016 we invested in Chempolis, a company developing biorefining technology in Finland, and Exeger, a company developing innovative solar cell solutions in Sweden.
Fortum HorsePower is a service concept in which Fortum delivers bedding to horse stables and picks up the bedding-manure

mixture for combustion. In 2016, bedding-manure mixture was collected from about 80 horse stables in southern Finland. Fortum combusts the bedding-manure mixture at the Järvenpää CHP plant, and it was delivered also to other energy companies.
The Joensuu bio-oil plant produced bio-oil, of which majority was used in a heat plant at Joensuu power plant area and at the Vermo heat plant in Espoo, Finland.
Emissions trading
Over 88% of carbon dioxide emissions from our energy production in Finland, Poland and the Baltic countries is within the sphere of the EU's emissions trading scheme. We had a total of 45 (2015: 48) plants in four member countries within the EU's emissions trading scheme in 2016. Fortum was granted free emission allowances corresponding to 1.0 (2015: 1.3) million tonnes in 2016. Our carbon dioxide emissions within the EU's emissions trading scheme were 2.7 (2015: 2.1) million tonnes. So, in terms of the emissions allowances, we had a deficit and had to purchase the shortfall of emissions allowances from the markets.
Fortum's view is that emissions trading is the most cost-efficient way to achieve emissions targets. In our view, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as a mechanism has functioned as planned, and it should be the key means for realising the EU climate targets also in the future. A revision of the EU's emissions trading directive for 2021-2030 was reviewed by the Parliament and the Commission in 2016, and the directive is expected to be approved during 2017.
We also want to promote the establishment of a global carbon pricing and carbon market. Fortum has signed the Carbon Price Communiqué, an international business statement for setting a price on carbon emissions. We also participate in several international business initiatives promoting the role of business in climate change mitigation. These include the UN Global Compact's Caring for Climate initiative and the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition initiative. In Finland, Fortum is a member of the Climate Leadership Council.

Carbon funds
Fortum is a participant in the international Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) climate fund. In 2016, we received a total of about 10,000 CER emission reduction units from this fund. So far, we have received a total of 1,250,000 emission reduction units, and we estimate that we will still receive about 145,000 units during the PCF's operating period.
Fortum's position on the development of the EU climate policy
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 totalled 23.6 (2015: 24.1) million tonnes. Scope 1 emissions were 18.8 million tonnes, Scope 2 emissions 0.1 million tonnes, and Scope 3 emissions 4.7 million tonnes.
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported on a pro forma basis and the figures of the comparison years have not been adjusted because of partially insufficient data. We have estimated that, taking the divestment of the Tobolsk power plant into consideration, greenhouse gas emissions from continuing operations increased in 2016 by about 2.5 million tonnes as a result of the commissioning of the Chelyabinsk GRES power plant's new units, the Meri-Pori power plant's increased condensation power production, and the acquisition of Ekokem.
Direct greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 1
The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions was generated from the use of fossil fuels in electricity and heat production. A small amount of emissions is generated from the use of company vehicles and leaks related to the natural gas distribution.
Our direct greenhouse emissions were 18.8 (2015: 19.3) million CO2-equivalent tonnes. The share of carbon dioxide from our direct greenhouse gas emissions was 99%. The share of direct greenhouse gas emissions from our total greenhouse gas emissions was 79%.
Of the direct carbon dioxide emissions, 83% (2015: 89%) originated from the Russian operations and 10% (2015: 7%) from Finland. Fortum's direct biogenic carbon dioxide emissions were 1.3 (2015: 1.3) million tonnes.

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions covers carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFCs) and SF6. Carbon dioxide emissions as well as methane and nitrous oxide emissions have been calculated on the basis of plant-specific fuel data. The amounts of HFC compounds and SF6 are reported on the basis of the amounts of gas added to the equipment. Specific emission factors of gases are based on IPCC publications.
Indirect greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 2
Greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity purchased for our own use were 95,500 (2015: 85,400) tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent. Carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 99.5% of this. The share of Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions of our total greenhouse gas emissions was 0.4%.
57% of Scope 2 emissions have been estimated on the basis of information received from electricity suppliers. The rest has been

estimated on the basis of country-specific breakdowns of electricity production because electricity supplier-specific greenhouse gas emissions data was not received from Russia in particular.
Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 3
The majority of our Scope 3 emissions are caused by the production and transportation of fuels, the purchases of goods and services, and investments. The transportation of customer waste also creates greenhouse gas emissions. Other activities (e.g. employee travel and waste management) account for less than 1%.
Our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 were an estimated 4.7 (2015: 4.7) million tonnes. The share of Scope 3 emissions was 20.1% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate that all our Scope 3 greenhouse gases come from fossil energy sources.
We report Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the requirements of the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting standard. The volumes describing

the scope of the various activities have been obtained from our monitoring and reporting system.
About 20% (2015: 37%) of the purchases were excluded from the purchasing categories defined by Fortum's Procurement function, due to insufficient reporting. The emissions for these are estimated with the average emissions factor of the specified purchasing categories. The specific emission factors used in calculating the greenhouse gas emissions are based on different literature sources.
Specific carbon dioxide emissions
Our specific carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1) from total energy production were 184 (2015: 181) g/kWh. The five-year average, including 2016, was 188 (2015: 191) g/kWh, which is below the target of 200 g/kWh.
Our specific carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1) from power production in the EU were 28 (2015: 21) g/kWh. The specific carbon dioxide emissions from our power production, measured as gCO2/kWh, are low compared to other European power producers. Our specific emissions in 2015 were about 7% of the 311 g/kWh average specific emissions of major European utilities.
Including our Russian power production, our specific emissions in 2016 were 173 (2015: 166) g/kWh. Our specific emissions in 2015 were about 54% of the average level of European utilities. European reference data for 2016 is not yet available.

The boundary for electricity production's specific carbon dioxide emissions differs from other environmental reporting. Fortum's production shares in associated companies are also included. This production is based on hydro, wind and nuclear power and doesn't cause direct carbon dioxide emissions.
In the calculation of electricity production's specific emissions, CHP plant emissions have been allocated for electricity and heat using the efficiency method presented in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidelines, with heat production efficiency of 90% and electricity production efficiency of 40%.

Improving energy efficiency

Energy efficiency is a key factor in energy production ­ from both an economic and environmental perspective. Improving energy efficiency at power plants refers to measures we implement to increase the efficiency of production processes or reduce the energy consumption of plants or equipment. This enables us to produce more electricity or heat for our customers without increasing fuel consumption.
The energy efficiency of power plants can be increased through investments and technical improvements, preventive maintenance, and by training personnel in the optimal operation of the plant and in monitoring the plant's operating economy. Improving power plant availability also increases energy efficiency, as unplanned plant start-ups are reduced.
Energy-efficiency investments
In fuel-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel's energy as efficiently as possible. Our most important means to improve the energy efficiency of fuel use is to increase combined heat and power (CHP) production. In CHP production, up to 90% of the energy content of the fuels can be utilised. Separate electricity production's efficiency is about 60% at best.
In March 2016, we commissioned a second natural gas-powered CHP unit at our Chelyabinsk GRES power plant in Russia.
Also several new projects have been implemented at the Loviisa nuclear power plant after 2012 to increase the efficiency of the plant units. The most recent and most significant was the replacement of two high-pressure turbines. With these replacements and other smaller improvements, the Loviisa power plant can produce about 98 GWh more electrical energy in an average year.

In addition, other projects to improve energy efficiency were completed in 2016, among them: · Refurbishment of Chelyabinsk CHP-3 unit's gas turbine in
Russia, 50 GWh · Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland,
30 GWh · Optimisation of energy production and a new thermal energy
storage at Suomenoja power plant in Finland, 40 GWh The energy-efficiency improvement projects are calculated to yield an annual energy savings of about 245 GWh.
Target within reach
Fortum is participating in the European electricity sector's Energy Wisdom programme. We report to the programme on significant projects that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. Fortum's target is to achieve an annual energy savings of more than 1,400 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012. By the end of 2016, about 1,372 GWh or 98% of the target set for 2020, had been reached.
In 2015, we reported 1,240 GWh for achieved energy savings. The corrected energy savings in 2015 was 1,127 GWh, because some of the energy efficiency projects planned for years 2014 and 2015 in Russia were postponed for implementation at a later date.
Energy-efficiency services for homes
Fortum has introduced energy-efficiency services for private customers in Finland and Sweden. Fortum's customers can, for instance, control and optimise the heating of their homes based on electricity price and demand or they can monitor energy consumption with an in-home display.

Energy efficiency services for businesses
Fortum's operation and maintenance services have been improving the energy efficiency of our customers' power plants already for decades. Our energy-efficiency services and expertise also bring our customers financial benefits and save the environment. We made advancements to the service in 2016, such as instead of an individual power plant, we can examine the development of a broader area, such as power and heat plants of a city or a company, and the profitability and environmental impacts of investments related to them.

Energy intensity
In 2016, our fuel consumption in electricity and heat production was 111 (2015: 116) TWh, or 398 (2015: 417) PJ. Additionally, we acquired 460 (2015: 398) GWh of electricity from external electricity suppliers. With these energy resources, we produced 35,970 GWh of electricity, 27,185 GWh of heat, 20 GWh of cooling, and 5 GWh of bio-oil. The total energy consumption, calculated as the difference between the procured energy resources and net production, was 47,900 GWh, or 172 (2015: 178) PJ.
In combustion-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel as efficiently as possible. In 2016, our average fuel use efficiency was 64% (2015: 64%). The efficiency has been calculated by dividing the electricity and heat energy produced with the fuel by the energy content of the fuel used in the production.
The energy intensity of our own production was 1.40 (2015: 1.33). The intensity figure has been calculated by dividing the amount of used energy resources by the total net production of energy products, including hydropower, wind power and solar power.
Fuel consumption
The most significant fuel was natural gas, which accounted for 62% (2015: 65%) of the total fuel consumption. The next highest fuel use was uranium 23% (2015: 22%) and coal 10% (2015: 9%).
Russia's share of our total fuel use was about 66%. Russia accounted for 98% of our use of natural gas and 51% of our use of coal.
Biomass and bioliquids accounted for 2.6% (2015: 2.7%) of our total fuel consumption and wastederived fuels accounted for 1.5% (2015: 0.6%). The share of waste-derived fuels grew due to the acquisition of Ekokem. In the implementation of our new strategy, we will maximise the added value from waste and biomass.
The energy-specific fuel consumption has been calculated based on the usage volumes and fuelspecific caloric values measured at the power plants. Uranium consumption has been calculated as the thermal heat generation in the reactors.

Circular economy
Climate change, urbanisation, population growth, and limited natural resources are examples of megatrends shaping the world. These megatrends are pushing us to maximise the efficient use of resources, such as waste and biomass. Fortum has long experience in the recycling and reuse of waste
Received and processed waste from our customers in 2016
Recovery of matEeFnrinieaarlgsl :yd6irs6epckootsv(aealr:syh1:9,51p6kl9taskttic, oil,

and by-products from power and heat production. As a part of our new strategy, we have expanded our business portfolio to include also circular economy services for our customers. For us, the circular economy means that materials are recycled as much as possible and hazardous substances are removed from circulation.
In August 2016, we acquired the Nordic circular economy company Ekokem Corporation, which provides environmental management and material efficiency services. In December 2016, we also acquired the Swedish waste management company Turebergs Recycling AB, which has long experience in the treatment and recycling of incinerated bottom ash from waste-to-energy plants.
Waste management services
Efficient and reliable waste management is important in a society based on sustainability. Fortum's aim is to promote the transition towards a more extensive circular economy. We offer waste management services for customers in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Lithuania.
In 2016, we received a total of 396,300 tonnes of non-hazardous waste and 239,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from our customers. As much of the waste stream as possible is recycled, recovered or reused. Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse as a material is incinerated in waste-to-energy plants.
For additional information about our energy production, see the section Sustainable energy production.
Recovery of materials
Various types of waste can be reused as raw materials. In 2016, of the waste and by-products received from our customers, we recovered as materials about 65,900 tonnes; ash accounted for 28,000 tonnes of that amount and processed new raw materials and products 17,700 tonnes. In addition, Fortum recycled about 244,800 tonnes of materials originating from its own energy production plants.

The Circular Economy Village
In June 2016, the Circular Economy Village was inaugurated in Riihimäki, Finland. The Circular Economy Village is a refinery complex developed by Ekokem, which Fortum acquired in 2016.
In the village, municipal waste is processed through the Eco Refinery, an automated sorting plant, the Plastic Refinery, the first in Finland to produce recycled plastic, and the Bio Refinery, which produces biogas and is owned by our partner Gasum. The concept of the Circular Economy Village is unique, both nationally and internationally.
Once fully operational, the Eco Refinery of the Circular Economy Village will annually receive around 100,000 tonnes of municipal waste, from which the refinery will separate biowaste (about 30% of the waste), plastic (4%), metal (3%) and recovered fuel suitable for industrial use (50%). The remaining amount is reject, which is not suitable for recovery.
The biowaste will be turned into biogas and fertilisers, and the plastic and metal into recycled raw material for industry. The reject will be used to generate electricity and district heat in our waste-to-energy plants in Riihimäki.
The Circular Economy Village is a pioneer in future waste management. The principle is that waste should be utilized as a raw material when it is economically viable. The strict targets of the Circular Economy Package adopted by the European Commission will not be achieved without recycling solutions like these.

We are continuously developing activities that increase the proportion of waste materials kept in circulation: · We refine new plastic out of waste plastic received from
customers. In October 2016, we launched CIRCO, our recycled plastic product family. · We pick up and process our customers' waste oils to be refined and reused as industrial lubricants · We recycle scrap metals generated in the maintenance activities of our power plants and other facilities. We also recover and separate metals from customers' municipal waste and slag. · We process ash, sand, sludge, dredging masses and slurries from energy production and other industries for reuse in various types of environmental construction and earthwork.

Hazardous waste treatment
We take hazardous waste out of circulation in a sustainable manner by offering solutions to treat hazardous waste while also producing clean energy and ensuring a safe final disposal. High-temperature incineration ensures the best available solution for the destruction of unwanted substances.
We have three high-temperature incineration plants in the Nordics. These plants for hazardous waste are located in Riihimäki, Finland; Kumla, Sweden; and Nyborg, Denmark. At these facilities, we incinerated 114,200 tonnes of hazardous waste and 198,000 of non-hazardous waste in 2016, producing electricity and district heating for the surrounding areas.
Contaminated soil
In 2016, we received about 99,400 tonnes of contaminated soil from our customers. We directed metal, rocks, concrete and wood, sieved from the soil for reuse as raw materials. Soil that is suitable for construction is used at our own construction sites and industrial waste reception centres. In addition, we treated about 161,000 tonnes of contaminated soil at customer sites.

Biodiversity

The degradation of biodiversity is one of the biggest environmental problems globally. We need to know our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystem services to be able to assess the related risks and opportunities.
Our impacts on biodiversity
Fortum's impacts on biodiversity are primarily related to its hydropower production operations in Finland and Sweden. Hydropower construction and the related water regulation alter the conditions in water systems and thus impact the diversity of the aquatic habitat and, in particular, the fish population. Emissions from fossil fuel-based energy production may decrease local biodiversity, especially in Russia. In addition, our fuel procurement may have a negative impact on biodiversity. However, our production of CO2-free energy replaces fossil fuel-based energy production and thus mitigates climate change, which is globally one of the greatest threats to biodiversity.
Fortum's biodiversity engagement
Fortum's Biodiversity guidelines set the principles for taking biodiversity into consideration and for managing the biodiversity impacts of the company's operations. Since 2014, we have participated in the activities of the Finnish Business & Society's (FiBS) Business and Biodiversity programme.
Sustainable use of biomass fuels has been actively debated in recent years. Fortum's position is that EU-wide, harmonised and binding sustainability criteria for all bioenergy is needed. The EU Commission's proposal to extend the existing sustainability criteria for bioliquids to cover also solid biomass and biogas is in line with Fortum's position. The proposal is included in the EU Commission's legislative "Smart and Clean Energy Package" published on 30 November 2016.

Fortum is a member of the Bettercoal initiative and uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain. Biodiversity aspects related to coal mining are covered in Bettercoal assessments.
We aim to minimise our negative impact on biodiversity, and we assess the impacts of our new projects. We offset and reduce the impacts of hydropower production on biodiversity by stocking and over-dam transferring fish and through voluntary environmental projects. In Sweden, we carry out biodiversity-related projects with the financing from our eco-labelled (Bra Miljöval) electricity.
Habitat restoration and other projects
Most of our habitat restorations and other projects improving biodiversity are related to hydropower production. The listing and additional information of hydropower-related projects supporting biodiversity is available on our website.
Restoring river stretches by tearing down dams In Sweden, we have mapped out the old dams that have low value for hydropower production, but have environmental impacts on riverine ecosystems. The aim is to restore habitats and river continuum in places with benefits for biodiversity. In 2016, two such projects were initiated. Our application to tear down the Acksjön dam in a tributary of the River Klarälven is pending in environmental court. Our application for the Kolsjön dam removal is under preparation.
Enhancing natural reproduction of migratory fish populations In Finland, a migratory fish project continued in 2016 in cooperation with local stakeholders at River Oulujoki. Fortum has hydropower production on the River Oulujoki. We transported

salmon spawners to the reproduction areas at tributaries, we supported the salmon and sea trout population with releases of young fish, and we followed up the migratory fish population. We also started construction of a permanent structure for trapping fish by the Montta hydropower plant in order to transport them to the reproduction areas upstream.
Restoring a wetland In the River Dalälven area in Sweden, we took part in financing the restoration of a rich wetland, Ambrick, which is partly on Fortum's property. The area is 23 hectares. The area was opened up by clearing small trees and bushes, and the restoration will continue in 2017. The area hosts different kinds of endangered species of plants, like orchids, and birds, like curlew.
Biomass fuels actions Existing forest certification schemes will continue to play a strong role in verifying sustainability of woody biomass. We annually collect data on the volume of certified wood-based biomass fuel used in our power plants in Finland, Sweden, Poland and the Baltics. Certified wood-based biomass fuel originates from sustainably managed forests in which special attention is paid to biodiversity. In 2017, Fortum will assess the possibility to obtain a Chain of Custody certificate for its wood-based biomass fuel purchasing.

Emissions into air

Fortum's activities cause various emissions into air. Greenhouse gases that accelerate global climate change are generated primarily from the use of fossil fuels and the combustion of waste of a fossil origin. Possible gas leaks during the transport of liquid natural gas and the piping of natural gas also impact climate change.
Flue-gas emissions causing local environmental and health effects are generated from all incineration. Nitrogen oxides are generated from the nitrogen contained in the fuel and in the combustion air. Sulphur dioxide, in turn, is generated from the sulphur that is an impurity in, e.g., coal, peat and oil. Particle emissions are fine-grained ash generated primarily in the combustion of solid fuels and waste. Depending on the origin of the fuel and waste, the particles contain various heavy metals.
World-class air pollution control
It is possible to decrease nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle emissions through fuel selections and various flue-gas cleaning technologies. Fortum has world-class know-how in combustion technology, and we have delivered combustion technology solutions to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to many other power utilities. During 2016 we supplied burner projects to Estonian, Swedish, Romanian and Polish customers.
Our Meri-Pori and Suomenoja power plants are equipped with a desulphurisation plant. The scrubber and bag filter that we are constructing for the new Zabrze CHP plant in Poland will reduce emissions into air.
Our plants incinerating hazardous waste are located in Riihimäki Finland, Kumla Sweden, and Nyborg Denmark, and are equipped with efficient flue-gas cleaning systems. Harmful

emissions to air are minimised with various filters and scrubbers selected on the basis of the waste to be incinerated.
Stricter standards
The EU has set very strict limits for flue-gas emissions; meeting the requirements necessitates the use of best available technology (BAT). Our nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle emissions have, in fact, decreased significantly in our European production over the past decades. Emissions limits became even stricter when the Industrial Emissions Directive came into force in 2016.
All Fortum power plants operate in compliance with the terms of their environmental permits, and the plants meet the new emissions requirements, for the most part. Investments in flue-gas cleaning processes and systems will be made in upcoming years at the Suomenoja power plant in Finland and the Rejtana heat plant in Poland.
At Russian power plants, emissions are limited in accordance with Russian legislation. The new legislation currently being drafted in Russia will bring stricter emissions standards in the future.
Flue-gas emissions
Our sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions were 22,500 (2015: 19,900) t, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions 26,000 (2015: 26,800) t and particle emissions 16,800 (17,800) t. 81% (2015: 77%) of sulphur dioxide, 82% (2015: 84%) of nitrogen oxide and 98% (2015: 98%) of particle emissions originated from Russian power plants. In 2016, the most significant source of particle emissions, 9,100 (2015: 12,700) t, was the Argayash power plant in Russia. Particle emissions decreased,

because three boilers at the Argayash power plant were equipped with a scrubber to reduce flue-gas emissions.
The reporting of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particle emissions from our European power plants is based on continuous measurement. Other flue-gas emissions data is based on discontinuous measurements or are calculated using fuel consumption data and specific emission factors. Specific emission factors are based on measurements taken at regular intervals, on information from the equipment supplier, or on regulatory norms.
We are reporting heavy metals more extensively for 2016, due to the new waste incineration business. Carbon dioxide emissions are reported in the section Greenhouse gas emissions

Water use

Fortum uses large volumes of water at various types of power plants and in district heat networks. In most cases, our power plants do not consume water, but the water is discharged back to the same water system from where it was withdrawn. The properties of the water may change in the process, but the volume of the water generally remains unchanged. In some cases, water is transferred to another recipient, e.g. through evaporation into the air from cooling towers, leaks into the ground from district heat piping, or through the discharge of wastewater to a municipal sewage system.
Hydropower production is a special case of water use. Water flowing in a river is conducted through a turbine to generate electricity. No water is consumed nor are the properties of the water altered in the process. However, the water system is often regulated for hydropower production, and the regulation changes the water flow and level patterns compared to their natural state. Fortum does not report water flows in rivers as water use related to hydropower production.
Cooling water
Condensing power production requires large volumes of cooling water. Cooling water accounts over 90% of Fortum's total water withdrawal annually.
Fortum's condensing power plants in Finland, the Loviisa nuclear power plant and the Meri-Pori power plant, are located in coastal areas and use direct seawater cooling. No water is consumed in the process and the water withdrawn is discharged back into the sea. The only change is an approximately 10 °C increase in the temperature of the cooling water.
Condensing power is occasionally produced also at our CHP plants. In most cases, the cooling water is withdrawn from a local

water system. In Russia and Poland, cooling towers are used, so some of the cooling water evaporates into the atmosphere.
District heating network
Fortum is a major supplier of district heating in Finland, Russia, Poland and the Baltic countries. Fortum has a total of about 2,800 kilometres of district heat pipes in these countries. Water is used as the heat transfer media in the district heat networks. Some water is lost through leaks that occur in the pipes, so occasionally water must be added to the district heating network.
Process water and other water uses
A thermal power plant needs water in the water-steam cycle when electricity is generated with a steam turbine. Because of leaks in the pipes, occasionally water must be added to the water-steam cycle. Water is also needed in some auxiliary processes, for example in flue-gas desulphurisation with wet scrubber technology, and in liquid radioactive waste handling and storage at nuclear power plants.

Water withdrawal
The majority of Fortum's power and heat production capacity is located in Finland, Sweden, Russia and Poland. Our thermal power plants and hydropower plants are not located in a water critical area in any of our operating countries. The Baltic Sea and local fresh water systems are the most important water sources for our plants. Municipal tap water is used mainly at CHP plants in major cities. In some cases, water is acquired from a near-by industrial facility of another company.
Water is used to clean solar panels at our Indian solar power plants. Even though the water volumes are relatively small, alternative water sources and purification methods are being explored in India.
We withdrew a total of 2,322 (2015: 2,138) million m3 of water in 2016. Seawater accounted for about 66% of this amount.
Of the water we withdrew, we used the majority, 2,228 (2015: 2,060) million m3, as cooling water. The Loviisa nuclear power plant withdrew from and discharged to the sea 1,339 million m3 of cooling water.

The reported water withdrawal and water use volumes are based on measurements and on calculations of water consumption.
Wastewater
Wastewater generated at our power plants is either treated at the power plants' own wastewater treatment plant and discharged into a water system or it is piped to a municipal wastewater system for further processing. In Russia, the wet method is used to pump ash from power plants into ash ponds. Part of the water from the ponds is recycled back to the power plant and part is released into a water system after sedimentation.
Wastewater contains solids and nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphor, and heavy metals. Wastewater effluents can impact local water quality as well as the nutrient and oxygen balance of the water system.
Our plants generated a total of 46 (2015: 34) million m3 of wastewater, of which 97% was released into the environment after being treated and 3% was piped to municipal wastewater treatment plants.

About 0.9 (2015: 1.2) tonnes of oil was released into water systems with wastewater. In addition, 0.63 tonnes of oil was released into rivers from hydropower plants. Hydropower plant reporting was further defined in 2016.
The thermal load discharged into water systems with cooling water was 17 (2015: 17) TWh. The Loviisa nuclear power plant's share of this was 16 TWh. Temperature measurements indicate that the cooling water has increased the temperature of surface water by 1­2 °C within a 1-2 kilometre radius from the discharge point. The reported wastewater is based on measurements and calculations.
NURES products for purifying radioactive waters
Initially developed for the needs of the Loviisa nuclear power plant, the NURES products are a unique solution for purifying radioactive waters. A selective ion exchange material purifies liquid waste more efficiently than any other alternative on the market. In 2016, we continued NURES deliveries to our customers around the world, including Finland, Japan, North America and Great Britain.

Waste and by-products

Ash is a by-product of the use of fuels, and gypsum and other desulphurisation products are by-products of flue-gas desulphurisation. Ash and desulphurisation products account for a more than 90% share, on average, of the by-products and waste from our energy production.
Power plant maintenance generates scrap metal and other conventional industrial waste and, to a smaller extent, waste oil and other hazardous waste. We aim to recycle by-products and waste, whenever possible. The waste management service providers we use are properly licensed and reliable waste management companies.
In addition to conventional industrial waste, the Loviisa nuclear power plant also generates radioactive waste, which we treat in accordance with the requirements of Finnish nuclear energy legislation. The volume of radioactive waste generated is small, but special solutions are needed in their treatment and final disposal.
The total volume of by-products and waste generated at Fortum's power and heat plants in 2016 was about 735,000 (2015: 601,000) tonnes. Of this volume, 37% was recycled or reused.
Ash and gypsum
Ash is created in the combustion of all solid fuels. Over half of the ash from our plants operating in Europe is utilised as a raw material, e.g. for the construction industry, road construction and soil improvement, and as backfill. Ash from the power plants in Russia is stored in ash basins, because there is no demand for wet ash sludge in Russia.
Coal-fired power plants generate either a wet or semi-dry desulphurisation by-product. Gypsum created as a by-product in the wet desulphurisation process at the Meri-Pori power plant in Finland is suitable for use as raw material for the construction industry, and in 2016 all the gypsum was utilised. The desulphurisation product created at the Suomenoja power plant is not suitable for utilisation.
In 2016, about 695,000 (2015: 570,000) tonnes of ash, 8,500 (2015: 2,300) tonnes of gypsum, and 12,700 (2015: 8,800) tonnes

of other desulphurisation product were generated. The growth in volumes of ash and gypsum was a result of increased coal use in Finland and Russia. About 52% of the ash was generated at Russian plants, 19% in Finland and 12% in Poland. The ash recycling rate was 37% (2015: 33%) and the gypsum recycling rate 100% (2015: 100%).
Any remaining by-products that cannot be utilised are transported to the appropriate final disposal areas for landfilling. In 2016, about 453,000 (2015: 390,000) tonnes of by-products were transported for landfilling, or in Russia for ash basins.
The reported volumes of ash and gypsum from our European power plants are based on the weighing of the truckloads. Ash volumes at our Russian power plants are calculated on the basis of the ash content of the coal.
Radioactive waste
At the Loviisa nuclear power plant, low-level radioactive maintenance waste and intermediate-level radioactive waste are stored in Loviisa's final repository. In 2016, 13.9 (2015: 10.5) tonnes of lowlevel radioactive waste went into final disposal. Intermediate-level radioactive liquid is generated mainly from spent ion exchange resins and wastewater from the controlled area. Liquid waste is processed to solid form before final disposal. In 2016, a new solidification plant for liquid radioactive waste started operation.
High-level spent nuclear fuel is stored in interim storage at the Loviisa power plant site. In 2016, 19.6 (2015: 21.8) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from Loviisa power plant's reactors.

Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima have established Posiva Oy to handle the technical implementation of the final disposal of the spent fuel, and final disposal is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the first half of the 2020s.
Other waste
Other, conventional waste generated during the operation and maintenance of power and heat plants is sorted, and waste that can be recycled, such as metal, is sent for further processing. Hazardous waste is delivered to licensed hazardous waste treatment facilities.
Our operations in power and heat plants generated a total of 31,900 (2015: 27,200) tonnes of other waste, approximately 2,700 (2015: 1,700) tonnes of which was hazardous waste. In addition, about 20 tonnes of contaminated soil was removed. The reported volumes of other waste are based mainly on the information provided by the waste management companies.
Waste reception, recycling and reuse
Fortum's new circular economy business receives, processes and reuses customer waste for material recycling and energy production in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. Waste recycling services are reviewed in more detail in the section Circular economy.

Environmental noncompliances and incidents

Environmental non-compliances and incidents

At the Group level, we monitor the number of major EHS incidents, which, in part, reflects the quality of environmental management. In 2016, there were 22 (2015: 18) major EHS incidents. 12 of these were significant environmental incidents, including spills of over 100 litres into the environment, significant environmental permit violations, and other environmental non-compliances having a significant impact on environment.
Spills and other significant environmental non-compliances
In 2016, there was one (2015: 2) spill of more than 100 litres into the environment. The spill occurred in autumn 2016. The incident involved a spill of hydraulic oil into the River Klarälven at a hydropower plant in Sweden. The incident did not have significant environmental impacts.
Significant environmental permit violations
There were 11 (2015: 14) environmental permit violations in 2016, and 9 of them occurred in Russia. Eight permit violations at the Russian power plants involved exceeding the wastewater emission limits. One permit violation involved exceeding the annual licence of heavy oil at the Tyumen power plant in Russia. At the waste combustion plant in Denmark, there was one wastewater discharge limit violation and one environmental permit violation related to the storage of waste.
Environmental enquiries and grievances
Power plants receive environmental enquiries and other contacts every year, and they are mainly handled locally. The aim is to communicate in advance about upcoming measures with possible environmental impacts e.g. through local media and at public events.
Fortum's website also has a grievance channel that our stakeholders can use to report problems possibly caused by our operations. No new environment-related grievances were reported to us through this channel in 2016.

Fines
In 2016, Fortum paid fines totalling RUB 1.782 million (EUR 24,120) for permit violations involving exceeding the wastewater emission limits and RUB 136,000 (EUR 1,840) for permit violations involving heavy oil use in Russia.

Security of supply
An uninterrupted and reliable energy supply is critical for society to function. With planned preventive maintenance and condition monitoring, we ensure that our power plants operate reliably to produce the electricity and heat customers need.
Power plant availability
We measure the availability of our CHP and hydropower plants with an energy availability indicator. Energy availability is calculated by dividing the power plant's actual production in the period under review by the theoretical maximum production. Planned maintenance outages are not included in the calculation. If the outage at a CHP plant is longer than planned, it is considered an interruption, which decreases the energy availability. The energy availability of our CHP plants in 2016 was, on average, 97.4% (2015: 96.4%); the target was 95%.
For hydropower plants, outages due to a failure and unplanned or prolonged outages decrease the availability factor only if they lead to spillage. The energy availability of our hydropower plants was 98.7% (2015: 99.2%).
The load factor describing the availability of the Loviisa nuclear power plant is among the highest in the world for VVER­440 type nuclear power plants. The Loviisa nuclear power plant's load factor in 2016 was 91.1% (2015: 92.9%).
Interruptions in gas and heat distribution
In spring 2016 Fortum acquired DUON, a company specialising in electricity and gas distribution. Through this acquisition, we own about 480 km of gas distribution networks and 20 regasification stations in Poland.
Fortum also has about 2,800 km of district heating networks in Finland, Russia, Poland and the Baltic countries. The aim is to keep interruptions in gas and district heat distribution as short as possible by carrying out planned and preventive refurbishment and maintenance activities.

Employees

We are a significant employer in the regions where we have operations. We strive to be a responsible employer that invests in the development and wellbeing of personnel.
In 2016, an average of 7,994 (2015: 8,009) employees worked at Fortum. The highest number of employees was in Russia, 3,814 (2015: 4,180) on average. The average and the year-end total personnel figures include 332 employees who joined Fortum in 2016 mainly through corporate acquisitions, but are not included in the other figures and tables presented in this report. These individuals include the civil contractors working in the Polish DUON Group and the entire personnel of the Swedish Info24 company.
The number of Fortum's permanent employees on 31 December 2016 was 7,473 (2015: 7,522), i.e. 96.1% (2015: 96.0%) of the personnel. Of these, 7,362 (2015: 7,395) were full-time employees and 111 (2015: 127) were part-time employees.
During the year 476 (2015: 375) new employees joined Fortum, and 968 (2015: 650) employment relationships were terminated, 805 of which by the employer. The number of employment relationships terminated due to production and financial reasons was 120. Departure turnover in 2016 was 13.0% (2015: 8.6%). Voluntary departure turnover was 5.6%.
With the acquisition of Ekokem and DUON, 755 new employees joined Fortum. Fortum signed a partnership agreement on the operation and maintenance of power plants and district heating networks with Maintpartner in Finland and Poland. Under the agreement, 341 individuals transferred as existing employees from Fortum to Maintpartner. Other acquisitions and outsourcings decreased the number of personnel by a total of 248 (2015: 184) people.
Contractor employees worked at Fortum sites for a total of approximately 1,113,000 (2015: 1,327,000) days during the year. The figure is based on contractors' hourly logs and on estimates made on the basis of job costs and average hourly rates. The figure has been calculated on the basis of an 8-hour work day.

Equal remuneration
Salary levels at Fortum are compliant with established industry practices in each country, local legislation and labour market agreements. Remuneration is based on the achievement of strategic business targets and the successful implementation of changes. The total remuneration level is based on competence requirements, job performance, and the local market practices with respect to the needs of the different business models.
In 2016 the short-term incentive scheme was renewed with the aim of emphasising in a new way the impacts the operation's and team's or individual's performance have on the variable salary component. In the renewed incentive scheme, the short-term changing salary component depends on the individual's job, and the amount of the final incentive pay depends on the job-based salary level and the combined result of the business unit's and the individual's goals. For the above-mentioned reasons, a male/female comparison of the short-term incentive pay is not expedient.
However, the global human resources data system and the harmonised job grade classification system enables

the examination and reporting of pay equality for the base salary in all our operating countries. Besides the centralised HR data management system, a separate, local, data system is also used in Russia, and therefore the data on Russia's pay equality is reported separately. With the corporate acquisitions made in 2016, the companies merged with Fortum ­ and for which the job grade classification and the integration of the personnel system has just started ­ are not included in the figures.
Our reporting covers all personnel groups except blue-collar workers. A male/female comparison in this group is not done because of the small group sizes. In countries where the number of personnel is small, we have reported these countries collectively

under "Other countries" so that the data are not identifiable. The figures presented are not comparable with last year's figures because the method of calculation has been changed.
In our operating countries, total number of personnel included in the comparison was 2,431, of which 861 (35%) were female. The base salaries of female employees in 2016 were, on average, 17% less than the male base salaries in all personnel groups. Taking the job grade levels into consideration reduces the gap between female and male salaries. Additionally, the years of service of the individuals also contribute to the differences.
In Russia, the difference between female and male salaries was -15% for comparable job grade levels (1,662 individuals).

Employee-employer relations
Fortum's business operations are developed and strengthened in good collaboration with employees. We believe that the successful management of business is built on relationships of trust between management and employees and on the free flow of information. Fortum respects employees' freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
In our operating countries, freedom of association and collective bargaining are guaranteed by law. The exception to this is India, which has not ratified the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention on the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. In India, we comply with the same practices as in other countries of operation, and we do not limit or prohibit the right to freedom of association.
We apply local collective bargaining agreements in compliance with the scope of each respective agreement in all our operating countries. Collective bargaining agreements cover about 85% of Fortum's employees in our main operating countries.
Share of personnel within collective bargaining agreements, by operating country: · Sweden and Russia: 100% · Finland: 100% (except top management) · Estonia: 26% In Latvia, the collective bargaining agreements cover less than 10% of the personnel. There are no collective bargaining agreements in Lithuania and Poland. Employment contracts are based on local legislation and on the company's human resources policy.
Fortum European Council
Fortum European Council (FEC) convenes, as a rule, once a year. FEC is a Europe-level cooperational function in which personnel and employer representatives meet to discuss matters related to Fortum. In 2016, the Fortum European Council (FEC) held a meeting in June in Finland, and personnel representatives from Finland, Sweden, Poland, and Estonia participated. The Council's themed workshops focused on, among other topics, Fortum's new

strategy, the future outlook for the energy industry, occupational safety, management of work-related stress and wellbeing. In addition to Fortum European Council meetings, local level meetings are held several times a year in different countries based on need.
Restructuring situations
In situations of organisational restructuring, we negotiate with personnel representatives in compliance with each country's local legislation and contractual procedures. In situations involving personnel reductions, we want to primarily support the reemployment of the personnel.
In restructuring situations, the length of the obligatory negotiation period depends on the scale of upcoming changes and varies in Fortum's different operating countries. The shortest period for obligatory negotiations is three weeks (Finland) and the longest is 90 days (India). There is no statutory obligatory negotiation period in Sweden, Norway and Lithuania.
The minimum notice period is based on local legislation, collective agreements or employment contracts, which are in harmony with the local legislation and agreements.
In situations involving personnel reductions, we offer outplacement services and, case by case, investigate the possibilities to arrange vocational training in cooperation with local unemployment authorities or service providers. Retraining for employees who continue working is arranged based on organisational and individual needs.
In situations involving personnel reductions, the content of the support package that we offer is decided based on local needs. The financial compensation of the package is usually based on the years of employment at Fortum.
Employee wellbeing
The energy sector is in transition and this reflects also on Fortum's business. We want to support our personnel in the change also by paying special attention to work wellbeing. Personnel wellbeing is a prerequisite for successful and efficient business operations.

ForCARE work wellbeing model
The goal of the work wellbeing model, ForCARE, is to promote the health and occupational safety of our employees by developing the work and work environment and by promoting the functionality of the work community.
The ForCare wellbeing themes in 2016 were "recovery and sleep" and "activeness and energy". The themes were on the agenda at team meetings, and lectures, wellbeing events and activity contests related to these themes were held.
We began using the HeiaHeia online and mobile app in nearly all our operating countries at the beginning of 2016. HeiaHeia offers a wealth of wellness content to motivate users to live a healthier lifestyle, to record physical and wellness activities, to encourage colleagues, and to participate in team-spirit initiatives.
Targeted work wellbeing projects were carried out in the Power Solutions unit, among others. These projects, too, utilised digital health and wellbeing technology, including Firstbeat wellbeing analyses, activity wristbands and the HeiaHeia app.
Energise Your Day got under way
As part of ForCare activities, the Energise Your Day wellbeing programme was launched in autumn 2016. It aims to support and encourage all Fortum employees to maintain and improve their overall wellbeing. Energise Your Day offers ideas and tools for selfmanagement, stress management, recovery, nutrition and physical activity. The programme effectively and flexibly utilises modern coaching methods and tools.
The Energise Your Day programme started with a wellbeing survey. Based on the results of the survey, everyone is offered wellbeing services, such as lectures and coaching clinics. Additionally, occupational healthcare offers employees surveybased, targeted support and services based on individual needs.
The Energise Your Day work wellbeing programme is being piloted in Finland and will later be expanded to our other operating countries.

Early-support model
We promote wellbeing at the workplace also through what is called an early-support model. We increase open communication between employees and supervisors by discussing and mapping the reasons for absences. Managerial knowhow in working capacity management is strengthened through Manage Working Capacity MASTER training.
Occupational safety committee and workplace wellbeing
Workplace wellbeing and occupational safety are organised in our operating countries in line with local legislative requirements.
The occupational safety committees represent all personnel groups, and they regularly address issues related to work safety and workplace wellbeing.
All our employees are within the sphere of occupational health care. We emphasise the significance of preventive activities in promoting wellbeing in the company. The occupational health care costs per person in Finland, before the share reimbursed by Kela (The Social Insurance Institution of Finland), were EUR 460 (2015: 509).
Fortum conducts regular examinations of its personnel in accordance with local laws. Employees who in their work are exposed to e.g. noise, dust, radiation or who perform shift work are within the sphere of the examinations. Occupational health care also participates in various discussions and assessments in the work community. The occupational health care professionals support supervisors by providing information on preventive actions as well as alternatives when the ability to work decreases. Occupational health care also offers methods and tools for these situations.
Sick-leave absences, occupational diseases and average age of retirement
At Fortum the rate of absence due to sickness was 2.3% (2015: 2.4%), which is lower than the average in the energy sector. This figure has become more defined from the one presented in the interim report and the operating and financial review (2.4%).

For males, the rate of absence due to sickness was 2.1% (2015: 2.2%) and for females 3.0% (2015: 3.0%). The sickness absence rate is calculated based on the reported working hours of the permanent employees.
In 2016 the rate of absence due to sickness (2.4%) was adopted as a new Group-level indicator to measure employee wellbeing. The management of sick-leave absences and particularly the early-support for managers in the management of illness-related absences and other working capacity challenges were among our focus areas in 2016. The goal for 2017 is to keep the sicness absence rate at the previous year's level.
There were 8 (2015: 8) cases of suspected occupational diseases in Finland; five were related to noise and three were related to asbestos. Four of the suspected noise-related cases were determined to be non-occupational and investigations are still underway for one case. All three suspected asbestos-related cases were determined to be occupational diseases and compensated as such. All the cases of suspected occupational diseases involved males.
An indication of the good management level of working capacity and work wellbeing at Fortum is the average retirement

Employee development
Fortum encourages its employees to continuously develop their knowledge, skills and competencies. To support this, we have focused on developing leadership and organisational culture through a coaching approach. The coaching approach increases participative management, which encourages employee accountability in their work. One of the key elements in the coaching approach is the giving and receiving of feedback.
Leadership coaching and induction
There were three programmes under way in 2016 to develop the leadership and organisational culture of managers: · Leadership Impact coaching · MASTER Growing Leader training · Fortum Navigator development programme A total of 113 managers took part in these programmes in 2016.
New employees go through an induction programme, part of which is Fortum Passport, the online on-boarding programme. In 2016 there were 100 (2015: 131) employees who learned about Fortum's operations through the Fortum Passport programme.
The sustainability online training targeting all personnel was updated in 2016. The online training is also part of the Fortum Passport programme.

Fortum Sound personnel survey
The Fortum Sound personnel survey is conducted every other year. The response rate to the survey conducted in October 2016 climbed to 87% (2014: 84%). The results indicate that 70% of the employees feel a commitment to the company (2014: 70%).
Based on the survey results, the personnel feel that overall wellbeing is at a good level and sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's operations. Also the level of leadership was considered good, although the results in this area varied greatly by unit.
The most important development targets emerging from the survey were communications, customer insight, agility and innovation. These areas were a focus in 2016 through the launch of the so-called must-win battle development programmes to increase customer-centricity, speed and agility. Additionally, the Fortum Dialogue events between management and employees were continued.

Performance and development discussions support the achievement of targets and professional growth
Employee development is supported through the annual performance and development discussions; all employees are within the scope of the annual discussions. The main target of the performance and development discussion is to ensure that the employee has clear targets that align with the business as well as the competencies supporting the achievement of the targets and professional growth.
The achievement of the targets forms the basis for payment of incentives. All employees who have a minimum of three months of employment in Fortum are within the scope of Fortum's incentive plan.

Safety and security

For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation of our business and safe performance is a sign of professionalism.
Occupational and operational safety
We strive to be a safe workplace for our employees and for the contractors and service providers who work for us. We believe that all work injuries are preventable when competence and the right attitude prevails, when potential risks are addressed and when measures are taken to safeguard against them. Good operational safety is an absolute prerequisite for safe and efficient operations in terms of the employees and the environment.
We have set Group-level targets for the following key indicators: · Injury frequency (TRIF* and LWIF**) for own employees and
(LWIF) for contractors · Number of serious*** accidents, as of 1 January 2017 number of
severe**** accidents · Major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents · Quality of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents and near
misses investigation process The safety targets apply to all Fortum employees and are part of the Group's short-term incentive plan.
Safety of own employees at a good level
Fortum's safety performance in 2016 was impacted by the completion of the Russian investment programme with good safety performance and the integration of Ekokem Corporation (as of 1 September 2016) and Grupa DUON S.A. (as of 1 April 2016). In particular, Ekokem Corporation's higher LWIF levels compared to Fortum's impacted the overall statistics.

Our good safety performance with our own employees continued. The lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) per million working hours was 1.0 (2015: 1.1). The total recordable injury frequency (TRIF), however, worsened to 1.9 (2015: 1.6).
The lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) for contractors is going to be our main challenge in 2017. The lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) per million working hours for contractors in 2016 was 3.0 (2015: 2.7). We successfully achieved our target (3.0), but we recognise that the LWIF of many contractors working for us

is higher than our target level. Robust safety management actions are needed from us in 2017 to reach the set target. A contractor safety performance assessment is also part of our supplier pre-selection process.
In 2016, as in 2015, there were no accidents leading to a fatality in Fortum's operations.
Unfortunately, there were still too many serious accidents to our own and our contractors' employees, and we did not achieve our target for serious accidents (2016: 8). In total, there were

13 (2015: 14) serious work-related accidents. Falls and injuries in connection with the use of tools were the main causes of the serious accidents. We have investigated all the injuries and launched measures to prevent similar injuries.
As of 1 January 2017, Fortum has changed the definition of the severity of the work-related accidents and is now focusing on accidents leading to serious consequences or potential serious consequences rather than the length of the sick-leave. We believe that this change will assist us in focusing and removing the root causes behind severe accidents and in allocating our resources more effectively. In 2016, there were five severe accidents for both own and contractors' employees. The Group target for 2017 is 5 severe accidents. Our target is to reduce severe accident to zero by 2020.
In reporting accidents, we comply with the principles of the United States Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and ILO's Practices on Recording and Notification of Occupational

Accidents and Diseases to the extent that they conform with the legislation in Fortum's countries of operation.
Operational safety
We track major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents as a Group target, which covers fires, leaks >100 litres into the environment, explosions, nuclear and dam safety incidents, and environmental non-compliances. There were 22 (2015: 18) EHS incidents in 2016; the target was 23. The incidents did not cause significant harm to operations, people or the environment. The majority (8) of the incidents were wastewater permit violations in Russia.
Common guidelines steer our operations
Fortum has Group-level EHS instructions and minimum requirements that set requirements for all the operations for which we have operative responsibility.

In 2016 we continued to update these requirements and, as part of the implementation, we assessed the divisions' performance in complying with the revised requirements in their operations. The shortcomings were recorded and the corrective measures were mostly implemented by all divisions during 2016. The remaining actions will be completed during 2017. The progress of this assessment of implementation is reported quarterly to the Fortum Executive Management.
A revised version of the Corporate Safety and Security handbook together with an e-learning module was published in eight languages. Completion of the e-learning is compulsory for all personnel. The training for the Fortum Executive Management took place in January 2017.
In 2017 Fortum will introduce two key control points for the EHS process: the assessment of compliance with Fortum's EHS minimum requirements and the quality of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents and near misses investigation process. A revised corporate incident management system, launched in December 2016, will help to ensure the effective root cause assessment, reporting and sharing of learnings.
We will continue our efforts to improve safety
Our goal is to continuously improve the safety of our operations. Our target for contactor safety in 2017 is LWIF  3.5 (2016: 3.0). Setting a higher numeric target than in the previous year might seem controversial, but achieving the 2017 targets set by Fortum's Board of Directors is very challenging in a situation in which acquisitions are resulting in new companies being integrated with Fortum. Achieving the targets requires EHS processes to be integrated and significant safety improvements.
Excellent occupational safety continues to be a promise we want to keep also in the coming years. We are committed to achieving the contractor safety level (LWIF 2.0) by 2020.

Corporate security
Through corporate security, we strive to ensure the uninterrupted continuity of business and the safety of people, information, our assets and processes in normal and exceptional situations. Uninterrupted energy production and distribution is important both for Fortum's business operations and for an energy-dependent society.
Securing personnel and business safety
Our Corporate Security unit is responsible at the Group level for security and for providing guidelines and support to the business units. Compliance with the minimum safety requirements improves our operational ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and thus reduces unplanned maintenance outages and improves productivity.
Fortum's new strategy was published in February 2016. In 2016 we analysed the company's security risks related to potential new business areas, services and products. We assessed risks related

to people, business and information in all geographical areas where Fortum has potential operations and business travel. Risks impacting the company and business operations may be related to political situations, terrorism, crime, conflicts and business partners.
Corporate security is improved also by gaining a deeper understanding of the security situation so that we can anticipate and prevent risks before they materialise.
Cyber security
Security with the information we handle and with our IT systems ensures that we can meet society's and our customers' expectations. The aim of cyber security is to ensure the production and distribution of power and heat and the functioning of new digital services, like Internet of Things applications.
In IT security, we aim to ensure the accessibility, integrity and confidentiality of critical information. We also take seriously and are uncompromising in our compliance with the regulations related to the protection of personal data.
We actively engage in collaboration with authorities and other stakeholders to understand and prevent new and growing cyber threats. We launch campaigns to increase employee awareness of security risks. We promote ways of operating that take employee information security into consideration by providing guidelines and, e.g., online training.
Contingency planning
The main disaster and emergency situations we prepare for are related to our critical operations, such as power plant and dam safety and securing other operations.
For dam and nuclear safety, emergency preparedness obligations in Finland and Sweden are based on regulatory provisions; likewise, there are terrorism-related preparedness obligations in Russia. Otherwise, emergency preparedness obligations prescribed by authorities are of a general nature. Based on its own risk assessments, Fortum independently defines the crisis and exceptional situations it prepares for and drafts action plans for.

Fortum's crisis and emergency management instructions are prepared for Group, division and site levels. The testing and updating of the crisis management and continuity plans are the responsibility of each division and line organisation. Crises impacting Group operations more broadly are managed at the Group level. Crisis communication instructions have been prepared for e.g. power and heat outages and for the Loviisa nuclear power plant. Corporate Security is responsible for crisis management development, e.g., for organising rehearsals and supporting planning. Group Communications is responsible for crisis communication.
In 2016, the annual emergency exercise related to a nuclear power accident was held at the Loviisa power plant. Additionally, in September 2016, a major accident drill was carried out at Ekokem's Riihimäki plant in compliance with the requirements of the Seveso II directive.

Corporate citizenship

Social responsibility is a cornerstone of Fortum's operations. Our operations impact the local communities where our power plants are located, and we engage in many kinds of collaboration with local stakeholders.
We support activities promoting the common good in society, for example the work of organisations and communities in our operating countries. Our sponsorship programme focuses on the future ­ on children, young people, the environment and society. Fortum also does significant collaboration with different research and development projects, particularly with Nordic universities.
We actively participate in national and international organisations. Public affairs and collaboration with authorities are a priority in the energy sector.
Local impacts and collaboration with local communities
We are an important employer and significant tax payer in our operating areas. In addition, our investments improve the local infrastructure. Of our energy production forms, hydropower has the most significant impacts on local communities and local forms of land use. Hydropower construction and use may alter the fluctuation range and rhythm in the discharge and water level in waterways as well as the fish fauna. These changes impact fishing, recreational use, and boating. We mitigate and compensate the adversities caused by hydropower production through numerous measures, such as stocking fish and building boat launch ramps.
We communicate openly, honestly and proactively, and we engage in a dialogue with the stakeholder groups located in the vicinity of our power plants. We carry out collaboration projects with local communities. We conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA) for our projects in accordance with legislative requirements. The hearing of stakeholders is part of the EIA process. In addition, relevant stakeholders are heard in all permit procedures.

Examples of our activities with local communities in 2016: · Customer panels and meetings were organised in Finland,
Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Poland. Meeting with customers is one way to get direct feedback and development ideas. We want to accommodate customer needs even better in the future. · Open-house events were arranged at power plants in different countries of operation; thousands of locals attended the events. For example, in Jelgava, Latvia, an open-house event is organised annually during the Jelgava City Festival, and the power plant offers recreational activities to local families. The Ekokem production plant's open-house event offered the opportunity to tour the new Circular Economy Village. · Fortum continued publishing the Naapurina ydinvoimala (Nuclear power plant as a neighbour) magazine in Loviisa and maintained an active dialogue with local residents and representatives of the city of Loviisa. · Projects aiming to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of hydropower were under way in Finland and Sweden in collaboration with municipalities, research facilities, fishermen, universities and environmental organisations. For example, every year Fortum partners with other actors to improve the environmental conditions and recreational use of the River Oulujoki through River Oulujoki restoration and multi-use framework agreement projects. · The fourth National Clean River Championships was held for students in Sweden. More than 2,300 young people raised money for recreational activities by collecting 31 tons of trash along the banks of four rivers (Dalälven, Klarälven, Ljusnan and Gullspångälven) where Fortum has hydropower plants. · District cooling production was started in Tartu, Estonia, after active collaboration with the City of Tartu and other stakeholder groups. Fortum is participating in the SmartEnCity project, which aims to develop smart solutions for transport, energy conservation and ICT to improve the quality of life for citizens.

· Fortum continued supporting local communities with several projects in the vicinity of the Kapeli and Amrit solar power plants in India. Among other things, Fortum has improved water service as well as lighting and cooling with fans for health care centre and schools. A new classroom was built in a school near the Amrit power plant.
· Fortum supports the communities in power plant areas through various donations. Support in 2016 went to e.g. workshops and scholarships for talented children raised in difficult conditions in Poland, a day-care centre for special needs children in Latvia, as well as a sports school for children, a hockey team, and cultural and residential events in Russia.
· In Finland we installed free-to-use, lockable cell phone charging stations in public areas, like libraries, hospitals and shopping centres.
Support for society
In 2016, our support for activities promoting the common good totalled about EUR 3.6 (2015: 3.6) million. The share of grants awarded by the Fortum Foundation was about EUR 675,000 (2015: 706,000) of the support. Fortum Foundation supports research, education and development in the natural, technical and economical sciences within the energy industry.
In 2017, Ekokem will award EUR 150,000 in grants for environmental and waste management sector research. The purpose of the fund is to promote and support innovative research and expertise to benefit the environmental management sector, especially with regard to waste management, material recycling, the utilisation of waste, the treatment of hazardous waste, and the restoration of soil and waters in the Nordic countries.
The goal of the collaboration with universities and colleges is to develop Fortum's business, promote energy-sector research and development, and foster Fortum's recruiting and training opportunities.

Human rights

Fortum supports and respects internationally recognised human rights, which are included in the key human rights agreements. Our own operations have a direct or indirect impact on the realisation of the human rights of our own personnel, those working in the supply chain, and members of local communities.
Management of human rights issues
Our goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and to apply these principles in our own operations as well as in country and partner risk assessments and supplier audits. Fortum's approach to the management of human rights issues is described in more detail in the Appendix 1: Sustainability management by topic, Human rights.
Fortum's Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordinating and developing sustainability, including human rights issues, at the Group level.
Personnel training in human rights issues
The online course for Fortum's Code of Conduct includes training in human rights-related issues. The course is part of the induction programme for new employees. Fortum employees conducting supplier audits receive internal training, during which they review the requirements of the Supplier Code of Conduct, the sub-areas to be audited, and the tools to be used to verify compliance

with the requirements. Those who have completed the internal training are advised to complete auditor training also on the Social Accountability (SA8000) standard. Internal trainings were not organised in 2016 but three Fortum employees participated in SA8000 auditor course during the year.
Assessment of human rights impacts
A sustainability assessment is carried out for our investment projects and takes into consideration the environmental, occupational health and safety, and social impacts of the project. The sustainability assessment includes a human rights evaluation, especially in new operating areas. A human rights assessment is also part of the systematic assessment of country and counterparty risks when planning a project.
The process has two parts: a light and a deep assessment. A light assessment is done for all new countries in where our business unit is planning the sales of operation and maintenance services, for example, and it is based on publically available sources. In 2016, 28 of these assessments were made. Deep assessments were not done during the year.
Fortum's supplier audits cover the most important human rights aspects related to purchases. The supplier audits conducted in 2016 and their results are described in more detail in the section
Sustainable supply chain.

Identified impacts on human rights, corrective measures and grievances
All forms of child and forced labour are strictly prohibited and in violation of Fortum's Code of Conduct. Of our operating countries, India has not ratified the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention on the minimum age and the worst forms of child labour. Our functions in India require job applicants to be of adult age. We have not identified risks related to the use of forced labour in our own operations. Support of employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining are discussed in the section
Employee-employer relations. Internal reporting channels used for reporting any suspected
misconduct relating to the labour practices or human rights violations are instructed in Fortum's Code of Conduct. In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum has an external "Raise a concern" channel which is available to all stakeholders.
In 2016, there were no grievances related to human rights, labour rights or discrimination filed through formal grievance channels, nor were there any grievances carried over from the previous year.

Product responsibility
Fortum is a clean energy company that provides customers with electricity, heating and cooling as well as smart solutions to improve resource efficiency. Our ambition is to engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a low-emission energy system and optimal resource efficiency.
We are one of the leading electricity sales companies in the Nordic countries, and we sell electricity to private and business customers in Sweden, Finland and Norway. Fortum is one of the world's biggest producers and sellers of heat. We sell heat to companies, the public sector and private customers in Finland, Poland, all the Baltic countries, and especially in Russia. Additionally, we sell district cooling in Finland and in Estonia, where the first customers started using district cooling in 2016. In Poland, we sell electricity, natural gas, and liquefied natural gas. Fortum Charge & Drive is the Nordic countries' largest electric vehicle charging network, which operates in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland.
With the acquisition of Ekokem, Fortum became one of the leading Nordic circular economy companies offering environmental management and material efficiency services. The range of services includes recycling, reutilisation and final disposal solutions, as well as soil remediation and environmental construction services. Operations are in Finland, Sweden and Denmark.

Innovative charging facility for electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway
Fortum Charge & Drive opened an innovative electric car charging facility at the Vulkan parking garage in central Oslo in December 2016. It has over 100 charging stations available for customers.
The battery reserve installed in the garage balances power loads in order to avoid putting strain on the power grid during times of high usage. The solution makes it possible for parking garages to set up large EV charging facilities without having to make expensive and time-consuming upgrades to the power grid. The installation is prepared for "vehicle to grid," meaning that power can be transferred both to and from the batteries of the charging cars. The charging facility will be further developed in the first half of 2017 to enable a choice in charging speed ­ from 3.6 to 22 kW ­ and to pre-book a charging slot.
The new charging facility was built in cooperation with the property owner and the city of Oslo. The facility is helping Oslo to reach its ambitious climate goals, which include cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020 and 95% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
Fortum Charge & Drive is a pioneer in electric vehicle charging. In total, the network consists of 1,200 affiliated smart chargers. The Charge & Drive cloud-based business system is already used by about 50 partners in the Nordic countries and nearly 40,000 end customers.

Guarantee-of-origin-labelled and renewable electricity
Fortum is one of the Nordic countries' leading sellers of carbon dioxide-free and guarantee-of-origin-labelled electricity and can offer more and more customers an electricity agreement that comes with electricity produced with renewable energy. All the electricity we sold to private customers in Finland and Sweden in 2016 was renewable and carbon dioxide-free hydro-, wind or solar power. The origin of the electricity was guaranteed with European Guarantees of Origin. Some of the production was guaranteed also with the pan-European EKOenergy label granted by environmental organisations and in Sweden with the Bra Miljöval label.
Services to customers
In recent years Fortum has introduced many new solutions that improve energy efficiency for customers and reduce environmental impacts. We want to offer growing urban areas sustainable solutions that support a circular economy. Smart solutions give customers better opportunities to control their electricity consumption and costs. Fortum is continuously developing its products and services to meet the needs of customers. The new solutions are related to, e.g., energy efficiency and demand response, electric vehicles, solar power, and open district heating.
We offer power plant owners and industrial customers a variety of expert services for operation and maintenance. Additionally,

we offer products and consulting services related to hydropower, nuclear safety and nuclear waste handling.
Marketing communications and customer data protection
Our goal is to present products and services truthfully in all our marketing and communication materials. We do not present misleading statements and we strictly follow responsible marketing communication guidelines. In statements regarding environmental issues, we follow the regulations for environmental marketing. No violations of regulatory or voluntary principles were observed in Fortum's marketing communications in 2016.
Data protection legislation has been amended in recent years. New personal data protection legislation in Russia took effect in 2015, and in 2016 the EU published the Data Protection Regulation, which will take effect in May 2018.
Fortum assumes responsibility for customer data protection. We have launched a project to ensure that we fulfil the requirements of the regulation by the deadline. Any changes needed in the handling of customer data, among other things, will be implemented during 2017.

Reporting principles

We report on sustainability in this Sustainability Report and in the Online Annual Review. Additionally, we describe sustainabilityrelated governance practices in the Corporate Governance Statement and strategy and the CEO's view in the CEO Letter. Tax footprint 2016 is also a part of our reporting entity.
In our sustainability reporting, we comply with integrated reporting principles, and we apply the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Guidelines' specific standard disclosure indicators we have identified as material. We apply the requirements of the Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures where we have deemed the information to be material to our stakeholders.
We gain information about our stakeholders' views through the One Fortum survey, the stakeholder sustainability survey and other stakeholder collaboration. Our selection of material aspects is based on Fortum's own and our stakeholders' views regarding the materiality of the impacts.
We report sustainability information annually in Finnish and English. In our annual reporting we describe Fortum's operations in 2016 as well as some information from January­February 2017. The previous reporting was published in February 2016, and our next reporting will be published in February/March 2018. In addition to the annual reporting, we report on our sustainability activities in Fortum's interim reports.
Reporting scope and boundaries
Reporting related to operations and management covers all functions under Fortum's control, including subsidiaries in all countries of operation. Possible deviations to this principle are reported in conjunction with information applying different boundaries. A list of Fortum's subsidiaries is in Notes to the
Financial Statements, Note 42 Subsidiaries by segment. Information from previous years is mainly presented as pro
forma information, i.e. on the basis of the organisation and the functions of each year; the impacts of ownership changes

in production facilities, for example, have not been updated afterwards in the previous figures.
The company AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholms stad (Fortum Värme) is classified in the Financial Statements as a joint venture and is consolidated with the equity method as of 1.1.2014. Fortum Värme is not included in Fortum's sustainability targets and indicators nor in the descriptions of management practices. Fortum Värme's sustainability information is available in Fortum Värme's sustainability report.
Fortum completed the divestment of its Distribution business on 1 June 2015. In this report, the information for 2016 and, as a general rule, also for 2015 does not include the Distribution business. The Distribution business is included in the figures for 2014.
Fortum completed the acquisition of Ekokem Corporation on 31 August 2016. Ekokem is included in Fortum's sustainability reporting starting from 1 September 2016. Fortum acquired 100% of the shares in the electricity and gas sales company Grupa DUON S.A. on 8 April 2016. DUON is included in Fortum's sustainability reporting starting from 1 April 2016.
Exceptions to the accounting practice are presented in conjunction with each figure.
Capacity changes
Fortum commissioned unit 2 (248 MW electricity and 174 MW heat) of its Chelyabinsk GRES combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Russia in March 2016. With the acquisition of Ekokem Corporation, 43 MW of electricity production capacity and 144 MW heat production capacity was transferred to Fortum's ownership. The acquisition of Grupa DUON S.A. bought Fortum 12 MW of heat production capacity. The new capacity constructed during the year and the new plants commissioned are included in the reporting starting from their commissioning.
Fortum divested the Tobolsk 665-MW CHP plant on 5 February 2016. The divested capacities are included in the reporting until the divestment date.

Greenhouse gas emissions are reported on a pro forma basis and the figures of the comparison years have not been adjusted in terms of new or commissioned or divested capacity because of partially insufficient data.
Measurement and calculation principles
Data for economic performance indicators is collected from the audited Financial Statements and from financial accounting and consolidation systems.
The environmental information of the report covers the plants for which Fortum is the legal holder of the environmental permit. In such cases, the plant information is reported in its entirety. The only exception is the calculation of specific CO2 emissions from the Meri-Pori power plant, where the calculation covers only Fortum's share of production and emissions as specified in the operation agreement between Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima Oy. In the specific emissions calculation, the production shares of minority holdings are also included in the total production.
Fortum utilises a Group-wide database with instructions for collecting site-level environmental data. Sites are responsible for data input, emissions calculations and the accuracy of the information provided. The Corporate Sustainability unit compiles the data at the Group level and is responsible for the disclosed sustainability information.
Fortum's CO2 emissions subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are annually verified at the site-level by external verifiers. Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions have been reported in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Analysis performed by an external consultant.
The average and the year-end total personnel figures presented in this report include 332 employees who joined Fortum in 2016 mainly through corporate acquisitions, but are not included in the other personnel figures and tables presented in the report. These individuals include the civil contractors working in the Polish DUON Group and the entire personnel of the Swedish Info24 company.

Social responsibility

Fortum's human resources (HR) management system is used in all Fortum's operating countries and is the main system for employee-related personal and job data. In Russia, the employee data system covers mainly superiors. In addition, Russian operations have their own, local data system. Other social responsibility data, such as occupational health-related data, originates from various data systems.
Designated individuals collect the information and deliver it to the Corporate Sustainability unit primarily in the format recommended by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative).
Assurance
Deloitte & Touche Oy has provided limited assurance for the 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 reporting period for emissions calculations (Scope 1-3) based on the GHG protocol according to the requirements published by CDP (Verification of Climate Data).
Global Compact and Caring for climate reporting
Fortum has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact initiative since 2010. In our sustainability report, in conjunction with the description of environmental responsibility, social responsibility and business ethics, we describe the realisation of the Ten Principles of the Global Compact initiative in our operations in 2016. We use the GRI G4 indicators to measure compliance with the principles of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption.
Fortum joined the UN Caring for Climate initiative in 2013. Fortum meets the reporting requirements of the Caring for Climate initiative by annually participating in the assessment in the CDP's climate change survey and by publishing its response on the CDP website.

Independent limited assurance report on Fortum's Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2016

To the Management of Fortum Corporation
We have been engaged by Fortum Corporation (hereafter: Fortum) to provide a limited assurance on Fortum's Greenhouse Gas Emissions (hereafter: GHG Emissions) broken down by scope 1, 2 and 3 for the reporting period of January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (hereafter: GHG Emissions Disclosures). The information subject to the assurance engagement is presented in the section "Greenhouse gas emissions" of Fortum's sustainability reporting 2016 (hereafter: GHG Reporting).
Management's responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation of the GHG Reporting in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in Fortum's reporting principles and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (hereafter: GHG Protocol). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the GHG Reporting that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, selecting and applying appropriate criteria and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Assurance provider's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the reported GHG Emissions Disclosures within Fortum's GHG Reporting based on our engagement. Our assurance report is made in accordance with the terms of our engagement with Fortum. We do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Fortum for our work, for this assurance report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410 to provide a limited assurance on performance data. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and

perform the assurance engagement to obtain a limited assurance whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that the GHG Emissions Disclosures have not been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.
We did not perform any assurance procedures on the prospective information, such as targets, expectations and ambitions, disclosed in the GHG Reporting. Consequently, we draw no conclusion on the prospective information.
A limited assurance engagement with respect to the GHG Emissions Disclosures involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the reported GHG Emissions. The procedures performed depend on the practitioner's judgment, but their nature is different from, and their extent is less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls and consequently they do not enable us to obtain the assurance necessary to become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.
Our procedures on this engagement included: · A review of management systems, reporting and data
compilation processes · Selected interviews of persons conducting scope 1, 2 and 3
analysis and data owners · Review of assumptions and emission factors used in calculations · Analytical testing of consolidated data · Testing of source data on spot check basis We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Our independence, quality control and competences
We complied with Deloitte's independence policies which address and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International Federation of Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional

Accountants in their role as independent assurance providers and in particular preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our independence and impartiality and from any involvement in the preparation of the report. We have maintained our independence and objectivity throughout the year and there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair our independence and objectivity.
Deloitte & Touche Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance and sustainability expertise with professional qualifications. Our team is experienced in providing sustainability reporting assurance.

Conclusion
On the basis of the procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information subject to the assurance engagement is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GHG Protocol or that the GHG Emissions Disclosures are not reliable, in all material respects, with regard to the reporting criteria.
Our assurance statement should be read in conjunction with the inherent limitations of accuracy and completeness of the GHG Reporting.

Management of economic responsibility

Targets and approach
Policies Responsibilities Monitoring and follow-up

Description
For Fortum economic responsibility means competitiveness, performance excellence and market-driven production that creates long-term value for our stakeholders and enables sustainable growth. Satisfied customers are key to our success and active consumers will have a crucial role in the future energy system. Fortum has indirect responsibility for its supply chain. We conduct business with viable companies that act responsibly.
Each new research and development project is assessed against the criteria of carbon dioxide emissions reduction and resource efficiency. Likewise, new investment proposals are assessed against sustainability criteria as part of Fortum's investment assessment and approval process. In our investments we seek economically profitable alternatives that provide the opportunity to increase capacity and reduce emissions.
We measure financial performance with the return on capital employed (target: at least 10%) and capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA around 2.5).
The realisation of financial targets in 2016 is reported in the Financial performance and position section of the Financials.
The financial management system is based on Grouplevel policies and their specifying instructions, and on good governance, effective risk management, sufficient controls and the internal audit principles supporting them. Other key elements steering financial management are presented in the section
Policies and commitments and the Appendix 2.
The CFO and the Group's Financial unit, division management, and ultimately the CEO and the Board of Directors, are responsible for issues related to finances and financial statements and for broader financial responsibility issues.
Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section Governance and management.
The Board decides on the company's financial targets as a part of the annual business planning process. Realisation of the targets is monitored on monthly basis both at the division level and by Fortum Executive Management. Fortum's management monitors the realisation of financial targets quarterly as part of the business performance assessment, and key indicators are regularly reported to Fortum's Board of Directors. Financial key indicators related to investments are monitored in divisions' investment forums and by Fortum Executive Management.
We report regularly on the direct and indirect financial impacts on our most important stakeholder groups. Fortum also uses the applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators to measure economic responsibility.

Management of environmental responsibility

Targets and approach
Policies Responsibilities Monitoring and follow-up

Description
Fortum's aim is to provide our customers with environmentally benign products and services. We strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations by using best available practices and technologies. We emphasise a circular economy, resource and energy efficiency, the use of waste and biomass, and climate change mitigation in our environmental responsibility.
Our company's know-how in carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power production and in energy-efficient combined heat and power production, investments in solar and wind power, as well as solutions for sustainable cities play a key role in environmental responsibility.
We measure the realisation of the environmental responsibility with the following indicators, for which we have set Group-level targets (targets for 2016 and 2017): · Specific CO2 emissions · Energy efficiency · Major EHS incidents Additionally, we have a Group-level target for the number of supplier audits.
Environmental management is based on Fortum's sustainability policy. Other key elements steering environmental management are presented in the section
Policies and commitments and the Appendix 2. We assess environmental risks as part of the Group's risk assessment process
Financials/Operating and financial review/Risk management.
Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section Governance and management.
EHS noncompliances are reported monthly and specific carbon dioxide emissions are reported quarterly and energy efficiency improvements annually to the Fortum Executive Management. The Group's key indicators are reported regularly to Fortum's Board of Directors and are published in Fortum's Interim Reports.
The divisions and sites follow and develop their operations with audits required by environmental management systems. Internal and external auditors regularly audit our ISO 14001 standard-compliant management system. The CO2 emissions of plants within the sphere of the EU's emissions trading scheme are audited annually on a per plant basis by an external verifier accredited by the emissions trading authority. The verification addresses the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the monitoring system and the reported data and information relating to emissions. The plants must annually submit to the authorities a verified emissions report of the previous calendar year's carbon dioxide emissions.
We assess the level of operations of our business partners through supplier pre-selection and audits.
For coal, we use the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the supply chain. The Bettercoal audits are always conducted by third parties.
We map our stakeholders' views annually with the One Fortum survey and with separate sustainability surveys.
