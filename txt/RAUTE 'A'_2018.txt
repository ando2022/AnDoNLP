> Review by the President and CEO

Raute's strong positive development continued
for the fourth consecutive year. We entered 2018 with a very strong order book and set a new record in our net sales with 22 percent growth. Our operating profit was Raute's best ever. Our growth and the development projects targeting our products and operations are to thank for the improved profitability.
Another record was made in our order intake volume. Geographically, our focus remained on Europe, North America and Russia. Demand for our technology services remained good throughout the year. We are happy with our EUR 167 million order intake. Our order book fell from the start of the year due to our record-breaking net sales but it came to a strong EUR 95 million at the end of the year.
Raute turned 110 in 2018. We celebrated this major milestone by keeping up the good work. In addition to our daily work, we focused more closely on the sustainability aspects of our operations. We already published our responsibility themes in 2017. Last year, we defined in more detail the monitoring of our themes and the projects to improve our key topics.

We are not yet happy with the occupational safety level and development we have achieved. We will continue to intensify our efforts to carry out our development projects.
Our impact on the environment and on the mitigation of climate change is one of our key external responsibility themes. A significant share of our customers' production is used in construction. The carbon captured in wood construction considerably reduces the load on the environment, compared with the growth in the carbon footprint when using other common construction materials. With our technology, customers can carry out their production while at the same time minimizing their climate impact. We are thus doing our bit to save the Earth from climate change.
The general economic outlook changed at the end of last year, becoming more uncertain, particularly due to politics. Of our client base, many established and traditional companies have made major investments over the past few years. Demand for our technology is now shifting towards new types of customers.

6 RAUTE 2018

Our strong development continued in our 110th year.
This year began with a strong order book. We are now focusing more on new customers and areas in which investment activity is on the rise, positioning us nicely in terms of advancing development.
I would like to warmly thank all of the parties that enabled our success in 2018. Thank you to our customers for their co-operation and trust. Thank you to our staff for their excellent work and strong commitment to carrying out the heavier workload. Thank you to our shareholders for their trust in us. And finally, a thank you to all of our other partners for contributing to Raute's development and success.

Long-lasting wood products
Thanks to our new innovations and state-of-the-art technology, our customers in the wood products industry can boost their production and improve the end-product quality. Our customers manufacture long-lasting wood-based panel products: veneer, plywood and LVL.

Veneer is a thin wood panel manufactured by peeling or slicing from a log.
Plywood is a panel of wood consisting of thin, cross-bonded veneers.
LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) is a beam made of veneers glued with their grains parallel and then hot pressed; it is used in load-bearing structures.

End uses
Veneer, plywood and LVL products are used mainly in construction and furniture-making and in the transport vehicle and packaging industries. The use of different wooden structures and components is growing dramatically especially in construction.
Renewability, recyclability and eco-friendliness are sustainable trends that increase the demand for and use of wood products worldwide.

Circular economy
The circular economy tries to keep products in use for as long as possible and to reuse their materials efficiently while maintaining the raw materials' value.
Wood-based panel products are long-lasting wood products. After their original life is over, they can be reused, recycled or used as raw material in energy production.
In the future, an increasing proportion of wood products will be recycled.

How the wood processing value chain is changing

Attention is shifting from the carbon footprint to the carbon handprint. In a carbon-neutral future, the winners will be clean technologies, products and solutions that enable customers and other parties in the value chain to reduce their emissions.
The popularity of wood as a raw material is growing and its use in construction is increasing.

Construction is constantly subject to new speed and efficiency requirements. New solutions based on wood panel components are arriving on the markets.
Safety and resource-efficiency requirements for production processes are becoming tighter.
New digital solutions based on automation are becoming more common, enabling new types of business models and services.

Growing together with our customers.
Sector's growth outlook remains good The uncertainty around economic development that marked 2018 continues. The availability of suitable wood raw material is becoming increasingly important and investments are moving closer to raw material resources. Integrated mills drawing on centralized wood sourcing and mill infrastructure are becoming more common.
We believe that the wood products industry is also globalizing. Our customers plan and implement production investments in neighboring countries, even in other market areas, such as from Europe to Russia. At the same time, the markets for new machinery are rapidly becoming international.
New equipment investments were, as a whole, at a higher level than the normal economic situation in 2018. The total value of new equipment investments in the industries we serve is approximately EUR 650 million a year in a normal economic situation. Our market share of all investments in production process machinery in the industry is 15 to 20 percent on average.
In 2018, the capacity utilization rates of our customers' production facilities remained essentially at a good

level. The share of planned and preventive maintenance services will grow as new production capacity goes on stream. Demand for remote services and the supporting systems is also growing.
The development of plywood production is continuing strong on the emerging markets in Asia, South America and Africa. Russia is also showing positive development with the focus remaining on the development of the production capacity and improving output.
On our traditional markets, the future looks good. In North America, production investments are focused on the modernization of processes and technology and in Europe, the growth in production capacity is focused on special plywood products.
New opportunities on the horizon Our competitive position will be strong, also going forward, in all of our traditional market areas and especially in new technologies. Our advanced and comprehensive solutions help our customers strengthen their resource efficiency and develop the quality of their products throughout the life cycle of their production processes and their various steps. Our success is based on overall expertise in production processes, our extensive technology offering and our wide selection of services.
Our position as the most reliable supplier of millscale projects is strong. We are specialized in the resource-efficient processing of small-diameter plantation wood. We have developed, together with local operators, an upgraded technology offering designed for the emerging markets. We expect it to provide new growth opportunities in the near future.

> Strategy

Always customer-oriented and one step ahead.

Wood is a renewable natural raw material,
which is growing in popularity worldwide. We are part of the wood processing value chain. Our complete solutions are a combination of advanced technology and services related to using that technology and developing the customer's entire production process and optimizing production.
We wish to serve the veneer, plywood and LVL industry on a global scale with our technology and service solutions suited to a variety of customer needs ­ from high technology using the latest automation to basic smaller-capacity machines and production lines. Our services can easily be scaled from basic maintenance and spare parts services to overall responsibility for the productivity of production lines.
Digitization constantly creates new opportunities to develop our service offering.
Better results in all market situations Our machines and equipment are a significant investment for our customers. The wood-based panel products they manufacture are used, for instance, in construction and other projects also of an investment nature. Investment demand reacts quickly to the threats and changes of the overall economic situation. This is why demand for our products and, to some extent, services is cyclical.

Our strategic goal is to enhance our performance in different demand situations in terms of growth and profitability. To achieve our goal, the entire organization is working together to implement the strategy.
Customer engagement ­ Grow with our customers We are genuinely interested in our customers' needs and the veneer, plywood and LVL production processes' bottlenecks and investment criteria. Our goal is to become the preferred supplier for a growing number of customers, in more and more market areas. We are genuinely committed to our customers and wish to grow together with them.
Always customer-oriented and one step ahead Our customers include veneer, plywood and LVL mills, the majority of which are relatively small private family companies. Some of our customers are part of major consolidated forest groups that manufacture not only various wood-based panel products, but also products such as pulp, paper and sawn timber. Wood-based panel products are also manufactured for various end uses with different quality requirements. On the developed markets, such as Europe and North America, investment demand is typically focused on the latest technology. Meanwhile, on the emerging markets, such as China and Asia, clearly less expensive basic technology with a lower degree of automation is used for manufacturing.

Raute's financial goals
· Maintain good profitability level throughout the economic cycles
· Grow faster than the markets · Remain financially sound
· Offer competitive returns to investors

Globally, Raute is known for its production lines created using the most advanced technology solutions. Our SmartMill concept's competitive advantages are optimized grading and digital production control. Our modernization solutions based on the latest technology allow customers to improve their existing production capacity's performance cost-efficiently. In our new solutions we focus particularly on digitality and our Mecano and Metriguard products' latest measurement technology for sorting veneer and plywood.
Our goal is to reinforce our position at the forefront of development in our industry and as a technology leader. We also wish to significantly increase our share of the basic technology markets by developing our Lite solutions, which improve the resourceefficiency and quality of wood-based panel products. We see considerable growth potential for our Lite products, especially on the Asian markets.
Basic services using digitality It is essential for our customers to improve their productivity and run their production disturbance free. We are growing the share of our basic service business by continuously developing our service offering that covers the entire life cycle of our customer's production process. We will supplement our traditional service offering and strengthen

our position as a digital service pioneer. A remote connection is available for all of the equipment we supply, which allows us to serve customers faster and more cost-efficiently than before, both at the commissioning and maintenance phases. This saves time and the need for travel is reduced.
Build operational excellence together We develop our operational excellence together with the whole company. We want our customers to achieve the best price-performance ratios on their investments ­ faster than ever. We standardize our solutions in order to satisfy different customer needs. This helps us shorten the lead times of our deliveries and to improve quality. By focusing on our core competencies, we improve our productivity and ability to adapt to fluctuations in demand. We build and develop our supply chain together with our partners. We lighten our operating methods by focusing on phases that create customer value. We improve our information systems to increase our productivity.
Our goal is to establish a work environment and culture that motivates us to serve our customers in the best way possible and to outdo ourselves over and over again. Our starting point is for all of Raute's personnel to be familiar with the company's strategy and participate in its implementation.

Our selection of solutions for different
customer needs is the world's largest. Our project deliveries can include individual machines, production lines or the production processes of entire mills. We ensure the efficiency of our customers' production processes and that they maintain their competitive advantages throughout the life cycle of the production line.
Our technology services include all of the basic services from spare parts to regular maintenance and the modernization of production lines. Our expert services support our customers in both investment decisions and production development. Our digital solutions can be linked to various service packages to produce information on the processes' efficiency and development areas. The information and skills required for safely and effectively operating production lines can also be learned through our online learning system.
The available wood raw material, desired production capacity, dimensions of the wood-based panels being produced and the end-user requirements determine the required production technology. We implement production lines for veneer, plywood and LVL mills using various equipment and line solutions and automation.
In northern areas, the most common tree species are birch and pine. When moving southwards, the poplar

and pine become more common. Nearer the equator, there are already dozens of wood species used in plywood production. We offer solutions for plywood, whatever the tree species is.
Traditionally, a typical plywood panel has been 1.25 m × 2.5 m. Our solutions enable the manufacture of, for example, 2.4 m × 4.0 m plywood panels and even bigger sizes. The thicknesses of the panels typically vary between 6 mm and 25 mm, but our solutions make it possible to produce plywood panels of up to 60 mm, for instance for special uses in the transport vehicle industry. New uses constantly set new demands on the panels' dimensions and other characteristics. A large portion of the panels are processed further, for example, by coating them for different uses or grooving and tonguing to make it easier to cover large areas with plywood panels.
The raw material of LVL beams is usually softwood; different spruce and pine species. The end uses often require both high load-bearing capacity and a long span. The sizes of LVL beams vary from partition wall posts of a length of 2.5 m and width of 95 mm to buildings' load-bearing roof beams of 20 m in length and 1 m in width. The strength requirements for roof beams necessitate a carefully controlled manufacturing process in which the veneer raw material is measured and sorted as adaptable for either structural or non-structural beams. Raute is the only supplier of technology for this purpose.

Modernization products play a key role in our product development.

Uncompromising safety To achieve a safe mill environment and operations, safe production machinery and good work ergonomics are required. We offer safety solutions that improve coping at work, occupational safety and productivity for different customer needs. The excellent ergonomics of our machines and state-of-the-art safety automation solutions guarantee smooth and safe working conditions even in surprising situations.
We are active participants in a European working group developing the safety of machinery (Observing Committee (K114) of European Committee for Standardization CEN/TC 114- Safety of Machinery).
R&D generates competitive advantage We continuously develop new solutions in order to improve the competitiveness of our customers' products. Our active research work is aimed at finding new technologies and solutions that will allow us to maintain our position as a leading turnkey supplier. We also carry out more and more research together with leading companies and universities.

New measurement technologies have enabled the development of new digital veneer and plywood production monitoring and analysis tools that allow us to guarantee the efficiency of our customers' production processes. We have launched several new digital tools and services on the markets. For example, KPIs for production volumes and grades speed up decision-making to achieve optimized processes and to initiate maintenance measures. We continuously add to our tool selection and our tools' features.
Modernization products also play a key role in our product development. We expect their demand to increase as the focal point of investments shifts towards the improvement of older production facilities' output. Many production lines in use can be updated to correspond more closely with the performance of state-of-the-art production lines using our measurement technology and automation.

In 2018, we brought to the markets a new innovative grading technology for measuring the characteristics of veneer sheets, which combines our machine vision, ultrasound, density and moisture measurement expertise. Now, sorting veneer sheets is even more precise and versatile.

Our personnel strategy's
key focal areas are a motivating employee experience, the development of leadership and the organizationwide strengthening of our highly responsible operating culture that strives for first-class quality.
For Raute, 2018 was a busy time. Our personnel grew by 68 people and totaled 772 at the end of the year. We recruited altogether 129 new permanent employees to our Group during the year. Our biggest challenge was to find enough new automation engineers and maintenance service experts. We employed 39 people on a fixed-term basis at the end of 2018.
Raute becoming younger and more diverse Over the last few years, many young people have joined our growing team. Our average age has fallen by one year over the past five years and is now 42 years. The number of employees under 30 has grown by 16 percent and they make up 20 percent of our entire personnel. The share of women has also increased to 11 percent and they can be found more often in specialist and supervisory positions. Our Nastola head office has become more multicultural and, currently, we have people of eight different nationalities working there.

Competence development continues By continuously developing our competence, we can ensure that Raute's strategy is implemented successfully now and in the future. Through the RauteACADEMY learning system adopted in 2017, our personnel have had the chance to participate voluntarily in training involving different topics. The focus has been on occupational safety, our Code of Conduct, our strategy and our technology. RauteACADEMY offered a total 24 courses last year and altogether 3,267 courses were completed with passing grades. For the second time, we organized a global leadership training program aimed at, among other things, developing managers as coaches, as givers of feedback and as challengers.
We have continued our close collaboration with technology and commercial schools, as well as universities and polytechnics. The most common forms of collaboration have been internships, theses, projects and corporate visits. In 2018, 38 interns worked at Raute in different production, planning and also customer service and management tasks.
Raute's internal mentoring program was also continued in 2018. Altogether 29 mentoring pairs took part in the mentoring.

> Corporate responsibility > Occupational safety

Safety first means safe and appropriate working methods.

A safe work environment and the right working
methods both at our units and at our customers' mills are some of our key development areas. We made improving occupational safety our main theme for 2018 and we launched a number of related measures at our units.
A developing occupational safety culture combined with an unusually high work load caused numerous minor accidents, especially at our Nastola main production unit. We are not happy with the occupational safety level and development. Based on safety observations reporting, however, we believe that our occupational safety culture is already improving.
We will continue to actively improve our occupational safety culture through our `Safety first' theme. Our target is to achieve a 10 on the LTIF scale, i.e. no more than 10 absences resulting from occupational accidents lasting at least one day for every million working hours, by 2020.
* Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF): Accidents leading to absences lasting at least 1 day for every million working hours.

Our technology and services have a strong carbon handprint.

Our carbon handprint is visible
in the wood processing value chain. Our strong carbon handprint results from the better resourceefficiency of our technology solutions compared with competitors.

Over the past 25 years, we have delivered mill-scale veneer, plywood and LVL projects corresponding to an annual capacity of more than 5 million cubic meters. This volume of wood-based panel products stores close to 3 million tons of carbon dioxide captured by tree growth each year.
After the emissions resulting from the production chain, the annual carbon dioxide volume captured in the production of the mills we have delivered corresponds closely with the emissions from 800,000 passenger cars.

Sustainable forestry and long-lasting wood products are key enablers of a low-carbon society. Our advanced technology solutions support this development throughout a production facility's life cycle, enabling the efficient use of raw materials, energy and other production inputs.

We are minimizing our environmental impacts.

Energyefficiency
7.2 kWH/working hour, ­5%

The continuous advancement of
technology and rapid progress of digitalization are changing our operating methods and customer service processes. Our goal is to proactively reduce the environmental impacts and risks of our activities in relation to our production operations.
Our environmental impacts in relation to our net sales fell further in 2018. Energy consumption per hour worked fell 5 percent and the consumption of water per person fell 8 percent. Waste in relation to net sales grew 9 percent in Finland. The carbon dioxide emissions of our operations in relation to net sales grew by one percent due to a change in the source distribution of the electricity contract.
Our Nastola unit's operations are certified according to the ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environment) standards. Our environmental management program targets apply to, for instance, improving energy efficiency, reducing the volume of waste and the management of chemical safety. In 2018, the execution rate for measures concerning managing environmental matters was 96 percent.

In its decision-making and
corporate governance, our parent company abides by the Finnish Companies Act, the Securities Markets Act, Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd's rules, other regulations concerning publicly listed companies and the Articles of Association. Raute Corporation's Board of Directors has also issued Administrative Instructions for the Group and approved the Code of Conduct.
Raute Group's parent company is the Finnish public limited liability company Raute Corporation, which was established in 1908. Our Finnish units include our head office and main production unit in Nastola, Lahti and a production and development unit specializing in machine vision and moisture analyzing technology in Kajaani. Raute Corporation's share of the Group's 2018 net sales was 80 percent.

We deliver resource-efficient technology for the wood products industry, which uses renewable raw materials. Most of the products manufactured using our machinery have a long life and are recyclable, and the carbon stored in wood products has positive climate impacts. Increasing the use of sustainably produced wood in, for example, construction is among the most important means of achieving global climate targets. Demand for clean technology will grow in the wood products industry with the increasing global focus on climate emissions from raw materials.
