UNIT B: MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The risks the Group is exposed to and the potential risks may arise during the financial year 2018, are the following:
Macroeconomic Situation in Greece ­ Capital Controls Since May 2010, Greece in co-operation with its Partners has undertaken and implemented significant structural reforms for the improvement of the competition and the promotion of the financial development, through programs agreed with European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund ("the Institutions"). The above-mentioned reforms led to an improvement to the fiscal figures especially to primary surpluses in 2013 and 2014 and to marginal increase in GDP in 2014, for the first time after a five year recession period. Following the national elections of 25th of January 2015, the new Greek government achieved a four-month extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (MFFA). The fact that there was not an agreement by the expiring date of the aforementioned extension led to capital controls, imposed in June 2015. The imposed capital controls in the country, which include amongst others restrictions on payments abroad, consequently affecting domestic transactions and dealings with foreign suppliers and creditors. After an almost three-year period with imposed capital controls, the approval process has significantly improved and the Government has amended the relevant regulatory framework, by improving some of the restrictive provisions and smoothing the effects in the Greek Economy. In addition, the Company has significantly improved the application process for payments abroad and, in combination, with the aforementioned improvements in the imposed capital controls, resulted in the significant limitation of the negative effects at its operations. In any case, the Company expects the complete abandonment of the limitations in order to eliminate any costs relating with the administration of the application process for the payments abroad and, to optimize the performance of its capital. Regarding the financing of the operations of the Company, Plaisio does not encounter any limitations, because, the Company has the ability to raise capital as short-term working capital and medium-term debt, while, in parallel, maintains robust liquidity which gives the ability to the Company to negotiate improved financing terms. The main risks are analytically presented below:
1. Interest Risk The long-term bond loans of the Company and the Group, on December 31st 2017, were 11.273 th. Euro
(877 th. Euro on 31.12.2016) and the short-term bond loan was 1.604 th. Euro (584 th. Euro on 31.12.2016). From the total bond loans (12.877 th. Euro), the 6.877 th. Euro refers to two common bond loans from NBG, while the remaining amount refers to a common bond loan with floating interest rate from Eurobank SA.. The short-term bank loans were null (14.000 th. Euro in 31.12.2016). The aim of the issuance of the two new bond loans of total amount of 12.000 th. Euro during 2017, was the refinancing of the short-term bank loans of the Group with loans with long-term payment terms. As a consequence, the total short-term bank loans of the Company were repaid (14.000 th. Euro in 31.12.2016) and the total debt decreased to 12.877 th. Euro from 15.461 th. Euro, on 31.12.2016.

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
The following table presents the sensitivity of both the results of the period and the net equity to a change of the interest rate of +1% or -1%. The relevant influence is presented as follows: ) Interest Rate increase by 1%: - the results of the period as well as the Net Equity of the Group and of the Company, in that case, would decrease by 120 th. Euro and 140 th. Euro in 2017 and 2016 respectively. B) Interest Rate decrease by 1%: The results of the period as well as the Net Equity of the Group and of the Company, in that case, would increase by 120 th. Euro and 140 th. Euro in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The level of the interest rates is positively influenced in a micro-economic level by the capital structure of the Group and the stable timely repayments of any kind of financial liabilities and the co-operation relationships the Group retains with the banks. As a consequence, it is noted the wide liquidity of the Group and the fact that the cash and cash equivalents exceed the Group's total short-term and long-term borrowings in the last years.
2. Credit Risk The Group has no significant credit risk, mainly because of the large dispersion of its customers. Retail sales are paid in cash or via credit cards, whereas for wholesales the Group has all the necessary internal procedures and policies, according to which it approves a credit limit, examining the creditworthiness of the customer, on a case by case basis, separately. Furthermore, it is a Group's policy, that the largest amount of receivables from customers is insured. The Company has divided its customer's base to named and non-named customers. The balances of the Public Sector are not insured. The Company and the Group form a provision for doubtful receivables, as stated analytically in Note 11 of the Annual Financial Report. On December 31st 2017 the total balance of customers and other trade receivables (not including the subsidiary) was 21.850 th. Euro and 21.035 th. Euro, respectively, while the provision for doubtful receivables was 4.242 th. Euro and 4.170 th. Euro, for the Group and the Company, respectively. The above mentioned bad debt provision includes: a) a strictly defined provision for all the customers that have been characterized as doubtful, b) a specific provision for all the customers that have overdue balances based on the ageing of their balances, c) a provision, based on the increased level of risk because of the conditions of the economic environment taking into consideration : 1) the reduced liquidity of Greek businesses and 2) the difficult access to bank financing. It is noted that this provision includes also non-overdue receivables. For this provision the balances of all the customers have been taken into account, with the exception of the receivables from Plaisio Computers JSC, as it is considered that there is no risk of non-collection of these particular balances, d) the Group has already formed a provision for the balances from the Public Sector. It is noted that this provision also includes non-overdue balances. Despite the increase in the trade receivables by 1.153 th. Euro compared to 2016, the ageing and the insurance terms have been improved. Taking the above into account, the percentage of the formed provision for the current year decreased (19,4% compared to 23,1% in 2016), but remained in a satisfactory high level confirming the conservative policy of the Management.

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
In any case, the Management examines the amount of receivables; taking into account historical data and the respective market trends in order to form a high level of provision in relation with the trade receivables and to control the risk. The debit balance of the company Plaisio Computers JSC to the parent company Plaisio Computers S.A. on 31.12.2017 amounted to 809 th. Euro. The Management of the Company considers that, the aforementioned amount has no risk of non-collection, given that Plaisio Computers JSC is a 100% subsidiary.
3. Inventory-Suppliers Risk The Group takes all necessary measures (insurance, safekeeping), so as to minimize the risk and contingent damages of inventory, due to physical disasters, thefts etc. Furthermore, since the Group takes activity in a sector of high technology, where the risk of technical devaluation is extremely increased, the Management reviews the net realizable value of inventory and forms the appropriate provisions, so that the value in the financial statements coincides with the real one. On 31.12.2017, the total value of inventory was 61.212 th. Euro and 60.168 th. Euro, while the provision for devaluation was 8.970 th. Euro and 8.945 th. Euro, for the Group and the Company respectively. In comparison, on 31.12.2016 the amounts were 61.997 th. Euro and 60.751 th. Euro (inventory) and 11.260 th. Euro and 11.237 th. Euro (provision for devaluation), for the Group and the Company respectively. The provision for devaluation was calculated taking into account the inventory turnover which was improved due to the significantly higher sales that the Group achieved in the second semester of the year. On 31.12.2017 the percentage for devaluation of inventory formed to 14,7% compared to 18,2%. The main reason for the decrease in the provision is the revaluation by the Management of the devaluation percentage per product category based on the market conditions. The Company considers the suppliers' risk very limited, and in any case non-important for its financial results, since there is no significant dependence on any one of its suppliers as there is no supplier, except one, which roughly exceeds the 10% of the total supplies. Also, the down-payments were distributed to various suppliers. The above mentioned facts mark the fixed policy of the Management for no significant dependence from individual suppliers, in order to minimize the risk from the termination of a co-operation or the bankruptcy of a supplier, and no significant change is expected concerning the conservative policy of the Company during the financial year 2018.
4. Foreign Exchange Risk The foreign exchange risk is the risk of volatility of the value of financial assets and liabilities due to changes of exchange rates. The majority of the Group's transactions and balances conducted in Euro, but at the same time, the Group has deposits in foreign currency (Note 13). Furthermore, there are no loan liabilities in a currency other than the Euro. The Group in certain cases, hedges the foreign exchange risk, by conducting derivative contracts, but does not proceed with hedge accounting for that matter. The Management of the Group observes at all times the foreign currency risks that may arise and evaluates the need for relevant measures. The activity of the Group in Bulgaria is not considered to enhance currency risk, as the exchange rate of the Bulgarian currency to the Euro is fixed.
5. Turnover Seasonality

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
Sales' seasonality demands rational working capital management and smooth inventory inflows in order to avoid any shortage. The Group's sales are characterized by seasonality as 55% of the total sales are realized in the second half of the year. In the second semester of the year, the sales from the beginning of the school and academic year, the sales from Black Friday and the sales from the Christmas period are realized. Despite the seasonality, the Management estimates the referred risk as limited due to the wide liquidity and the ability to act immediately in cases of necessity of increased inventory and due to the retention of sufficient inventory for the needs of the Group (the inventory on 31.12.2017 was translated in almost the average sales of a quarter of the corporate year).

6. Intensity of Competition The Company operates in an intensively competitive industry, as there are many retailers which operate in the consumer electronics sector. However, due to the multi-product approach of the Group, it is not an easy exercise to identify an identical business model in the market. In any case, the Group achieves over time one of the best performance margins, and consistently appears profitability, facts that prove the success in the referred Market. However, the competition may change in the future with the entrance of new competitors in the market or with the amendments of the strategy of the already existed competitors. Also, in periods when the consuming spend is stable or decreasing, the competition can lead to redistribution of the market shares. The intensity of competition may negatively affect the turnover and the profitability of the Group.

7. Liquidity Risk The Group retains high level of cash and cash equivalents which exceed the total bank debt exposure while, in parallel, has pre-approved credit balances from banks in order to minimize liquidity risk. The Group, is also highly estimated by the Greek banks and its vendors, because of its 48 year dynamic course in the Greek market. The financial liabilities of the Group and the Company on 31.12.2017 and 31.12.2016 are analyzed as follows:

The Group considers its liabilities to suppliers as short-term. In the same category, other short term liabilities and tax liabilities are included. In consolidated terms, there is an increase in the liabilities from suppliers, while the loans and interest appear a decrease with extended maturity dates, in periods after the year end. Taking into consideration all the above mentioned acknowledgments and the assurance of the smooth repayment of the liabilities using the wide liquidity of the Group and the positive cash flows, this particular risk is limited for the following fiscal year.

The aforementioned evolution is attributed, mainly, to the formation of significantly high negative foreign exchange differences/evaluations (the evaluation of cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency, the evaluation of derivative contracts, and the daily transactions in foreign currency). The negative effect in the results of 2017, amounted to 2.257 th. Euro (compared to income of 674 th. Euro in 2016) and it is, mainly, attributed to the Group's cash in foreign currency in combination with the exchange rate between Euro and US Dollar which was devaluated. Earnings before Tax ­ Earnings after Tax The combination of the increase in the gross profit and the stability in the expenses drove to an increase of 11,26% in the earnings before taxes of the Group which came up to 7.288 th. Euro, compared to 6.551 th. Euro in 2016. The increase of the effective tax rate, by approximately 100 b.p. to 32,8% led earnings after taxes to increase by 9,48% and in consolidated terms to end up to 4.900 th. Euro.

UNIT G: ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ("APM")
As Alternative Performance Measure (APM) is considered, according to the definition of the European Capital Commission, a financial ratio which measures the historical or the future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, which is not defined by the IFRS. Even if APM are not included in IFRS, APM have to be evaluated supplementary with the figures provisioned by the IFRS and always in combination with the IFRS results. The Group uses in a limited extent the Alternative Performance Measures during the publication of the financial performance with target the better understandability of the operating results of the Group and its financial position. Plaisio has as a general principle, the presentation of the examined performance measures to be clear, in order the measures to be suitable and useful for the decision making by the users of the financial statements. The Group, both in the current and the previous year has not used adjusted APM,( i.e. adjustments in the figures of P&L, Balance Sheet or Cash Flow), as the Group has not implemented extraordinary actions (such as operating restructures or non-repeated revenue or expense) that are not in accordance with the main activity of the Group and which significantly affect the formation of these measures. The below amounts presented in th. Euro. A. Net Debt (Net Liquidity): Consist of an APM that is used in order to estimate the capital structure of the Group.
It is calculated as the difference between the total debt (long-term and short-term) and the total of cash and cash equivalents. If the result of the aforementioned difference is negative (as in the case of Plaisio) indicates the liquidity of the Company exceeds its total liabilities.

B. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation/amortisation ­ EBITDA: Constitutes the most used measure of operating effectiveness, because it considers only the expenses that are relative with the daily operation of the Group and the Company. EBITDA is the sum of the operating results (Earnings before taxes, interest and investing results), the depreciation and the impairment. EBITDA expressed as a percentage to sales is calculated by dividing EBITDA with the Turnover.

UNIT H: ASSESSMENT OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP DURING 2018
2017 was the year when the Greek economy developed after a multiannual recession period, as GDP increased by 1,4%. The investment in infrastructure, the income of the tourism and the exports, positively influenced the Greek economy. The private consumption slightly recovered in the first semester and, especially, in the second semester when the second evaluation was completed successfully by the Institutions, although, the trend was limited. In the retail sector, the indices showed a mixed trend, while the industrial production showed an increase. Moreover, there was a positive trend in the labour market, in which the unemployment decreased to 20,8%. The progressive improvement in the macroeconomic figures resulted in a credit rating upgrade of the Economy, the increase in the deposits which led to consecutive decreases in the dependence of the Greek banks from E.L.A.. Moreover, in the beginning of 2018, the Greek Economy raised funds from the bond market, after a three-year period. However, the high public debt, the slow movement on structural reforms and the high level of non-paid loans, still, burden the Economy. In such an environment, the estimations for 2018 are characterised by reserved optimism. GDP growth rate is expected to come up to 2,4%, driven by the tourism and exports growing for one more year. There are indications that during the current year, some significant investments may start such as the project in the area of "Elliniko", the airport in Kastelli and highways in the Central and Western Greece. These investments are expected to trigger the employment and private investments. On the other hand, the wealth of the Greek households constantly decreases due to the prolonged crisis, the tax measures focusing on higher tax payments by the individuals, the high insurance contributions for the companies and the individuals and the high level of unemployment (more than 20%). Also, there is no trend for increase in deposits and the salaries are in low levels. The products of the Group are addressed to all the income levels and for that reason the sales are elastic in relation to demand. However, Plaisio has proved its ability to adjust overtime to the needs of the Market and to create value for its shareholders and the Society. Taking all of the above into consideration, the Management observes and analyses on a continuous basis the volatile socioeconomic conditions in order to adjust its commercial policy, based on the flexible managerial structure and on the trained staff, in combination with the exceptional financial structure of the Group.

the Company uses, the risk of working accidents which even if it is limited, is a potential risk for every single enterprise, the risk of non-compliance with the principle of equality and in general with the rights of the employees, as well as the risk of bribery.

***************************
INTRODUCTION The term "Corporate Governance" describes the way with which companies are managed and controlled. Corporate Governance is stipulated as a system of relationships between the management of the Company, the Board of Directors, the shareholders and other interested parts and constitutes the structure through which the targets of the company are set, the main risks are identified, the means to achieve the set targets and to control the risks are defined and the observation of the performance of the management is monitored. Effective corporate governance holds a substantial and primary role to the advancement of competitiveness of companies, to the reinforcement of internal structure and the development of innovative actions, while the increased transparency it offers has as a result the improvement of overall transparency of economic activity of private businesses, public organizations and institutions, with obvious benefits for the shareholders, as well as the investment public. On October 2013, the new Code of Corporate Governance was published. This Code was drafted at the initiative of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV), and was later on amended, in the context of its first review by the Hellenic Corporate Governance Council (HCGC).

________________________________________________________________________
The Hellenic Corporate Governance Council, was founded in 2012 and is the result of synergy of the Hellenic Exchanges Group (HELEX) and the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV) that together recognized the contribution of corporate governance to the continuous enhancement of the Greek corporate institutional framework and broader business environment and also to the increase of reliability of the Greek market. Hence, since then HCGC works towards this direction.
1. Code of Corporate Governance 1.1 Disclosure of willing compliance of the Company with the Code of Corporate Governance In our country the framework of corporate governance has been developed mainly via the adoption of mandatory legislation or regulation, according to 3016/2002 as it stands today, which mandates among others the participation of non-executives and independent non-executives on the boards of Greek listed companies, as well as the establishment of an internal control function and the adoption of internal charters. Moreover, a number of other later laws such as 3693/2008, which mandates the creation of Audit Committees and a number of significant disclosure obligations regarding the ownership and governance of companies, and Law 3884/2010 on the rights of shareholders, which includes further obligations regarding disclosure of information to shareholders, prior to General Meetings, transposed several European directives in the area of the company law, for the protection and effective updating of the whole of the shareholders. Moreover, the Law 3873/2010 incorporates into Greek legislation the EU Directive 2006/46/EC, operating as a reminder of the need for establishment of a Corporate Governance Code and being simultaneously the cornerstone of the Code. Our company is in full compliance with the above mentioned laws. At this point the company states that it adopts as CGC the Code of Corporate Governance of the Hellenic Corporate Governance Council (HCGC) (available at http://www.helex.gr/el/eded), following the "comply or explain" approach.
1.2 Divergence from the Code of Governance and explanation of the non-compliance The Company states that it conforms to all legal obligations (law 2190/1920, law 3016/2002 and law 4449/2017). These obligations embody the minimum of any Corporate Governance Code, for listed companies. An important addition to the new Corporate Governance Code is the adoption of the standard of non-compliance of the Company with special practices of the Code. This means that the new Code follows the rule of "comply or explain" and requires from listed companies that choose to imply it, to publish their intentions and either comply with the whole of the Code's special practices, or explain the reasons of non-compliance with specific provisions. Regarding the above-mentioned additional practices and rules the new CGC applies, some deviations (including the case of non-compliance) are observed in the current period, for which a short explanation follows.
 Part  - Board of Directors and its Members . Role and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors - The BoD has not created separate committees, to manage the procedure of nominations to the Board and for the preparation of proposals for election in the BoD concerning the remuneration of the members of the BoD and the Management Team. This divergence is justified by the fact that the Company's policy regarding remuneration of members of the Bod and Management Team members is considered regular, consistent, stable and reasonable, and always adjusted to

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
the current economic environment conditions. This policy is always sustained and applied by the BoD, in order to avoid cases of extortionate compensations, that don't coincide with the provided services and the general economic situation of the country. It is noted that there are not unstable compensations (bonus, stock options) based on the policy of the Company, so the importance of existence of such a committee is limited. Furthermore, the non-existence of a separate committee that manages the procedure of applying candidates for the election in the BoD members is explained by the fact that applicants, from the establishment of the Company since today, meet all the necessary prerequisites and provide all the guarantees for being elected as members of the Board of Directors. They also stand out for their high professional brilliance, their knowledge, qualifications and experience. They are also of exceptional moral and personal integrity and therefore since today, there is no need for forming such a committee.
. Size and composition of the Board of Directors - The BoD is not comprised by seven (7) to fifteen (15) members. According to the Company's Memorandum and especially to article 10, paragraph 1, "The Company is directed by a Board that consists of three (3) to seven (7) members". This deviation is justified, as the size and organization of the Company, as well as the controlled and targeted expansion of the Company, also geographically and in a Group level, does not require such a numerous BoD. Also, the existence of a numerous BoD may, negatively affect, the flexible structure of the Company. - The policy of diversity, including the genders equilibrium of the BoD members, as this has been adopted by the BoD will be available at the Company's site. In the Corporate Governance Code a special statement should be included: a) regarding the diversity policy of the Company for the composition of the BoD and the Management Team and b) the percentage of each gender's representation respectively. The current BoD of the Company now consists by six members, five (5) of which are men and the sixth is a woman. This deviation is justified by the inability for the current period of finding women executives, to meet the high set requirements for becoming BoD members, due to the special characteristics the Company presents. It is among the near future priorities of the Company to find and add skillful women representatives to the BoD, without being able to determine accurately though the time frame of compliance with this rule of the CGC. This is because on the one hand, a relative interest should arise, but on the other, the needed requirements should be met.
. Role and Profile of the Chairman of the Board of Directors - There is no specific discern between the Chairman of the BoD and the CEO. This non-compliance is due to the fact that it is not considered as needed, given the structure and operation of the Company. If the Company's needs alter in the future, this matter of discernment of the Chairman and CEO will be re-evaluated. Furthermore the fact that the Vice-Chairman, also obtains the role of the CEO, substantially satisfies the above mentioned Code's prerequisite, since it creates a peer pole of management and representation of the Company. - The BoD does not appoint an independent Vice-Chairman arising from its independent board members. This divergence is counter-parted by the appointment of an executive Vice-chairman, whose contribution to the exercise of the executive duties of the Chairman is considered of utmost importance, for achieving the Company's goals in favor of the shareholders, the employees, the clients, the BoD members and the Management Team.

________________________________________________________________________
IV. Duties and Conduct of members of the Board of Directors - The BoD has not adopted as part of its internal rules, policies to ensure that the BoD holds enough information to make decisions regarding transactions between associated parties with the diligence of a prudent businessman. These policies should also be applied during transactions of the subsidiaries of the Company with the associated parties. Corporate Governance Statement should include a special report on the policies applied by the Company, regarding all the above-mentioned. Although such a special and specific policy, which forms the framework for provision of sufficient information from the side of the BoD, in order for decisions for transactions between associated parties to be made under the diligence of a prudent businessman, does not exist, the BoD while managing the Company's business issues and therefore during transactions between the Company and its associated parties, has the diligence of a prudent businessman. This is in order for these transactions to be absolutely transparent and in accordance with the markets terms and conditions (arm's length), but also in absolute compliance with the existing regulative law, as defined by the relevant regulations of the corporate and tax legislation. The same diligence is also shown regarding transactions of the subsidiaries of the Company with associated parties. At this point of time and based on the structural organization and operation of the Company, there is no need for constitution of such a special committee for the information of the BoD. - There is no obligation for analytical disclosure of any professional bounds of the BoD members (including important non-executive bounds to companies and non-profitable organizations) before their appointment in the BoD. This deviation is justified by the fact that the members of the BoD are distinguished for their professionalism and their concrete devotion to the Company, and therefore besides the absence of a statutory analytical disclosure of any professional bounds for the members of the BoD, prior their election to the Board they would proceed to such a disclosure, if they considered that any danger of conflict of interests existed.
V. Nomination of Board members - BoD members' maximum service is not four (4) years. According to article 10, paragraph 3 of the Company's Memorandum, "the service of the members of the BoD is five (5) years". This deviation is a result of the necessity of avoiding the election of BoD in shorter period of times, because of the fact that the provision for maximum service of four (4) years, carries the risk that the elected BoD will not be able to complete all the projects, placing in danger the effective management of the Company's business and the management of the Company's property, due to the continuous alteration of management teams and also due to the many different opinions that may exist regarding the Company's interests and activities. - There is no committee for selecting candidates for the BoD. This is justified by the size, structure and operation of the Company at the time being, which do not make necessary the existence of such a committee for selecting candidates. Besides that, every time before the election of a new BoD member, the Management of the Company, assures the existence and appliance of a transparent procedure, evaluates the size and the composition of the BoD member to be elected, examines the qualifications, knowledge, views, skills, experience, morals and integrity of the candidates and therefore the mission of a committee for selecting candidates if that existed, is fully accomplished.

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
VI. Operation of the Board of Directors - There is no specific rule for the operation of the BoD. This is justified by the fact that the Company's Memorandum regulations are considered to be adequate for the organization and operation of the BoD and ensure the full, right and on time fulfillment of its duties and the satisfactory examination of all matters upon which the BoD makes decisions. - The BoD at the beginning of every calendar year does not adopt a calendar of convocations and a 12month program of actions, which is eligible to alterations, according to the Company's needs. This divergence is justified by the fact that the members of the BoD are residents of Attica and therefore the calling and convocation of the BoD is easy every time it is necessary, without the existence of a strict pre-defined program of actions. - There is no provision for the support of the BoD during its work by a competent, specialized and experienced secretary, which will be present during the meetings. This is justified by the fact that state of the art technology exists to record and map the convocations of the BoD, because of the nature of the Company and the segment of its operation. Furthermore all BoD members have the ability, if it is considered necessary, to ask for support from the legal consultants of the Company, in order to ensure compliance with the existent legal and regulatory legislation. It is noted that according to the new Corporate Governance Code, a high level employee or a legal consultant, can act as a secretary, whilst the purpose of the secretary is the provision of practical support to the chairman and to the rest of the members of the BoD, in person and as a whole, with aim the total compliance of the BoD with the legal and Memorandum regulations and provisions. The Company will examine in the near future, the need for such a secretary. - There is no provision of programs for introductory information to the new members of the BoD or the constant education of the rest of the members. This is explained by the fact that for BoD members, only individuals with satisfactory and proven experience, high level of knowledge, as well as organizational and managerial skills, are proposed. Besides that, the Group has as a basic rule the constant education and training of its employees and managers, but also the reinforcement of the corporate consciousness in all levels, by frequently conducting educational seminars according to the sector each member is working in, or the duties it is responsible for. - There is no provision for supplying sufficient resources to the committees of the BoD for the fulfillment of their obligations and for the hiring of external consultants to the degree they are needed. This is justified by the fact that the Management of the Company examines and approves such resources for hiring of external consultants based every time on the needs of the company, for being able to control the operating expenses of the Company.
VII. Evaluation of the Board of Directors - There is no institutional procedure that takes place every two (2) years, aiming to assess the effectiveness of the BoD and its committees. The BoD does not assess the performance of the Chairman of the BoD during a certain procedure which the independent vice-chairman directs, or if one does not exists another non-executive member does.

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
During the current period an institutional procedure aiming to access the effectiveness of the BoD and its committees does not exist. Also the performance of the Chairman of the BoD is not assessed, during a procedure directed by the independent vice-president, or even another non-executive member of the BoD. Such a procedure is not considered to be necessary due to the organizational structure of the Company, since there are no boundaries between the members of the BoD. Therefore whenever weaknesses or malfunctions concerning the organization and operation of the BoD are identified, meetings are conducted and analytical discussions are made, during which the problems are presented, critique is made to decisions and other actions or statements of all members of the BoD that take place. Besides, the BoD observes and re-evaluates regularly the implementation of their made decisions, based on time plans set, while the BoD is annually assessed by the Regular General Meeting of the shareholders of the Company, conducted according to the regulations and the procedures described in detail in law 2190/1920 as well as to the Memorandum of the Company. The Company in order to comply with this particular rule, which the Corporate Governance Code has introduced, is currently examining the necessity of introducing a system of control and evaluation of the BoD, though the time frame of its completion cannot be accurately defined.
 Part - Audit Committee . Internal Control ­ Audit Committee - The audit committee does not convene at least four (4) times per year. This is explained by the call and meeting of the audit committee when substantial matters regarding the procedure of financial information and credibility of the financial reports of the Company rise. Besides, the aim is not conducting meetings without purpose, in order to cover the required by the CGC needed number but monitoring the effectiveness of internal audit procedures and management of risks the Company faces. Also the regular examination of its internal audit system, to ensure that the main risks are defined and faced effectively, that there is management of conflict of interests while conducting transactions with associated parties occur and that enough information regarding the financial performance of the Company is obtained. However, the audit committee informs the BoD, at least 4 times per year according to the Law, for results of its internal control. It is, also, noted the law 4449/2017 which referred to the Audit Control and it consists a European Law, does not include any provision regarding the minimum number that the Audit Committee should convene. - There is no special and specific rule for the operation of the audit committee. This divergence is explained by the fact that basic duties and responsibilities of the audit committee are adequately described by the existing legislation. Therefore the Company does not consider necessary at the present time the formation of such a specific internal rule for the operation of the above-mentioned committee, since what comes first is the adherence of the existing legislation. - No specific funds are given out to the audit committee for the use of external services or consultants. This is justified by the current composition of the audit committee and the special knowledge and experience of its members, which ensures its correct and effective operation in a sufficient way. Therefore the external service of consultants is not considered to be necessary.  Part C- Compensation . Level and structure of the compensation

Greek language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail over this document

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
________________________________________________________________________
- There is no committee of compensation, comprising exclusively of non-executive members, independent in their majority, which aims at defining the compensation of the executive and non-executive members of the BoD and thus there are no rules for the frequency of its convocations and other issues concerning its operation. This divergence is explained by the way the Company is structured and organized, a way that does not require the establishment of such a committee. Until today the Management of the Company redacts the procedure of defining the compensation and ensures this procedure is characterized by objectivity, transparency, professionalism and is deprived by any conflicts of interest. Regarding the specification of compensation of the BoD members, executive and non-executive ones, the Management of the Company, acts with the principle of creating a long-term company value, the sustainability of balance and meritocracy, for the shill of executives, that have the needed qualifications for the effective operation of the Company. The BoD, while defining the compensation of the BoD members and especially of the executive ones, takes into consideration their duties and responsibilities, their performance in relation to pre-defined quantitative and qualitative criteria, the economic environment, the performance and future prospects of the Company, the level of compensation for similar services in other relative companies, as well as the level of compensation of the Company's and Group's employees. From the above described procedure, it arises that the formation of such a specific committee is not necessary, since the duties and responsibilities of such a committee are efficiently performed by the BoD of the Company. - In the contracts of the executive members of the BoD, there is no provision for the BoD to ask for part or full refund of the bonuses paid due to revised financial statements of previous years or in general wrong financial data that were used to calculate such a bonus. This is explained by the fact that rights for bonuses rise, only after the final approval of financial statements. Also since today, because of the state of the art organization and auditing procedures, the phenomenon of a bonus calculation based on inaccurate financial statements and data has never occurred. - The compensation of every executive member of the BoD is not approved by the BoD after the proposal of the audit committee, without the presence of its executive members. This divergence is explained by the fact that such a committee does not exist.
 Part D - Relationship with shareholders . Communication with shareholders - The Company has not adopted a special practice regarding communication with its shareholders that includes the policy of the Company for questions made from shareholders to the BoD. At this particular time, an established special procedure regarding questions made by shareholders to the BoD does not exist, since every shareholder has the ability to address to the Investor's Relation Service, making requests and questions. If it is considered necessary, these are transferred in groups to the BoD for further processing and the relative answer or update is given to the interested party. Moreover the rules of article 39 of the law 2190/1920, describe in a detailed way the procedure of participation of the shareholders of minority to the General Assemblies of the Shareholders, a procedure always followed in every General Assembly, in order to ensure the valid and on time information of the shareholders, in relation to the evolvement of the corporate issues. Despite all the above-mentioned safeguards, the Company examines the possibility of adoption of a special policy, for upgrading the procedure for shareholders setting questions to the Company, through the Investors Relation

Service, although the direct communication of shareholders with BoD members is not considered to be necessary and appropriate.
. The General Assembly of the shareholders - No deviation was observed.
General Note regarding the time point of release of the non-compliance of the Company with the special practices adopted by the CGC As it was mentioned before (Introduction of Corporate Governance Statement), the new CGC, as it stands from October 2013 follows the "comply or explain" rule and demands from the listed companies that choose to apply it, to publish their intention and either comply with the whole of the special practises of the Code, either explain the reasons for non-compliance with certain special practises. Furthermore, the relevant explanation for non-compliance, is not only restricted to a simple mention of the general principle or the special practice with which the Company does not comply, but among others the Company should disclose whether this divergence is time framed and its intentions to comply with the codes principle. The divergences of the Company from the practices established by the new CGC are not thought to be subject to a strict time-frame, taking consideration that these practises do not correspond to the structure, organization, tradition, corporate values, ownership status and needs of the Company and maybe the compliance with these practises makes more difficult the application of the substance of the code's principles. In any case, no code can or is supposed to substitute the context of principles, values and structure of any Company and therefore the adoption of rules not compatible with these principles is not reasonable. Nevertheless, the Company has already formed a working group, that examines the existing divergences from the special practises of the new CGC, investigates the possibility of compliance with these and evaluates the possibility of establishment of its own Corporate Governance Code, the identity and regulations of which, will respond to the needs and specificities of the Company. This would promote the long term success and robust the competitiveness of the Company.

included in Note 11 of the separate and consolidated financial statements.
Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information is included in the Board of Directors' Report, as referred to the "Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" section, in the Declaration of the Board of Directors Representatives, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this respect. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the separate and consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's and Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless, management either intends to liquidate the Company and the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Audit Committee (art. 44 of Law 4449/2017) of the Company is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the separate and consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Legislation, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as incorporated in Greek Legislation, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the Company and the Group. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 1) Board of Directors' Report
Taking into consideration that management is responsible for the preparation of the Board of Directors' Report which and the Corporate Governance Statement that is include therein, according to the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 2 of L. 4336/2015 (part B), we note that: a) The Board of Directors' Report includes the Corporate Governance Statement which provides the information required by Article 43bb of Codified Law 2190/1920. b) In our opinion the Board of Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of articles 43a and 107A and of paragraph 1 (cases c' and d') of article 43bb of Codified Law 2190/1920 and its content is consistent with the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31/12/2017.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements These Company and consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Interpretations by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as they have been adopted by the European Union based on the Regulation 1606/2002 and IFRS that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting principles that have been used in the preparation and presentation of the annual financial statements are in accordance with those used for the preparation of the Company and Group financial statements as of December 31, 2016. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property at fair value. The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions, which affect the balances of the assets and liabilities, the contingencies disclosure as at the balance sheet date of the financial statements and the amounts of income and expense relating to the reporting year. Any differences between amounts in the primary financial statements and similar amounts detailed in the explanatory notes are due to rounding of figures.
2.2. New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations:
Certain new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for periods beginning during the current financial year and subsequent years. The Group's evaluation of the effect of these new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations is as follows:
Standards and Interpretations effective for the current financial year
IAS 7 (Amendments) "Disclosure initiative" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 - Endorsed by the EU on 6 November 2017). These amendments require entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendment to IAS 7 disclosed in note 16.
IAS 12 (Amendments) "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 - Endorsed by the EU on 6 November 2017). These amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014 ­ 2016 Cycle) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 7 February 2018) IFRS 12 "Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities" The amendement clarified that the disclosures requirement of IFRS 12 are applicable to interest in entities classified as held for sale or distribution according to IFRS 5, except for the summarised financial information required (par B10-B16).

___________________________________________________________________________
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued not yet effective, nor early adopted There are a number of standards and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods.

· IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 22 November 2016) IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 which deals with the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used today. IFRS 9 establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the current model in IAS 39. The Group will adopt the new standard in 2018, by adjusting the beginning balance of the retained earnings and the Group will not adjust the comparable year 2017. The most basic categories that will be influenced are analyzed below: The Group performs a provision for devaluation of the financial assets based on the receivables received period and probability by examining: the due dates of the customers' balances, the credit history and the payments made according to future settlements. The aforementioned are evaluated in combination with the estimation of the Group for the market risk at any point in time based on the condition of the market, the macroeconomic figures, the policies, the taxation and the international evolutions which influence the consuming behavior. The Group will proceed with the calculation of the impairment of the financial assets based on the expected credit losses. This calculation will not significantly affect the formed provision in the financial statements of the Group. The classification and the measurement of the financial assets of the Group will not be significantly affected from the adoption of the standard. Moreover, the investments of the Group should be measured in fair value and the respective changes in the fair value should be recognized in the results, a fact which will not significantly influence the financial statements of the Group. It is not expected any significant effect in the financial liabilities of the Group, given that they are not measured in fair value. It is expected that the application of the IFRS 9, will not have any significant effect in the financial statements of the Group and the Company. The necessary notes will be included in the statement regarding the new requirements of the standard.

IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 22 September 2016) & IFRS 15 (Clarifications) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 31 October 2017) The objective of the standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model. IFRS 15 establishes a fivestep model which will be applied for revenues gained from contract with a customer and the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue in a way that it will depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be adopted and applied by the Group from the 1st January 2018. At the first application of the IFRS 15, the Group will apply the standard for 2018 and for the previous periods. The Group will recognize the accumulated result of the application of the IFRS 15 for all the contracts which were not completed on the 1st January 2018 as adjustment in the beginning balance of the Equity on the 1st January 2018. The Group has evaluated the below as the most significant effects from the adoption of the standard: 1) Revenue from providing specific services (e.g. warranty extension) was recognized on the selling date based on the IAS
18. According to IFRS 15, a company should recognize the revenue when it fulfils a liability with the delivery of a

language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail

___________________________________________________________________________
product or a service. The aforementioned amendment in the accounting treatment is in force, only, in the cases in which the customer can purchase the warranty independently from the product. In the cases, that the warranty is included in the price of the product but there is not the choice to purchase the product without the warranty, then the warranty is recognized based on the IAS 37. 2) For the time being, the Group recognizes the discount rights that it offers to the customers through coupons (vouchers) when the voucher is redeemed. According to IFRS 15, the right for future discounts must be recognized at the first recognition of the revenue/sale which gives the discount right to the customer. The Group estimates the fair value of the non-redeemed vouchers by using the historical and statistical data. Based on the best of the estimations of the Management and the current information the future effects in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in 2018 will not be significant. The effect in the statement of profit or loss in 2018 will result in:  In the cases of warranties in force on 1st January 2018, lower revenue from services and,  In the cases of vouchers in force on 1st January 2018, lower revenue from product sales. The Group evaluated the relative revenues, implementing the five-step approach described in the standard, in order to detect the areas that may be affected. Some contract liabilities will be appeared subtractive to the turnover influencing the gross profit and the distribution expenses, without a significant effect in the earnings after taxes. Significant effects in the earnings and losses compared with the current accounting treatment may happen, only, triggered by commercial reasons. Based on the current estimation of the Management, IFRS 15 will not significantly affect the financial statements of the Company at its first adoption and at the later ones.
IFRS 16 "Leases" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 31 October 2017) IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. The Management of the Group estimates that the aforementioned standard will significantly affect the parent and the consolidated statement of financial position due to the fact that the present value of the future leasing payments for building leases and other agreements (mainly vehicles) will be recognized as right-of-use asset in total assets and as right-of-use liability in total liabilities. For the moment, the future leasing payments are presented in the financial statements in their nominal value (note 26).
Other Standards and Interpretations The amendments below will not significantly affect the financial statements of the Company and the Group.
IFRIC 22 "Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU). The interpretation provides guidance on how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on foreign currency transactions. The Interpretation applies where an entity either pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currency denominated contracts.
IFRIC 23 "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU).

*These financial statements and notes to the financial statements have been translated to English from the original statutory notes that have been prepared in the Greek

language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
___________________________________________________________________________
The interpretation is to be applied when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. An entity is required to use judgement to determine whether each tax treatment should be considered independently or whether some tax treatments should be considered together. If the entity concludes that it is not probable that a particular tax treatment is accepted, the entity has to use the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment in its calculations.
IFRS 17 "Insurance Contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU). The standard measures insurance contracts either under a general model or a simplified version at current value. Companies will report estimated future payments to settle incurred claims on a discounted basis and use current discount rates that reflect the characteristics of the financial risks as well as a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
Other Amendments
IFRS 4 (Amendments) "Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 3 November 2017). The amendments introduce two approaches. The amended standard will: a) give all companies that issue insurance contracts the option to recognise in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard is issued; and b) give companies whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 2021.
IFRS 2 (Amendments) "Classification and measurement of Shared-based Payment transactions" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 26 February 2018). The amendment clarifies the measurement basis for cash-settled, share-based payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014 ­ 2016 Cycle) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ Endorsed by the EU on 7 February 2018) IAS 28 "Investments in associates and Joint ventures" The amendments clarified that when venture capital organisations, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities use the election to measure their investments in associates or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), this election should be made separately for each associate or joint venture at initial recognition.
IFRS 1 "First-time adoption of IFRS" IFRS 1 has been amended to remove short-term exemptions which are no longer applicable and had been available to entities for reporting periods that have now passed.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
___________________________________________________________________________ IAS 40 (Amendments) "Transfers of Investment Property" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU). The amendments clarified that to transfer to, or from, investment properties there must be a change in use. To conclude if a property has changed use there should be an assessment of whether the property meets the definition and the change must be supported by evidence. A change in management's intentions alone does not constitute evidence of change in use.
IFRS 9 (Amendments) "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU). The amendment clarifies that an entity can measure at amortised cost some prepayable financial assets with negative compensation. The assets affected, that include some loans and debt securities, would otherwise have been measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Negative compensation arises when the prepayment amount could be less than unpaid amounts of principal and interest.
IAS 28 (Amendments) "Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU). The amendment clarifies that an entity should apply IFRS 9 to other financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity's net investment in an associate or joint venture.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015 ­ 2017 Cycle) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU)
IFRS 3 "Business Combinations" The amendment clarifies that when an entity obtains control over a previously held interest in a joint operation that is a business, it must remeasure its previously held interest at the acquisition-date fair value and recognize any difference as a gain or loss.
IFRS 11 "Joint Arrangements" The amendment clarifies that when an entity participates in a joint operation that is a business and obtains joint control, it must not remeasure its previously held interest at the acquisition-date fair value.
IAS 12 "Income Taxes" The amendment clarifies that the income tax consequences of dividends must be recognized at the same time as the liability to pay those dividends is recognized and in the same statement where the entity originally recognised the past transactions or events that generated the distributable profits from which the dividends are being paid.
IAS 23 "Borrowing Costs" The amendment clarifies that once a qualifying asset funded through specific borrowings becomes ready for its intended use or sale, those borrowings then become part of the pool of general borrowings. Therefore, from that date, the rate applied on those borrowings is included in the determination of the capitalisation rate applied to general borrowings.

IAS 19 (Amendments) "Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU) The amendment specifies that entities should determine pension expenses when changes to a defined benefit pension plan occur during an annual reporting period, by requiring the use of the updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after the date of change to the plan.
Other changes not endorsed by the EU IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendment) "Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture" (deferred indefinitely ­ it has not yet been endorsed by the EU) The amendment will be adopted by the companies in the future for the sales or contributions of assets for periods starting following the 01.01.2016. The Company will evaluate the effect of the aforementioned amendment in its financial statements, even if it is not expected any effect.

2.3. Consolidated financial statements

a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated (full consolidation) from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and they are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group' share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the income statement. When the Group increases its shareholding in a subsidiary, the difference between the price paid and the book value of the net assets of that subsidiary is recorded directly in equity. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Company accounts for its investment in subsidiaries, in its stand-alone accounts, on the cost less impairment basis.

(b) Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted by using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group's investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, (net of any accumulated impairment loss). The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or has made payments on behalf of the associate. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Investments in associates are accounted for in the Company financial statements at the cost less impairment basis.

2.4. Segment reporting The operational segments are regularly considered by the Management and they appeared in the financial statements in the same basis as they are used for internal purposes of the Group. The operational segments are defined as a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different

language. In the event that differences exist between this translation and the original Greek language financial statements, the Greek language financial statements will prevail

___________________________________________________________________________
from those of other business segments. The results of operational segments are regularly evaluated by the decision makers in order to make decisions relative to distribution of resources to the segment and assessing its performance.
2.5. Conversion of foreign currency (a) Operating currency and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ("the operating currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company's operating and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the operating currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
(c) Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet ii. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions) and iii. All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity and transferred in Income Statement with the sale of those entities. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
2.6. Tangible fixed assets All property, plant and equipment ("PPE") is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group higher than the initially expected according to the initial return of the financial asset and under the assumption that the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Costs required for development and improvement of the computer software programmes are capitalised.

___________________________________________________________________________
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on PPE is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, in order to write down the cost in its residual value. The expected useful life of property, plant and equipment is as follows:

- Buildings: - Vehicles & mach. equipment: - Other equipment:

30 - 50 years 5 ­ 10 years 3 ­ 6 years

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. When the carrying amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount, the resulting difference (impairment loss) is recognized immediately as an expense in the income statement. In case of sale of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized as profit or loss in the income statement.
2.7. Intangible Fixed Assets Computer Software Software licences are evaluated at cost minus depreciation and any impairment cost. The software depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and within a period of 3 - 5 years. Expenses that are required for the development and repair of software are recognized as expenses when they are realized. Expenses for the development of specific software, controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets, when: a. there is the technical possibility to complete the software so that it is available for use or sale, b. there is the intention to complete and sell or use the item, c. there is the possibility to sell or use the item, d. the asset is going to produce future benefits. There has to be evidence that there is a market for the item or its production or if it is going to be used internally to prove the usefulness of the item in other segments of the entity, e. it is certain that adequate technical, financial and other resources will be available to ensure the completion and sale or use of the item, f. there is the possibility to measure reliably the expenses directly attributed. Expenses that are capitalized comprise of the cost of material and services used or are consumed as well as the cost of the benefits to the employees that comes about directly from the production of the item.
2.8. Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value, less costs to sell and value in use. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense to the Comprehensive Income Statement, when they occur.

___________________________________________________________________________
2.9. Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, available-for-sale, investment in subsidiaries, derivative financial instruments and hedging activities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has three sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception and derivatives. Assets in this category are classified as current if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Also, the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and with no intention of trading. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.
(c) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the above categories. They are included in non-current assets, unless management intends the disposal of investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date ­ the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the "financial assets at fair value through profit or loss" category are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value of financial assets that are classified as available for sale are recognized in revaluation reserves. In the cases of sales or impairment of the financial assets held for trading purposes, the accumulated adjustments in the fair value are transferred to the statement of profit or loss. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss ­ measured as the difference between acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss ­ is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
___________________________________________________________________________
2.10. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in Group's results (income statement). Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). Certain derivative instruments not qualified as hedging instruments and no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, are classified as derivatives available for sale and accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognized immediately in the income statement within `Other operating income / (expenses) - net'. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as: 1) hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or 2) derivatives at fair value through the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not attributable to hedging are recognized immediately in the income statement within `Other operating income / (expenses) ­ net'.
2.11. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Differences between cost and net realisable value are recognised as losses in the income statement when they arise. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. It excludes financial costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any applicable selling expenses. Certain provisions are formed for devaluated, not usable and with a very low turnover inventories. The decrease in the cost of inventories to the net realizable value and all other damage to the inventories are posted in the P&L of the period in which they appear.
2.12. Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value (invoice value) and are then valuated in their un-depreciated cost, using the real interest rate, deducting any impairment losses. The impairment losses are recognized when there is objective evidence that it is not going to collect the amount owed to it, based on the selling terms. Significant financial difficulties, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization and the delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognized as expense in the income statement within `Other operating income / (expenses) ­ net'. The amount of the impairment loss is posted as expense in the "Other Expenses" of the P&L. When a trade receivable is characterized as "not-to-be-collected" it is written off, using the account for provisions. In case a receivable which was written off is collected, the other expenses are credited in "the Other Expenses" of the P&L.
2.13. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term bank deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturity dates of three (3) months or less and insignificant risk.

___________________________________________________________________________
2.14. Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown after the reduction of the relative income tax in reduction to the product of issue. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares for the acquisition of other entities are included in the cost of acquisition of the new company. The acquisition cost of own shares is presented as decreasing in equity until the own shares are sold or cancelled. Any profit or loss from the sale of own shares, net of direct to the transaction other expenses and taxes is presented as a reserve in quity.

2.15. Trade and other payables The trade and other payables are recognized initially in their fair value and after that in their undepreciated value based on the method of effective interest rate.

2.16. Debt Banking loans are recognized initially at fair value, decreased by any transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, they are stated at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognized in the profit and loss statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

2.17. Income Tax (Current and Deferred) The income tax of the subsidiaries and associates of the Group is calculated based on the relevant laws that apply at the date of the Balance Sheet in the countries where they act and where the taxable income occurs. The management periodically checks the calculations of the tax and in cases where the relevant tax law can be interpreted in different ways; it forms a relevant provision for the surplus amount that is expected to be paid to the local tax authorities. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business merger that at the time of the transaction affects neither the period's income tax includes the current tax, the deferred tax and the provisions for unaudited tax periods. Income tax is recognized in the income statement of the period, except for the tax relating to transactions that have been booked directly to equity, in which case it is, accordingly, booked to equity accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and liabilities shall be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

2.18. Employee Benefits (a) Current benefits Current employee benefits, monetary and in items, are recognized as an expense when they accrue. (b) Benefits for employee compensation

The aforementioned payments depend on the years of working experience, the remunerations, and the way of leaving the company (dismissal or resignation). The compensations for pensions and dismissals fall under the defined benefit plans according to the IFRS 19 «Employee benefits». he above obligations are calculated based on an actuarial projected unit credit method. A program of specific benefits that operates taking into consideration various factors such as age, years of experience, remuneration and other specific obligations. The provisions that concern the fiscal year, are included in the relative personnel cost in the attached consolidated financial statements and consist of the current and previous personnel cost, the relative financial cost, the actuarial profits or losses and any other possible charges. According to the non-recognized actuarial profits or losses, the amended IAS 19 is applied, which includes a series of amendments regarding the accounting of defined benefit plans among others: 1. Actuarial gains and losses will be recognized in other comprehensive income and they will be definitely excluded from

2. The net interest on the net defined benefit liability during the reporting period that arises from passage of time and is determined by multiplying the need defined benefit liability by the discount rate
3. Past service costs are recognized in the income statement in the period when a plan is amended.
4. Other changes include extended disclosures, as quantitative sensitivity analysis
2.19. Subsidies State subsidies are recognized at their fair value when there is the certainty that the subsidy is going to be collected and the Group will comply with all the terms. State Grants that refer to expenses, are deferred and are recognized in the results so that they are matched by the expense they are going to subsidize.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the increases specific to the liability.

___________________________________________________________________________
Revenue includes the fair value of the sales of goods and services, net of VAT, deductions and returns. The intercompany revenue of the Group is fully eliminated. The Group recognizes the income when the amount can be measured reliably, when the Group expects future inflows and when the criteria that are mentioned below, for each separate category, are met. The amount of the sale is not considered to be measured reliably if any contingent obligations are related to the income. The Group bases its estimations on historical data, taking into consideration the category of the customer, the type of transaction and the specific terms of the contract. Revenue is recognized as follows: a) Sales of goods Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when the Group delivers the Goods to the customers, the goods are accepted by them and the collection of the receivable is assured.
b) Provided Services
Income from services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, based on the stage of completion of the services provided in relation to the total services to be provided.
c) Interest income Interest income is recognized in the income statement on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues accreting the discount as interest income. Afterwards, interests are calculated by using the same rate on the impaired value (new carrying amount).
d) Dividend income
Income from dividends is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
2.22. Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases of property, plant and equipment which the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease's inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term if classified as tangible assets, while if classified as investment properties they are not depreciated but presented in their fair value.
2.23. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the Group's financial statements when the dividend distribution is approved by the Company's General Assembly.

3. Risk management policies

3.1. Factors of financial risk The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.

The main risks are:

(a) Market risk i) Foreign exchange risk
The foreign exchange risk is the risk of volatility of the value of financial assets, of assets and liabilities due to changes in the exchange rates. The majority of the Group's transactions and balances are in Euro. However, given the fact that the Group transacts in an international level and as a result is exposed to foreign exchange risk resulting, mainly, be the U.S. dollar. The Group holds deposits in foreign currency (note 13). Furthermore, there are no loan liabilities in a currency other than the Euro. The Group in certain cases, outweighs the foreign exchange risk, by awarding derivative contracts, but does not use with hedge accounting. The Management of the Group observes at all times the trends in the foreign exchange market and the potential risks that may arise from its fluctuations and evaluates the need for relevant measures. The activity of the Group in Bulgaria is not considered to enhance currency risk, as the exchange rate of the Bulgarian currency to the Euro is fixed.

ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Based on these scenarios, the group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. The policy of the Company regarding the capital structure is to keep loans at a low level, assuring at the same time that there is a financing capability from the banks that Plaisio cooperates with, to satisfy without problems the planned development of the Group. The long-term bond loans of the Company and the Group, on December 31st 2017, were 11.273 th. Euro (877 th. Euro on 31.12.2016), the short-term bond loans were 1.604 th. Euro (584 th. Euro on 31.12.2016). From the total bond loans (12.877 th. Euro), the 6.877 th. Euro refers to two common bond loans from NBG, while the remaining 6.000 th. Euro refers to a common bond loan with floating interest rate from Eurobank SA.. The short-term bank loans were null in 31.12.2017 (14.000 th. Euro in 31.12.2016). The aim of the issuance of the two new bond loans of total amount of 12.000 th. Euro in 2017, was the refinancing of the short-term bank loans of the Group with loans with longer payment terms. As a consequence, the total short-term bank loans of the Company were repaid (14.000 th. Euro in 31.12.2016) and the total debt decreased to 12.877 th. Euro from 15.461 th. Euro in 31.12.2016. The following table presents the sensitivity of the results of the period as well as the net equity to a change of the interest rate of +1% or -1%. Due to the lower debt exposure, the sensitivity of the results appeared more limited. The relevant influence is presented as follows: A) Interest Rate increase by 1%: The results of the period as well as the net equity of the Group and of the Company, in that case, would decrease by 120 th. Euro and 140 th. Euro on 31.12.2017 and 31.12.2016 respectively.

___________________________________________________________________________
B) Interest Rate decrease by 1%: The results of the period as well as the net equity of the Group and of the Company, in that case, would increase by 120 th. Euro and 140 th. Euro on 31.12.2017 and 31.12.2016 respectively. The level of the interest rates is positively influenced in a micro-economic level by the capital structure of the Group and the stable timeless repayments of any kind of financial liabilities and the co-operation relationships the Group retains with the banks. As a consequence, it is noted the wide liquidity of the Group and the fact that the cash and cash equivalents exceed the Group's total short-term and long-term borrowings in the last years.
iii) Turnover Seasonality Sales' seasonality demands rational working capital management and smooth inventory inflows in order to avoid any shortage. The Group's sales are characterized by seasonality as 55% of the total sales are realized in the second half of the year. In the second semester of the year, the sales from the beginning of the school and academic year, the sales from Black Friday and the sales from the Christmas period are realized. Despite the seasonality, the Management estimates the referred risk as limited due to the wide liquidity and the ability to act immediately in cases of necessity of increased inventory and due to the retention of sufficient inventory for the needs of the Group (the inventory on 31.12.2017 was translated in almost the average sales of a quarter of the corporate year).
iv) Intensity of Competition The Company operates in an intensively competitive industry, as there are many retailers which operate in the consumer electronics sector. However, due to the multi-product approach of the Group, it is not an easy exercise to identify an identical business model in the market. In any case, the Group achieves over time one of the best performance margins, and consistently appears profitability, facts that prove the success in the referred Market. However, the competition may change in the future with the entrance of new competitors in the market or with the amendments of the strategy of the already existed competitors. Also, in periods when the consuming spend is stable or decreasing, the competition can lead to redistribution of the market shares. The intensity of competition may negatively affect the turnover and the profitability of the Group.
(b) Credit risk Credit risk is managed on Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Sales are made mainly to customers with an assessed credit history and credit limits. Also, certain sales and collection terms are applied. Whenever possible, further securities are requested for outstanding receivables. The Management, on the one hand because of the large dispersion of the Group's customers, and on the other hand because of the significant provision it has formed for doubtful receivables, given that its environment is one of increased credit risk, evaluates the risk as controlled. Retail sales are paid in cash or via credit cards. For wholesales the Group has the necessary policies in order to give credit, by examining the creditworthiness of the customers in every single case separately. Furthermore, it is a policy of the Group that the largest amount of its receivables is insured. The concentration of credit risk relative to customers is presented in Note 11.
(c) Liquidity Risk

The Group considers that the total liabilities to suppliers are short-term, while in the same category includes other shortterm liabilities, as well as the tax liabilities. In consolidated terms, it is observed an increase in trade payables, while the loans and the interests are decreased and with longer due dates. Taking into account all the above and the security of the repayment of the aforementioned liabilities through the broad liquidity of the Group, and the positive cash flows, for the current and the next year, the examined risk is absolutely controlled.

3.2. Capital risk management (capital structure) The Group's and Company's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern and in parallel to maximize the yield for the shareholders and the utility for other stakeholders through the optimization of the capital structure (debt and equity). In order to maintain the effective capital structure for the shareholders, the Management can propose to the General Assembly the adjustment of the dividend yield depending the conditions, or the return of the share capital to the shareholders (this happened based on the results of 2014), and in case of need for working capital, the increase of share capital with cash. In the following two tables information for the net borrowing of the Group and the Company is given.

THE GROUP Total Loans Minus: Cash & cash equivalents Net Borrowing

31.12.2017 12.877
(49.862) (36.985)

31.12.2016 15.461
(42.792) (27.331)

THE COMPANY Total Loans Minus: Cash & cash equivalents Net Borrowing

31.12.2017 12.877
(48.774) (35.897)

31.12.2016 15.461
(42.051) (26.590)

From all the above, cash and cash equivalents are multiple times more than the total loans, eliminating the need for targeted policy regarding the management of the examined risk.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments of the Management Estimates and judgments of the Management are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. For the Annual Financial Statements of December 31st 2017 the basic accounting principles and assumptions of the Balance Sheet of December 31st 2016 apply.

5. Segment information (figures in th. Euro)

The Management of the Group recognizes three main segments of its operation (the product categories): a) Office products, b) PCs & Digital Technology products and c) Telecommunications products, as its main operation segments. The before mentioned operation segments are those used by the management team for observation of sector evolutions and the strategic decisions are thus made, taking into consideration the results, efficiency and productivity of each one separately. There are two more segments of a less importance and are included in the category "other". The main source of revenue for these two segments is the provision of service for the PCs and the provision of transportation services.

The segment results for the year ending 31 December 2017 were as follows:

The total turnover of the Group in 2017 came up to 286.098 th. Euro, having increased by 1,1%, compared to 2016. The sales decreased during the first half of the year (-3,4%), but in the second half the trend reversed and the sales increased by 5%. In addition, in combination with the lower increase of the cost of sales, the gross profit improved by 7%, and as a result, for the whole year increased by 2,8%. Improved performance was achieved in the operation results and in EBITDA. The sales of personal computers and digital equipment remained almost the same compared to 2016 figures (138.303 th. Euro and 139.750 th. Euro, respectively). The sales of the office products remained almost stable (+0,2%) to almost 95 million Euro. Telephony sector was the one which contributed to the increase in the total sales. Telephony sector appeared an almost two-digit increase (9,3%), exceeding the 51 million Euro, compared to the 47 million Euro in 2016. The above changes in the turnover in every sector brought changes in the participation of each sector to the total turnover of the Group. As a result, the Telephony sector contributed by 18,0% to total sales in 2017, compared to 16,7% in 2016. The Office Equipment sector marginally decreased as it contributed by 33,1% in the consolidated sales, compared

The Group takes all the necessary precautions (insurance, security) in order to minimize the risk and contingent damages from loss of inventory from natural disasters, thefts etc. The group is activated in the high technology area, where the danger of technological devaluation is increased; the management examines constantly the net realizable value of stock and forms all the necessary provisions so that the value in the financial statements matches the true value. On 31.12.2017 the total inventory remained at the 2016 levels amounting 61.212 th. Euro and 60.168 th. Euro, while the provision for devaluation was 8.970 th. Euro and 8.945 th. Euro for the Group and for the Company respectively. The respective amounts for 2016 was 61.997 th. Euro and 60.751 th. Euro (Inventory), and 11.260 th. Euro and 11.237 th. Euro (Provision for devaluation) for the Group and the Company. The provision for devaluation is estimated by taking into account the inventory turnover which was improved due to the significant higher sales achieved by the Group in the 2nd half of the year. On 31.12.2017 the provision for inventory devaluation formed to 14,7% compared to 18,2%. The main reason for the decrease in percentage is the revaluation of the devaluation rates by the Management, based on the current market conditions.

Despite the increase in the trade receivables by 1.153 th. Euro compared to 2016 the ageing and the insurance terms have been improved. Taking the above into account, the percentage of the formed provision for the current year appeared a decrease (19,4% compared to 23,1% in 2016), but remained in a satisfactory high level confirming the conservative policy of the Management. In any case, the Management examines the amount of receivables; taking into account historical data and the respective market trends in order to form high level of provision in relation with the trade receivables and to control the risk. The changes in provisions of bad-debts are as follows:

THE COMPANY 2017 4.700 (530) 4.170

2016 5.062 (362) 4.700

The above mentioned bad-debt provision includes: a) a strictly defined provision for all the customers that have been characterized as doubtful, b) a specific provision for all the customers that have overdue balances based on the ageing of their balances, c) a provision, based on the increased level of risk because of the conditions of the economic environment, taking in consideration: 1) the reduced liquidity of Greek businesses and 2) the difficult access to bank financing. It is noted that this provision includes also non-overdue receivables. For this provision the balances of all the customers have been taken into account, with the exception of the receivables from Plaisio Computers JSC, as it is considered that there is no risk of non-collection for these particular balances. d) the Group has already moved to a provision for the balances from the Public Sector. It is noted that in the
aforementioned provision includes non-overdue balances as well.

All the above receivables are short-term and there is no need to discount them at the date of the balance sheet. Other receivables refer to down payments, accommodation money to personnel, vendor's advance payments and pre-calculated purchase discounts. Receivables from Public Sector concern the debit balance of the account "Income Tax", due to the fact that down-payment for 2014 exceeded the respective liability for 2015 and was sufficient to cover the tax liability of 2016 and consequently, in 31.12.2016 the receivable which presented in accounting terms appeared an increase. The Group proceeds to impairment tests and forms the relevant provisions regularly at each balance sheet date.

the paid share capital. The legal reserve can only be used, after approval of the Annual General meeting of the shareholders, to offset retained losses and therefore cannot be used for any other purpose. (b) Special reserves The special reserves includes a) a reserve that was created following a decision of the Annual General meeting in prior periods. This reserve was not created for any specific purpose and can therefore be used for any reason following approval from the Annual General Assembly and b) reserves which were created under the provisions of Greek law. The before-mentioned reserves have been created by already taxed profit and therefore are not taxed furthermore in case they are distributed or capitalized. In the special reserves, an amount of 4.894 th. Euro is included, which refers to Reserves formed with the first adoption of IFRS that was realized on January 1st 2005. (c) Other Reserves Other reserves are created under the provisions of tax law from tax free profits, income, or profits taxed under special provisions. The above-mentioned reserves can be capitalized or distributed, after the approval of the Annual General meeting, after taking into consideration the restrictions which will apply at each time. The Group does not intend to distribute or capitalize these reserves and therefore has not calculated the income tax that would apply in this case. With article 72 of the law 4172/2013, the non-distributed or capitalized tax free reserves of entities as stated in the last financial statement before 01.01.2014 are taxed with a tax rate of 19%. From 01.01.2015, it is not allowed to keep special accounts for tax-free reserves.
The Extraordinary General Assembly which took place on 16/12/2014 decided the capitalization of the tax-free reserves that have been formed based on the c.l. 2238/1994, according to article 72 of c.l. 4172/2013, of amount 144 th. Euro (net amount which remains after the deduction of the taxes (19%) to the total amount of tax-free reserves which were 178 th. Euro). The taxation of the reserves took place in 2014, while the capitalization of these reserves approved by the decision of the Ministry of Development with virtue number K2-7315/21-01-2015.
(d) Actuarial Losses Reserves As a consequence of adopting the amended IAS 19, the Group changed the accounting policy regarding the recognition of actuarial losses and profits, arising from the before mentioned benefit plan of employees. An analytical presentation of the way of formation of this particular reserve and also of the effect of this change of policy is presented in Note 18.

In 2017, the Management of the Company decided to refinance its short-term bank loans by bond loans with long-

term repayment terms.

As a result, the short-term bank loans of the Company fully repaid (14.000 th. Euro in 31.12.2016) and the decrease

of the total debt to 12.877 th. Euro from 15.461 th. Euro in 31.12.2016.

The level of the interests is influenced by many factors which have been analysed on the unit "Interest rate risk".

Estimating the increased risk of the interest rates the Management, carefully, considers the related evolutions and acts in

order to smooth any negative effects. It is noted that cash and cash equivalents of the Group on 31.12.2017, exceed the

total of bank debt.

The long term bank loans appeared an increase of approximately 11,4 mil. Euro compared to the end of 2016 while the

total debt appeared a decrease by 2.584 th. Euro and refers to:

 12-year common Bond Loan, non-convertible to stocks of remaining balance 877 th. Euro from the National Bank of

Greece S.A.

 5-year common Bond Loan, non-convertible to stocks of 6.000 th.  with one year and a half of no capital payment and

a floating rate. The empowered for the bank payments and the representative of the Bond holders was appointed

the bank Eurobank Ergasias S.A.. The amount of 5.400 th.  was contracted with Eurobank Ergasias S.A. and the

remaining 600 th.  with Eurobank Private Bank Luxembourg S.A..

 6-year common Bond Loan, non-convertible to stocks of 6.000 th.  with one year of no capital payment. The

empowered for the bank payments and the representative of the Bond holders was appointed the bank National

Bank of Greece S.A.. The amount of 5.820 th.  was contracted with National Bank of Greece S.A. and the remaining

180 th.  with NBG Bank Malta LTD.

On 31.12.2017 and 31.12.2016 the Company and the Group has complied with the above mentioned covenants.

The level of the interest rates is positively influenced in a micro-economic level by the capital structure of the Group and

the stable timeless repayments of any kind of financial liabilities and the co-operation relationships the Group retains with

the banks. As a consequence, it is noted the wide liquidity of the Group and the fact that the cash and cash equivalents

exceed the Group's total short-term and long-term borrowings in the last years.

The Deferred tax assets and receivables are offset when there is a legal right that makes it applicable to offset current net tax assets over liabilities and when the Deferred Taxes refer to the same tax authority. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are presented offset in the figure "Deferred Tax Assets" in the statement of financial position as at 31.12.2017, given that the financial statements of the subsidiary company Plaisio Computers JSC, do not present Deferred Tax Liability but only asset.

18. Provisions for pensions and similar commitments (Figures in thousand )

According to the labor law, employees are entitled of compensation in case they are dismissed or retired, the amount of which differs according to the wage, the years of experience and the way of their leave (dismissal or retirement). Employees that resign or are rationally dismissed are not entitled to any compensation. In Greece, employees that retire are entitled to 40% of such compensation according to the Law 2112/1920. Those schemes are not financed and are the part of specified compensation schemes according to IAS 19. The Group had an independent actuarial study done on personnel compensation according to IAS 19. The evolvement of the net liability, in the Statement of Financial Position, after the adoption of the amended IAS 19, is analyzed below:

20. Deferred Income (Figures in thousand )

The investment that took shape in Magoula Attikis, came under the provisions of the development law 3299/2004 (subjection decision 32278/YPE/4/00513/N.3299/2004). Part of government grant amounted to  2.153 th., received by the company during 2010, is included in short and long-term liabilities and acts deductive to the relative cost of depreciations. Moreover, with 18420//4/00513//.3299/28.4.2011 decision of the undersecretary of competitiveness and shipping (Government Gazette, issue B, 1078/1.6.2011) the completion of the investment was certified and the cost and commencement of the productive operation of the investment was finalized. With the above mentioned decision the remainder of the subsidy was approved, amounting to 2.259 th. Euro. It is noted that the total amount of the subsidy came up to 4.412 th. Euro. State grants are posted in their value when there is the certainty that the grant will be collected and the Group will comply to all the relevant terms. The state grants that are intended for the purchase of tangible assets are posted under long term liabilities and are posted in the Income Statement through the method of depreciation based on remaining lifetime of the fixed assets that the grant refers to. For this year 01.01.2017-31.12.2017 the depreciation of grants came up to 130 th. Euro. The state grants that concern expenses are deferred and posted directly in Income Statement, when the granted expense is posted, so that the expense and the income is matched.
