2.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
PPC was established in 1950 having as purpose to generate, transmit and distribute electricity throughout the Greek territory. Prior to the establishment of PPC, the right to generate, transmit and distribute electricity had been assigned by the Greek Government to private and municipal electricity companies.
PPC started its operation in 1953 by generating and selling electricity to the abovementioned private and municipal electricity companies. During the period 1957-1963, the Company acquired the above electricity companies, including the Electric Company of Athens - Piraeus Ltd, which used to service the largest urban area of Greece and was generating a significant percentage of the total electricity consumed in the Greek market.
The L.s 1559/1985 and 2244/1994, provided for a relevant exception from PPC's exclusive right in electricity generation mainly in order to give the right to industrial companies to generate electricity for their own consumption. Moreover, said legislation allowed individuals to generate electricity from renewable sources and cogeneration exclusively for commercial use.
By virtue of L. 2773/1999 concerning the liberalization of the electricity market and pursuant to the Presidential Decree 333/2000, PPC, as of January 1st 2001, was converted into a societe anonyme wholly owned by the Greek State having as main purpose the generation and supply of electricity.
In December 2001, following an increase of share capital and an offering of existing shares held by the Hellenic Republic, PPC's shares were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. In parallel, Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) were admitted to London Stock Exchange which were deleted, as of November 29, 2017, at the request of the Parent Company.
The Hellenic Republic further reduced its stake in PPC through secondary offerings in December 2002 and October 2003.
In April 2014, the Greek Biministerial committee for restructurings and privatizations decided the transfer, without consideration, of 39,440,000 ordinary shares with voting rights corresponding to 17% of the existing share capital of PPC S.A, by the Hellenic Republic to the HRADF, pursuant to the provisions of L. 3986/2011. In March 2018, a transfer of 79,165,114 PPC shares (namely 34.123%) by the Hellenic Republic to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP S.A.), in which the Hellenic Republic holds 100% of its shares and voting rights, was completed by L. and without consideration, according to para. 20, article 380 of L. 4512/2018, as amended para. 1 of article 197 of L. 4389/2016. Given that HRADF is a subsidiary of HCAP, the total percentage of the Hellenic Republic in PPC's share capital, remains indirectly at 51.123%.
After the spin-off of the Transmission and the Distribution segments, two 100% subsidiaries of PPC were created, namely IPTO S.A. (Independent Power Transmission Operator S.A.) and HEDNO S.A. (Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A.). IPTO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, maintenance and development of the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System and its interconnections. On June 20th 2017, the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA was completed as provided for in articles 142 et seq. of L. 4389/2016. HEDNO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, development and maintenance of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network, which is owned by PPC S.A.
Pursuant to L. 4533/2018, on June 30th 2018 the Parent Company completed the spin-off of the two branches of lignite power generation Melitis and Megalopolis and their contribution to two new 100% subsidiary companies under the trade names "LIGNITIKI MELITIS SA" and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA", respectively.

part A' / Company Information

2.3 OVERVIEW OF COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES
PPC is Greece's largest electricity generator and the principal supplier of electricity in Greece.
PPC holds assets in lignite mines, power generation and distribution. The installed capacity of its power plants is 11.6 GW and accounts for approximately 55% of the installed capacity of power stations in Greece (including 930 MW of its two lignite subsidiaries Lignitiki Melitis S.A. and Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A.). Its power portfolio consists of conventional thermal plants (lignite, gas and oil fired), and hydroelectric power plants, as well as Renewable Energy Sources (RES) installations. PPC is the owner of the Distribution Network (Medium and Low voltage of approximately 240,000 km and High Voltage of approximately 1,000 km) which is operated by its 100% subsidiary, the Hellenic Distribution Network Operator S.A. (HEDNO S.A.).
Specifically, in the RES sector, PPC is the first company in Greece to install RES (in 1982), and is active through its subsidiary company "PPC Renewables S.A." (PPCR), with a portfolio of wind farms, small scale hydroelectric plants and photovoltaics.
The Hellenic Electricity Transmission System, often referred to as the "Interconnected System", spreads over the mainland of Greece. The Ionian islands, along with certain Aegean islands, are also included in the Interconnected System, to which they are connected through submarine cables. In the Interconnected System, approximately one third of the generation capacity is located in northwestern Greece, in close proximity to the lignite mines
All remaining islands, which are referred to as the "Non-Interconnected Islands", are served by autonomous oilfired power plants. In most of the islands, demand is also covered by RES. The largest power plants in the NonInterconnected Islands are located in Crete and Rhodes (with total thermal capacity exceeding 1,150 MW).
In 2019, PPC's generation of 25.8 TWh coupled with the 2.3 TWh that it imported, covered 45.5% of total demand. PPC's energy mix comprised of generation from lignite (40.5%), oil (17.8%), natural gas (27.6%), hydroelectric (13.1%) and renewable energy sources (1%).
14
The nearly 6.6 mil. customers of PPC, consumed 75.8% of the total electricity supplied to end-customers in Greece in 2019.
PPC remains by far the largest private investor in the country with total investments exceeding EUR 3.3 billion during the last five years, which contribute to the renewal of its generation potential and are expected to improve significantly the financial results of the company in the coming years.
PPC is entering a new phase during which it plans to transform itself into a modern, strongly outward-looking and efficient European utility.
The three pillars through which PPC's business plan for the coming years will be implemented are the following:
-Implementation of the "Green deal" in electricity generation by accelerating the decommissioning of lignite power plants and the corresponding mines and highlighting RES as the new dominant energy production technology. The detailed decommissioning plan includes the removal of polluting lignite plants with a capacity of about 3.4 GW by 2023. The decommissioning plan will be implementedwith full respect for PPC employees, local communities and the environment.
-The plan for the new PPC includes significant investments in RES, aiming at an additional installed capacity of more than 1 GW by 2024, which will come from organic growth and many partnerships as well. The plan also includes PPC's entrance in e-mobility with the installation of 1,000 charging stations throughout Greece over the next 2-3 years and 10,000 charging stations in the medium term.

-Digitization and operational efficiency to achieve cost reduction synergies and revenue growth by applying new technologies in all PPC'S sector. The company's digital transformation plan includes network upgrades, with tools such as smart meters, automated switches, GIS systems and more.
- Expansion to new activities and value-added products with a customer-oriented approach both in  the retail electricity market and in new business sectors, such as e-mobility. The transformation of the  Commercial department includes new combined products and flexible packages, as well as high-level  energy services, following the example of modern electricity suppliers worldwide.
PPC is changing in the direction of the energy transformation that is taking place worldwide in the industry, in order to play a leading role again in the Greek market and Southeast Europe.

For further information regarding definitions of ratios included in abovementioned figures, please refer to the Financial Report for the twelve - month period ended December 31, 2019 (Report of the Board of Directors ­ Appendix)

Group EBITDA for 2019 was positively impacted by the rebate of  99.3 m. from the surplus created in the Special

Account for Renewables, by the reduction by  243.4 m of the liability for post-retirement benefits, as well as by the

38

settlement of a total amount of  122.6 m for PSOs for previous years (collection of  194.7 for the period 2007-2011

and negative impact by  72.1 m. for 2017).

Excluding abovementioned amounts, recurring EBITDA settles at  333.6 m. For comparability reasons, EBITDA for 2018 is adjusted at  403.8 m.

The deterioration of recurring EBITDA for the full year is primarily attributed to higher expense for the purchase of CO 2
emission rights driven by the significant increase of prices, which more than doubled, as well as to the negative impact
on energy purchases cost by increased System Marginal Price.

On the other hand, EBITDA was positively impacted by the partial recovery of the higher expense for the purchase of

CO emission rights through the CO clause in Medium and High Voltage tariffs as well as the measures taken since Au-

2

2

gust 2019 and the cost containment efforts of the Company.

According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Group and the Parent Company have selected since the listing in the Stock Exchange to value their fixed assets on their fair values. Said appraisal is performed periodically, every three to five years. Results of the previous appraisal were recorded in the 2014 annual financial statements. Consequently, in 2019, an independent firm was assigned for the appraisal of the Group's property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 fair values. As a result of the appraisal, a total net increase of the fixed assets value of the Group by  1,261 m was recorded, which based on IFRS had a direct impact on equity, while at the same time, as a result of the appraisal and the negative value arising from lignite assets, an additional devaluation of assets by  2,098.8 m was recorded which negatively affected pre tax profits. The amount of  2,098.8 m includes among other the provision for the dismantling of power plants and mines as well as the full restoration of the land in the mines once the facilities cease to operate. All the above amounts do not have a cash flow effect.

Adjusted pre - tax losses for 2019 amounted to  424.4 m compared to adjusted pre - tax losses of  347.3 m in 2018.

It is noted that since Q4 2019, a reversal of the trend has been recorded, since it is the first quarter that fully incorporates the positive impact from measures taken, with recurring EBITDA amounting to  236.8 m compared to  44.7 m in Q4 2018. Adjusted pre-tax profits amounted to  26.9 m. compared to pre-tax losses of  131.6 m. last year.
Analysis of Revenues & Operational Expenses of PPC Group
Revenues Turnover for 2019 ­ the reduction of sales volume by 2,421 GWh (or 5.9%) driven by market share loss increased by  189.7 m or 4% due to: -tariff adjustments effective as of 1.9.2019 and gradual reduction of the discount provided to customers who pay on
time from 15% to 5%, - partial recovery of the CO expense from Medium and High Voltage tariffs
2
-revenues' increase from energy sales of thermal units in the non-interconnected islands as well as from Distribution network fees collected by third party electricity suppliers.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses before depreciation increased in 2019 to  4,598.0 m compared to  4,338.1 m in 2018, marking an increase by  259.9 m mainly as a result of the particularly increased expenses for energy purchases, CO emission
2
allowances and natural gas. Operating expenses before depreciation do not include adjustments for the Special RES Account, the provision for personnel's severance payment, the reduction of the liability regarding post-retirement benefits and the settlements for ETMEAR and PSOs for previous years.
Operating figures (generation ­ imports) In 2019 domestic electricity demand increased by 2.7% to 58,660 GWh compared to 57,122 GWh in 2018. On the contrary, total electricity demand (including pumping and exports) marked a slight decrease by 0.8% due to the intensified decrease of Third Party exports from Q2 2019 onwards. This decrease was recorded following a RAE decision that imposed restrictions on the NOME products that can be exported, resulting in the containment of the NOME quantities that were delivered from the second quarter onwards.
PPC's average retail market share in the country, declined to 75.8% in 2019, compared to 81.8% in 2018, while PPC sales (in GWh) declined by 5.9%. Specifically, the average retail market share in the Interconnected System was contained to 71.7% in December 2019 from 80.3% in December 2018, while PPC's average market share, per voltage, was 97.5% in High Voltage, 52.6% in Medium Voltage and 73.4% in Low Voltage compared to 97.6%, 68.0% and 82.1% in December 2018, respectively.
PPC's electricity generation and imports (including the lignite subsidiaries) covered 45.5% of total demand in 2019 (41.6% in the Interconnected System), while the corresponding percentage in 2018 was 54% (51% in the Interconnected System), a reduction attributed to lower lignite and hydro generation.
Specifically, lignite fired generation declined by 30.1% or 4,489 GWh with the largest part of the reduction being realized in Q3 2019 (1,975 GWh) and in Q4 2019 (1,409 GWh) mainly due to lower natural gas prices and higher CO prices which
2
render lignite - fired units less competitive compared to natural gas fired units.
Hydro generation declined by 33.4% or 1,688 GWh, a reduction which was however attributed to different reasons since it was driven by lower inflows in the hydro power plants' reservoirs in 2019 compared to 2018 as well as by the increase of water reserves, which in December 2019, were up by 467 GWh compared to December 2018.
On the contrary generation from natural gas fired units increased by 11.9% or 758 GWh.
Regarding electricity imports in the country, they were increased by 22.1% or by 2,479 GWh, due to increased quantities that where imported from third parties (increase by 2,576 GWh), since PPC imports slightly decreased by 97 GWh.
Energy mix expenditure Expenditure for liquid fuel, natural gas, third parties fossil fuel, CO , energy purchases (excluding the charge and the rebate
2
for the Special RES account deficit) and for the Special Lignite Levy increased by  425 m (14.8%) compared to 2018.
part ' / Financial Report

In detail:

-Liquid fuel expense remained practically stable at  670.9 mil. in 2019 without a significant change both in electricity

generation and heavy fuel oil and diesel prices.

-Natural gas expense increased by 12.5% to  431.4 mil. from  383.6 mil. due to higher natural gas generation. Natu-

ral gas prices remained practically stable since the increase recorded in the first half 2019 was counterbalanced by a

proportional decrease recorded in the second half of 2019.

-Energy purchases expense from the System (mainland) and the Network (non-interconnected islands), excluding the

charge of electricity suppliers for the Special RES account and negative impact from NOME auctions, increased by 

305 mil. due to the System Marginal Price (SMP) increase from  60.4/MWh to  63.8/MWh (negative impact by 

61.2 mil.), higher energy purchases volume (negative effect by  208.6 mil.) and other expenses (negative effect by 

35.2 mil.). The negative impact from NOME auctions - despite their abolition - continued although reduced by  71.9

mil. ( 156 mil. compared to  227.9 mil.) due to the reduction of the difference between SMP and the NOME price,

as well as due to lower quantities that PPC delivered in Q3 and Q4 2019.

-Expenditure for CO emission rights increased to  546.5 mil. compared to  369.6 mil. in 2018 due to the CO emis-

2

2

sion rights' average price increase from  12.5/tn to  23.7/tn, despite lower emissions (from 29.5 mil. tones to

23.1 mil. tones).

Payroll cost Total payroll cost including capitalized expense decreased by  49.1 mil. to  817 mil. in 2019 from  866.1 mil. in 2018, due to natural attrition (a decrease of 1,638 employees).

Provisions In 2019, a  46.1 mil. reversal of bad debt provisions for customers was recorded compared to a  169.7 mil. reversal in 2018. Provisions for litigation and slow moving materials, decreased to  37.1 mil. compared to  153.8 mil. in 2018, mainly due to the fact that in 2018 provisions for litigation were negatively impacted by an  109.5 mil. provision for overdue interest that IPTO claimed from PPC.

Financial expenses

40

In 2019, net financial expenses increased by  18.3 mil. to reach  97.6 mil. compared to  79.3 mil. in 2018 mainly due

to the decrease of the interest on overdue receivables from customers. On the contrary, financial expenses decreased

by  13.7 mil. mainly due to lower interest rate cost of the debt portfolio.

Capex

Capital expenditure, amounted to  646.6 mil. in 2019 compared to  746.7 mil. in 2018.

The composition of main capex is as follows:

Capital Expenditure Program of Business Units. Total capital expenditure for the Parent Company amounted to  608.1 mil. and was allocated as follows:  85.9 mil to Mines,  372.7 mil to Generation,  145.9 mil to the Distribution Network,  1.9 mil. to the Supply Division and  1.7 mil. to activities of the Administrative Divisions. Capital expenditure for the Parent Company for the year 2019 has decreased by  79.6 mil., compared to 2018, representing a decrease of 12%.
It is noted that capital expenditure for the year 2018 was affected by the significant progress in the construction of the Ptolemaida V lignite fired Unit, resulting in an increased amount of expenditure for the whole year.
Total capital expenditure for the Group for 2019 amounted to  646.6 mil. and includes besides Parent Company's capital expenditure, also those of PPC RENEWABLES S.A. amounting to  32 mil., of HEDNO S.A. amounting to  3.9 mil. and of the two spined-off Lignite subsidiaries amounting to  2.6 mil. Capital expenditure for the Group for the year 2019 decreased by  100.1 mil., compared to 2018, representing a decrease of 13%
Mines Business Unit
Capital expenditure of the Mines Business Unit for 2019 amounted to approximately 85.9 mil. and is related to projects in Western Macedonia Lignite Center (WMLC). A breakdown of the capital amount was spent during 2019 is presented below:
1. 48.5 mil. were spent on land expropriations of which 33.8 mil. on land acquisition in the region of Pontokomi ­ Mavropigi villages and 13.4 mil. on the relocation of Pteleonas village. As also 1.3 mil. were spent on archaeological excavations.
2. 17.3 mil. were spent on pre-operational expenses and earthworks, using both PPC's and contractors equipment, in South Field Mine.
3.  5.2 mil. were spent on the construction of the lignite belt conveyor system that interconnects Main Field Mine and Kardia Field Mine.
4.  8.2 mil. were spent on electromechanical works of which 5.5 mil on belt conveyor's extension and constructions and 2.7 mil. on equipment upgrades.
5.  3.5 mil. were spent on civil engineering projects and other technical projects (berm floor construction, road asphalting).
6.  0.8 mil. were spent on environmental projects and liabilities to third parties (national road and railway relocation, waste management projects, fences construction etc)
7.  2.2 mil. were spent on the purchase of auxiliary equipment. 8. The remaining expenses are related to smaller projects.
Total excavations in the Mines of Western Macedonia amounted to 129.5 mil. cubic meters and lignite production to 17.7 mil. tones.
Generation Business Units
Exploitation: · During 2019 the total net production of the General Division of Lignite Generation (GDLG) and General Division
of Thermo- and Hydro-electrical Generation (GDTHG) power stations (excluding the subsidiary companies Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A., Lignitiki Melitis S.A. for 2018-2019 and PPC Renewables S.A.) amounted to 22.05 TWh, decreased by 18.5% compared to 2018 (27.11 TWh). PPC's share of production dropped from 53.30% in 2018 to 46.03% in 2019. · Compared to 2018, the most notable change is the significant reduction of lignite generation. The lignite based generation (excluding the subsidiaries) was reduced by 37.32%, since it reached 6.97 TWh, which is 4.15 TWh less than in 2018. The main causes for this reduction was: the decommissioning of the lignite based Units I and II of the Kardia Power Plant since 30.06.2019; the limited operation of the Amyntaio-Filota Power Plant and Units III and IV of Kardia under special regulatory conditions in view of their planned decommissioning; and the increased Unit unavailability due to planned maintenance and upgrade projects (the unavailability factor due to planned outages was 21.78% in 2019 as opposed to 12.89% in 2018). The lignite Units' availability factor was 67.42% in 2019, which is a reduction of 9.0 p.c. units compared to 2018. The generation's reduction and the
part ' / Financial Report

increase of the unavailability factor in 2019 resulted to a reduction of the load factor, which reached 29.36%

as opposed to 42.37% in 2018 and a corresponding reduction of the utilization factor from 55.45% in 2018 to

43.56% in 2019.

· Compared to 2018, the hydroelectric generation was reduced by 1.70 TWh or 33.55%, reaching 3.36 TWh

in 2019. It should be noted that in 2018, the hydroelectric generation reached 5.06 TWh when emergency

measures were taken for protecting the reservoirs from flooding due to excessive rainfall. The 2019 generation

is directly comparable to that of 2017 which reached 3.46 TWh.

· Natural gas based generation reached 7.13 TWh, 0.77 TWh more than in 2018, which is a 12.02 % increase.

The Units' load factor reached 30.95% and was increased by 3.29 p.c. units. The availability factor in 2019 was

83.46%, an increase of 13.31 p.c. units compared 70.15% in 2018. The increased availability, however, outpaced

the increased generation and as a result the utilization factor was reduced by 2.35 p.c. units reaching 37.08% in

2019 from 39.43% in 2018.

· In 2019, the South Rhodes Thermal Plant at Kattavia added 119.56 MW of capacity at the Rhodes electrical

system. This allowed the transfer of 18 generator sets of total power 22.95 MW from the Rhodes Thermal Power

Plant at Soroni to the Atherinolakkos Thermal Power Plant for partially supporting the needs of Crete's electrical

system. In view of the increased load demand placed on Crete's system, extra 58 MW of non-permanent capacity

were also used. Furthermore, extra 20 MW of non-permanent capacity was used in 2019 for supporting the

needs of the rest of the Non-Interconnected Islands (NII).

· Megalopoli Unit A III and B IV as well as Meliti Unit were owned by the Parent Company until 30.06.2018. As of

01.07.2018 they are owned by the Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A and Lignitiki Melitis S.A. respectively.The two lignite

based generation subsidiaries Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A. and Lignitiki Melitis S.A. operated the whole of 2019 as

independent units. They started operating like this from the second half of 2018. Comparison between 2019 and

2018 is performed on a whole year basis irrespective of ownership status.

Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A.'s generation was 2.37 TWh, which is similar to the annual production of 2018 (operating

both as a subsidiary and as part of PPC), when it reached 2.36 TWh. The load, availability and utilization factors

were 54.78%, 67.73% and 80.88%, respectively, very similar to the corresponding 2018 values, which were

54.26%, 68.35% and 79.38%, respectively.

Lignitiki Melitis S.A.'s generation reached 1.08 TWh in 2019 and was 0.39 TWh less than the 2018 annual

42

generation (operating both as a subsidiary and as part of PPC), which was 1.47 TWh. The load factor was reduced to 43.54%, which is 14.79 p.c. units less than that of 2018, which was 58.33%. Although the power

plant's availability increased to 68.90% in 2019 from 64.92% in 2018, the generation's reduction resulted to the

reduction of the utilization factor to 63.20% in 2019 from 89.86% in 2018.

Investments: Total Investments of the General Division of Lignite Generation and the General Division of Thermo- and Hydroelectrical Generation during 2019 amounted to 372.7 million .

In the context of PPC S.A.'s Strategic Priorities Plan, the GDTHG and the GDLG have undertaken the implementation of Investment Projects in order to replace obsolete Units with new, environmentally friendly ones, of modern technology and higher performance. Concerning the progress of the Projects during 2019 it is noted that:

· Thermal Units: -Megalopoli Natural Gas Combined Cycle Unit No V, of 811 W net capacity at reference conditions:
The Unit was put into commercial operation on January 27th 2016. Performance tests of the Unit have already been executed and the relative evaluation report was submitted by the Third Party to PPC. Moreover, the Unit's compliance tests with the Management Code of the Independent Power Transmission Operator (IPTO) have been completed and it has been included in IPTO's Register. The Unit's Final Acceptance Protocol has been approved.
-Steam Electric Unit V, of Ptolemaida Station, of 660 MW (+ 140 MWth for District Heating) installed capacity, using pulverized lignite fuel:
The Installation License of the Project was issued, by the Ministry of Reconstruction of Production Environment and Energy, on April 24th 2015 while the Building Permit was issued on July 1st 2015.
PPC, in accordance with the contractual provisions, has already paid to the Contractor two advance payments, of approximately  198 mil., each, against relevant Letters of Guarantee of Advance Payment, of approximately  227 mil., each respectively.

Currently, the submission to PPC for review of studies and drawings, for the procurement of Project's equipment as well as for the construction of civil engineer and electromechanical works, continues. At the same time all Project buildings and facilities are in the process of construction. 91 % of the mechanical, 87% of the electrical, 61% of the automation, instrumentation and control, and 73% of the water and chemical processing equipment are on site and have been costed. The certified Civil Engineering work has been completed by 89%, the installation of mechanical equipment by 63%, the raise and installation of electrical equipment by 62%, the installation of instrumentation and automation equipment by 4%, and the raise and installation of water and chemical treatment facilities by 26%. For the fiscal year 2019 expenditure for the project amounted to 307.5 million .
· Hydroelectric Units: -Messochora Hydro-Electric Project (HEP) (160+1.6 MW):
The Environmental Terms Ministerial Decision has been issued providing that PPC will undertake ground support and stabilization measures for the preservation of a section of the Messochora village. The procedure for the expropriation of estates in the wider area has been initiated starting with the estates that will be inundated by the reservoir and have not been already expropriated, as well as with those of the Sectors A, B and C of the Messochora village. Along with this, procedures for meeting the provisions introduced by the said Ministerial Decision as well as those for the preparation of Tender Call documents for the remaining construction works are under way. The operation of the Power Plant is estimated to begin in the year 2023. It is noted that due to necessary actions that are beyond PPC's responsibility such as submission and approval of development plans, urban studies, and the expropriation (Phase B) of the areas to be expanded, as well as the relocation of the settlement (for which the Municipality is responsible), there may be further delays to the expected time of operation.
- Ilarionas HEP (153 + 4,2 MW): The Units' operation tests have been completed and the procedure for registering them in the IPTO Units
Registry was completed in February, 2018. From the three basic contracts, two have been completed by 100% and the third by 99.65%. -Metsovitiko HEP (29 MW): The construction schedules have been affected by the expected issuance of building permits.

Significant events for the period January 1st 2019 ­ December 31st 2019

Significant events for the year 2019 are presented in detail in Note 3 of the Financial Statements.

COVID-19 Pandemic

On December 31st, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of limited cases of pneumonia, of

unknown cause, detected in Wuhan, Hubei. On January 7th, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new type of

coronavirus (COVID-19) as the cause. On January 23rd, 2020, the first COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Hong

Kong. As of December 31st, 2019, the development and spread of COVID-19 has led to the emergence of numerous

related events. On March 11th, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic.

46

From mid-March, the Greek government started taking measures both to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (closure

of educational institutions and businesses, extensive cessation of economic activity, ban on the movement of all

citizens, cessation of the works in the worksite of the new Ptolemaida Unit V, etc.) and mitigate the economic impact

of the COVID-19 pandemic on affected businesses and individuals (provision of extraordinary allowances and aids,

protection of labor relations, extension of the deadline and suspension of tax and insurance debts collection, etc.).

Since, as at December 31st, 2019 it was not yet known how the situation was going to develop, the Management estimates (according to the provisions of IAS 10 - Events after the reporting period) that the COVID-19 pandemic does not constitute an adjusting event for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2019 figures.

PPC S.A., already from the initial appearance of the new COVID-19 pandemic, implements a series of actions aiming to inform employees, raising their awareness on the prevention and protection measures, providing them with the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), protecting both them and their families and at the same time ensuring its business continuity. Indicatively: - At the stage of the still mild condition, the Company:
·Posted on PPC's portal, informative material related to the new coronavirus. This material continues to be updated on the portal until today.
·Sent to all employees an information document (printed and electronic) for COVID-19 with accompanying instructions from NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION (NPHO).
·Started updating the existing Plan of Operations dated to the year 2009 (reffering to the influenza pandemic H1N1 virus), referring in the first phase to the stages of the mild and moderate condition.

- At the stage of the moderate condition, the Company: · Sent to all employees a new document (printed and via email) with instructions for their protection · Activated the following measures, in the context of the policy for dealing with a possible epidemic: - Intensive disinfection and cleaning in the workplace. -Cancellation of trips abroad, suspension of participation in conferences, postponement of educational  programs and meetings, activation of teleconferences. -Extraordinary supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other materials related to the protection from the coronavirus (masks, gloves, antiseptics, cleaners, etc.). - Support of PPC's employees through PPC's IT Security Team and the Company's resident doctors.
- At the stage of the pandemic, the Company: · Set up a Crisis Management Committee to deal with COVID-19. · Included in the Plan of Operations the stage of the pandemic and brought it in its final form entitled 
 "Operational plan of PPC's readiness to deal with pandemic from the new coronavirus COVID-19". · Further strengthened measures already imposed at the previous stage. · Based on its Operational Plan, determined the critical minimum staff for the operation of the Company per
 sector of activity · Activated a telephone line to inform the staff about the coronavirus. · Suspended the operation of restaurants and canteens. ·Is in constant communication with its business units sending Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (gloves, masks, uniforms, etc.) according to their needs. The Company also proceeds to extraordinary supplies of additional quantities of PPE, in order to avoid the lack of them, especially in the critical staff groups. ·Issues informative material and instructions for the provision of a special purpose day off and a special day off in case of a suspected, probable or confirmed case, for vulnerable groups to stay at home, for the disinfection, for the use of the PPE, for the out-of-office work, as well as for the monitoring of the incidents in the contractors' staff. ·Statistically monitors the evolution of the number of cases (probable, suspected or confirmed) concerning its employees, strictly protecting its employees' personal data.
The other subsidiaries of the Group take similar to the above measures. PPC also took extraordinary measures in order to relief electricity consumers, amending its tariffs from March 26th, 2020 and for the duration of a quarter. These extraordinary measures are as follows:
· Abolition of the fixed charge in all Low Voltage tariffs. ·Abolition of the second consumption range of the electricity charge in tariffs 1 and 1, for the consumption
within the peak period (i.e. the second scale of the tariffs 1 and 1 equals the first scale for the consumption within the peak period). · Abolition of the Euro 1 charge for every printed bill. ·Readjustment of the discount on each issued electronic bill, from Euro 1 for bimonthly bills and Euro 0.50 for monthly bills to Euro 5 for bimonthly bills and Euro 2.50 for monthly bills. ·For vulnerable customers which are included in the categories B & , the Company applies an 8% discount on the competitive component of their bill. ·Application of an 8% discount in all Business Tariffs for the consumption of more than 2,000kWh within the peak period. From the above measures, it is estimated that there will be a reduction in revenues from electricity sales amounting to approximately Euro 40 mil. Due to the fact that the majority of the impacts mainly comes from the measures, taken both worldwide and Greece since mid-March 2020 to reduce the spread of the pandemic and to mitigate the economic impact on businesses and individuals, it is likely that the Group's and the Parent Company's operation, financial position, operating results, cash flows and the implementation of their business and investment plans will be affected. For this reason, the Group's and the Parent Company's Management daily monitors developments and measures taken regarding the rapid spread of COVID-19 and studies any adverse or positive impacts that may arise, making estimates for the following:

part ' / Financial Report

- The evolution of the electricity demand - The availability of the Power Production Units - The evolution of the expenditures (energy balance, payroll, other expenses etc.) -The evolution of the revenues from electricity sale and other revenues (revenues from the use of Distribution
Network) - The evolution of the expected cash flows - The possibility of breach of contracts by the suppliers (due to extraordinary events) - The possibility of reduced electricity bills collection - The possibility of changing the investment plan

For the impacts expected from the measures already taken, in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, Management reassessed the budgeted financial figures for 2020 and first half of 2021, making assumptions about the evolution of the main figures of the electricity market (liquid fuels and natural gas prices, CO allowance prices, System
2
Marginal Price, etc.), as well as for the expected evolution of electricity sales. The measures taken until now to avoid the spread of COVID-19 do not seem to have an adverse economic impact on the Group and the Parent company. On the contrary, there is an increase in operational profitability due to a significant reduction in energy balance expenditures, which exceeds revenue reduction, while at the same time the adverse impact from delayed electricity bills collection is offset. In the context of the above reassessment, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the basic assumptions (liquid fuels prices, CO allowance prices, System Marginal Price and collection of electricity bills) resulting in the burdening
2
of 2020 and first half of 2021 revised financial figures, due to COVID-19, which, however, does not affect the Management's assessment that the Group and the Parent Company may continue as a going concern. It is noted that under the above conditions the Company is in compliance with financial covenants included in its loan agreements until June 30th, 2021.

MAJOR RISKS - UNCERTAINTIES

The Group's and the Parent Company's activities are subject to various risks. Any of the following risks could have

48

a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial position or operational results and liquidity. The risks described below are not the only ones that the Group and the Parent Company

face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Group and the Parent Company or that are

currently deemed to be of minor importance may also have a materially adverse effect on the Group's and the

Parent Company's financial position, business, operational results and liquidity.

Macroeconomic conditions in Greece The Group's and Parent Company's operations, their operating results, their financial position and their prospects depend to a large extent on the macroeconomic and microeconomic environment in Greece, as virtually all their assets and activities are in Greece. Any negative change and development in the macro and micro-economic environment of the country that directly and to a significant extent affects consumer demand for electricity, the ability of customers to repay their debts, the ability of the company to pass on increases in its costs to invoices, or financing prospects from the domestic financial system, therefore affects the operating results, financial position and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Company.

Credit Risk Despite the fact that, electricity sales are dispersed over a large number of customers with a wide range of operations, spreading credit risk, the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, operational results and cash flows are dependent on their customers' ability to repay their debts. he wide and protracted recession of recent years

have had a significant adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity, mainly resulting from: · Difficulties in payment by customers who continue to fail to meet their obligations. ·A sizeable number mainly of small and medium sized companies that cease their operations due to the
economic conjecture, leaving their electricity bills unpaid. ·The inability (in accordance with regulatory framework) to transfer debts of the same customer between their
various electricity bills for household use, which accounts for 70% of the customers. ·Incidents where customers (both household and commercial) with debts due to electricity consumption,
attempt to change their electricity supplier under a different name (or a different Tax Identification Number) in order to avoid restrictions that the Electricity Code imposes. ·Significant increase in debts from customers with move out, arising from the loss of market share as well as the ceases of representation by PPC to long-term debt customers. ·The fact that some customers under the pretext of the current economic downturn do not fulfill their obligations or delay their payments, despite the fact that they afford to do so. ·In addition, some industrial customers have questioned some of the electricity supply charges. For the customers concerned, it cannot be guaranteed to repay the electricity consumption-related amounts invoiced.
Additionally, the Parent Company's collection enforcement mechanisms may be affected by legislation or other administrative acts, (for example by restricting disconnections for non-payment of electricity bills for certain categories of customers or in areas that are declared to be in an emergency state, where customers benefiting from such decisions stop paying their bills).
Cooperation with a company providing specialized support services continues, aiming at a more efficient management of overdue claims through legal offices and companies informing debtors. ctions are implemented with scaling, consistency and continuity in order to ensure the effectiveness of the actions to reduce outstanding debts. However, credit risk persists, due to the financial difficulty of some of the customers to timely repay their obligations, and may adversely affect the Parent Company's operations, operating results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, some industrial customers have questioned some of the electricity supply charges.
Finally, due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its possible impact on the financial situation of customers of both the parent company's and other subsidiaries of the Group within 2020, the credit risk faced by the Group and the Company may increase, resulting in an increase in their overdue receivables.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows to finance the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as servicing their debt.
The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including: ·The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills, especially from customers that
do not have an active electricity supply contract. ·The obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT when
due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected from the Group's and the Parent Company's customers. ·The burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying in the same time amounts due to third parties.

part ' / Financial Report

·The continuous increase in the number of disadvantaged citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers, that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding (a) a longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue); b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest; c) limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.
·Regulatory measures on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as a Supplier.
·The potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.
The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs to access and find liquidity (to refinance existing debt and / or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years.

Risk from exposure to the Banking Sector The Group and the Parent Company may be exposed to risks arising for the Greek banking sector (for example limitations effected by the Single Supervising Mechanism (SSM) of the ECB on loans for Public Entities).

It should be noted that as of December 31st 2019 the Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations towards the Greek banking sector amounted to 37.5% of their total loan liabilities.

Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk The Group's and the Parent Company's debt liabilities consist of bank loans, bonds and overdrafts. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution in their loan portfolio between fixed and variable interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio. As of December 31st 2019 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging.

50

Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars,

the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against

the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company

examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case-by-case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity

circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions may

not provide full or adequate protection against these risks.

Credit Rating Risk The Group's and the Parent Company's ability to access capital markets and other forms of financing (or refinancing), and the costs associated with such activities, depend in part on their credit rating which is closely related to that of the Greek State as well as to the Greek banking sector's credit rating.

Commodity price risk and risk from the Electricity Market The Parent Company is exposed to the risk of an increase in prices of oil, natural gas, electricity purchased from the System and the Network, as well as electricity prices of direct PPC imports. The Parent Company has established a policy of oil hedging transactions, based on which specific hedging transactions are undertaken on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing circumstances. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions,

may not provide full or adequate protection against this risk. Currently no derivative transactions exist to hedge against oil, gas and electricity price volatility. Moreover, the Parent Company has not established a hedging policy against the risk arising from the volatility of natural gas prices.
In terms of the risk arising from increased electricity purchase prices, exposure is hedged less and less by the Parent Company's vertical integration (internal hedge), i.e. the gap between the retail and wholesale market share increases. It is noted that PPC's average share in the wholesale market (Interconnected System) as of December 2019 amounted to 54.2%, while at the same period, PPC Supply's average share in the retail market amounted to 74.4%.
Additionally, prices of the main materials (metals, etc.), besides fuel, used by the Group and the Parent Company for their operation and development are determined on the international commodity markets, resulting to the Group's and the Parent Company's exposure to the risk of fluctuation of the relevant prices as well as to foreign currency risk, since no policy has been implemented to manage this risk.
Moreover, it is noted that the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible impacts on both the global and Greek economy may lead to increased uncertainty, resulting in exchange rate fluctuations, price fluctuations in international commodity markets, while, the Greek electricity market is expected to be affected also. However, it is not currently possible to reasonably assess impacts from measures taken to avoid COVID-19 spread.
CO Emission Rights 2
In order to operate its bound thermal power plants, PPC is required to acquire and deliver CO emission rights 2
under the EU ETS (the "EU Allowances" or "EUAs") to cover CO emissions. 2
The price of CO emission allowances may be further affected by the probable adjustment of the European Union 2
(EU) targets for pollutant emissions in 2030, which is part of its commitments under the Paris Agreement, the ongoing dialogue on the objectives of the EU's climate for 2050 as well as the proposed upgrading of the EU's renewable energy and energy efficiency targets for 2030 that have already been upgraded to 32% and 32.5% respectively.
he Parent Company systematically monitors markets and developments at European level and has adopted a market policy that partly offsets the risk of price change, while an automatic mechanism (clause) for passing on increases in the price of CO emission allowances to Low, Medium and High Voltage tariffs. However, an important
2
part of the indirect risk (System Marginal Price (SMT) increases, decrease of lignite units share in the Wholesale Market) is not offset and therefore any increase of emission allowances prices may (directly or indirectly) affect the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position, operating results and liquidity.
Risk of exposure in competition in the wholesale market The Parent Company faces intense competition and share loss in the wholesale market, due to the increased penetration of Renewables units in the System and the Network, as well as due to increased electricity imports from the neighboring countries and intense competition by third-party independent electricity producers. In addition, due to CO emission allowances rising prices and the rigid environmental regulatory framework, the
2
competitiveness of lignite production is adversely affected.
Possible changes in the competitive environment, through the introduction of new laws and / or regulatory mechanisms in the electricity market that benefit the Group's competitors, may adversely affect its operating results and liquidity.

part ' / Financial Report

Since the forthcoming changes to the wholesale energy market model are not currently final, new regulatory decisions and other developments are expected, that may have an impact on PPC's activities and financial position, which at present cannot be determined.

Tariff risk for the competitive activities With the exception of vulnerable customers, all end-user tariffs are fully liberalized.

However a number of factors affect the Parent Company's ability and freedom to formulate the competitive component of tariffs, such as the ability of customers to cope with new possibly increased tariffs, initiatives of the Authorities, decisions of RAE etc., especially in view of the current socioeconomic condition in Greece.

Therefore, the Parent Company may face difficulties incorporating a potentially increased commodity cost, as well as costs related to electricity and CO emission allowances to electricity bills, through increased tariffs.
2
Risk from regulated rates of return on Network activities Regulated rates of return on Network investments combined with the approved by the RAE asset base on which depreciation and returns are calculated, may have a negative impact on the Groups' profitability and value, if they do not provide for a reasonable return on the invested capital and an adequate additional incentive for future strategic investments.

As a result, any RAE Decision on regulated tariffs that does not provide a reasonable return may have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business, operating results and financial position, as well as making it difficult to raise capital (foreign or domestic) to finance its investment plans.

Finally, since recovery of regulated returns is based on unit charges for consumers, determined by decisions of the Regulatory Authority for Energy, there is a significant risk that part of the return may not be fully recoverable or be recovered with a delay of several years.

52

Regulatory Risk The legislative and regulatory framework of European and national energy and environmental policies, affect the

business choices as well as the financial position and operating results of the Group and the Parent Company.

The Greek electricity system and the Greek electricity market are in the midst of broader developments due to the ongoing changes at European level, which are related to promoting the integration of European electricity markets, enhancing competition in energy markets, developing RES, limiting the use of solid fossil fuels in electricity generation, providing consumers with viable alternatives and generally promoting sustainable energy investment.

Therefore, a long period of continuous adjustment of the regulatory framework of the Greek energy market to the decisions and regulations of the national and European institutions is expected.

Possible modifications and adjustments to the regulatory and legislative framework governing energy markets and the environment, which would restrict business activities or lead to inadequate market liberalization, could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial position and operating results.

Risk from providing Public Service Obligations (PSOs) The PSOs for which the Parent Company and the other electricity providers are entitled to compensation relate to:

a. the supply of electricity to the Non-Interconnected Islands (NII) at the same tariffs as those in the Interconnected System,
b. the supply of electricity at a special tariff to families with more than three children, c. the supply of electricity to the beneficiaries of the Social Residential Tariff ("SRT") which is currently provided to
persons of low income, families with three or more children, long-term unemployed, people with special needs and people on life support and d. the supply of electricity at special tariffs to public welfare entities.

PSO compensation is based on the relevant costs incurred by the Parent Company and other electricity suppliers providing PSOs and is calculated according to a methodology published by RAE's Decisions.
Possible changes in the compensation rights for existing PSOs provided by the Parent Company or changes in the methodology for calculating the compensation for the provision of PSOs that will not allow the Parent Company to recover all of its costs, or any partial compensation, as well as delays in the payment of previous years' PSOs, or any possible adoption of new PSOs for which the Parent Company will not be entitled to full compensation, will have an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's costs, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
Risk of a deficit in the Special Account for Renewables The deficit of the DAPEEP RES Special Account as a result of the account's revenues being insufficient to cover payments for RES producers compensated at a regulated tariff has created for many years both uncertainty and market liquidity issues. The primary sources of income for this account are the amounts that electricity providers pay for electricity generated from Renewables, the Special Renewables levy paid by Customers (ETMEAR) -which as already mentioned limits their ability for the timely payment of their electricity bills- and various other smaller amounts according to the relevant legislation.
Due to the fact that a zero deficit was not achieved, despite regulatory interventions for the period 2012-2016 (special solidarity levy, reduction of RES sales prices, etc.) in 2016 a new charge was imposed on Load Representatives (electricity suppliers), in order for the deficit of the DAPEEP RES Special Account to be reduced to zero by the end of 2017.
The above charge significantly burdened the financial results and cash flows of the Parent Company and the Group throughout the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, while it has been already abolished as of January 1st 2019, since the increase in the marginal price and the CO emission allowance prices (which affect the income of the Special
2
Account) led to a surplus.
However, no assurance can be provided that this favorable momentum in the RES Special Account's revenues will be maintained, since the proportion of the special Renewables levy in electricity bills has been reduced, resulting in a future decrease in the RES Special Account's revenues, leading to a possible future increase of the cost of RES purchased electricity by the competent authorities, which may have a significant adverse effect on the Group's operating results and financial position.
Risk from the absence of Fixed Asset insurance Currently, the Group and the Parent Company do not maintain insurance against the usual risks associated with their power plants, distribution assets, property and equipment. Only major information technology equipment is insured. Moreover, materials and spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured. This has been primarily due to the high costs associated with obtaining insurance against these risks compared to the cost for remediating the damage should any of these risks occur, and the dispersed network of power plants.
Additionally, the Group does not insure third party liabilities with respect to distribution networks. During construction, major assets (except for networks) are insured by EPC contractors for their construction period. Cash in offices and agencies or in transfer is insured against theft and transports of liquid fuels are also insured.
Any severe damage to key power plants, distribution assets or mining equipment could have a significant adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Hydrologic Conditions The evolution of hydrologic conditions is an unpredictable factor that affects the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability.
Risk from the dependence on the Transmission System The transmission of electricity from the power plants to the distribution networks depends on the infrastructure of the electricity transmission system in Greece. Possible failures of the transmission system, including those due to natural disasters and inadequate maintenance or development, may hinder the distribution of electricity from the
part ' / Financial Report

plants to final consumers and adversely affect the business activity, operating results and the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company.

Risk associated with the operation and production capacity of the Non-Interconnected Islands Network (NII) The needs of Non-Interconnected Islands (NII) are met by stand-alone power plants using oil as fuel, although to a certain extent these needs are also covered by renewable energy installations.

In order to meet the demand for electricity in the NII, especially during the summer months that there is an increase in the consumption of electricity due to tourists, the Group and the Parent Company may lease or transfer production capacity (via generating sets) from one island to another, when required.

The same process, of leasing or transferring production capacity is also followed when demand in an NII cannot be met due to an unexpected, major damage and only for the time it takes to restore it.

The Group and the Parent Company are not in a position to guarantee that there will be no future damages or operational weaknesses in the Non-Interconnected Islands Network or that they will be able to meet the demand for electricity in the event of such events occurring.

Any failure to operate or reduced production capacity on the Non-Interconnected Islands Network may have an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's business activity, financial condition and operating results, as well as on their reputation.

Also, due to the fact that the Independent Power Trasnmission Operator (IPTO SA) has announced a wide interconnection program for NII and Crete, the autonomous electricity production stations that are installed in the islands that will be interconnected may in the future become inactive or switch to reserve status without receiving any compensation, which will have a direct adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position and operating results.

54

EPC related risks The Group and the Parent Company face risks relating to the construction of electricity generation units, including

risks relating to the availability of equipment from reliable suppliers, availability of building materials and key

components, availability of key personnel, delays in construction timetables and completion of the projects within

budget and to required specifications. They may also encounter various setbacks such as pandemics, adverse

weather conditions, difficulties in connecting to electricity transmission grids, construction defects, delivery failures

by suppliers, unexpected delays in obtaining zoning and other permits and authorizations or legal actions brought

by third parties.

Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial or operating problems of main suppliers and contractors, may have an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials, as well as finding sufficiently competitive conditions in the domestic market and have engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contracts completed in a timely manner and may increase the Group's and the Parent Company's operating and maintenance costs as well as costs and planning times of construction projects.

It is noted that among the measures taken by the Greek Government to limit the pandemic of COVID-19, is the cessation of work on the site of the new Ptolemaida Unit V which is expected to delay the completion of the project for a time equal to the duration of the pause of work, as the Contractor's delay is provided for as a force majeure incident in the contract.

Relating to the supplies of material and liquid fuels, no requests for postponement or suspension of the delivery deadlines, nor information from foreign producers for the suspension of their production activity have been submitted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As long as there are no new measures to limit economic activity, no particular change in the course of supplies will take place, beyond a shift of some deliveries by 2-3 months due to changes in needs and changes in the maintenance program.
Risk from Potential Undertaking of Social Security Liabilities Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group and the Parent Company do not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit whatsoever between income and expenses (deficit) to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
Litigations Risk The Group and the Parent Company are involved in several legal proceedings arising from their operations, and any adverse outcome against PPC or any other of the Group's companies may have a negative impact on their business, financial condition and reputation.
In addition, as a majority (ultimately) state owned utility, the Group is subject to laws, rules and regulations designed to protect the public interest, such as of public procurement or environmental protection. Violation of such legislation, entails, among others, criminal sanctions for the Board of Directors members and executive officers as well as the employees of the companies and utilities that are subject to those rules.
At the same time, PPC being one of the largest industrial groups in Greece, with wide and complex activity and operations throughout the country, in the ordinary course of business, from time to time, it is hit by competitors, suppliers, customers, landowners - the media, activists as well as ordinary citizens, who make complaints (even to prosecutors) about the activities and operations of the Group. Obviously the reason for these complaints is their belief (usually driven by modest springs) that the operations and activities of the Group cause or are likely to cause damage to their interests, their business or their properties. In this context, reports containing complaints and accusations of allegedly unlawful actions of executives against the Group usually entail further investigation by the Prosecuting Authorities in the so-called preliminary proceedings, which usually ends up in the dismissing of the investigated case due to lack of conclusive evidence.
These practices have intensified during the recent economic crisis, as public prosecutors and the general public have generally become more sensitive to similar allegations, especially against companies in which the Hellenic Republic is a major shareholder and are viewed as operating in the public interest.
As a result, the Group and the Parent Company, their Board of Directors members and directors, are at present and could be in the future, subject to various criminal or other investigations at various stages of procedural advancement on a variety of grounds arising in connection with their activities in the ordinary course of business. These investigations and legal proceedings may be disruptive to the Group's and the Parent Company's daily operations to the extent that the officers and directors involved need to spend time and resources in connection therewith. They may also adversely affect the Group's and the Parent Company's reputation, although to date, none of the proceedings initiated against the Group and the Group's officers or directors has resulted in any criminal convictions.
Risk from tax and other regulations The tax regime in Greece is subject to frequent revisions and although a reduction in corporate tax rates is anticipated, the Group may in the future face possible tax or other burdens. Changing the interpretation and application of tax

part ' / Financial Report

provisions by the Tax Authorities may result in additional amounts payable by the Group and the Parent Company, which may have a significant adverse effect on their activities, operating results, financial position and financial position and liquidity.

The Parent Company paid a special levy for the development of areas where electricity is generated from lignite, equal to 0.5% of its annual turnover which from January 1st 2019 has been replaced by the special fee for lignite exploration and exploitation rights of 1.40  / MWh of lignite energy produced.

Currently, the Group does not pay any royalty, concession fee or other fee for lignite extraction or for water used on its hydropower plants. The establishment of any new royalty regime may require the abolishment of the current regime and the Group cannot guarantee that any form of royalties, concession fees or other fees on its lignite or hydropower production will not be introduced by the Greek Government in the future.

Even if the effect of any new taxes, levies, etc. is passed onto the Group's and the Parent Company's customers, such taxes, levies, etc. may impact collection rates for PPC's electricity bills or result in a loss of market share due to competition. Conversely, if the Group and the Parent Company do not increase tariffs to match an increase in taxation and levies, a significant adverse impact on their financial results and liquidity may follow.

The Group and PPC are subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to companies of the broader public sector As long as the Hellenic Republic, directly or indirectly, holds 51% of its share capital, the Parent Company shall, in some respects, continue to be considered a public sector company in Greece. Therefore, its operations shall continue to be subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to public sector, affecting thus specific procedures, including but not limited to personnel salaries, maximum level of salaries, recruitments of employees, as well as the procurement policies etc.

The aforementioned laws and regulations, particularly within the framework of the current financial conjecture and

the relevant decisions of the Central Administration, which are not applicable to the Parent Company's current and

56

future competitors, may limit the Parent Company's operational flexibility and therefore have significant negative impact on its financial results, cash flow and on business risk management.

It should be noted that the Group has not have for several years (until December 2019) the ability to recruit experienced personnel in the range of its business activities while, today's average personnel age is approximately 52 years. The Group's inability to recruit specialized personnel negatively affects the ability of the new PPC Group to elaborate and implement its strategy in the new competitive and financial environment, as well as to adequately staff basic supportive operations at the level of new subsidiaries. Finally, there is a risk of losing managers and experienced personnel to the competition mainly because of restrictions on remuneration policies.

The viability and development of PPC Group in the new business environment notably depend on the ability to attract and retain experienced and specialized personnel and executives. The statutory recruitment process in force until December 2019, caused difficulties to meet the immediate needs of the Company with human resources, created critical shortcomings in employees and executives and may have adverse effects on the Group's business.

Since August 8th 2016, L. 4412/08.08.2016 (Public Contracts concerning Works Supplies and Services) has come into force.This Law constitutes a transfer of the European Directives 2014/24 and 2014/25 to national law with the addition of many national regulations on public contracts. This Law applies, according to its specific provisions, to the bidding procedures and implementation of Works, Supplies and Services contracts.

According to L. 4643/2019, the award of PPC's works, supplies and services contracts above and under of the 2014/24 and 2014/25 financial thresholds for the public contracts, is ruled by the Parent Company's Works,

Supplies and Services Regulation, derogating from the present Legislation regarding the Public Contracts without prejudice to the provisions of European Union Law. The force of the above begins with the body assembly of the Audit Committee, which will observe among others the proper application of the aforementioned Regulation and will suggest modifications and general improvement measures to the BoD. The Audit Committee has not yet been assembled, it is soon expected.
It is estimated that the above will offer greater flexibility to PPC's bidding procedures, mainly to the contracts under the EU Directive Thresholds. Since the new Regulation is not yet in force and no tender procedures have been implemented with the new settings we are not yet in position to know their consequences, which we estimate that will be favorable for PPC, HEDNO and PPC Renewables, the companies of the Group on which the above are proportionally implemented.
The Group may face strikes Most of the Group's and the Parent Company's employees are members of labor unions. Extensive labor unrest may have a significant negative impact on the Group's business activity.
Health, Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are subject to National as well as European laws and regulations regarding their employees and the subcontractors employees' health and safety as well as environmental issues.
The cost for complying with such legislation and regulations may require major investments and/or significant expenses for actions regarding the environmental compliance, upgrade and rehabilitation. Changes in the environmental legislation may increase the compliance cost and eventually, may have an impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability as well as its cash flow program, although compliance cost for health and safety rules is relatively low.
Furthermore, due to the nature of their operations, the Group and the Parent Company are involved in a number of environmental proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may not involve financial penalties and therefore cannot be quantified. The Group is also involved in court cases raised from victims of serious work-related accidents or from the families of deceased persons. Future related costs as a result of enforcement actions and/or third party claims for environmental damage and/or insurance cost for environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations and financial position.
The Group and the Parent Company are also required to obtain environmental and safety permits for their operations from various governmental authorities. Certain permits require periodic renewal or review of their environmental terms as well as continuous monitoring and reporting of compliance with such terms.
The Group and the Parent Company cannot give any assurance that they will be able to renew environmental permits or that material changes to their permits requiring significant expenditures on its end will not be imposed.
Environmental, health and safety laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may not at all times be in full compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
Additionaly, due to the restructuring of PPC Group and the commitment undertaken by the Group and the Parent Company, due to the immediate decommission of lignite assets, for the dismantling and removal of the facilities and equipment of the electricity production units, as well as for the removal of the mining equipment and the restoration of the mines land, after the end of their productive activity, on December 31st, 2019 a provision has been established by the Management for the cost of dismantling and removal of facilities and equipment and for the restoration of mines land.

part ' / Financial Report

In the event that in the future the actual costs exceed the budgeted ones, the difference will affect the results of the Group and the Company.

Information Technology (IT) security A large portion of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations are based on information systems; therefore they are exposed to the risk of non-availability, data integrity corruption and unauthorized access to these systems. In order to minimize these risks, the Group and the Parent Company take measures for the enhancement of their IT security.

The Group and the Parent Company believe that they currently have adequate security policies in place to cover risks associated with the operation and maintenance of their IT infrastructure and perform regular audits of their systems.

However, there can be no assurances that they will be able to prevent technology failures or IT security breaches in a timely manner or continue to have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for related losses (including litigation claims, liability and data loss), which could disrupt their operations or harm their reputation and have a materially adverse effect on their business.

In addition, with regard to the risk of cyber-attacks, the Group and the Parent Company take the appropriate measures that are constantly updated to avoid this risk, and so to this day there has not been anything wrong with their systems. However, it cannot be ruled out that a serious episode of cyber-attack will occur with adverse effects on the systems and operation of the Group and the Parent Company.

Risk of non-compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")

The new GDPR has entered into force in the European Union on May 24th 2018. GDPR sets stricter operational

requirements for the processing and management of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures

on how to use personal information, restrictions on information retention, mandatory discloses in case of data

breaches and higher standards for data controllers to be able to demonstrate that they have received valid consent

58

for certain data processing activities. Although the Group and the Parent Company have taken all necessary steps to comply with the above guidelines, they are active in a sector where the processing of a significant amount of

personal data is necessary and therefore inevitably are more exposed to the risk of being imposed with penalties

for non-compliance with the above Regulation. Failure to comply with the applicable data collection and privacy

provisions or other applicable data security standards may result in fines, penalties, limitations, and legal disputes.

Any failure to adequately address privacy concerns (even unfounded) or non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations and privacy policies or personal data may lead to additional costs and civil liability, damage to reputation and to negatively affect the business activities of the Group and the Parent Company.

Extraordinary events Unexpected events, including natural disasters, fires, war, terrorist activities, strikes, etc., may lead to a breakdown or the interruption of the operation of the Group's and the Parent Company's mines, the generation function and electricity transmission and distribution. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial and operating problems of basic suppliers, service providers and contractors may have a negative impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials and may increase their operating costs.

The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are susceptible to industrial accidents, and employees or third parties may suffer bodily injury or death as a result of such accidents. In particular, while the Group and the Parent Company believe that their equipment has been well designed and manufactured and is subject to rigorous quality control tests, quality assurance tests, and is in compliance with applicable health and safety standards and regulation, the design and manufacturing process is ultimately controlled by their equipment suppliers or manufacturers or EPC contractors rather than by them, and there can be no assurance that accidents will not result during the installation or operation of this equipment. Furthermore, the consequences of these events may create significant and longlasting environmental or health hazards and pollution and may be harmful or a nuisance to neighboring residents. The Group and the Parent Company may be required to pay damages or fines, clean up environmental damage or dismantle power plants in order to comply with environmental or health and safety regulations.
The Group and the Parent Company may also face civil liabilities or fines in the ordinary course of their business as a result of damages to third parties caused by the natural and man-made disasters mentioned above. These liabilities may result in the Group and the Parent Company being required to make indemnification payments in accordance with applicable laws.
Licensing Risk The procedures for obtaining and renewing authorizations and permits for the Group's and the Parent Company's activities can be protracted and complex. Obtaining these authorizations is not routine and the conditions attached to obtaining them are subject to change and may not be predictable. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may incur significant expenses in order to comply with the requirements associated with obtaining or renewing these authorizations. Failure to obtain or renew the necessary licenses and permits might result in interruptions to some of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including also the ability to obtain funding for their activities.
Any failure to obtain, maintain, renew or extend all the administrative authorizations and licenses necessary for the operation of their business and execution of their strategy, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, strategic and financial planning, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
Risk management The Group has defined the risk as a set of uncertain and unpredictable conditions that may have an overall adverse effect on its activities, business performance, economic performance, and the implementation of the strategy and the achievement of its objectives.
The Risk Management Division is organizationally provided in the Parent Company's organization chart but has not yet been staffed due to a reduction in recruitment and other negative factors mentioned in the previous section. To date, executives are involved in the process of identifying and prioritizing risk, as appropriate, in order to advise the Board of Directors on the design and adoption of specific Risk Management processes and policies. The Group and the Parent Company are not in a position to guarantee that these procedures and policies provide full protection against the risks they face.

SERVIA HIGH BRIDGE, POLYFYTOS HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT

NON-FINANCIAL REPORT Business Model PPC was established in 1950 as a public sector enterprise, tasked with the responsibility of providing electricity to the entirety of the country. Since its transition to an S.A. and the listing of its shares in the Stock Exchange, its operation has been governed by the law on public limited companies. However, the influence of the State on PPC remains significant, especially regarding its public service obligations. As a result, PPC is subject to various laws and regulations that apply to businesses in the wider public sector. For as long as the Greek State holds, even if indirectly, 51% of its share capital, PPC will continue to be regarded as a Greek Public Sector Company. Consequently, its activities will continue to be subject to laws and regulations that apply to companies in the Greek public sector and affect specific procedures. PPC is transforming from a vertically integrated company of Basic Business Units, as it was in the early 2000s (Mines, Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Supply), into a Group of Companies, with PPC at its core, which will operate in the generation of energy from conventional forms of energy (lignite, natural gas) and emphasize in increasing renewable energy generation. PPC Renewables, PPC's 100% subsidiary, will be responsible for the implementation of the latter. PPC is currently facing significant changes both in the business environment in which it primarily operates in and in the regulatory framework governing the liberalized electricity market. In this context, PPC believes that it will safeguard its sustainable development, in order to achieve its goal of maximizing its value, while always taking into account its civil role in the National Economy. At the same time, the Company will place great emphasis on its customers, developing and operating in new energy markets, with the medium/long-term goal of providing a wide range of products that will meet all of the customers' needs and requirements. More specifically, PPC's new business model outlines the Company's medium-term goals and is based on three pillars: · Implementation of the EU "Green deal" in power generation, by accelerating the decommissioning of lignite units
and respective mines and emphasizing in the uptake of RES as the new primary power generation technology. ·Digitization and operational efficiency for the achievement of cost-reduction and revenue-saving synergies, by
applying new technologies across sectors. · Expansion in new value-added activities and products with a customer-centric approach, both in the retail electricity
market and in new business sectors, such as electromobility. The Company's organizational structure, which is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2020, will meet the aforementioned priorities.

Fighting corruption and bribery It is crucial for the Company to comply with the law and respect the principles of the PPC Staff Regulations and the PPC Code of Conduct. In order to ensure control and compliance of the above, PPC has established internal procedures and organizational structures such as the Internal Audit Department and the Compliance Division. All cases of corruption which come to PPC's attention, either as a result of complaints or through inspections carried out by a Supervisor/Department and/or the Internal Audit Department, are fully investigated and subsequently disciplinary measures are taken against the employees, in accordance with Chapter VI of the PPC's Staff Regulations. In most cases, given the significance of the disciplinary offences imposed on employees involved in such cases, the aforementioned disciplinary cases are forwarded from the CEO at the First Instance Disciplinary Board, which can impose any of the sanctions specified in articles 26 and 32 of the PPC Staff Regulations. Cases of misconduct which constitute criminal offenses are referred to the appropriate judicial authorities. ·The Company takes all appropriate measures, in accordance with the provisions of L. 4557/2018,
currentlyinforce, with regards to the prevention and suppression of money laundering and terrorist financing. To this end, it has introduced in its institutional framework (Code of Conduct, Standards of Contract Documents,etc.) and applies, provisions concerning: · Transparency (Code of Conduct: § 9). · Corruption (Code of Conduct: § 10; PPC Staff Regulations: articles 26 and 32). · Fraud (Code of Conduct: § 12). · Conflict of interest. It is typical practice by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each meeting to submit a statement stating no-conflict of interest (PPC Rules of Operation: article 6). ·Exclusion from partnerships with economic entities who have either been convicted of an offense of corruption, bribery, involvement in a criminal organization, committing terrorist offenses, child labor, money laundering and fraud, or have been penalized for labor law violations (PPC BoD Decision 5/17.01.2019: "Approval of Documentation Standards for the Contracting of Works, Supplies and Services, in accordance with L. 4412/2016, and relevant settings").

Social Contibution

For the Company, contribution to local communities is inextricably linked to its business activities. To this end, it

74

implements significant programs and actions targeted towards the societies in which it operates and the wider community. Its valuable social work includes a series of activities developed over time that relate to sports, culture,

health and education. Detailed information on the programs and activities that are part of the Company's social

contribution are included in the Annual Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which is available on

the Company's website.

Customer-centric approach ­ Protection of vulnerable customers In recent years, PPC has set as one of the main objectives of its commercial policy a customer-centric approach, the optimal and quality customer service and the protection of social vulnerable groups. In 2019, it developed new online customer service systems, streamlined its processes, developed document digitization systems, introduced the new natural gas product, and developed special favorable adjustment programs and special invoices for vulnerable groups. As part of its responsibility to its customers and the commitments it has made at the European and domestic level, PPC is undertaking organizational changes to transform its commercial policy and develops a new, modern network of PPC Sales Offices. It offers new value-added, high-quality services designed to help customers optimally manage their energy consumption, provide better quality customer service through digital and personalized information, and protect personal data.

Materiality Analysis PPC monitors international trends on how sustainable development is being managed and strives to improve its own performance, to ensure greater transparency in procedures and to ensure accountability. With that in mind, given that the core of the GRI Guidelines is that each company must identify and evaluate its material aspects, at the end of 2018 ­ beginning of 2019, PPC's Senior Management and Stakeholders carried out a sustainability materiality analysis for the fourth time.

Material topics identified by Management PPC has developed a sustainability materiality analysis process as part of its risk identification and assessment process. In this case, however, sustainability risks / impacts are identified instead of operational or financial risks. From this process, materiality heatmaps were developed to show the estimated impacts / risks and the likelihood of occurrence. The heatmaps, the corresponding findings and conclusions and the dynamic tool used to formulate and

capture the results of the process are thereafter evaluated by the Company's Management team to devise policies and make decisions.
Material topics identified by stakeholders PPC acknowledges that its business operations and decisions affect as well as are affected by different groups of stakeholders. PPC engaged its stakeholders using an online questionnaire, asking them to evaluate and score what in their opinion were PPC's sustainability material topics. After a period of around 1 month of the questionnaire being open, PPC had collected 1,706 responses from all stakeholder groups from all regions of Greece.

PPC's approach to material topics Material topic: 1. Financial position / performance PPC's financial performance was indicated as a material topic primarily by management, partners and suppliers, employees and competitors. It is a key priority for Management. The Company's financial data is available in this Financial Report.

Material topic: 3. New markets and investments Both PPC and stakeholders have identified and agreed that key material topics for the Company's sustainable development are the investments made and expansion into new markets. Generally speaking, PPC's strategic goal (which it is working on intensively) is to offset domestic losses due to the market liberalization measures imposed on it, by expanding into new markets and capitalizing on business partnerships.

Material topic: 4. Regulatory issues Management and Company competitors have recognized PPC's involvement in managing regulatory issues as a material topic of its operations. Further market deregulation has created uncertainties and challenges for PPC, and the Company considers that the need to generate results when it comes to regulatory issues will intensify.

Material topic: 5. Risk/crisis management Risk/crisis management was primarily selected as a material topic by Company Management, employees, shareholders and investors, partners and suppliers, competitors, and by non-governmental/ non-profit organizations. PPC's Management has made concerted efforts to recognize, prevent and manage risks and crises in good time. PPC's Board of Directors then examines the key risks PPC faces and refers to them in detail in the Board of Directors' Annual Financial Report.

Material topic: 7. New energy market conditions

Management, shareholders and investors at PPC identify managing new energy market conditions as a material topic.

Rapid developments in the Greek energy market, coupled with the country's commitments to MoUs that are changing

the country's energy landscape, hold an interest for Management and employees regarding the role the Company will

76

play in the emerging energy and economic environment. PPC's goal continues to be ensuring a competitive environment, where the key concern is benefit for customers.

Material topic: 11. Staffing the Company Staffing the Company was indicated as a material topic primarily by Management, employees and by non-governmental/ non-profit organizations. An ageing staff coupled with restrictions on new recruitments because of legal provisions applicable to companies in the Greek public sector, are factors of this topic which have a direct impact on the Company's operations.

Material topic: 13. Customer service, information and satisfaction Both PPC and stakeholders have identified customer service, information and satisfaction as a material topic. The Company constantly strives to improve the way it provides services to its customers to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. Efforts are being made to strengthen our customer-focused approach, carry out research and examine complaints, taking into account consumer needs. PPC's main objective is to ensure quality customer service and to handle customer requests in the best possible way. It designs specific and uniform procedures to ensure rapid and effective handling of customer requests and complaints. Moreover, providing information to the public and raising awareness about energy savings and protecting the health and safety of consumers and users of electricity is a key concern for PPC.

Material topic: 19. Climate change and greenhouse gas / particle emissions Climate change is a global environmental problem and its impacts affect all aspects of human life (the environment, health, the food chain, infrastructure, the economy and politics). According to the 5th IPCC assessment report, it is extremely likely that man-made GHG emissions (CO , methane, nitrogen oxide and fluoride gases) are the main cause of
2
climate change. When generating electricity from fossil fuels, GHGs and atmospheric pollutants are released into the air. In this regard, climate change and gas / particle emissions have been recognized as material matters by the Company's management team, shareholders and investors, partners and suppliers, the State, regulatory authorities and public bodies, regions, local authorities and local communities, as well as by non-governmental and non-profit organizations. Keeping the rise in the average global temperature sufficiently below 2oC and the attempt to bring it even lower, to 1.5oC compared to pre-industrial age levels (targets which were agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris) require measures to be taken to curtail GHGs in the power generation sector.

Material topics: 24. Energy efficiency / new technologies and 25. Promotion of renewable energy sources Investments in new technologies to improve energy efficiency as well as the promotion of renewable energy sources are identified as material topics by the Company management as well as by all stakeholders. Improving energy efficiency makes a positive contribution to the Company's financial results, while further promoting RES reduces the Company's exposure to fluctuations in carbon prices in the EU's ETS. At the same time PPC recognizes its own responsibility for GHG emissions resulting from its operations and helps effectively limit such emissions and thereby combat climate change.
Significant risks Significant risks are further analysed in the "Main Risks ­ Uncertainties" section of within the Executive Summary of the Board of Directors of this report.

Statement of Corporate Governance

1. INTRODUCTION Corporate Governance is a system of management and control of the societes anonymes. It is a set of structures, principles, rules, procedures and practices based on which the continuous improvement of the Company's efficient operation for the sake of its shareholders and all parties having legitimate interest in its operation, the enhancement of the long-term value of the Company and in general the safeguarding of corporate interests are pursued.

The implementation and the observance of the best practices of corporate governance constitutes an essential commitment and priority of "Public Power Corporation S.A." (herein "PPC S.A." or "the Company") due to its important role in the Greek economy and the public interest services it provides.

It is noted that specific laws and regulations applicable to the corporations of the wider public sector govern the Company. Consequently, its operations continue to be subject to restrictions provided for in special laws applicable to the companies of the Greek public sector such as, by way of illustration, supply and works, remuneration, and recruitment policy. The said laws and regulations to which the current competitors of the Company are not expected to be subject, are likely to limit its operational flexibility and the implementation of the relevant "best practices" of corporate governance. It should be pointed out that the recent L. 4643/20129 has introduced regulations that facilitate a more flexible operation for the Company in critical fields of its activity (see below sub-section 6.11).

With regard to the shareholder structure of the Company, it should be noted that the Hellenic Corporation of Assets

and Participations S.A. (HCAP) in which the Hellenic Republic holds 100% of its shares and voting rights participates

directly with 34.123% in PPC's share capital. Moreover, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), which

is a subsidiary of HCAP, participates directly with 17% in PPC's share capital. Based on the above, the total percentage of

78

the Hellenic Republic remains indirectly at 51.123%. In addition, based on number 15 of the decision of the Government

Council for Economic Policy No 33/20.5.2016 (NOG vol. B issue 1472/25.5.2016) on the approval of the HRADF Business

Plan, HRADF should offer for sale its participation in the share capital of the Company of 17%, through a process to be

decided by the Board of Directors. Finally, it is clarified that the percentage (3.93%) of the EFKA (Single Social Security

Entity) and the TAYTEKO/TEAPAP-DEI (PPC Insurance fund) shall not be counted in the percentage of the Hellenic

Republic's indirect participation in the share capital of the Company.

In 2019 PPC harmonized its Articles of Incorporation with the provisions of L. 4548/2018 (NOG 104/13.06.2018), which

was put into effect on 1.1.2019 (article 190).

2. Code and Practices of Corporate Governance PPC prepares the current statement of Corporate Governance pursuant to the provisions of par. 1 article 152 of L. 4548/2018.

4.The Board of Directors or the General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Companyelects the Chairman of the Board of Directors as well as the Deputy Chairman (article 14 of the Articles of Incorporation "Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors).

1. The internal audit, in accordance with L.3016/2002 as applicable, article 4 of L. 3429/2005 and article 44 of L. 4449/2017 constitutes an independent, objective, safeguard and advisory activity, designed to add value and improve the operations of the Company, enabling it to fulfill its objectives through the adoption of a systematic and professional approach with regard to the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of the risk management procedures, of the internal audit systems and of the corporate governance. The Internal Audit of the Company is performed by a special Service, the Internal Audit Department (IAD), which is established by decision of the Board of Directors and supervised by the Audit Committee (AC) of the Board of Directors.
The IAD aims at the efficient and valid audit of the Company in order to protect the interests of the shareholders, in accordance with the Legislation in force, the Corporate Governance principles and the best practices of Internal Audit, in order to ensure that: - Risks are identified thus ensuring adequate management by the competent Units. - The personnel acts in accordance with PPC policies and procedures, Regulations and the Legislation in force. - PPC resources are acquired and used in an efficient and cost efficient manner. - PPC assets are adequately protected. - Financial information is reliable.

The annual audit plan of the IAD is elaborated based on the determination, updating and assessment of the corporate risks of the Group and taking into consideration the strategic goals of the Company and all developments concerning the Group and its business environment. The audit plan is submitted for approval to the BoD through the Audit Committee.

2. The Company, acknowledging the need to adapt to a new business environment, constantly evolving worldwide through the issuance of new necessary regulations and codes of corporate governance, proceeded in 2017 to the establishment of the Compliance Department. The objective of the said department is to monitor the observance of all the above within the framework of the operation of the Company and at the same time to enhance the development of this corporate culture, that is the culture of compliance with the law.

In order to attain this objective the Company through the Compliance Department has already launch the "Code of Conduct" which is posted on the Company's website and proceeds with the elaboration of the "Business Ethics & Compliance Program" in accordance with the best international practices, principles and rules. Moreover it plans to set up communication procedures in matters of Compliance and Business Ethics, as well to create and manage a suitable channel for the submission of complaints and in general of non-compliance reports.

The Company by means of operating within this framework highlights its commitment to the establishment of a business environment, which not only respects and comply with the law but enhances the Company's value as well, thus safeguarding its good repute and credibility.

3. The Audit Committee of the BoD, in its current form and composition (see below in detail sub-section 6.11 herein), supervises the IAD, submits to the BoD the six-month activity reports, the annual reports and other reports on issues falling within the competence of the Compliance Department and, in general, constitutes the highest safeguard of the Company.

6.14 Contracts with Members of the Board of Directors
Following the conversion of PPC to societe anonyme (PD 333/2000) provision had been made for a system for the determination of the remuneration of the executive members of the BoD and the Chief Officers consisting of the fixed and the variable remuneration (bonus) which was related to the achievement of business goals. Following the introduction of the restrictive laws on the medium-term stability programmes 2010-2019, ceilings were

part ' / Financial Report

102

set on contractual remunerations, equal to the remuneration of General Secretary of Ministry. By virtue of L. 4354/2015 (article 28) that took effect on 1.1.2016, the executive Board members could receive remunerations exceeding that ceiling. Moreover, they received compensation for their participation in committees and meetings of the BoD of the Company. Following the enactment of L. 4643/2019, the General Meeting of the Shareholders is the sole responsible for the determination of the remuneration of Board members, officers and senior officers of the Company, within the limits set out by articles 4 and 5 of L. 4643/2019 and pursuant to the provisions of articles 110-111 of L. 4548/2018. The remuneration policy of the Company as approved by the General Meeting held on 23.12.2019 consists in determining the remuneration of Executive Board Members, officers and senior officers of the Company as follows: a) fixed part (basic remuneration-salary) and b) variable performance-related part (variable remuneration). There is no provision for the granting of shares, call options on the Company's stocks or other similar securities to the members of the Board of Directors. Nevertheless, there are other contractual provisions concerning expenses during the execution of their duties (travel expenses, mobile phone, etc.) which are submitted for approval, in accordance with the remuneration policy of the Company as approved by the General Meeting (see par.6.11.2).
6.15 Diversity applied to the managerial, administrative and supervisory bodies of the company
As already mentioned in paragraph 6.1 herein, nine (9) out of the eleven (11) members of the BoD of the Company are elected by the General Meeting of Shareholders and two (2) members representing the employees of the Company are elected by direct, general ballot.
For the selection of the members of the managerial, administrative and supervisory bodies of the Company, their qualifications such as academic credentials and professional experience are taken into consideration, whereas age or other personality characteristics, which could be considered as sensitive personal data, do not constitute criteria for selection.
The Shareholders of the Company, which is considered to be a public interest entity, take into consideration any requirement derived from the law concerning the selection of the BoD members who are nominated at the Shareholders' General Meeting. Particular reference is made to the fact that according to article 197, par. 4 in conjunction with par. 6 of L. 4389/2016 (see Internal Regulation-Coordination Mechanism of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations SA), as applicable, the HCAP, as shareholder of the company, conforms to the procedure provided for by law in order to nominate at the General Meeting of Shareholders the members of the Company's Board of Directors to be selected by the GM, pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of article 9 of the company's Articles of Incorporation.
In particular: a. Diversity policy implemented by the company in relation to the composition of the Board of Directors and of its senior executives (Deputy CEOs and Chief Officers). More specifically, with regard to Board Members 82% hold a higher education degree while 18% are secondary education graduates. 91% of the Board members belong to the age group from 40 to 60 years old, while 9% are aged over 60. All Deputy CEOs hold a higher education degree and belong to the age group of 40-60 years old. All Chief Officers hold a higher education degree, 71.4% belong to the age group of 40-60 years old, while 28.6% belong to the age group of 60+.

More specifically for Board members, the percentage of men arises to 91% compared to that of women which arises to 9%. All Deputy CEOs are male while with regard to Chief Officers, 71.4% are men and 28.6% are women. To conclude, the Company is continuously working towards the direction of adapting to the principles of corporate governance, as stipulated by the new provisions of the Greek legislation.

APPENDIX
Definitions and reconciliations of Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs")
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ("APMs") The Group and the Parent Company use Alternative Performance Measures («APMs") in taking decisions concerning the financial, operational and strategic planning, as well as for the evaluation and publication of their performance. These APMs serve to better understand the financial and operating results of the Group and the Parent Company, their financial position and cash flows. Alternative indicators (APMs) should always be read in conjunction with the financial results that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and in no way replace them.
Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs") In discussing the Group's and the Parent Company's performance, "adjusted" measures are used such as: EBITDA Recurring without one off effects and EBITDA Recurring margin % without one off effects as well as Profit / (Loss) without one-off effects. These adjusted measures are calculated by deducting from performance measures directly derived from amounts of the annual Financial Statement the effect and costs arising from events which have occurred during the reporting period and which have not affected the amounts of previous periods.
EBITDA (Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses and taxes).
part ' / Financial Report

The EBITDA margin (%) is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total turnover. Calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin is presented in Table A.
Operating Expenditure before tax, depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses, profit/(loss) from sale of related companies and taxes excluding one off effects This measure is calculated by subtracting the one-off effects mentioned in the EBITDA Recurring note below, from the EBITDA measure. It is presented on Table B.
EBITDA Recurring (Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses and taxes).

For the Parent Company (positive effect), 2) An impairement of the actuarial liability concerning the supply of electricity at a reduced tariff, due to the decrease of the discount applied amounting to 243,415 th. for the Group anf 148,058 th. for the Parent Company (positive effect), 3) collection of an amount of 194,652 th. for PSO compensation for the period 2007 ­ 2011 for the Group and the Parent Company (posistive effect), 4) a decrease of PSO compensation for the year 2017 after the clearing performed by the competent authorities amounting to 72,140 th. for the Group and the Parent Company (negative effect), 5) a bad debt provision for the Parent Company's expected credit losses for receivables from the two lignite subsidiaries amounting to 104,426 th.(negative effect). For the the year 2018, the one-off effects that affected EBITDA Recurring are as follows: 1) a charge to cover the deficit of the RES Special Account (RES SpAcct) amounting to 196,349 th. for the Group and 196,290 th. for the Parent Company for (negative impact). These charges were abolished on 01.01.2019, 2) Provision for severance payment amounting to 164,346 th. for the Group and 90,670 th. for the Parent Company (negative impact) and 3) a positive amount of 105,248 th. for the Group and the Parent Company relating to the clearing of ETMEAR for the years 2012, 2013 and 2016 (positive effect). EBITDA Recurring Margin (%) is measured by dividing EBITDA Recurring by Total Turnover Recurring. EBITDA Recurring and EBITDA Recurring margin are presented in Table C.
EBIT (Operating Income before net financial expenses and taxes) EBIT serves to better analyze the operating results of the Group and the Parent Company and is calculated as follows: Total turnover minus total operating expenses. EBIT margin (%) is calculated by dividing EBIT with total turnover. Calculation of EBIT and EBIT margin is presented in Table D.
Net amount of Depreciation, Financial Expense and Profit from Subsidiaries and Associates.

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Shareholders of Public Power Corporation S.A.
Report on the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of Public Power Corporation S.A. ("the Company"), which comprise the separate and consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31st, 2019, the separate and consolidated statements of income statement and statement of other comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of Public Power Corporation S.A., and its subsidiaries ("the Group") as at December 31st, 2019 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as incorporated in Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report. We remained independent of the Company and Group throughout the period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated in Greek Law, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters and the related risks of material misstatement were addressed in the context of our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements.

Contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue (separate and consolidated financial statements)

At December 31st, 2019 Company's and Group's contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue amounted to 302mil.
The estimation method used, requires the management to make judgments and use estimates and assumptions with a high degree of uncertainty, of which the most significant are related to the technical and non-technical losses of the distribution network, the invoicing period, the average revenue and the adjustments for discounts and expected credit losses.
We have determined the estimation of contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue to be a key audit matter due to the inherent risk of revenue recognition in the correct period, the significant audit time required, and the high degree of estimation uncertainty in the management's judgments, estimates and assumptions used in this process.
The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policies, the judgments, the estimates and the assumptions used to determine the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled energy can be found in notes 4.3, 4.4, 6 and 22 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- We discussed with management and assessed the design of management controls over the estimation of the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue.
- We received and audited the calculation of the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue performed by the management, evaluating the judgments, estimates and assumptions related to the technical and non-technical losses of the distribution network, the invoicing period, the average revenue and the adjustments for discounts and expected credit losses. We also tested the calculations for mathematical accuracy.
- We assessed the consistency between periods of the estimation methods used, the assumptions, and the calculations used by the Company and the Group, and whether events of the period or changes in the environment or changes in the facts and circumstances have been taken into consideration in the estimates and assumptions used and in changes in the business practices, and the accounting principles which may have affected the calculations.

- W e tested the calculations for mathematical accuracy and the correctness of accounting process.

Finally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (separate and consolidated financial statements)

At December 31st, 2019 Company's and Group's property, plant and equipment amounted to 10.573mil. and 10.177mil., respectively.
The Company and the Group measure property, plant and equipment at revalued amounts (fair values less accumulated depreciation), except for the mines and lakes that are measured at cost (less accumulated depreciation) and property, plant and equipment in progress, that are measured at cost (less accumulated depreciation).
The fair values of property, plant and equipment that are measured at revalued amounts, are determined by independent valuators periodically, in order to assure that the value of the property, plant and equipment have not changed significantly. The Company and the Group performed a valuation exercise (from independent valuator) for property, plant and equipment as of December 31st, 2019. The result of the valuation exercise was (1) revaluation surplus amounted to 1.250mil. and 1.261mil. for the Company and the Group, respectively, which were registered in statement of comprehensive income and (2) impairment amounted to 547mil. and 672mil. for the Company and the Group, respectively, that were not covered by the revaluation surplus of prior revaluations and were registered in the statement of current period. The determination of fair values of property, plant and equipment requires also estimations, assumptions and judgements regarding the ownership, the use and the existence of any physical, operational and economic depreciation.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- W e discussed with management and assessed the design of internal controls over the process of revaluation, as well the process of impairment test of property, plant and equipment.
- For property, plant and equipment that are measured at fair values, we received the valuation report of independent valuator and we assessed, with the contribution of EY specialists in valuation, the judgements, estimations and assumptions used, as well the accuracy of the methodology used.
- We performed sampling tests regarding the mathematical accuracy of determination of revaluation surplus and deficit of property, plant and equipment that were measured at fair values, assessing also the implementation of the Company's accounting policy and the correctness of the accounting process.
- We evaluated the skills and objectivity of the independent valuator, to whom management assigned the valuation exercise.
- F or property, plant and equipment that measured at cost and there were indications of impairment and impairment tests were performed, we assessed, with the contribution of specialists in valuation, the judgements, estimations, assumptions and methodology used in estimation of the recoverable amounts.

Furthermore, the Company have to assess annually, whether there are any signs of impairment and if there are, the Company should perform a valuation exercise for the value of property, plant and equipment. This procedure incorporates judgements, estimates and assumptions with high degree of subjectivity, the most important of which are related to the estimated future productivity and use of assets, their future cash flows and other factors. As part of the procedure of the assessment of indications for the property, plant and equipment that are measured at cost, taking also under consideration the requirements for the lignite phase-out, management performed as at December 31st, 2019 an impairment test, which resulted in impairments amounted to 1.077mil. and 1.105mil. for the Company and the

Group, respectively, which were registered in the income statement of current period.
The valuation of the property, plant and equipment has been determined to be a key audit matter due to the level of the related account and the degree of subjectivity in the judgements, estimates and assumptions used for the above described procedures.
The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policy, the judgments, the estimates and the assumptions used in the valuation of the property, plant and equipment can be found in notes 4.3, 4.4, 15, 35 and 41 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

As December 31st, 2019, the Company's and the Group's trade receivables amounted to 579mil. and 683mil., impaired by 2.537mil. and 2.655mil., respectively.
The Company and Group apply the simplified approach of IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and determine lifetime expected credit losses ("ELC") on their trade receivables. The calculation of the expected credit losses is done based on historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward- looking information.
We have determined the impairment of trade receivables to be a key audit matter due to the level of the related accounts and the significance of management's assumptions and estimations. The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policy, the judgements, the estimates and the assumptions used for the impairment test of trade receivables can be found in notes 4.3, 4.4 and 21 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- W e discussed with management and assessed the design of management controls over the impairment process of trade receivables.
- We received the calculation of impairment of trade receivables performed by the management and we assessed the completeness and accuracy of data used for the calculation of expected credit losses and the assumptions used. We checked the mathematical accuracy of relevant calculations and the correctness of accounting process.
- F inally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information, includes the Board of Directors' Report, for which reference is also made in section "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements", the Statements of the Members of the Board of Directors, and any other information either required by law or voluntarily incorporated by the Company in its Annual Report prepared in accordance with L. 3556/2007, but does not include the separate and consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of [separate and consolidated] financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee (L. 44 .4449/2017) is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements.

part ' / Financial Report

120

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
·Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
·Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
·Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
·Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
·Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
·Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company and its subsidiaries. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

Also, the Energy Exchange Clearing House S.A. was established under the distinctive title EnExClear, for the settlement of transactions in the Day Ahead and Intraday markets of the Energy Exchange S.A. as well as any other related activity. · Regarding the operation of the Electricity Markets, the Regulations of the Energy Financial market (derivatives market), the Day Ahead Market and the Intraday Market, the Settlement Regulation for Day Ahead and Intraday Market transactions as well as related methodologies and other arrangements were approved. · By the Ministerial Decision //7083/112 (OG ' 172/30.01.2020), IPTO and EnEx approved in cooperation with the company Energy Exchange Clear of the Energy Exchange a binding timetable for the fulfillment of their obligations to start (go-live) the Day Ahead Market, the Intraday Market and the Balancing Market until June 30th, 2020.
2. Auctions of Regulated Forward Products (NOME)
· The Special Purpose Regulatory Mechanism for the sale of electricity by PPC through auctions of forward electricity products ("NOME mechanism") with physical delivery through the Daily Ahead Schedule and with a regulated starting price was established by L. 4336/2015. L.s 4389/2016 and 4472/2017 and Resolutions 35/2016, 38/2016, 58/2017, 68/2017, 77/2018 and 85/2018 of the Government's Council for the Economic Policy determine PPC's annual market share levels in the retail market until 2019, as well as the other key features of "NOME mechanism", including the cost elements to be taken into account for the calculation of the auction starting price. Through the "NOME mechanism", the Parent Company is under a contractual obligation to deliver specified quantities of electricity to third parties for a period of 12 months, through auctions, the prices of which are ultimately determined below the System Marginal Price ("SMP").
· RAE's Decision 1248/2018 set the annual quantities of electricity available through auctions for the sale of forward electricity products with physical delivery to 1,444 MWh/h, the allocation of these quantities in separate forward products, as well as the auction timetable for the year 2019. RAE, with its Decision 164/2019, adjusted the annual quantities of electricity available through auctions for the sale of forward electricity products with physical delivery for the year 2019 and set to 1,972 MWh/h, due to the deviation from the six month target of PPC's share decrease.
· By a Legislative Act, as published in the Government Gazette (OG A'145/30.09.2019) entitled: "Urgent Provisions of the Ministries of Environment and Energy, Interior, Finance and Health", the Auction of forward electricity products ("NOME mechanism") dated on October 16th, 2019, for a quantity 1,029 MWh/h was canceled and consequently the annual quantities of electricity available through auctions for the sale of forward electricity products with physical delivery for the year 2019 exhausted with the auction held on July 17th, 2019.

IPTO initially announced an Invitation for the expression of interest to participate in the Auction for the Provision of Flexibility Service for the period April 1st, 2019 until June 30th, 2019, but with a newer announcement, IPTO notified that the auction that was scheduled for March 20th, 2019 was temporally postponed.
·L ong Term Power Capacity Compensation Mechanism With Article 15 of L. 4618/2019 which superseded Article 95 of L. 4001/2011 the establishment of a Permanent
Power Capacity Compensation Mechanism is provided for on the basis of a competitive process, through the auctioning by the HETS Administrator of reliability rights for a predetermined period. The selected providers will be reimbursed for the power availability service at a fee paid by the HETS Administrator. The Power Availability Compensation Mechanism will be funded by charges that the HETS Administrator will impose on the Electricity Suppliers.
·Special fee for the reduction of CO emissions (ETMEAR - ex RES Fee) and RES Special Account (ELAPE) 2
By L. 4585/2018, "Emergency Regulations of the Ministry of Environment and Energy etc. - (OG A' 216/24.12.2018), some provisions of L. 4001/2011 regarding ETMEAR and the RES Special Account have been amended and were set in effect from January 1st, 2019.

· Moreover, Sales Departments, by applying the Supply Code, stop massively to represent customers who did not pay their debts for many months and did not respond to PPC's calls to settle their debts.
· PPC maintains the consistency discount to those customers who pay their bills timely. The aforementioned discount was set 15% from 01.01.2019 to 31.03.2019 and 10% from 01.04.2019 to 30.08.2019 and 5% from 01.09.2019.
· Since 01.04.2019, PPC continues the 4% discount due to the prepayment of the electricity bills.
Transformation of PPC In November 2019, the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) was drafted by the Greek Parliament and it was published in OG 4893/'/31.12.2019 on December 31st, 2019. The NECP provides for the lignite phase-out of the Country by 2028. The Management of the Company, taking into account the NECP, proceeded with the planning of its medium-term business plan for the next five years and decided to restructure the Group, with an emphasis on green energy, accelerating the plan for shutting-down the lignite fired power plants and the related mines and promoting RES as the new dominant power production technology. The detailed plan for the lignite phase-out includes the shutting-down of the 12 lignite fired power plants with a capacity of about 3.4 GW starting from the year 2020 until 2023. In 2022, the new Unit Ptolemaida V will be integrated into the system and will continue to operate with lignite until 2028 at the latest, and then will operate with a different fuel mix. Similarly, the plan to cease the operation of the mines follows the plan for shutting-down the lignite fired power plants, with the gradual shutting-down of all mines in 2023 except the South Field Mine, which will cease its operation in 2028. The lignite phase-out plan will be implemented with full respect for PPC's employees, local communities and the environment. The company will cooperate with the local authorities to find the most suitable alternative solutions for district heating and will support the Government's plan for supporting local economies. Since PPC still holds significant fixed assets in the regions, it intends to develop activities there with significant added value for both the company and local economies.

4. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
4.1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Approval of financial statements The Board of Directors of the Parent Company approved the accompanying financial statements for the year ended December 31st, 2019 on April 23rd, 2020. These financial statements are subject to approval by the Parent Company's General Shareholders' Meeting.
Basis of preparation of financial statements The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for fixed assets and financial assets that have been measured at fair value through other comprehensive income), assuming that PPC will continue as a going concern. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Euro and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
During the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent Company recorded pre-tax losses, that are due solely a) to impairments of Assets as a result of the decision taken in 2019 for cutting its reliance on coal until 2028 and b) to the reduction of the Group's and Parent Company's fixed assets values, arising from the revaluation of these assets as of December 31st, 2019, in accordance with Group's and Parent Company's accounting principles.
At the same time, the Group's and the Parent Company's total current liabilities exceed the total current assets by approximately Euro 779 mil. and Euro 981 mil., respectively (2018 : Group: Euro 979 mil. and Parent Company: Euro 1,182 mil.). This difference is mainly due to the obligation to repay within the year 2020 the current portion of longterm borrowing amounting to Euro 407.7 mil., while a significant part is also the additional obligation to purchase CO emission rights due to the rapid increase in the international prices in 2019. It is noted that the Group and the
2
Parent Company as at December 31st, 2019 are in full compliance with the terms of all their loan agreements.
In order for the Group and the Parent Company to be able to meet their liabilities as long as they become overdue, they have taken the following actions:
1) Securing long term borrowings and a releasing (guarantees because of borrowing) pledged deposits totaling to Euro 183.7 mil. in 2020.
2) Increase on electricity bills prices, decrease of the discount for the timely payment of electricity bills, decrease of the discounts for payments in advance and use of "Clause for CO " in Low Voltage invoices (Decision of the
2
Board of Directors 90/30.09.2019). Additionally, with the respective decision, the Chairman and CEO of the Company was authorized to resolve any issue that may arise from the implementation of the decision and for the determination of the commercial and tariff policy assisted by the competent business units. 3) Collection from the Greek State, in February 2020, of an amount of Euro 587 mil., as a prepayment for electricity consumption of its entities for the year 2020. This prepayment by the Greek State is expected to be repeated in the first quarter of 2021 based on a five-year agreement signed with the Greek State on June 14th, 2018. 4) Collection, in January 2020, of PSOs for the period 2007-2011 amounting to Euro 45 mil.

part ' / Financial Report

152

The above actions have already result in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 and will continue to result in a significant improvement in the cash flows and operational profitability of both the Group and the Parent company.
However, it should be noted that, despite the above, current liabilities are expected to continue to exceed current receivables in the future.
Within the First quarter of 2020, the spread of COVID-19 proves to be a major global and European challenge. The Group and the Parent Company, already from the initial appearance of the new coronavirus, implement a series of actions aiming to informing employees, raising their awareness on the prevention and protection measures, providing them with the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), protecting both them and their families and at the same time ensuring the continuity of its operation.
The Group's and the Parent Company's Management monitors daily the developments regarding the rapid spread of COVID-19 and study on an ongoing basis any negative or positive impacts that may arise in their financial position, operating results, cash flows and the implementation of their business and investment plans, and proceeds with estimates and quantification of the relevant figures where possible.
From the assessment carried out up to date, it does not seem to arise any significant negative impact for the Group and the Parent Company from the measures taken for reduction of the spread of COVID-19. On the contrary, it is expected an increase in the profitability of the Group and the Parent Company due to the significant decrease of energy costs that covers the decrease of electricity sales, and simultaneously the negative impact from the increase of overdue receivables. All the above, apply also after the adoption of the worst case scenario in respect of the basic assumptions made, while in any case the Company will be in compliance with the covenants included in the loan agreements for the period ended June 30, 2021 (note 43).
Taking into consideration the cash flows of the approved Budget 2020, the estimated cash flows until June 30th, 2021 and all the available information for the foreseeable future including the data up to date on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Management concludes that the Group and the Parent Company have ensured that they will continue to operate as a going concern and thus prepared their financial statements on the basis of the going concern principle as Management does not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their transactions and under no circumstances is forced to do so.
Consequently, Management concluded that the basis of the going concern is the correct one, after having taken into consideration a wide range of factors.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, drawn up to December 31st each year. Subsidiaries (companies in which the Group directly or indirectly or through other subsidiaries has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations) have been consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Losses within a subsidiary are apportioned to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without any change in control) is accounted for as an equity transaction. All inter-company balances and transactions have been fully eliminated as well as unrealized intra ­ group gains and losses. Where necessary, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been revised to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. It is noted that certain of the abovementioned requirements have not a retrospective effect, and due to this reason the following differences are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation:

·Losses incurred by the Group were not attributed to the non-controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the Parent Company, unless the non-controlling interest had a biding obligation to cover these.
In case that the Group loses control of a subsidiary then the following are : Derecognized :
- The assets (including the surplus value) and liabilities of the subsidiary - The book value of the non-controlling interest - The accumulated exchange differences, which have been recorded in Equity Recognized: - The fair value of the price obtained - The fair value of the remaining participation - Any surplus or deficit in the Statement of Income -The Parent Company's share in the elements previously recognized in the comprehensive income statement,
in the income statement or the retained earnings where that is judged necessary.
4.2 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
A) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations adopted
The accounting policies on the basis of which the annual separate and consolidated financial statements were prepared for the year ended December 31st, 2019 were consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual separate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st, 2018 with the exception of the following amendments and standards, which were adopted by the Group and the Parent Company on January 1st, 2019. The Group and the Parent Company adopted for the first time IFRS 16 Leases. The nature and effect of these changes are analyzed below. Various other amendments and interpretations were adopted for the first time in 2019 but did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st, 2019.
· IFRS 16 : Leases IFRS 16 replaces the existing accounting treatment of leases under IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating Leases - Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to the contract, namely the customer ("lessee"), and the supplier ("lessor"). The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases in their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting framework for all leases, with some exceptions. Lessors will continue to classify leases either as operating or as finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 has no impact on leases where the Company is the lessor.
The standard mainly affects the accounting treatment of the Group's and the Parent Company's operating leases.
4. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Group and the Parent Company initially adopted IFRS 16 on January 1st, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, whereby the retrospective effect of applying the standard was recognized at that date. The comparative figures have not been restated. The Group and the Parent Company applied the practical expedient provided for the definition of a lease. This means that they applied IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before January 1st, 2019 that were identified as leases

part ' / Financial Report

154

in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Furthermore, the Group and the Parent Company use the exemptions of the standard for lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less and lease contracts of low value.
On the Standard's initial application date, there was an impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's total assets and liabilities, due to the capitalization of operating leases as assets and the recognition of their respective liabilities.
Analysis of the impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements from the adoption of IFRS 16 is set out in note 42.
a) Nature of the effect of adoption of IFRS 16
The Group and the Parent Company have lease contracts for property, equipment, chartering of vessels for the transport of fuels in the Non-Interconnected islands for the production of electricity and transportation assets. Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group and the Parent Company (as lessees) classified their leases either as a finance lease (where the Group and the Parent Company maintained substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership), or as an operating lease. Finance leases were capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between lease liabilities and finance costs. The part of the finance cost of the lease corresponding to interest was recognized in the income statement during the lease, while the corresponding lease liabilities were reflected in "Borrowings". Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership were retained by the lessor were classified as operating leases and were not capitalized, while payments for operating leases were recognized in the income statement proportionately during the lease. Any prepaid rents were included in "Other receivables", while accrued leases were included in "Accrued and other liabilities".
Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group and the Parent Company applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for leases of low-value and leases where the lease term is lower or equal to 12 months. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group and the Parent Company.
- Leases previously classified as finance leases
The Group and the Parent Company had no finance leases on January 1st, 2019
- Leases previously accounted for as operating leases
The Group and the Parent Company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for leases of low-value assets and leases where the lease term is lower or equal to 12 months. The right-of-use assets were recognized as equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application. Lease liabilities were recognized at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The Group and the Parent Company also applied the available practical expedients whereby they:

- Used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics (such as leases with a corresponding lease term, for similar fixed assets and in a corresponding economic environment).
- Assessed on whether leases contracts were onerous, immediately before the date of initial application. - Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application. - Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contained options to extend or terminate the
lease. - Chose not to separate lease from non-lease components but to consider them as a single component, per asset
category. This choice was made in the category of other equipment.
Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group's and the Parent Company's new accounting policies, which have been applied from the date of initial adoption are set out below:
b) Summary of new accounting policies
- Right-of-use assets The Group and the Parent Company recognize right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-ofuse assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized (see below), initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease discounts or incentives received. Unless the Group and the Parent Company are reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.
- Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group and the Parent Company recognize lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be paid over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and the Parent Company and amounts of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease contract reasonably reflects that the Group and the Parent Company will exercise the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group and the Parent Company use the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease contract is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification in the lease contract or a change in the lease term, a change in fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. The result of this re-measurement is disclosed in a line of the right-of-use assets note as modifications.
- Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group and the Parent Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases

part ' / Financial Report

156

(i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). They also apply the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value (i.e., below Euro 5,000). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
- Significant judgment in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options
The Group and the Parent Company determine the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by a) an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or b) an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group and the Parent Company have the option, under some of their leases to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group and the Parent Company apply judgment in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew, taking into consideration all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for them to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group and the Parent Company reassess the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within their control and affects their ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (for example a change in the Group's and the Parent Company's business strategy).
· IFRS 9: Prepayment with Negative Compensation (Amendment) The amendment clarifies that financial assets allowing or requiring a party to either pay or receive fair compensation for the early termination of the contract (so that, from the perspective of the holder of the asset there may be a negative compensation) may be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income. The amendment does not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Parent Company.
· IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments) The amendments relate to whether the measurement (and especially the impairment) of long-term investments in associates and joint ventures, which are in essence part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, is governed by IFRS 9, IAS 28, or a combination of the two standards. The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 before applying IAS 28 to those long-term investments for which the equity method does not apply. When applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take into account any adjustments in the carrying amount of long-term investments that arise from the application of IAS 28. These amendments have no material effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements.
· IFRIC 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The interpretation provides guidance for addressing the uncertainty involved in tax treatments when accounting for income taxes. The interpretation provides additional clarification regarding the examination of uncertain tax assumptions individually or collectively, the examination of tax assumptions by the tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect the uncertainty of the acceptance of the assumption by the tax authorities, as well as the examination of the consequences of changes in facts and circumstances. This interpretation does not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Parent Company.

· IAS 19: Changes, Cuts or Settlement of a Defined Benefit Plan (Amendments) The amendments require entities to use updated actuarial assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after a change, cut or settlement of the defined benefit plan is made. The amendments also clarify how the application of asset ceiling requirements is affected by the accounting treatment of a change, cut or settlement of the defined benefit plan. These amendments do not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Parent Company.
· The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015 ­ 2017 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The following amendments are not expected to have material impact on the Company's (and / or the Group's) financial statements unless otherwise stated.
- IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it re-measures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not re-measure previously held interests in that business.
- IAS 12 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify that the income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity should be recognized according to where the past transactions or events that generated distributable profits have been recognized.
-IAS 23 Borrowing Costs: The amendments clarify paragraph 14 of the standard that, when a qualifying asset is ready for its intended use or sale, and some of the specific borrowing related to that qualifying asset remains outstanding at that point, that borrowing is to be included in the funds that an entity borrows generally.
B) Standards and Interpretations which are mandatory for subsequent periods and have not been applied earlier by the Company and the Group
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are mandatory for subsequent periods. The Company and the Group have not yet applied the following standards.
· IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments): Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of accounting. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting The IASB issued the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting on March 29th, 2018. The Conceptual Framework sets out a comprehensive set of concepts for financial reporting, standard setting, guidance for preparers in developing consistent accounting policies and assistance to others in their efforts to understand and interpret the standards. IASB also issued a separate accompanying document, Amendments to References to the Conceptual

part ' / Financial Report

158

Framework in IFRS Standards, which sets out the amendments to affected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework.
Its objective is to support transition to the revised Conceptual Framework for companies that develop accounting policies using the Conceptual Framework when no IFRS Standard applies to a particular transaction. For preparers who develop accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2020.
· IFRS 3: Business Combinations (Amendments) The IASB issued amendments regarding the definition of a business (amendments to IFRS 3) in order to resolve the difficulties that arise when an entity determines whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets. The amendments apply to business combinations for which the acquisition date is determined in the first annual accounting period commencing on or after January 1st, 2020 and for the acquisition of assets that occur at or after the beginning of that period, while earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Materiality (Amendments) The amendments are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2020, while earlier adoption is permitted. The amendments clarify the definition of materiality and the way it should be applied. The new definition states that «Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity". In addition, the interpretations accompanying the definition of materiality have been improved. The amendments ensure that the definition of materiality is consistent across all IFRS standards. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (Amendments) The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2020 and must be applied retrospectively. Earlier application is permitted. In September 2019, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, which concludes the first phase of its works to respond to the effects of Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) reform on financial reporting. The second phase focus on issues that could affect financial reporting when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced with a risk-free interest rate (an RFR). The amendments published, deal with issues arising in financial reporting in the period before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative interest rate and address the implications for specific hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement". The amendments provided temporary reliefs, applicable to all existing hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform, which enable hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate. There are also amendments to IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" regarding additional disclosures around uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these amendments in its financial statements.

· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments) The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2022 while earlier application is permitted. The amendments aim to achieve consistency in the application of the standard's requirements, helping companies to determine whether the loans and other liabilities with uncertain settlement date are classified as Current or Non-Current liabilities, in the Statement of Financial Position. The amendments affect the presentation of liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position, while they do not amend the existing requirements regarding the measurement or the time of recognition of an asset, liability, income or expense or their disclosures. The amendments also clarify the classification requirements for the borrowing, which can be settled by a company by issuing equity instruments. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these amendments in its financial statements.
4.3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The principle judgments and estimates referring to events, the development of which could significantly affect the items of the financial statements during the forthcoming twelve month period are as follows:
Post-retirement benefits a) T he Group's employees and pensioners are entitled to the supply of electricity (which the Parent Company
provides) at reduced tariffs. Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. The relevant retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions. b)According to the provision of Article 25 of L. 4491/66 "Regarding the Insurance of PPC's Staff" an one-off allowance is paid to the beneficiaries of pension (who are insured employees leaving PPC) in proportion to the years of actual service to PPC. This one-off allowance, according to the special provision of par. 3 of the same article, is offset against any compensation paid due to termination of the employment contract, or because the insured employees reached the age limit or due to another reason for leaving, according to the provisions of the law. The provisions of PPC's Staff Regulations (SR/ PPC) which was ratified by Article 2 of legislative decree 210/1974 and has the force of law, and specifically in Articles 34, 35, 36 and 37, it is defined that the Company's permanent staff, who for whatever reason its contract is terminated (automatically or through termination of an employment contract), no compensation is payable if entitled to an one-off allowance from the relevant insurance organization. If the one-off allowance is less than the compensation, then only the difference between the compensation and the one-off allowance is paid. In any case, and when an employer is, in accordance with Article 2 § 1 of L. 173/1967, "public or government owned entities or Businesses and Utilities (PPC, OTE etc.)" the owed compensation due to dismissal of L. 2112/1920 that would be paid, if not the above, in any way of employees leaving from the company and because of this, shall be subject to the limitations imposed by the abovementioned provisions in respect of its upper limit, which according to article 33 of L. 1876/1990, as amended by the provisions of article 21 § 13 of L. 3144/2003, is currently set at Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro).

part ' / Financial Report

160

With L. 4533/2018 (OG A ' 7527/4/2018), the provision of Article 25 (par.3) of L. 4491/1966 (OG A ' 1) as well as any other general or specific provision of the law or the Labor Regulation which provides for the offsetting of employees' severance payment with the one-off allowance to which employees are entitled by the relevant insurance organization, were abolished. Based on the above, PPC S.A. and its subsidiaries, will hereafter pay a severance payment, which should not exceed Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro) to the insured employees who leave due to termination of the employment contract, or because they reached the age limit, or due to other reason that the law provides. The above is a defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19. The present value of the liability assumed by PPC S.A. and its subsidiaries, calculated at the end of each year using actuarial methods, is a past service cost for service provided in previous periods.
Details of the underlying assumptions and estimates of the above mentioned post - retirement benefits are included in Note 31.
Fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment The Group carries its property, plant and equipment (except for mining land and lakes) at revalued amounts (estimated fair values) as determined by an independent firm of appraisers. Revaluation is performed periodically (every three to five years). The determination of the fair values of property, plant and equipment requires from management to make estimates, assumptions and judgements with respect to the ownership, the value in use and the existence of any economic, functional and physical obsolescence of property, plant and equipment.
On December 31st, 2019, the Group assigned the revaluation of property, plant and equipment to an independent appraiser. Key estimates, assumptions and judgments made to determine the fair value are included in Note 15. Furthermore, the management makes estimates regarding the total and the remaining useful lives of fixed assets which are subject to periodic review. Useful lives as estimated are included in Note 4.4.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a long ­ term asset may be impaired. The determination of whether such indications exists, requires from Management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to external and internal factors that may affect the recoverability of assets, as well as assumptions on the determination of the cash flow generating units (Note 15).
The Group and the Parent Company as lessee The Management, in order to measure the right-of-use assets, determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by a) an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or b) an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. In determining the lease term, Management assesses all the facts and circumstances that create economic incentive for them to exercise the option of renewal or not exercise the option of termination. After the commencement date of the lease, Management reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within their control and affects their ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (for example a change in the Group's and the Parent Company's business strategy). In addition, the Management in order to calculate the financial lease liability determined the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at the lease commencement date as the interest rate implicit in the lease contract is not readily determinable. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group and the Parent Company would have to pay, to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset.

Decommissioning and removal costs of property, plant and equipment and mines' land restoration costs Based on the provisions of IAS 16 "Property, plant and equipment" the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes, among others, the initial estimate of the costs required for the dismantling and removal of such an item. These costs are quantified and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IAS 37 "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets", while any subsequent change in the measurement of this provision is treated in accordance with the provisions of IFRIC 1.
The respective provision includes the land remediation cost, the cost of dismantling the existing equipment/ machinery, the cost of demolition of buildings and collection of any waste from power plants and mines. At the time of their dismantling and removal, the actual cost and the commencement and expiration date of the relevant works may differ from Management's estimate.
In addition, the Group and the Parent Company, in order to calculate the provision of decommissioning, determined the discount rate that reflects the current market estimates for the time value of money and the risks associated with the liability.
Regarding the remediation of the environment of the hydro power plants, the Group and the Parent Company estimate that the relevant cost in present values is not significant on December 31st, 2019 and therefore they have not established any provision. In the future the actual commencement date of the relevant works and the remediation cost may differ from Management's estimate.
Details of the underlying assumptions and estimates for the decommissioning provision are included in principal accounting policies and in Note 32.
Provisions for risks The Group is establishing provisions concerning claims by third parties against companies of the Group and which might lead to an outflow of resources for their settlement. The provision is established based on amounts claimed and the possible outcome of the legal dispute.
Provisions for trade receivables The Group and Parent Company apply the simplified approach set out in the Standard IFRS 9 for the calculation of Expected Credit Losses, according to which the respective provision is always measured in amount equal to the expected credit losses over the life of customer receivables. The provision for doubtful receivables is formed for high voltage customers on a personalized basis in the assessment of the expected credit loss per customer. While for the estimation of the expected credit losses from medium and low voltage customers, credit loss provision tables are applied with an ageing analysis of the trade receivables balances, based on the historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses and adjusted for future factors with respect to debtors and the economic environment. Additional details are included in Notes 4.2 and 21. Provisions for income taxes and recognition of deferred tax receivables Current provisions for income tax liabilities for current and prior years are calculated at the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities, using the prevailing tax rates at the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes current taxes reported in the respective income tax returns and potential additional taxes that may be imposed by the tax authorities upon settlement of the unaudited tax years on the basis of the findings of prior tax audits. Therefore, final settlement of the income taxes might differ from the income taxes that have been accounted for in the financial statements. From the fiscal year 2011 onwards, the Parent Company and several of its subsidiaries are audited for tax purposes by the Certified Auditors Accountants in accordance with the provisions of Income

part ' / Financial Report

162

Tax Legislation. The audit for the fiscal year 2019 is ongoing and the relative tax conformity report will be issued after the publication of the financial statements for the year 2019. If, at the completion of the tax audit, additional tax liabilities arise, the Management estimates that these will have no material effect on the financial statements. Deferred tax receivables are recognized on carried forward tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will occur to offset carried forward tax losses. Deferred tax receivables that are recognized, require Management to make assessments as to the time and level of realization of future taxable profits.
Provision for unbilled revenue Management considers that its customers consume the benefit of electricity over the period of the sale, while the Parent Company continues to fulfil its contractual liabilities. For this reason, revenue is recognized based on actual quantities of electricity consumed and based on an estimation of electricity consumed (unbilled revenue). Especially for low voltage customers at each balance sheet date, unbilled revenue is recorded to account for electricity delivered and consumed by these customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenue is estimated using certain assumptions with respect to quantities of electricity consumed, network losses and average electricity sale prices. The actual amounts that will be finally billed may differ from those provided for. (Note 6)
Recognition of revenue from customers' contributions The Group estimates that customers' contributions refer to the initial and continuous connection to the distribution network which is a distinct service, separate from electricity sale. The service which is promised to be delivered is the only one to be executed by HEDNO and this transaction is considered a separate contractual obligation. Therefore, revenue from customers' contributions is recognized as the service transferred to the customer. As the contract with the customer is not of a specific time duration, the revenue is recognized based on the useful life of the distribution network fixed assets (35 years).
4.4 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Foreign currency translation The functional and reporting currency of all the Group entities is the Euro. Transactions involving other currencies are converted into Euro using the exchange rates, which were in effect at the time of the transactions. At the balance sheet date, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency adjustments are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), in the accompanying statements of income. Non-monetary items in foreign currency which are valuated at acquisition cost are converted using the exchange rate of the date of acquisition. The non-monetary items which are measured at fair value in foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate of the fair value's calculation date. The profit or loss from the conversion of non-monetary items is treated in the same way as the profit or loss from the conversion of fair value of these items. Intangible assets Intangible assets include software and CO emission rights allowances.
2
Software Software programs are measured at their acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation and impairments. In case of withdrawal or sale, the cost of acquisition and depreciation are written off. Any profit or loss resulting from the write-off is included in the Statement of Income. Software is depreciated using the straight line amortization method over a five-year period.

CO Emissions Rights 2

Parent Company acquires CO emission rights in order to meet its obligation arising from the actual CO emissions of

2

2

its production units. This liability is measured at fair value to the extent that Parent Company has the obligation to

cover its emissions through purchases (after offset of any free CO emission rights held). Emission rights purchased 2
and held are recognized as intangible assets, at their acquisition cost less any accumulated impairment loss.

Tangible Assets Tangible assets are initially recognised at their acquisition cost which includes all direct attributable expenses for their acquisition or construction. Subsequent to their initial recognition, tangible assets (with the exception of mines and lakes which are valued at their acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation and impairment) are valued at fair value minus accumulated depreciation and impairment. Fair value estimates are performed periodically by independent appraisers (every three to five years) in order to ensure that fair value does not differ significantly from net value of the asset. At the date of revaluation, accumulated depreciation is offset against pre depreciation accounting values and net amounts are restated according to revalued amounts. Any increase in value is credited to the revaluation surplus in equity net of deferred taxes. However, an increase due to revaluation will be recognized in the Statement of Income, to the extent that it reverses a previous devaluation of the same asset, which had previously been recognized in the Income Statement. Any decreases, first offset remaining revaluations surplus and then the remaining amounts burden the Statement of Income. Upon disposal of a revalued tangible asset, the relevant portion of the revaluation surplus is transferred from the revaluation surplus to the retained earnings. Repairs and maintenance are recorded in expenses in the fiscal year in which they are incurred. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized if the criteria for recognizing them as tangible asset are met. For all assets withdrawn or sold, their acquisition cost and depreciation are written ­ off when sold or withdrawn. Any gain or loss resulting from the write ­ off is included in the Statement of Income.

The use of the own resources for the construction in progress tangible assets constitutes an addition to their acquisition cost at values which include the direct payroll costs of the staff participated in the construction (corresponding employers' contributions), the cost of materials used and other general costs.

Borrowing cost Since January 1st, 2009, borrowing costs that are directly related to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that needs a substantial period of time to become available for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the acquisition cost of that asset. This accounting policy is implemented on fixed assets recognized from January 1st, 2009 onwards (new constructions). All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Depreciation Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated residual useful life of the asset. The total useful life (in years) used for calculating depreciation is as follows:

Mining activities 1.The Group and the Parent Company own and operate lignite mines. Land acquisition (mainly through
expropriation) and initial (pre-operational) development costs relating to mines are capitalized and amortized (upon commencement of the mines' commercial operation) to the shortest period between mine life and a twenty (20) year period. Exploration, evaluation and ongoing development costs are added to the lignite production cost of the fiscal year they incurred. 2.After the completion of the mines' restoration, the restored mining land is transferred from the category "Mines" to the category "Land", if the restored land has been expropriated in the name of the Company and not in favor of the Greek State.
Provision of decommissioning of power plants and dismantling of infrastructure/ equipment of power plants and mines The provision of decommissioning of power plants is calculated taking into account the specificities of each unit (type of fuel, generating capacity, co-installation of units) discounting the present value of the land remediation cost, the cost of dismantling the existing equipment/machinery, the cost of demolition of infrastructure and collection of any waste by using a discount rate. The cost includes the direct cost of monitoring/managing the project of the withdrawal of units. The provision is reduced by actual costs (utilization of provision) and increases with the finance cost. In case the actual costs exceed the estimated ones, the difference is recorded directly in the income statement. Moreover, the respective provision does not take into account any income from the sale of machinery, spare parts and materials of the decommissioned units or from the utilization of the land, as the relevant revenue will be recognized at the time it is considered certain. For all units, the present value of their restoration costs, for the demolition of their infrastructure and the removal of their equipment is first capitalized on the value of assets they concern proportionately following their remaining useful life, while any remaining amount is then offset by any revaluation surplus existed with direct record in other comprehensive income and if any further amount remains it is then recognized in the Statement of Income. Any changes in the provision of decommissioning of power plants due to a change in Management's estimate (change of the restoration time, change of the future use of the fixed asset or related cost) affect the assets' revaluation surplus or deficit which was previously recognized, so that:

·a decrease in the liability shall be recognized in other comprehensive income and increase the revaluation surplus included in equity, with the difference that it will be recognized in the Statement of Income, to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation deficit of the assets, which had previously been recognized in the Income Statement. In the event that a decrease in liability exceeds the book value that would have been recognized if the assets were recorded in accordance with the cost method, the excess amount will be recognized immediately in the income statement.
·an increase in the liability shall be recognized in the Statement of Income, with the difference that it will be recognized directly in other comprehensive income and it will reduce the revaluation surplus included in equity as long as there is a credit balance for the assets in the revaluation surplus.
The amortized amount of assets is depreciated throughout their useful life. Therefore, when the relevant assets reach the end of their useful life, any subsequent change in liability is recognized in the income statement when is incurred. On December 31st, 2018, the Group and the Parent Company had not established a provision for the decommissioning of their units due to the gradual removal of waste / decontamination of the installation sites of its units and the non-existence of a legal and constructive commitment for the demolition of the units that were withdrawn and those that are going to withdraw. Due to the restructuring of PPC Group and the commitment undertaken by the Group and the Parent Company in 2019 to demolish infrastructure, remove equipment and fully restore then land when the industrial sites will cease from operation, the respective cost was first estimated on December 31st, 2019 (Note 32). Simultaneously, the Group and the Company recognized a provision for the removal of infrastructure /dismantling of equipment of its mines (Note 32) that includes the cost of the removal of infrastructure and the cost of dismantling of equipment with use of a discount rate, while it does not take into account any income from the sale of machinery, spare parts and materials. The provision is reduced by the actual costs incurred (utilization of the provision) and is increased with the finance cost. Any change in the provision of the removal of infrastructure /dismantling of equipment of mines follow the same accounting policies for the provision of decommissioning of power plants as the assets that they concern are measured based on the revaluation model.
Provision of mines' land restoration The Group and the Parent Company own and operate lignite mines. Provision for the remediation of the environment was established to meet the Group's liabilities for the remediation of the affected land, and was calculated on the basis of the affected area and the average cost of restoration per metric unit. On December 31st, 2019, in the context of the immediate lignite phase-out, Management reassessed the cost of lignite mines' land restoration. In the provision of the mines' land restoration, except for the cost of land reclamation and remediation and the cost of reclamation of reclining surfaces and preparation for water refilling through rain and underground water, the cost of the on-going environmental monitoring and maintenance cost of the restored land are also included. As the mines' lands are measured based on the cost method, any changes in the provision of the mines' land restoration are added or deducted from the cost of the relevant asset in the current period. The amount deducted from the cost of the asset cannot exceed its book value. ·In the event that a decrease in liability exceeds the book value of the asset, the excess amount is recognized
immediately in the income statement. ·In the event of an increase in the cost of an asset, the Company considers whether this is an indication that the
asset's new book value may not be fully recoverable. The additional provision for 2019 (Note 32) was capitalized on the value of mine's land proportionately following its remaining useful life, while simultaneously Management carried out an impairment test and partially impaired the respective asset recognized since its carrying amount exceeded its recoverable value (Note 15).

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
i) Right-of-use assets The Group recognize right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: · Buildings: 2 to 10 years · Other equipment: 1 to 2 years · Transportation means: 1 to 2 years · Vessels: 18 to 24 months
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.
ii) Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group and the Parent Company recognize lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group and the Parent Company use its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. Those re-measurements are included in a separate line in the note Right of Use Assets "modifications/ re-measurements".
iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value asset The Group and the Parent Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). The Group and the Parent Company also apply the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low value (those with value less than Euro 5 thousands). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Intermediate Lessor The Group and the parent company enter into certain lease agreements with third parties and therefore act as intermediate lessors. The Group and the Parent Company, as intermediate lessors, classify the sublease as financial lease or operating lease as follows: (a) if the head lease is a short-term lease that the Group or the Parent Company, as a lessee, has accounted for
applying paragraph 6 of the standard, the sublease shall be classified as an operating lease. (b) Otherwise, the sublease shall be classified by reference to the right-of- use asset arising from the head lease,
rather than by reference to the underlying asset. The Group and the Parent Company have evaluated all sublease contracts based on the above criteria and classified them as operational or financial. As at 31 December 2019, all leases where the Group and the Parent Company act as intermediate lessors were assessed and evaluated as operating.
Leases -IAS 17 (applicable until December 31st, 2018)
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date i.e. whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right or use the asset.
Group as a lessee Leases, which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as revenue in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Investments in subsidiaries In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less any impairment losses. The spin off and contribution of an activity from the Parent Company to a wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for shares, is accounted for as a transaction between companies under common control. In cases of such transactions the shares received are recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary with a value equivalent to the carrying value of the net assets contributed at the transaction date.
Investments in associates These are entities in which the Group has significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. The Group's investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in associates are carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate, less possible provisions for any impairment in value. In case that the Group's share in an associate's losses is equal, or exceeds its participation in the associate, the Group does not recognise the losses exceeding its participation. The Statement of Income reflects separately the Group's share on the results of its associates, while amounts that are recorded by the associates directly to their equity are recognized directly to the Group's equity. Non ­ realised profit or loss resulting from the transactions of the Group with the said associates is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates. In the separate financial statements such investments are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

168

Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash generating unit's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value of sale (after the deduction of sales costs) is determined, in each case, according to the implementation of a revaluation model. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized to the Statement of Income, except if the particular asset is valued in fair values and then the impairment loss is recognised as a decrease of the already recognised surplus value. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets' recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. That increased amount resulting from the reversal of the impairment loss, cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation), if no impairment loss had been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in profit and loss unless the asset is carried at fair value amounts in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, to be divided equally to future time spans on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments such as derivatives, and fair value through other comprehensive income at each reporting date and non-financial assets such as property, periodically (every 3-5 years) at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: · In the principal market for the asset or liability, or · In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: · Level 1 -- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ·Level 2 -- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is directly or indirectly observable.

·Level 3 -- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Group determines policies and procedures applied for both recurring measurements and assets held for distribution or for sale. Assets of substantial value, as tangible assets as well as substantial value liabilities are evaluated by the Group and the Parent Company with the assistance of external appraisers. External appraisers involvement needs, are annually decided by the Group. The selection criteria include market knowledge and expertise, reputation, independence and observance of professional standards. On each reporting date, the Group, according to its accounting policies, assesses if there is any change on the carrying values of assets and liabilities being subject to periodic reassessment and revaluation. For the above mentioned assessment, the management verifies considerable inputs applied to the last asset or liability evaluation, confirming data used for the evaluation against contracts and other relevant documents. For disclosing fair values, the Group's assets and liabilities are categorized according to their nature, characteristics, potential risks stemming from specific asset or liability categories, as well as fair value hierarchy described above.
Investments and financial assets Financial assets that fall under and are governed by the provisions of IFRS 9 are classified on initial recognition as financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the contractual characteristics of cash flows of the financial asset and the Group's business model for the management of that financial asset. With the exception of trade receivables and receivables from electricity customers that do not contain a significant financial component, the Group initially evaluates the financial assets at their fair value plus, in case of a financial asset that is not valued through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not have a significant financial component and also receivables from electricity customers are valued at the transaction price determined in accordance with IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, the resulting cash flows should be "Solely for Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) "n the initial capital. The Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to the way in which it manages its financial capabilities in order to generate cash flows. Business model determines whether cash flows arise from collection of contractual cash flows, sale of financial assets, or both. Usual sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized on the transaction date (on which Group is committed to purchase the financial asset). Usual purchases or sales involve purchases or sales of financial assets that require physical receipt of items within the period and are also governed by a law or a purchase agreement.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost Non-depreciated cost of a financial asset is defined as the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition less the capital repayments plus or minus the cumulative depreciation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the amortized cost adjusted for any loss provision. A financial asset is measured at amortized cost only if both of the following are met unless it is measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition:

part ' / Financial Report

170

i. The financial asset is held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets for the collection of contractual cash flows ("HTC") and, ii. The contractual terms of the financial asset result in specific dates in cash flows that are only capital and interest payments on the outstanding initial capital. Consequently, the Group classifies financial assets at amortized cost when financial assets are held in the context of a business model with a view to being held to maturity mostly concentrating their contractual cash flows, and these financial data lead to cash flows consisting only of capital and interest payments. Financial assets that do not meet the above conditions are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, with the exception of investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading and for which is selected to be measured at financial assets fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The Group, after initial recognition, measures financial assets of this category at amortized cost using effective interest rate. These financial assets are subject to impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. Profit and loss are recognized in Statement of Income when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments) Upon initial recognition, the Group may choose to irrevocably classify its equity investments as equity instruments which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they comply with the definition of equity as stated in "IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation" and are not held for sale, but it has been chosen for them to be retained with a long-term perspective to serve strategic choices. Classification is determined by financial instrument. Profit and loss from these financial assets remain in equity and are not reclassified to Statement of Income after the recognition has ceased. Dividends are recognized as other income in the Statement of Income when payment right has been established, unless the Group benefits from such revenue by recovering part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case profit is recognized in Statement of Comprehensive Income. Equity instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless it is measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Any financial asset whose contractual terms do not result in specific cash flow dates that are only capital and interest payments on the outstanding initial capital are classified by the Group at fair value through profit or loss (unless it is an investment in an equity instrument that is classified at fair value through other comprehensive income). Since the option to determine a financial asset at fair value at its initial recognition is irrevocable, if a financial asset is designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, the Group does not reclassify it as measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income in case the business model changes. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are transferred to the statement of financial position at their fair value, and changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded in the Statement of Income. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are not subject to impairment. Impairment of Financial Assets Group assesses at each reporting date whether the value of a financial asset or group of financial assets has been impaired in accordance with provisions of IFRS 9.
The Group has adopted the expected credit losses model for each of the abovementioned asset categories.
· Trade Receivables from the sale of electricity to customers · Trade Receivables from intercompany transactions · Other financial assets measured at amortized cost. · Contract assets

Trade Receivables from the sale of electricity to customers The Group and the Parent Company apply the simplified approach of IFRS 9 for the calculation of expected credit losses, according to which the provision for impairment is always measured at the amount of the expected credit losses over the lifetime of trade receivables.
More specifically:
(i) Regarding the receivables of High Voltage (HV) customers from the sale of energy, the Group and the Parent Company (due to the individual characteristics of each client and its credit behavior) evaluate the expected credit loss from each customer individually.
(ii) R egarding the receivables from Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) customers from the sale of energy, the Group and the Parent Company, considering these contracts as sharing similar characteristics, classified them into two distinct portfolios (Medium and Low Voltage). The Group and the Parent Company In order to estimate the expected credit losses, used credit loss provision tables based on the maturity of their balances, following the historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses and adjusting appropriately for future events and the economic environment.
In addition, the Group and the Parent Company consider that the non-collection of receivables constitutes a credit event as follows: · For Low Voltage customers for more than 180 days · For Medium and High Voltage customers for more than 90 days · For state-owned entities and wider public sector companies for more than 365 days
Customers' contributions Consumers or producers connected to the distribution network are required to participate in the initial cost of connecting to the network (meters, lines, substations, etc.) or other types of infrastructure by paying institutionally fixed amounts of money or by contributing fixed assets (extremely rare cases). It is noted, that according to law, all the facilities that are constructed are under the exclusive ownership and possession of the Parent Company, while in the event that a customer leaves a facility and a new customer enters, then the new customer is not obliged to pay for a new contribution. Customers' contributions are classified as "Long ­ term contract liabilities". Revenue from customers' contributions is recognized on the basis of the remaining useful life of distribution network's fixed assets and is included in "Other Sales".
Payments in advance against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity supply contract. By signing the electricity supply contract, the customer is required to pay an advance - a guarantee against future electricity consumption. This amount is not refunded to the customer but is offset by the amount of the last clearing bill following the request for suspension of electricity supply to the customer. Considering that these amounts are settled in a period over 12 months, the Group and Parent Company classified them as "Long ­ term Contract Liabilities".
An advance payment of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are paid by the participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company. During the NOME-type auctions for forward products, which are conducted every three months and concern the Parent Company's forward sale of electricity on the wholesale market for a period of 12 months, the electricity suppliers pay in advance 3% or 5% of the value of electricity, awarded to them. These prepayments are classified as "Short ­ term contract liabilities" as they are settled in less than 12 months. Revenue is recognized on an equal basis per month according to the quantities delivered to alternative electricity suppliers.

Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity The Parent Company gives the opportunity to Medium & Low Voltage customers (for High Voltage customers this possibility is included in their contract) to pre-pay the annual electricity consumption against a discount on the price of electricity. The received amounts are classified as "Short ­ term Contract Liabilities " as they are settled within 12 months, whereas revenue recognition is based on the pricing of the consumed or estimated Electricity.
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost For the other financial assets of the Group and the Parent Company, measured at amortized cost, the general approach is used. These financial assets are considered as having low credit risk and any provision for loss is limited to the expected credit losses of the next 12 months from the respective reporting date. Inventories Inventories include materials and consumables, spare parts, lignite and liquid fuel. Provision for slow moving or obsolete materials and consumables is established if necessary.
· Materials and consumables Materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the finished product in which they are incorporated. The cost is determined using the weighted average method. These materials are recorded in inventory when purchased and then are expensed or capitalized upon use.
· Lignite (self-produced and purchased) The cost of lignite inventories which have been excavated / purchased but not yet consumed at the balance sheet date is stated at the balance sheet. Lignite inventories are stated at the lower of production cost / purchase cost and net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the finished product in which they are incorporated with the cost being determined by using the weighted average production / purchase cost method. Production / purchase cost mainly consists of expenses incurred in order for lignite inventories to be used for electricity generation.
· Liquid fuel Liquid fuel is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value which takes under consideration the net realisable value of the finished product in which it is incorporated. The cost of liquid fuel reflects purchase price plus any taxes (excluding VAT), levies and any other type of expense for the fuel to be stored in the Group warehouses and determined using the weighted average method. Liquid fuels are expensed on consumption and appear separately in the Statement of Income.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. Share capital Share capital reflects the value of the Parent Company's shares that are fully issued and in circulation. Any proceeds in excess of par value are recorded in share premium in equity. Expenses related directly to new shares issuance are recognized directly to Equity net of proceeds.
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial Receivables Financial receivables (or, where applicable a part of a financial receivable or part of a group of similar financial receivables) are derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, (2) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without

material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement and (3) The Group has transferred the right to receive cash from that asset while either: (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but has transferred control of that asset. Where the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash inflows from that asset but has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards or control of that asset, then the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to pay. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchase option (including a cash-settled option) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except in the case of a written put option on an asset measured at fair value, where the extent of the Parent Company's/Group's continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discontinued, cancelled or expires. In the event that an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet only when the Group has the legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to either settle such asset and liability on a net basis or claim the asset and settle the liability at the same time.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at cost, which reflects the fair value of the amount received less the cost of borrowing. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. For the calculation of amortized cost, all types of borrowing and issue costs are taken into account. Provisions for Risks and Expenses, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Claims Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal, contractual or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that they will be cleared through outflows of resources and the estimate of the exact amount of the liability can be reliably made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the present value of the expense expected to be required to settle the liability. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is minimal. Contingent claims are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed when the inflow of economic benefits is probable. Post-retirement benefits a) The Parent Company provides to employees and pensioners of the Group electricity at a reduced tariff. The
reduced invoice to pensioners is recognized as a liability and is calculated as the present value of future retirement benefits deemed accrued by the end of the year on the basis of the rights of employees accumulated during their service and are calculated on the basis of economic and actuarial models on the basis of economic and actuarial assumptions.
b) Starting from the fiscal year 2018, PPC and its subsidiaries will pay, in accordance with L. 4533/2018 (OG A' 7527/4/2018), a severance payment, which may not exceed Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro) to insured persons who leave due to termination of the employment contract, or because the insured employees reached the age limit or due to another reason for leaving, according to the provisions of the law.

174

Net expense for the period is included in payroll cost in the Statement of Income and consists of the present value of the benefits earned in the year. The post-retirement benefit liability is not funded. Actuarial gains or losses are directly recognized in other comprehensive income.
Subsidies for fixed assets The Group receives grants from the Greek State and the European Union (through the public investment program of the Greek State) in order to finance specific projects that are executed within certain time periods. Subsidies are accounted for when they are collected and are shown in the balance sheet as deferred income. Amortization is recognized based on the remaining useful life of the related assets and is included in depreciation in the Statement of Income.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value based on quoted market prices if available, or defined using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. The accounting of subsequent movement of fair value depends on whether derivative qualifies criteria for hedge accounting and the nature of the asset being hedged. For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability. For derivatives used for hedging, a hedge account is applied which at the inception of a hedge relationship, formal documentation, includes the existence, identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the business strategy for undertaking the hedge.
For fair value hedges that meet all the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting, any change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of income.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the profit or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative profit or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.
The Parent Company uses derivatives in order to hedge its exposure on interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquid fuels price risk. As of December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent Company had not entered into any derivative financial instrument.
Income taxes (current and deferred)
Current Income Taxes Current income tax expense consists of income taxes for the current year based on the Parent Company's profits and the profits of the other companies of the Group as adjusted in their tax returns and, provisions for additional income taxes and increments arising from unaudited tax years, and is calculated by using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date.
Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income tax is calculated, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base and the book value of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for

all taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred income tax liability arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or of a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences carried forward as well as unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is possible that taxable profit will be available against the deductible temporary differences and the carried forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. No deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences is recognized when it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are reduced at the time where it is not considered possible that enough taxable profits will appear against which, a part or the total of assets can be utilized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in force in the year when the asset is recovered or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that are in force or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income is recorded in other comprehensive income and not in the Statement of Income.
Defined contribution plans The Parent Company and the Group recognize as an expense the contribution for the employees' services payable to EFKA (Greek Single Social Security Institution) (ex IKA ­ETAM /TAP DEH, ETEA, TAYTEKO) (defined contribution plans) and as a liability the amount that has not been paid yet.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of electricity to customers The Group and the Parent Company are active in the supply of electricity to high, medium and low voltage customers through the Operations electricity Supply Sector and in the provision of electricity distribution services. Given the particular characteristics of electricity, the Group and the Parent Company consider that when their customers buy electricity simultaneously receive and use the benefits on an ongoing basis resulting from the sale of electricity as the Parent Company fulfills its contractual obligations. For this reason, revenue recognition (as long as the collection of the total amounts is considered probable) is based on metering data or on estimation of electricity consumed. The Group and the Parent Company also assess whether they have the role of principal or representative in any relevant agreement. The Group's and the Parent Company's assessment is that they have the role of principal in all of its sales transactions. If the price agreed under the contract also includes a variable portion, this amount is recognized as revenue to the extent that it is unlikely to be reversed in the future.
Contract Assets At each reporting date and taking into account that the invoicing based on the measurement data of the last month of the period is issued during the first days of the following month, as far as High and Medium Voltage customers are concerned, the total value of electricity provided that month is recognized as accrued revenue for the period, and is reversed in the following month, after billing has already been recorded in books. These accruals at the end of each reporting period are classified as "Contract Assets". Additionally, at each reporting date, the Parent Company estimates the value of the energy consumed but not yet billed from Low Voltage customers, since it has developed an estimation method especially for doing so. The estimated values are recorded as income receivable for periods ending on the reporting date and are reversed during the following month. Those accruals are also classified as "Contract Assets" at the end of each reporting period.

Contract Liabilities If the customer pays a fee, or the Group reserves an unconditional right to a sum of money, before the Group transfers the goods or services to the customer, it classified the contract as a contract liability to the customer, either when the payment is made or when it becomes chargeable (whichever comes first). For the Group and the Parent Company, contract liabilities come mainly from: · Customers' contibutions ·Payments in advance against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity
supply contract. ·An advance payment of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are
paid by the participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company. · Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity.
Revenue from NOME quantities Revenue from forward products (NOME) is recognized at the time of delivery of those forward products' quantities. The difference from the quantities of electricity delivered by the Company for fulfilling its liability in forward products (NOME) is recognized at the time of delivery and not before that (for the total time of each auction), because this difference cannot be measured reliably before delivery time. The Parent Company considers the "NOME mechanism" as an onerous contract, in accordance with IAS 37, but as the unavoidable costs of fulfilling its commitments by this mechanism cannot be determined reliably, no relevant provision has been recognized on the financial statements.
Interest income Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognized when it has been approved by the relevant authority of the company that distributes it.
Income from rentals Leases, where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases and the rentals are recognized as revenue in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Electricity Electricity costs are expensed as purchased and presented separately in the Statement of Income.
Earnings/ (Losses) per share The basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit with the weighted average number of shares issued during the relevant year. The weighted average number of shares is derived by adding the existing shares, in which the share capital is divided, with the rights that the Parent Company owns and potentially could exercise.
Subsequent events Subsequent events that provide additional information about events or circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date and meet their recognition criteria, are reflected in the financial statements. Otherwise, they are disclosed in the notes of the financial statements.
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The Group classifies a non-current asset (or a group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction and not through its use. In sale transactions, all exchanges of non ­ current assets for other non ­ current assets are included, if the transaction has a commercial substance. The basic requirements for a non-current asset (or a group of assets and liabilities) to be classified as held for sale are that the asset or the group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition while the completion

of the sale must depend only on conditions that are usual and customary for sales of such assets / groups and its sale must be highly probable and within the next 12 month from their classification. Immediately, before the original classification of an asset or the group of assets and liabilities as held for sale , the asset or the group of assets and liabilities are evaluated according to the adopted IFRS's at the date of classification. Non - current assets (or a group of assets and liabilities) classified as held for sale are measured (after the initial classification as above) at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less the expenses to sell and any possible resulting impairment losses will be recognized in the Statement of Income. Any subsequent increase in fair value will be recognized in the Statement of Income, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss which was previously recognized. No depreciation or amortization is recognized on a non-current asset (or non-current assets that are included in a group of assets and liabilities) from the date that is classified as held for sale. When the Group has classified a non-current asset (or a group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale, while the classification criteria are no longer met, the Group will cease to classify the non-current asset (or a group of assets and liabilities) as Held for sale. The Group will measure the non-current asset (or a group of assets and liabilities) that cease to be classified a held for sale at the lower of: a) its carrying amount before the asset (or disposal group) was classified as held for sale or for distribution, adjusted for any depreciation, amortization or revaluations that would have been recognized had the asset (or disposal group) not been so classified; and b) its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. The Group will include any required adjustment of its carrying amount in the profit or loss statement that cease to be classified as held for sale.
Operating Segment According to L. 4001/2011 the Group, as a vertically integrated undertaking, is obliged to prepare and integrate in its financial statements, accounting unbundled financial statements for each segment. These include the Parent Company's activities in the Sectors of Mines, Generation, Distribution and Supply and are compatible with the information provided to the Executive Committee, which consists of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, the Deputy CEOs and the General Managers. The Executive Committee monitors internal financial reports to evaluate the performance of the Company and the Group and to make decisions on the allocation of the Group's resources and on Group's strategic movements. As a result, information disclosures by operational segment as well as the principles of segment as presented in IFRS 8 "Operating Segment" are stated in Appendix I and pertain only to Company's continuing operations. The Group's activities, which do not meet the criteria and quantitative limits of IFRS 8 to be a distinct operating segment, are combined and presented under the description "Other Group's Companies".
Spin-off of the lignite power generation sectors Following the disclosures made in Note 2 under the heading "Structural measures on access to lignite and the further opening of the wholesale electricity market", pursuant to L. 4533/2018, on May 23rd, 2018, the Parent Company's Board of Directors decided the spin-off of two of PPC's lignite power generation sectors and their related assets, liabilities and human resources and their contribution to two new companies. Moreover, the Board of Directors' proposal to the Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's shareholders, which was convened on June 26th, 2018, inter alia, for this purpose and approved the above, as well as any other relevant issue with the spin-off the two PPC's lignite power generation sectors, was approved.
On June 30th, 2018 the spin-off and contribution process of the two lignite sectors of PPC S.A. to the two new companies with the sole shareholder being PPC S.A. and with the main purpose being the extraction of lignite and the production of electricity using lignite, according to the provisions of the above mentioned Law was completed (for more details please see Note 2). On June 30th, 2018 and on December 31st, 2018, the Group's and Parent Company's Management classified the value of the shareholding in the two subsidiaries, which were created on the basis of the provisions of L. 4533/2018, as Held-for-sale Assets (Discontinued Operations), since the IFRS 5 criteria were met.

In January 2019, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company decided to increase the share capital of the wholly owned subsidiary companies "Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A." and "Lignitiki Melitis S.A." by  11.6 mil. and  7.3 mil. respectively by issuing 2.9 mil. and 1.8 mil. of common shares respectively, with a nominal value of four (4) euros per share and an issue price of four (4) euros per share for both subsidiaries. The Parent Company paid the aforementioned amounts on April 18th, 2019.
The closing date for the submission of tenders, following extensions given with the consent of the European Commission, was finally set on February 6th, 2019, on which date two (2) of the interested parties submitted a binding offer. One of those was deemed inadmissible as it did not meet the criteria of the Invitation to Tender, while the second one was deemed not economically advantageous by the Board of Directors of PPC S.A., (due to the low price offered). As a result of the above, the relevant tender procedure was declared barren.
L. 4602/2019, which was passed by the Greek Parliament on March 7th, 2019 and published in the Government Gazette (OG A' 45) on March 9th, 2019, amended and supplemented L. 4533/2018. Under the new provisions, PPC was required to launch a repeat bidding process, inviting prospective bidders which participated in the previous bidding process, as well as other investors wishing to express their interest in the bid for the shares issued by "Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A." or / and "Lignitiki Melitis S.A.", within 7 days from the call. Pursuant to the above provisions of the Law, following a decision of its Board of Directors, PPC posted on March 8th, 2019 on its website a Joint Call for Proposals & Invitation to Bid, with which investors were invited to express initially their interest to participate in the bidding process by March 15th, 2019.
At the same time, PPC's management took additional measures to further improve the financial position of the two (2) lignite power generation subsidiaries for sale. The above mentioned measures included the announcement of additional incentives for early retirement of employees (mainly in the lignite subsidiary of Megalopolis), and also the launch of negotiations to reduce Meliti's purchasing cost of lignite from the Achlada mine, aiming to reduce their operating costs. Furthermore, the date of submission of the binding offers, following postponements extensions, was set on July 15th, 2019 to give investors an opportunity to evaluate in detail the effects of the measures taken on the financial position of the two (2) lignite power generation subsidiaries. On July 18th, 2019, the repeated bidding procedure for the sale of the lignite subsidiaries was declared barren by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, as no binding offer was submitted by any eligible participant.
Subsequently, the Group's and the Parent Company's Management concluded that after July 18th, 2019, the criteria of IFRS 5 for the classification of lignite subsidiaries as Assets Held for Sale were not met.
According to the provisions of IFRS 5 (par. 15), before the classification of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries as Assets Held for Sale on June 30th, 2018, a valuation of the two (2) Subsidiaries was carried out so as to be stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value after deducting the costs of their sale. The same practice was followed both on December 31st, 2018 and on June 30th, 2019.

The above valuations of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries, resulted in the following impairments: ·On June 30th, 2018 the impairment amounted to 240,600 thousands of Euro for the Group and the Parent
Company, while on December 31st, 2018 an additional reduction in the fair value less cost to sell was charged totaling to  242,691 thousands and  235,803 thousands for the Group and the Parent Company respectively. The above amounts affected the Results on the respective reporting dates. ·On June 30th, 2019 an additional reduction in the fair value less cost to sell occured of  64,940 thousands for the Group and  102,300 thousands for the Parent Company that affected the Results on the reporting date June 30th, 2019.
Furthermore, pursuant to par. 25 of IFRS 5, depreciation on tangible and intangible assets of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries ceased to be accounted for as of July 1st, 2018. On the reporting date, June 30th, 2019, the total impaired value of tangible and intangible assets of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries amounted to 137,660 thousands of Euro for "Lignitiki Melitis S.A." and 77,335 thousands of Euro for "Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A."
Due to the fact that, as stated above, on July 18th, 2019, the criteria of IFRS 5 for the classification of the two lignite subsidiaries as Assets Held for Sale ceased to be met, their results are now reflected in the Group's Continuing Operations. The comparative figures of the Group in the statement of income for the year ended December 31st, 2018 have been restated, while the comparative figure of the Parent Company still show the results from discontinued operations due to the spin-off of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries.
In addition, in the Group's statement of financial position, the total assets of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries that no longer meet the classification criteria set by IFRS 5 are measured based on IFRS 5 (par. 28) at the lower of: A)their carrying amount before the assets were classified as held for sale, including the depreciation that was not
accounted for as those assets were considered as discontinued operations and B)The recoverable amount of the next day from which the classification criteria as discontinued operations no
longer meet, therefore on July 19th, 2019.
From this comparison, the total assets and liabilities of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries will continue to be recognized at their recoverable amount, as the carrying value including depreciation of those impaired fixed assets, is greater than their recoverable amount. In addition, the comparative figures of the statement of financial position of the Group and the Parent Company as of December 31st, 2018 were restated to include the assets and liabilities of two (2) lignite subsidiaries, as they had never been classified as held for sale. n addition, on December 31st, 2019, following an impairment test, the Parent Company fully impaired its value of the shareholding in the two Lignite Subsidiaries "Lignitiki Melitis S.A." and "Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A.", recording Iimpairment losses of Euro 124.5 mil. and Euro 126.8 mil. respectively in the separate financial statements. Below we present a comparative table of total assets and liabilities of the Group as of December 31st, 2018 as amended in order to include the total assets and liabilities of the two (2) lignite subsidiaries:

10.EMISSION ALLOWANCES (CO ) 2
According to the current European and National legislation, during the 3rd implementation phase of the EU-ETS (period 2013-2020), PPC is not entitled to free allocation of emission allowances for its bound stations, with the exception of allowances allocated for emissions corresponding to the generation of thermal power for district heating. In accordance with its verified CO emissions for 2018, the total emission allowances that PPC delivered for
2
the period from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018 amounted to 29.52 Mt., including the installations of subsidiaries. During 2018, PPC has been allocated with about 53.04 thousands emission allowances corresponding to the generation of thermal power for district heating. Based on provisional ex-post data for the fourth quarter of 2019, the total CO emissions of the Parent Company's
2
bound plants as well as of the two subsidiaries "LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A." and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A." for the period 01.01.2019 ­ 31.12.2019 amount to 23.09 Mt. It should be noted that the emissions of 2019 will be considered final by the end of March 2020, when the verification of the annual emissions reports (for the year 2019) by accredited third party verifiers will be completed. Consequently, the total CO emissions rights that PPC will have to deliver for the period 01.01.2019
2
­ 31.12.2019 is estimated at 23.09 Mt.

According to the current Income Tax Code (L.4172/2013), as amended by the L. 4646/2019, the income tax rate for the legal entities residing in Greece for the income of the fiscal year 2019 is set at 24%. The prepayment of income tax remains at 100%. Tax returns for companies residing in Greece are filed annually but profits or losses declared remain provisional, until the tax authorities audit the Company's returns and records and a final tax audit report is issued. The Group establishes a provision, if deemed necessary, on a case by case basis and per company, against any possible additional taxes being imposed by the tax authorities.
Based on the applicable Income Tax Code, from the fiscal year 2011 and onwards, the Statutory Auditors issue an "Annual Tax Compliance Report" after conducting a tax audit at the same time with the financial audit. The tax audit is conducted on particular tax areas, specified by an audit program, according to the provisions of the tax law. Audit matters which are not covered by the above mentioned decision are dealt with in accordance to the ISAE 3000 "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information". From January 1st, 2016 onwards, pursuant to L. 4410/2016, the issuance of the tax certificate became optional, however, the Parent Company continues to apply the procedure for its issuance by the Statutory Auditors.
The tax audit of the Parent Company for the issuance of the tax certificate for the fiscal year 2018 was completed by the Statutory Auditors and the company received a certificate with "unqualified conclusions".
Tax unaudited years for the Parent Company and the subsidiaries of the Group are presented in the following table:

Revaluation of Fixed Assets The Group proceeded with the revaluation of its operating fixed assets as of December 31st, 2019. The revaluation, which excluded lakes, land for the extraction of lignite and construction in progress, was carried out by an independent firm of appraisers, according to IAS 16. Fixed assets of the Group's subsidiaries abroad were not revalued. The results of the revaluation were recorded in the Company's books on December 31st, 2019. The previous revaluation took place on December 31st, 2014. The method and the significant assumptions used by the independent firm of appraisers were as follows:
(a)To calculate the fair value of the fixed assets, the appraisers took into account the Group's Operational Plan, which provides for, among others, the gradual shutting-down of lignite units and lignite mines until 2028.
(b) The total of the appraised property was considered to be wholly owned by the Group (except those that are jointly-owned with IPTO S.A.), while, properties for which the Group notified the independent firm of appraisers that are burdened by commitments or during the appraisals it was found that are burdened by commitments, were not taken into account for the appraisal.
(c) The appraisers assumed that the Group for all its property, has the title deeds, building permits and other similar approvals, or has arranged to settle any outstanding issues, as required by Greek Legislation.
(d) The majority of the properties that were appraised, were considered being used by the Group, both in the Sectors of Mines, Generation and Distribution (HEDNO SA), as well as to house its Administrative Divisions and are expected to be used as such during their remaining useful life.
(e) The Market Approach (market-based evidence) was applied to determine the Fair Value (Note 41) of land, buildings, fixtures & furniture and transportation assets. The appraiser, in order to calculate the fair value of the property, carried out a market research and relied on these market research data as well as on data collected by professionals who are active in each examined region of the relevant properties and lands, adjusting the market data according to the conditions of each region and the physical characteristics of the Group's properties and lands (size, condition and exact location).
In the case of lands and buildings where sufficient comparative data have not been found, the Utilization Approach / Residual Method was applied. Future Land restoration costs for properties were power plants and mines are in operation were not calculated.

The fair value (Note 41) for special purpose buildings, machinery and technical works (special purpsose fixed assets), was determined on the basis of the Cost Approach and in particular by the method of depreciated replacement cost, in the context of which the needed adjustments were made to reflect their physical, functional, technological and economic obsolescence. For all electromechanical equipment, the appraiser took into account their acquisition date, their degree of utilization, maintenance and marketability. In the total of the electromechanical equipment of the lignite units and mines, apart from the physical obsolescence, the functional obsolescence was also added taking into account the immediate plan of units' and mines' withdrawal, the technology (fuel) they use, the ratio of the power production of the units to their installed capacity and the corresponding decommissioning date of the Mines and the units.
(f) The economic obsolescence was determined by the appraiser applying the income approach and in particular the discounted cash flows method after testing the Group's profitability (Profitability testing). The discount rate used at Group level was calculated on the basis of WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) and amounted to 6.5%. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the positive or negative change in the discount rate by 0.25% and on the positive or negative change in the cash flow growth rate by 0.25% and not additional burden on the Group's profit and loss was identified.
The revalued amounts, from appraisers' work, compared to Net Book Value of the fixed assets, resulted to net surplus for the Group amounting to approximately  1,261 mil., (Parent Company:  1,249 mil.), which was credited directly in the Revaluation Surplus in Comprehensive Income ( 958.4 mil. and  949.9 mil. net of Deferred Taxes for the Group and the Parent Company, respectively). Also, an amount of  672.4 mil. for the Group (Parent Company:  546.6 mil.) which was not offset by previous years' Revaluation Surplus was charged in the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31st, 2019 ( 511 mil. and  415 mil. net of deferred tax for the Group and the Parent Company respectively).
Revaluation surplus reserve The following table presents the total fixed assets revaluation effect in the income and comprehensive income statements, as well as the revaluation surplus reserve's movement.

Impairment of mines' land and construction in progress Under the new business plan of the Group and the immediate withdrawal plan for lignite units and mines, the Group and the Parent Company proceeded on December 31st, 2019 to an impairment test of mines' land (valuation by the cost method) for individual assets. More specifically, assets that are not expected to be used in the production process as their recoverable value is very low, were fully impaired. For assets that are expected to be used in the production process until the end of the mines production activity, Management proceeded to the assessment of their recoverable value, estimating Unit future production capacity. On December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent Company recognized impairment for all Mines (mines' lands and construction in progress) amounting to  516 mil. and  489 mil. respectively.
Impairment of decommissioning provision On December 31st, 2019, due to immediate lignite-phase out, the Group and the Parent Company proceeded in recognizing an asset amounting to the additional provision for the mines' land restoration, while at the same time this asset was impaired by  66.67 mil., since its carrying amount exceeded its recoverable value.

Impairment of investment in the new Steam Electric Unit 660 MW in Ptolemaida The construction of the new Steam Electric unit 660 MW in Ptolemaida is in progress. PPC S.A. has already paid the two advance payments of  197.88 mil. each against relevant Letters of Guarantee of Advance Payment amounting to  226.77 mil. each. On 05.04.2017, following the relevant decision of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Supplement No 1 of the Convention 11 09 5052 of Thermal Projects Engineering ­ Construction Department was issued. With this Supplement, the Conventional Table of Materials and Prices was replaced with a new Table of Materials and Prices which includes a further analysis of the prices in accordance with a relevant conventional term. Additionally, for the needs of testing the equipment of the Project (commissioning), PPC S.A. and the Contractor signed on 04.07.2019 the Supplement No 2 of the Convention, according to which the Contractor undertakes the construction and the commissioning of a Temporary Interconnection of the 150 kV transmission line with the Backup Unit Auxiliary Transformer. On December 31st, 2019, the total expenditure for the Project amounts to  1.355 mil. On December 31st, 2019, the Parent Company, in accordance with IAS 36, proceeded to an impairment test of the total cost of the project, since the withdrawal plan of lignite units is an indication of impairment. The recoverable amount of the above investment was determined on the basis of the Value in Use method. The Value in Use method based on future cash flows of the investment discounted using a discount rate (Weighted Average Cost of Capital - "WACC") 5.9%. The main assumptions made concern the future costs for the operation of the Unit (fuel costs, CO emission rights costs etc), the expected future revenues as well as the additional
2
capex required for the change of fuel mix after 2028.
As at December 31st, 2019, following the impairment test carried out, an impairment loss of  589 mil. was incurred which burdened equally the Group's and the Parent Company's income statement.
Impairment of construction in progress of other Lignite Units Taking into account the early withdrawal of all units of SES Agios Dimitrios until the end of 2023, the Parent Company impaired part of the costs of construction in progress in order for Units I, II, III and V to adapt the environmental requirements of Directive 2010/75/EU and to comply with the objectives of Transitional National Emissions Reduction Plan (TNERP), given that the estimated useful life of the above important environmental upgrades of the Units will not exceed 3 years maximum. It is noted that the implementation of these projects was decided in previous periods and with different assumptions for the estimated useful life of these Units. The impairment loss amounted to  34,048 thousand and burdened equally the Group's and the Parent Company's income statement. In addition, from the specific environmental obligation, the Parent Company established a loss provision from expenses that cannot be avoided amounting to  45.7 mil. (Note 32) based on IAS 37 (onerous contracts) burdening equally the Group's and the Parent Company's income statement.
Capitalization of Borrowing cost: On December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent company capitalized borrowing cost for construction in progress totaling  22.2 mil. (2018:  12.9 mil.).
Encumbrances on tangible assets: Tangible assets are held free from encumbrances and any claims against the Group's tangible assets are deemed as not substantial.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PPC and its subsidiaries (full consolidation).
In January 2019, the Parent Company's Board of Directors decided to increase the share capital of its 100% subsidiaries under the name "Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A." and "Lignitiki Melitis S.A." by  11.6 mil. and  7.3 mil. respectively with the issuance of 2.9 mil. and 1.8 mil. respectively of common shares with a nominal value of four (4) Euros per share and an issue price of four (4) Euros per share for both subsidiaries. The Parent Company paid the above amounts on April 18th, 2019.
In addition, on June 30th, 2019, an impairment in the value of the investment of two above mentioned subsidiaries was recorded amounting to  102.3 mil. Since their tender procedure was declared barren, their operational profitability (EBITDA) dated 31.12.2019 is negative and the Parent Company is not expecting to receive any dividend in the future, and also taking into account the fact that the Parent Company decided in April 2020 to capitalize its receivables from these subsidiaries of  104.4 mil., on December 31st, 2019, the Parent Company fully impaired the value of the shareholding in the Lignite Subsidiaries.

For the collection of electricity bills, PPC cooperates with the Hellenic Post (ELTA S.A.), which possesses the license required by law. The balance of the amounts collected from electricity bills that ELTA S.A. had not timely paid to PPC until December 31st, 2018 amounted to  15,686. The above amount includes all charges included in the electricity bills issued by PPC. At the beginning of 2019, PPC received part of the above amount and the remaining amount was offset with Parent Company's debts relating to the provision by ELTA S.A. of Postal Services for the collection, sorting, transport and distribution of PPC's postal items throughout the Hellenic Territory. As of December 31st, 2019, there is no claim of PPC for the above reason.

High voltage customer balances relate to (a) receivables from sales of energy to 58 companies with 92 installations (power supplies), including large industrial companies, which are invoiced at the end of each calendar month, based on individual agreements and actual metering and (b) receivables from exports to customers abroad.
Medium voltage customers are mainly industrial and commercial companies. Billing is made on a monthly basis and it is based on actual meter readings. Low voltage customers are mainly residential and small commercial companies. The majority of low voltage customers are billed every four months based on actual meter readings, while interim bills are issued every two months based mainly on the energy consumed during the corresponding prior period.

part ' / Financial Report

There are different types of tariffs for both medium and low voltage customers based on different types of energy use (commercial, residential, etc). The provision for expected credit losses for the high voltage customers is established by making a personalized assessment of the expected credit loss per customer. For the determination of expected credit losses regarding the receivables from Medium and Low voltage customers, the Group and the Parent Company use credit loss provision table based on the ageing of the balances, based on the historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses, adjusted for future factors with respect to debtors and the economic environment.
The movement of the provision for expected credit losses is as follows:

Revenues from the supply of power to High, Medium and Low voltage customers during the interval from the last measurement or billing until the reporting date are accounted for as energy consumed but not yet billed (unbilled revenue). At each reporting date and taking into account that the billing which is based on measurement data of the last month of the period, is carried out in the first days of the next month with respect to High and Medium Voltage customers, the total value of energy of that month is recognized as accrued income for the period, which is reversed in the following month, after billing has already been accounted for. Additionally, at each reporting date, the Parent Company estimates the unbilled revenue from Low Voltage customers, having developed a specific estimation method. The resulting amounts are accounted for as accrued income for the periods ending until the reporting date and reversed in the next month. All accrued income from the energy consumed but not yet billed is impaired at each reporting date with provision for expected credit losses. This provision is calculated on the basis of the possibility of default for non-past due trade receivables, arising from the expected credit loss provision table. The movement of the provision for expected credit losses on the value of the unbilled revenue is as follows:

VAT return Within 2019, requests for VAT returns were submitted to the tax authorities due to credit balances in VAT for tax periods 01.10.2018 to 31.03.2019, 01.04.2019 to 30.04.2019, 01.05.2019 to 30.06.2019, 01.07.2019 to 31.07.2019, 01.08.2019 to 31.08.2019, 01.09.2019 to 30.09.2019, 01.10.2019 to 31.10.2019 and 01.11.2019 to 30.11.2019. The above credit balances arise mainly from outflows subject to a VAT tax rate lower than the

input VAT tax rate. The requested VAT returns of  235 mil. was received by the Athens Tax Office for Commercial Companies after conducting corresponding partial tax audits. With the submission of the periodic VAT declaration of January 2020, the Company requested for VAT return of  20 mil. which was collected within March 2020. Along with the submission of the periodic VAT declaration of February 2020 a new request for VAT return of  10 mil. was submitted.
Reduction of VAT rate The Appendix III of the VAT Code was replaced by the paragraph 1 of article 121 of L.4611/2019 and electricity is subject to the reduced VAT rate of 6%. The effective date of the provision was set on May 20th, 2019.
Assessed taxes and penalties: The amount represents additional income taxes and penalties assessed to the Parent Company.
An amount of  31,644 corresponds to a paid special consumption tax with recourse In the framework of an audit conducted by Audit Department of the Customs House for the period May 2010 to September 2012, an Imputation Act (Nr. 80/14/07.07.2015) of the Head of the 4th Customs Supervision Assembly of Piraeus was issued, which charged the Company with special consumption tax amounting Euro 9,790 which corresponds to self-consumption quantities for the audited period to Electricity Transmission System due to non-compliance with the terms and formalities mentioned in the Ministerial Decision (.50257772010/17.6.2010) on the matter. The Company paid the charged amounts and, at the same time, appealed against the aforementioned act before the Piraeus Administrative Court of Appeals, but since then compliant with the instructions of Ministry of Finance, PPC includes the self-consumption quantities of electricity in the Special Consumption Tax Statements which submits and pays with recourse the relevant tax on the monthly basis, while simultaneously files a corresponding lawsuit. A total amount of  31,644 corresponds to a paid special consumption tax with recourse to date.
An amount of  10,555 corresponds to amounts paid, which were imposed by the regular audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies for the years 2009-2011 Following a regular tax audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies, various accounting differences were added to the Company's taxable profits for the fiscal year 2012 (reporting period 01.01.2011 - 31.12.2011) and an income tax plus an inaccuracy tax totaling  462 was charged. A Fine of Withholding Tax of  9,855 was imposed on the ground that PPC in the same fiscal year 2012 issued false salary statements to its staff, since it did not include the employees' benefits from the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs. Finally, two fines of  900.00 were imposed due to late issue of purchase invoices and  500.00 due to providing incomplete data to audit. The surcharges amounted to  237. On January 24th, 2018, against the aforementioned corrective acts an appeal was filed before the Dispute Resolution Division of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue. The latter did not issue a decision on the case and the Company filed an appeal before the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal on June 25th, 2018. For the amount of  10,555 an equal provision was established in the Financial Statements of 2018. This appeal was heard on January 9th, 2019 and on June 20th, 2019 the Three-Member Athens Administrative Court of Appeal (5th Section) issued the decision No. 2566/2019 which accepted the Company's appeal. For the amount of  10,555 an equal provision was established in the Financial Statements 2018. According to decision No. 2566/2019 the rejection of the Dispute Resolution Division No. 1606/26.01.2018 was cancelled, which was filed against the Final Acts of Fines Imposed on our Company from the tax audit for the period 2009-2011.

According to the aforementioned decision of the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal, PPC's appeal was accepted, since it was judged that the right of the Greek State to audit the disputed year was time-barred, while at the same time the Company had a tax certificate with "unqualified conclusion" by independent Certified Auditors. Following the above and in compliance with the aforementioned decision of August 9th, 2019 a request was submitted to the Centre for Auditing Big Companies and we received a refund, through offsetting with withholding taxes of  10,318, the imposed amounts which the Company had paid to the Greek State.
Social Security Funds in Dispute The amount relates to social security contributions and deductions (during years 1983-1993) for employees who have worked with other employers before joining PPC. As PPC undertook the obligation to cover the whole amount of their pensions and other related benefits, part of their contributions to other social security funds mainly IKA (SII, i.e. Social Insurance Institute which was the major Greek social security fund) has been claimed by PPC. Since the claim was not accepted by IKA, PPC resorted to the courts. Following an adverse court decision, PPC together with PPC ­ PIO (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appealed against the said decision. The court rejected PPC's appeal, whereas PPC ­ PIO's (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appeal against IKA is still pending. For the abovementioned amount, an equal provision has been established at the attached financial statements.
Advances to Pensioners in Dispute The amount of  5,262 represents an advance payment made in 1993 to pensioners. An equal provision has been established of this amount.
State Participation in Employees' Social Security Contributions: The amount represents the State's contribution to the social security contributions of employees who started working after January 1st, 1993. For the above mentioned amount, an equal provision has been established.
The movement in the allowance for other receivables is as follows:

31. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
a) SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AT REDUCED TARIFFS
The Group's employees and pensioners are entitled to the supply of electricity (which the Parent Company provides) at reduced tariffs. Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. The relevant retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions. Net costs for the period are included in the payroll cost in the accompanying income statement consisting of the present value of the benefits earned in the year, interest cost on the benefit obligation, as well as past service cost. The actuarial gains or losses are now recorded in comprehensive income statement. Retirement benefit obligations are not funded.
For the purpose of assessing the impact of this change on the Group's liabilities, in the individual data used to calculate the actuarial liability, included the estimate of the reduction in the cost of electricity supply at reduced tariffs from the application of Article 11 of L. 4643/19 in the individual electricity consumptions in 2019.
According to Article 11 of L. 4643/2019, from January 1st, 2020 the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs to pensioners of the Group changes. In particular, "A special electricity tariff can be applied to employees and pensioners of PPC S.A., PPC's subsidiaries and IPTO S.A., exclusively for the pricing of electricity consumption where supply charges are applied. In any case, the discount on the charge for electricity consumption resulting from the application of the above special electricity tariff shall not exceed thirty percent (30%)."
The Parent Company's Board of Directors, at its meeting on January 21st, 2020, set the discount at thirty percent (30%).
Taking into account the specific data, it was estimated, on December 31st, 2019, that the reduction in the actuarial liability due to the change in the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs amounted to Euro 237,282 for the Group (Parent Company:  144,113). The specific change was characterized as Negative Past Service Cost, which according to IAS 19, was recognized in the Results of the fiscal year 2019.
The results of the actuarial study regarding the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2019 and December 31st, 2018 are as follows:

b) PROVISION FOR SEVERANCE PAY
According to the provision of Article 25 of L. 4491 / 66 "Regarding the Insurance of PPC's Staff" an one-off allowance is paid to the beneficiaries of pension (who are insured employees leaving PPC) in proportion to the years of actual service to PPC. This one-off allowance, according to the special provision of par. 3 of the same article, is offset against any compensation paid due to termination of the employment contract, or because the insured employees reached the age limit or due to another reason for leaving, according to the provisions of the law.
The provisions of PPC's Staff Regulations (SR/ PPC) which was ratified by Article 2 of legislative decree 210/1974 and has the force of law, and specifically in Articles 34, 35, 36 and 37, it is defined that the Company's permanent staff, who for whatever reason its contract is terminated (automatically or through termination of an employment contract), no compensation is payable if entitled to an one-off allowance from the relevant insurance organization. If the one-off allowance is less than the compensation, then only the difference between the compensation and the one-off allowance is paid.
In any case, and when an employer is, in accordance with Article 2 § 1 of L. 173/1967, "public or government owned entities or Businesses and Utilities (PPC, OTE etc.)" the owed compensation due to dismissal of L. 2112/1920 that would be paid, if not the above, in any way of employees leaving from the company and because of this, shall be subject to the limitations imposed by the abovementioned provisions in respect of its upper limit, which according to article 33 of L. 1876/1990, as amended by the provisions of article 21 § 13 of L. 3144/2003, is currently set at Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro).
With L. 4533/2018 (OG A ' 7527/4/2018), the provision of Article 25 (par.3) of L. 4491/1966 (OG A ' 1) as well as any other general or specific provision of the law or the Labor Regulation which provides for the offsetting of employees' severance payment with the one-off allowance to which employees are entitled by the relevant insurance organization, were abolished.
Based on the above, PPC S.A. and its subsidiaries, starting from the fiscal year 2018, will hereafter pay a severance payment, which should not exceed  15 (fifteen thousand Euros) to the insured employees who leave due to termination of the employment contract, or because they reached the age limit, or due to other reason that the law provides.
The above is a defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19. The present value of the liability assumed by PPC S.A. and its subsidiaries, calculated using actuarial methods, is a past service cost for service provided in previous periods.
The actuarial study results for the calculation of the severance liability for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2019 and December 31st, 2018 are as follows:

40. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION
OWNERSHIP AND INSURANCE OF PROPERTY
Major matters relating to the ownership of the Group's assets, are as follows: 1.The Parent Company has completed the registration of its property. These assets (almost entirely) are
registered at the relevant land registries over the country and the cadastral application is monitored. The update of Parent Company's existing integrated information system for fixed assets management is in progress. 2.In a number of cases, expropriated land, as presented in the expropriation statements, differs (in quantitative terms), with what the Parent Company considers as its property. 3.Agricultural land acquired by the Parent Company through expropriation in order to be used for the construction of hydroelectric power plants, must be transferred to the State at no charge, following a decision of the Parent Company's Board of Directors and a related approval by the Ministry of Development, if such land is no longer needed by the Parent Company for the fulfilment of its purposes according to article 9, of L. 2941/01. 4.According to article 15 of L. 4273/14 (O.G./A/146), the compulsory expropriation of real estate in areas where exclusive research and exploitation rights have been granted to PPC S.A., is declared in favor of the Greek State with expenses of the applicant who declared the expropriation. Following the completion of expropriation, the aforementioned areas are transferred to the Greek State's ownership and PPC (which pays the compensations) uses them for the mining of the lignite deposit.
The property, plant and equipment of the Group are located all over Greece. The Group does not carry any form of insurance coverage on its fixed assets in operation (except for its information technology equipment), resulting to the fact that if a sizable damage is incurred to its property, it might affect its profitability. Materials, spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured.
LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
The Group is a defendant in several legal proceedings arising from its operations. The total amount claimed as at December 31st, 2019, amounts to  826 mil. as further detailed below:
1.Claims with contractors, suppliers and other claims: A number of contractors and suppliers have raised claims against the Group. These claims are either pending before courts or under arbitration and mediation proceedings. The total amount involved is  397 mil. In most cases the Group has raised counter claims, which are not reflected in the accounting records, until the time of collection.
2.Fire incidents and floods: A number of individuals have raised claims against the Group for damages incurred as a result of alleged electricity-generated fires and floods. The total amount involved is  56 mil.
3.Claims by employees: Groups' Employees are claiming the amount of  65 mil., for allowances and other benefits that according to the employees should have been paid by PPC.
4.PPC's lawsuit against ETAA (former TSMEDE) ETAA (former TSMEDE) by its Decision 7/2012 has imposed on PPC the amount of  27.4 mil. applying
article 4 of L. 3518/2006, relating to employer contributions due to the Main pension Branch for the period 01.01.2007 ­ 30.04.2012 and pertaining to the engineers insured before 01.01.1993 to the above mentioned Insurance Fund, that have been employed by PPC for the above mentioned period. Against the above mentioned 7/2012 decision of the Insurance Fund in question, PPC has filed legally and timely the 05.09.2012 appeal to the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance. The discussion of the appeal took place on 03.11.2014. The preliminary ruling 11872/2016 was issued, which obliges TSMEDE to produce to the Court the documents referred to the judgment and then the case will be discussed again in order to issue
part ' / Financial Report

232

a final decision. Already the case was determined to be discussed at the hearing on April 9th, 2019 and was postponed for October 8th, 2019 and it was postponed again for January 14th, 2020 in which it was postponed for May 26th, 2020. Since its employees ­ who are engineers- are insured mandatorily to PPC's Insurance Fund based on L. 4491/1966, thus resulting to PPC paying on their behalf to the above mentioned Insurance Fund the corresponding employer contributions while insurance for the above mentioned engineers in ETAA is optional and is done by choice, with them paying the corresponding insurance contributions provided for engineers that are independently employed, the Parent Company considers that the possibilities of a negative outcome of its appeal are minimal and therefore has not established a provision.
5. Lawsuits and extrajudicial documents of IPTO against PPC S.A. In February 2015, IPTO filed against PPC, two lawsuits for a total amount of  540 mil. for amounts due from the Parent Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market. In particular: ·By its first lawsuit IPTO is asking for an amount of  242.7 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which the
Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO, that in turn conveys them to EMO. Interest for the above mentioned overdue sums amounts to  22 mil. ·By its second lawsuit, IPTO is asking for the payment of  232.6 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which the Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO. Interest for the above mentioned overdue sums amounts to  40 mil. The hearing of these lawsuits took place on 28.2.2019 before the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens and a decision is pending.
On its side, PPC has served an extrajudicial document to IPTO, requesting the payment of a total amount of  14 mil. The above mentioned amount corresponds to overdue interest of invoices which incorporate debts to PPC from March 2012 until the 02.02.2015. IPTO, up to this date, has not answered to this extrajudicial document.
In December 2016, IPTO filed against PPC a new lawsuit by which IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of  406.4 mil. (with interest) for overdue receivables arising from the Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market and relate to specific non-competitive charges of IPTOs' invoices. Moreover, IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of  59 mil. corresponding to interest litigation plus the relevant stamp duty. In this lawsuit, the Company submitted proposals within the given time limit and a decision is pending. All of the above lawsuits' principal amounts have been paid and in any case are being recorded in the Company's liabilities, so there is no reason to establish a provision.
On November 29th, 2018, IPTO S.A. served an extrajudicial document to PPC S.A. with which IPTO S.A. asks the Parent Company: -to pay-off debts of  495.3 mil. from PPC's participation in the wholesale electricity market for the period
January 2018 to August 2018, which have become overdue, plus overdue interest amounting to  8.8 mil. -to pay overdue interest amounting to  83.4 mil, arising from the overdue payment of the Parent Company's
debts from its participation in the wholesale electricity market for the period August 2016 to September 2018.
Of the above amounts, only  82 mil. concerns IPTO S.A. while for the remaining amounts, DAPEEP S.A. (former EMO S.A.) has become a sole successor.
6. Alleged claims of former EMO (LAGIE), against PPC S.A. due to deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule (DAS) Due to the deficits created by the suppliers ENERGA POWER TRADING S.A. and HELLAS POWER S.A. during 2011

and 2012, PPC was obliged under RAE's Decision 285/2013 [whose legality was confirmed by the State Council's decision 1761/2016], as well as by the Power Exchange Code for Electricity, to pay a total amount of  126.3 mil. (after a final clearing according to Article 61 of the Power Exchange Code for Electricity) within 2017 (PPC's BoD Decision No.146/21.12.2016) that approved the payment of the debt with an advance payment and partially in twelve (12) equal monthly interest-free installments starting from January 1st, 2017.
A. A lthough EMO explicitly accepted the proposed debt settlement, in December 2016, it filed a lawsuit against PPC asking approximately the residual amount of  78 mil., plus interest. In February 2017, PPC filed a counter lawsuit claiming EMO to be ordered to pay the amount of  126 mil. plus an amount of 100 thousands of Euro for PPC's moral damage. On these lawsuits, the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens issued the decision 4810/2018 which accepted EMO's lawsuit and rejected PPC's counterclaim. An appeal is examined by PPC.
B. In December 2017, EMO sent to PPC two new Information Notes on the allocation of the monthly deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule (DAS), totaling 833 thousands of Euro. With the attached letters, EMO claimed that its new claims arose from the second settlement of the Deficit in 2011 and 2012, due to the disappearance or insolvency of the previous third electricity suppliers of that time. In this context, in March 2018, PPC filed before the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens its lawsuit against EMO, requesting a declaration that it does not owe the above-mentioned amount and EMO to be condemned to pay an amount of 50 thousands of Euro as a compensation due to PPC's moral damage. In May 2018 EMO filed its counterclaim. The two opposite lawsuits were judged and a decision is pending.
For the above amounts, on December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent Company have established provisions amounting to  320 mil. and  278 mil., respectively (2018: Group:  301 mil. and Parent Company:  263 mil.), which are considered adequate for the expected losses arising from the final judgment.
Lawsuit of former EMO against HEDNO in which a notice was served to PPC On June 19th, 2017, HEDNO S.A. served a notice to PPC on EMO's lawsuit against HEDNO S.A. With this notice HEDNO S.A. asks PPC S.A. to intervene in favor of HEDNO S.A. in the trial in which EMO claims from HEDNO S.A. overdue amounts from invoices issued. In particular, EMO S.A. with its lawsuit claims amounts with interest from partially paid and unpaid invoices which incorporate receivables from the RES Special Account in the NonInterconnected Islands (mainly debts from ETMEAR, PVs on rooftops, RES Generation in the Non-Interconnected Islands and balancing of the Special Account in the Non-Interconnected Islands). The claim from EMO's part amounts to approximately  140 mil. while interest due for late payment amounts to  3.9 mil. The Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens, with its decision 1302/2019, rejected in favor of PPC HEDNO's notice to PPC as unlawful considering that there is no relationship of procedural guarantee between HEDNO and PPC, and that, on the contrary, the only relationship that connects them is conventional. In particular, the Court considered that according to the NII Code there is no obligation of PPC to pay-off HEDNO's lenders other than PPC's contractual obligations towards HEDNO regarding the timely payment of invoices under the NII Load Representatives contract.
The decision has not yet been served on PPC. HEDNO is likely to file an appeal.
Corrective settlements of IPTO, concerning the Special Account of art. 143, of L. 4001/2011 According to L.4152/2013, RES energy purchases in the Interconnected System are paid through the market operation, on the higher amount of either their revenue from DAS plus deviations or the value of energy they inject to the system multiplied by the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants.

part ' / Financial Report

234

This amendment started being applied from August 14th, 2013, when RAE's Decision 366/2013 was published in the O.G., amending the relevant articles of the Power Exchange Code and specifying the methodology of calculations, with which the provision of the law was implemented. In October 2013, IPTO sent to PPC S.A. corrective clearing statements for May, June, July and part of August of 2013, totaling to an amount of  48.2 mil., which was derived from the retrospective application of the relevant methodology. PPC's lawsuit against IPTO for the invoices in question was accepted by the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens (Decision 2260/2016) and is considered that PPC does not have to pay the invoices issued totaling  54.4 mil., which incorporate claims for the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants for months May to August 2013. IPTO has filed an appeal which is heard on 19.03.2020 following a postponement from 04.04.2019 requested by DAPEEP.
However, other decisions have been issued (Athens Court of Appeal 5413/2017 and Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens 702/2016 as well as professors Ant.Metaxa and Kyr.Papanikolaou opinions) in corresponding cases that justify our point of view and are against IPTO. According to a new regulatory framework, the relevant claims now concern DAPEEP.
Old Bank of Crete The dispute with the old "Bank of Crete" is dating back to 1989, when the bank was under liquidation. More precisely, by a mandatory action of the then trustee of the Bank, PPC's deposits were mandatorily converted to stake-holding in the share capital of the Bank and to obligatory credit to the Bank. PPC by its July 22nd, 1991 lawsuit against the bank asked to be compensated for GRD 2.2 billion approximately, ( 6.5 mil.) for the reason that the above mentioned Act of the trustee of the Bank was held invalid. Moreover, PPC had outstanding loan balances, received under six (6) loan agreements for which it was agreed upon to be repaid gradually through installments. On June 10th, 1991, although PPC has paid the overdue installments, the Bank has terminated all of the above mentioned loan agreements and thus on that date the claim against PPC became overdue for the whole amount of the loans. For that reason, against PPC's above mentioned lawsuit, the Bank has proposed an offset of its claim resulting by the above mentioned loans, amounting to GRD 4 bil. approximately, and furthermore has asked the payment of this amount by PPC by its lawsuit dated 28.12.1995. The Court of First Instance postponed the hearing of the Bank's lawsuit against PPC until the final outcome of the hearing, which started with PPC's lawsuit against the Bank.
PPC's lawsuit against the Bank was rejected by the Court of First Instance and PPC appealed against the said Decision of the Court which was also rejected by the Court of Appeals. The above mentioned decision was brought to review by PPC before the Supreme Court, which accepted it and in consequence the case was again brought to trial before the Court of Appeals, which ordered that an accounting expert report should take place. After the said expert report the Court's decision was held partially in PPC's favor (Court of Appeals decision 2005). However, a petition for review before the Supreme Court was filed against the aforementioned Decision which was then accepted by the Supreme Court and then was resubmitted to the Court of Appeals which by its inconclusive decision (Nr. 4093/2009) ordered the completion of the accounting expert report. The official expert report was completed in May 2012. The hearing of the case would have taken place on October 25th, 2012, but it was postponed for September 26th, 2013, due to the strike of both judges and lawyers. The case was heard on the latter date.

Decision 3680/2014 of the Athens Court of Appeals was issued, which only partially accepts PPC's lawsuit while essentially accepting the results of the ordered by the Court above mentioned official expert report, as following: a) the amount due by the Bank of Crete to PPC at the time of the filing of the lawsuit by PPC on 22.07.1991 amounted to GRD 1,268,027,987 and b) The amount due by PPC to the Bank of Crete on 01.07.1991 due to the termination of the above loan agreements by the Bank and after the proposed by the Bank offsetting of its counterclaim against the above-mentioned PPC's claim, amounted to GRD 2,532,936,698. Therefore, the above decision of the Court of Appeals recognizes that on 22-7-1991 the amount due by PPC to the Bank of Crete was 2,532,936,698 - 1,268,027,987 = GRD 1,264,908,711. On June 19th, 2017, PPC appealed against the above mentioned decision (Decision 3680/2014 of the Court of Appeals in Athens), the hearing date of which had been scheduled on March 18th, 2019 before the Supreme Court. This hearing was postponed for March 9th, 2020. The case was heard on the latter date and a decision is pending. It is noted that until the final judgment on the appeal, the discussion of the aforementioned (December 28th, 1995) lawsuit of the Bank of Crete against PPC remains suspended. In case that the Supreme Court accepts PPC's appeal, then it will judge the case again and the decision which will issue will be irrevocable. PPC, with its appeal, requests to be recognized that the Bank's loans to PPC had not been credited to overdraft facilities and therefore the Bank's termination of the loan agreements on 10-6-1991 was invalid.
This means that the Bank's lawsuit against PPC will be rejected (because this lawsuit is based precisely on the fact that the Bank's claims from the loans had been credited to overdraft facilities which the Bank legally closed with a complaint on 10-6-1991, and consequently PPC owed to the Bank that year the amount of GRD 2,532,936,698 which is reduced due to the proposed by the Bank offsetting of its claim against PPC's counterclaim amounting to GRD 1,268,027,987, and so the difference is 2,532,936,698 - 1,268,027,987 = GRD 1,264,908,711).
However, this does not mean that PPC can request from the Bank the amount of GRD 1,268,027,987, because this PPC's claim was settled until 1996 with offsettings proposed by PPC against the Bank's counterclaims that the latter had against PPC from the above loans and which arose when each installment of these loans became overdue (see above no. 8). Therefore, if PPC's appeal is accepted, then neither the Bank has a claim against PPC nor the PPC against the Bank. However, if PPC's appeal is rejected, then the assumptions of the decision taken by the Court of Appeal will become irrevocable and therefore the court that has undertaken the second lawsuit, i.e. the Bank's lawsuit against PPC, is obliged to accept that on 22-7-1991 PPC owed to the Bank of Crete the amount of GRD 1,264,908,711 due to the closing of the overdraft facilities on 10-6-1991, and the court will condemn PPC to pay this amount to the Bank with overdue interest (with different interest-bearing dates per loan amount, from the year 1993 until 1995) and with quarterly compounding until the repayment (see above), since deducting from the amount due the payments that (according to information from PPC's Accounting Department) PPC made to the Bank in repayment of the loan installments, when they became overdue. Therefore, the amount due by PPC to the Bank of Crete cannot be calculated now in case the Bank's lawsuit against PPC is accepted. Accounting expert report may be needed here as well.
LARCO Tariffs With the submission of the amendment plan - addition to a Bill, which concerned LARCO's Issues Arrangements and in order not to be hindered, for reasons of public interest, the process of privatization of LARCO, as described in the above amendment plan, PPC's Board of Directors decided to continue the electricity supply to LARCO,

236

under the following conditions: a) the fully and timely payment of electricity bills upon the entry into force of the law and b) the signing of the Electricity Supply Contract, with the special administrator immediately after its appointment. Already, after the publication of the relevant article 21 of L.4664/14.02.2020 and the appointment of the special administrator in LARCO, actions for the signing of the Electricity Supply Contract with the special administrator of the Company are in progress. It is noted that as of 31.12.2019, a provision against LARCO has been established, amounting to  353.3 mil.
PPC's claims from HALYVOURGIKI S.A.
PPC filed an application for a payment order before the Court of First Instance in Athens against the company under the name "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", in which PPC claimed from HALYVOURGIKI to pay the total amount of  30,473,320.80 plus interest from the day following the expiry of the final bill issued after the termination of the Electricity Supply Contract between PPC S.A. and HALYVOURGIKI S.A. and until repayment, plus the amount of  15,237 for court costs.
The payment order No. 1769/2019 of the Single-Member Court of First Instance in Athens was issued which orders "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." to pay to PPC the above total amount. PPC notified the payment order in question to "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." and further, on 15.03.2019 proceeded to serve the writ of garnishment for conservative seizure in the banks under the above payment order against "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." Subsequently, on 22.03.2019, an application for suspension of "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." against PPC S.A. was served to PPC, following a request for a temporary injunction, the hearing of which took place on 26.03.2019. Following the discussion of the case, the application in question was rejected by the competent President of the Court of First Instance in Athens.
PPC, upon expiry of the deadline of the statements of a third party on behalf of the banks to whom proceeded to conservative seizure, at the request of "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", proceeded to the bank EUROBANK in a partial withdrawal of imposed conservative seizure up to the amount corresponding to the payroll cost of that company's employees. The company in question filed a caveat, which was discussed in early October 2019. The caveat in question is expected to be approved by a relevant court's decision.
Furthermore, on 15.02.2019, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." filed against PPC an appeal for arbitration before the ICC (INTERNATIONAL COURT OF ARBITRATION) "due to PPC's failure to comply with the obligations under the Shareholders Agreement of 2009" between PPC S.A. and "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", requesting PPC to be condemned to pay the amount of two hundred and seventy million (270,000,000) Euro for consequential damage, which according to the appeal in question, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." suffered with interest from the service of this appeal, plus one million (1,000,000) Euro for moral damage which according to "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." suffered (Case 24270/AYZ).
Both "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." and PPC S.A. appointed their arbitrators (each party appointed its arbitrator). Deadline for PPC's reply in order to define the group of its legal representatives as well as to collect the data needed to defend its positions, was set by the ICC on April 25th, 2019. On April 23rd, PPC submitted its Reply to the above Appeal of "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." and requested the rejection of the Appeal entirely and "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." to be obliged with the guarantee measure for the amount of  1,000,000 and to be condemned to pay the total court costs of the Arbitration. Subsequently, following the exemption requests against the appointment of the proposed arbitrators, the two appointed Arbitrators, in their joint letter to the Arbitration Court dated

14.05.2019, stated that they were unable to appoint a Third Arbitrator jointly and requested from the Arbitration Court to appoint the Third Arbitrator, pursuant to Article 12 par. 5 of the International Arbitration Rules ICC Rules 2017. Furthermore, (on 10.08.2019) the Parties submitted their comments on the appointment of Third Arbitrator in the trial in question.
Finally, the Arbitration Court sent to the Parties a proposal for the appointment of an Arbitrator, who has lawfully submitted to the Parties her Independence Declaration citing the cases in which she has been involved in relevant legal proceedings and the Court invited the Parties, until 10.09.2019, to submit any objections to the appointment of the said Arbitrator.
Neither PPC nor the defendant raised any objections. Therefore, the ICC court ratified the appointment of the said Third Arbitrator. Following this, on 16.10.2019, the first meeting of the Arbitration Court was held where the TERMS OF REFERENCE of the Arbitration were agreed. PPC suggested the Bifurcation of the case, (meaning that there is an interim decision of the Court regarding the Responsibility claimed by the Plaintiff-Claimant and if the Court's Decision is in favor of this claim, then this decision should be followed by an examination of possible damages and amounts). The Court, by its decision, accepted the Bifurcation while the time frame regarding the procedure of evidence was set until October 2020.
More specifically, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." submitted its Proposals-Memorandum (Statement of Claim on Liability) on 14.02.2020 while PPC has to submit its Memorandum (Statement of Defense on Liability) accordingly on 10.04.2020.
However, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." requested a short postponement due to COVID-19 and the Arbitration Court decided to postpone the deadline of Memorandum for 30.4.2020.
Other High Voltage Tariffs However, given the fact that the supply contracts with the High Voltage customers for the energy consumed in the period 2016-2017 expired on 31.12.17, PPC, in December 2017, sent letters to all High Voltage customers, with a proposal to extend the existing Supply Contract for the period 2016 - 2017, until 28.02.2018, in the framework of the Electricity Code and contractual relationships. Subsequently, PPC's Board of Directors, by its related decision, approved the extension of the High Voltage Tariffs until 28.2.2019 and on 26.6.18 PPC's EGM approved the extension of the discounts, which were approved by EGM's decision on 7.12.2015, until 28.2.2019. In this context, a new round of meetings with High Voltage customers was held to inform them on the above issues. Out of the total of 91 supplies that electrify installations of 58 High Voltage customers, electricity supply contracts relating to 72 supplies of 48 High Voltage customers were signed, while for one customer with one supply, namely HALYVOURGIKI S.A., a cessation of the representation has taken place on 17.12.2018 due to debts.
PPC's BoD, with its decision no. 34/19.3.2019 approved the submission of proposals to High Voltage customers (except MYTILINEOS S.A.-GROUP OF COMPANIES and LARCO S.A. whose pricing terms were approved by the competent bodies to be valid until 31.12.2020) for the adjustment of the existing tariffs by + 10%, in order for supply contracts to be signed for the period 1.03.2019 - 31.12.2020. Already, on 04.04.2019, an agreement to sign a High Voltage supply contract with the companies of VIOHALKO Group by the end of 2020 has been reached. Furthermore, in July 2019 PPC announced the agreement to sign a High Voltage supply contract with AGET HERACLES, member of the Lafarge Holcim Group, for its installations which are connected to High Voltage.

238

Key features are, among other things, the supply contract of 3 years duration until the end of 2020 and the increase in tariffs by 10%. Cooperation with AGET HERACLES also expands to the grant of sign for the guarantee of origin of electricity from renewable energy sources (GREENPASS), the use of which is part of the Group's strategy and commitment for sustainable development and responsible entrepreneurship. A supply contract for the period 2018 ­ 2020 was also signed with the High Voltage customer  CEMENT COMPANY S.A., who after the negotiation and the relevant agreement, withdrew the complaint - interim measures against PPC, which had filed before RAE.
CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Pricing terms of "MYTILINEOS S.A. GROUP OF COMPANIES" By the October 5th, 2016 Decision of the EGM of PPC's Shareholders the customer's ALOUMINION (now MYTILINEOS S.A. - GROUP OF COMPANIES) pricing terms for the period 1.7.2016 - 31.12.2020 as well as the pricing for the clearing of the period 1.1.2014 - 30.6.2016 were approved. Based on the Decision of the EGM, a Supply Agreement was signed on October 20th, 2016 between ALOUMINION and PPC. Under the signed agreement, MYTILINEOS S.A. - GROUP OF COMPANIES proceeded to a prepayment of  100 mil. for electricity bills for the first contractual period (July 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2017), as well as to a prepayment of the estimated amounts for the second contractual period (July 1st, 2017 to June 30th, 2018), the third contractual period (July 1st, 2018 to June 30th, 2019) and the fourth contractual period (July 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020).
PPC's relation to its personnel's Social Security Funds Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group does not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit between revenues and expenses to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
PPC's audit by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition Since February 2017, a European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition audit of the Parent Company is in progress in accordance with Article 20 of the Regulation 1/2003 of the European Union. The audit is carried out pursuant to a relevant Commission's decision dated February 1st, 2017 for alleged abuse of a dominant position on the wholesale market for the production of electricity from 2010 onwards. This audit is in progress.
ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS
Key uncertainties that may impact the final level of environmental investment which the Group will be required to undertake, over the forthcoming decade, include:
1.During 2017, the Joint Ministerial Decision regarding the Environmental Terms for HPP Messochora was issued under which PPC is obliged to undertake protection projects for the preservation of part of the Messochora Village (Sector D). Along with the procedure for the expropriation (a) of the remaining areas which will be flooded by the Reservoir and the Sectors A, B, and C of Messochora Village in favor of PPC, (b) the expropriation of the expansion area - relocation area of the village in favor of the Municipality of Pyli, and (c) the fulfillment of the remaining obligations introduced by the new Joint Ministerial Decision, the preparation of Tender Documents for the remaining projects, is planned, with a slight transfer of the estimated operation of the Project from 2022 to the first months of 2023. This transfer is due to unexpected delays in the expropriation procedures in favor of PPC and in favor of Municipality of Pyli.

On 31.12.2019 the aggregate expenditure amount for HPP Messochora amounted to  281 mil., while an estimated additional amount of Euro 84 mil. will be required in order to complete the project.
2.In December 2010, the new Directive (2010/75/ EU) was issued for industrial emissions (Industrial Emissions Directive ­ IED), revising Directives IPPC and 2001/80/ EC, which is effective from January 6th, 2011. Following the provisions of Article 32 of Directive 2010/75/EU, a Transitional National Emissions Reduction Plan (TNERP) for the period 2016-2020 was elaborated and officially submitted by Greece to the EU at the end of 2012. The TNERP was approved by the EU on November 26th, 2013. In December 2013, PPC submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Energy an application for limited changes to the TNERP, along with its declaration to use the limited life-time derogation (Article 33) for certain Power Plants. After the approval from the Ministry of Environment and Energy the revised TNERP was resubmitted on March 18th, 2014 by the Greek authorities and was approved by the EU on July 7th, 2014. The Joint Ministerial Decision for TNERP was issued in August 2015 (Nr. 34062/957/103/2015). Finally, according to the above, SES Agios Dimitrios, as well as the disinvested Units of Meliti and Megalopolis 3 and 4 are included in the TNERP, while SES Amyntaion and Kardia will use the limited life-time derogation.
3.In 2011 began the process of revising the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques Manual for Large Combustion Plants within the framework of Directive 2010/75/EU, and is coordinated by the EIPPCB (European IPPC Bureau). With the European Commission's decision 2017/1442 on 31.07.2017, the Conclusions on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion Plants ­ BREF LCP were determined under Directive 2010/75/EU. The Decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on August 17th, 2017. Following the adoption, of the legally binding, conclusions of the revised Manual, additional investments in PPC's major thermal stations may be required.
It is noted, however, that possible decisions on additional investments will now be made taking into account the developments arose by the recent ratification of the new National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP, Government's Council for the Economic Policy/4/31.12.2019, OG 4893/'/31.12.2019), which provides for the lignite phase-out of the country until 2028, as well as the expressed will of PPC for the final shutting-down of the normal operation of its existing lignite fired power plants until 2023.
4.On November 28th, 2015 Directive 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and the Council of November 25th, 2015 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from Medium Combustion Units, regardless of the type of fuel used. As Medium Combustion Units, are defined units with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MWth and less than 50 MWth. Pollutants in question are sulfur dioxide (SO ), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust, while rules for
2
the monitoring of emissions of carbon monoxide (CO ) are defined. Production units of such a size, operate 2
mainly in the islands (engines and turbines). Also, in many of PPC's SES, there are many G/S and auxiliary boilers, but with limited operating time.
The provisions of the new Directive should be thoroughly examined by the competent departments of PPC, so as together with the competent Greek authorities to timely promote the appropriate strategies for the electrification of the islands with technically and economically viable solutions which should also be promptly implemented, and in any case before the expiry of the deadline laid down by the Directive. Indicatively, major projects such as the islands' interconnection, should be planned and implemented in such a way as to fully cover the needs of all islands in electricity, while any remaining production units will be used as a backup solution and will be operating only in an emergency, not exceeding 500 hours of operation per year.

5.The extent of land contamination has to be assessed for many of PPC's installations, following the provisions of art. 22 of Directive 2010/75/EU. At present, there appears to be no requirement for remediation projects at PPC's sites for the foreseeable future, and it is unlikely that this will be required at the mining sites or at the lignite-fired power stations. Remediation, however, may be required, at some of the company's oil-fired power stations in the future. In the context of the decommissioning of the Unit Agios Georgios in Keratsini, a remediation study for the land and the underground water in the Unit was submitted in November 2016 and was approved by the Competent Authorities in July 2017. The remediation cost is estimated at  212,700.
6.PPC has performed limited studies on the presence of asbestos-containing materials, at its premises. Upon submission by PPC of a full environmental impact assessment study, the Ministry of Environment issued in May 2004 the environmental permit for the construction and operation by PPC, in its premises in Ptolemaida area of an environmentally ­ controlled Industrial Waste Management Area for the management and final disposal of asbestos containing construction materials, from the plants of the Northern System. With the real estate transfer contract no. 37244 / 05.06.2015, which is legally transcribed, PPC transferred full ownership of the Industrial Waste Management Area, located at the Kardia Mine of the Western Macedonia Lignite Centre, in DIADYMA S.A. From the date of signing the contract, DIADYMA S.A. is responsible for the Area's management. It should be noted that any dismantling/removal of asbestos-containing materials from PPCs' premises is carried out by companies licensed for this purpose.
7.In April 2018 the Environmental Terms for Klidi and Megalopolis Mines were issued. These mines belong to the two subsidiaries "LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A." and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A." respectively. At the beginning of January 2020, the Council of State announced the revocation of the Environmental Terms of SES Melitis, resulting in its decommissioning. The approval of the new Environmental Terms is expected within May 2020.
8. The Environmental Terms for Amyntaio Mine are expected to be issued.
9.During March and May 2013, CO emission licenses were issued for all 31 PPC installations, for the 3rd 2 implementation phase of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS phase III, from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2020). In November 2015 the license of the Lignite Centre of Western Macedonia thermal station was revoked due to its decommissioning. In May 2017 the licenses of Ptolemaida and Agios Georgios thermal stations were revoked due to their decommissioning. In February 2018 the CO 2 emission license of the Power Plant in South Rhodes was issued. Following the establishment of subsidiaries LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A. and LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A., SES Melitis belongs now to LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A. SES Megalopolis A belongs to LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A. while SES Megalopolis B was separated in SES Megalopolis Unit IV, belonging to LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A. and in SES Megalopolis Unit V, belonging to the Parent Company PPC S.A. As a result of these modifications, PPC's bound installations (including the aforementioned installations of subsidiaries) amount to thirty (30).
On 31.03.2019, the verification of the annual emissions reports of 30 bound plants of PPC for 2018 by accredited third party verifiers was completed and the reports were promptly submitted to the Competent Authority, according to the current legislation. The total verified emissions for 2018 amounted to 29.52 Mt CO .
2

In addition to the environmental obligations arising from the Environmental Terms Approval of the power stations, PPC in 2019 undertook voluntarily to dismantle all the power plants' and mining facilities and remove their equipment when these cease to operate. For the aforementioned obligations necessary provisions are recognized (note 32).
INVESTMENTS
A new diesel engine Power Plant 115.4 W in South Rhodos burning of heavy fuel oil with low sulphur content The construction of the new diesel engine Power Plant 115.4W in South Rhodos burning of heavy fuel oil with low sulphur content is in the stage of completion and all Units have been put into Commercial Operation and a Completion Protocol of the Project's Commercial Operation was signed. Performance tests were executed and the initial Report for the said tests was submitted by the THIRD PARTY. This initial Report is examined by the Thermal Projects Engineering ­ Construction Department. The Contractor submitted a request for the Project's Temporary Acceptance.
Hybrid Project in Ikaria The Hybrid Energy Project in Ikaria "Naeras", of 6.85 MW total capacity, is an innovative project which was inaugurated on June 5th, 2019. Naeras combines the utilization of two renewable energy sources, Wind and Hydroelectric. The construction of the project started in 2009. The delay in the completion of the project is due to contractual dissents with the contractor. In 2018, at the request of the contractor the two parties proceeded to a "friendly settlement procedure". The entire project has been connected to HEDNO's electricity network and operates since the beginning of 2019. The automated operation of the Project is expected to be completed during the first half of 2020. It is estimated that "Naeras" will produce clean energy of about 9.8 GWh/year. The expected submarine energy interconnection of Ikaria with Samos, will enable us to make greater use of the "Naeras" energy produced. Finally, "Naeras" generates significant economic, environmental and social benefits to the island of Ikaria.
Research, Development and Exploitation of Geothermal potential PPC Renewables has leased from the Greek State the geothermal potential Research and Management rights of four (4) public mining sites: a) Milos-Kimolos-Polyagos, b) Nisyros, c) Lesvos and d) Methana. While maintaining the exclusive Research and Management rights, the subsidiary PPC Renewables S.A. sought a Strategic Partner to co-exploit the geothermal potential of the above areas through an international tender. The submission of binding offers was completed in August 2018 and the Highest Bidder and the Reserved Bidder were announced in September 2018. The final qualification of the "Preferred Partner" will take place once the procedures for the necessary approvals as provided by the law and corporate structure of PPC Renewables S.A. are completed.
Biomass project in Amyntaio, Florina The tender for the selection of a Strategic Partner for the project "Installation and Operation of a Biomass Combustion Plant for the production of electricity and thermal energy" in Amyntaio, Florina is in progress. The first phase of the international tender was completed in 2018. The organization of the second phase of the tender is pending.

Finally, in March 2020, PPC Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with RWE for the development of RES projects in Greece through PPC Renewables S.A., in the context of its lignite phase-out strategy and its broader turn in the field of renewable energy.
41. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Fair value and fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuing technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are
observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value and are not based
on observable market data.
During the reporting period there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurement, and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurement.
The following tables compare the carrying amount of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial instruments that are carried at amortized cost and their fair value as well as tangible (fixed assets) which are measured periodically at revalued amounts:

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, of restricted cash, as well as of cash and cash equivalents, equals their carrying amounts. The fair value of trade receivables and trade accounts payable approximates their carrying amounts.
The fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities is based on future cash flows discounted using either direct or indirect observable inputs and are included in the Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of tangible assets (except mines, lakes and construction in progress which are valued at their cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses) is included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
As of December 31st, 2019, the Group and the Parent Company held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

Financial Risk Management
Fair Value The amounts reflected in the accompanying balance sheets for cash, current assets and current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term maturity. The fair values of financial Assets at fair value through Other Comprehensive income that are traded on stock markets are based on their quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The carrying values of long-term borrowing approximate their fair value because these loans are in local currency and mainly of floating interest rate. For all derivatives, the fair values are confirmed by the financial institutions with which the Group has concluded the relative contracts.
Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk The Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations consist of bank loans, bonds and overdraft facilities. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution of the loan portfolio between fixed and floating interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio. As of December 31st, 2019 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging.
Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars, the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions may not provide full or adequate protection against these risks.

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows for the financing of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as the servicing of the Group's and the Parent Company's debt.
The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including:
·The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills in particular from those customers with interruption of a supply contract.
·The obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT when due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected or not.
·The burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying at the same time amounts due to third parties.
·The continuous increase in the number of citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding: (a) the longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue), b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest, c) the limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.
·Regulatory decisions on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as an electricity Supplier.
·The potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.
The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as on their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs for accessing and finding liquidity (for refinancing existing debt and / or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years.
The contractual maturities of the main financial liabilities (borrowings), not including interest payments are as follows:

Risk from exposure to the Banking Sector The Group and the Parent Company may be exposed to risks arising for the Greek banking sector (for example limitations effected by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) of the ECB on loans for Public Entities).
It should be noted that as of 31.12.2019 the Parent Company's debt obligations towards the Greek Banking sector amounted to 37.5% of their total loan obligations.
Market risk The sensitivity analysis on liquid fuel, natural gas, liquid fuel, CO and system marginal price is as follows.

It concerns the estimation of 2020 for PPC S.A. due to COVID-19.

The change in the $/ rate by 5 cents of the dollar is estimated to affect the expenditure for liquid fuels and natural gas as well as profit before tax for the year 2019 by  22.6 mil. In 2020, the annual CO emissions are estimated at 14.0 mil. t. (7.2 mil. t from lignite, 3.3 mil. t. from Natural
2
Gas, 3.5 mil. t. from liquid fuels) with an average price  20.5/t. The purchased allowances amount to 8.2 mil. t. with an average price of  19.13/t. Therefore, the change in the purchase price of new CO emission allowances by +/- Euro 1.0/t changes the

relative expenditure by approximately  5.8 mil.

Offices' rentals are fixed for an average term of twelve years while rentals for machinery and transportation assets are fixed for an average term of 1 and 3 years, respectively.

43. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In addition to those presented in other notes, the following events occurred from December 31st, 2019 until the date of approval of the Financial Statements:
Repayment of loans and new loans
During the period January 1st, 2020 ­ April 23rd, 2020, the Parent Company proceeded to debt repayments of loan installments amounting to  114.4 mil. and drew an amount of  12.3 mil. from a Bond Loan of a total amount of  680 mil., with a consortium of foreign banks supported by the German Export Credit Insurance Organization `'Euler Hermes'', for financing part of the construction cost of the new Lignite Unit "Ptolemaida V". In February 2020, an amount of  40 mil. from a loan with balance on 31.12.2019 of  50 mil. in the form of a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) maturing 2/2020 was extended by one year, i.e. until February 2021 with interim repayments of  30 mil. within 2020. In January 2020, the Parent Company signed a loan agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) amounting to Euro 100 mil. to carry out investments relating to the modernization and strengthening of the Mainland's and Islands' Distribution Network in Greece for the period 2017-2020, under a total funding of  255 mil., bearing the Greek State's guarantee.

COVID-19 Pandemic On December 31st, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of limited cases of pneumonia, of unknown cause, detected in Wuhan, Hubei. On January 7th, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) as the cause. On January 23rd, 2020, the first COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong. As of December 31st, 2019, the development and spread of COVID-19 has led to the emergence of numerous related events. On March 11th, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic.
From mid-March, the Greek government began taking measures both to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (closure of educational institutions and businesses, extensive cessation of economic activity, ban on the movement of all citizens, cessation of the works in the worksite of the new Ptolemaida Unit V, etc.) and mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on affected businesses and individuals (provision of extraordinary allowances and aids, protection of labor relations, extension of the deadline and suspension of tax and insurance debts collection, etc.).
Since, as at December 31st, 2019 it was not yet known how the situation was going to develop, the Management estimates (according to the provisions of IAS 10 - Events after the reporting period) that the COVID-19 pandemic does not constitute an adjusting event for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2019 figures.
PPC S.A., already from the initial appearance of the new COVID-19 pandemic, implements a series of actions aiming to inform employees, raising their awareness on the prevention and protection measures, providing them with the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), protecting both them and their families and at the same time ensuring its business continuity.
Indicatively: - At the stage of the still mild condition, the Company:
·Posted on PPC's portal, informative material related to the new coronavirus. This material continues to be updated on the portal until today.
·Sent to all staff an information document (printed and electronic) for COVID-19 with accompanying instructions from NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION (NPHO).
·Started updating the existing Plan of Operations dated to the year 2009 (referring to the influenza pandemic H1N1 virus), referring in the first phase to the stages of the mild and moderate condition.
- At the stage of the moderate condition, the Company: ·Sent to all employees a new document (printed and via email) with instructions for their protection.

· Activated the following measures, in the context of the policy for dealing with a possible epidemic:  - Intensive disinfection and cleaning in the workplace.  -Cancellation of trips abroad, suspension of participation in conferences, postponement of educational
programs and meetings, activation of teleconferences.  -Extraordinary supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other materials related to the
protection from the coronavirus (masks, gloves, antiseptics, cleaners, etc.).  - Support of PPC's employees through PPC's IT Security Team and the Company's resident doctors. - At the stage of the pandemic, the Company:
· Set up a Crisis Management Committee to deal with COVID-19. ·Included in the Plan of Operations the stage of the pandemic and brought it in its final form entitled
"Operational plan of PPC's readiness to deal with pandemic from the new coronavirus COVID-19". · Further strengthened measures already imposed at the previous stage. ·Based on its Operational Plan, determined the critical minimum staff for the operation of the Company per
sector of activity. · Activated a telephone line to inform the staff about the coronavirus. · Suspended the operation of restaurants and canteens. ·Is in constant communication with its business units sending Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (gloves,
masks, uniforms, etc.) according to their needs. The Company also proceeds to extraordinary supplies of additional quantities of PPE, in order to avoid the lack of them, especially in the critical staff groups. ·Issues informative material and instructions for the provision of a special purpose day off and a special day off in case of a suspected, probable or confirmed case, for vulnerable groups to stay at home, for the disinfection, for the use of the PPE, for the out-of-office work, as well as for the monitoring of the incidents in the contractors' staff. ·Statistically monitors the evolution of the number of cases (probable, suspected or confirmed) concerning its employees, strictly protecting its employees' personal data.  The other subsidiaries of the Group take similar to the above measures. PPC also took extraordinary measures in order to relief electricity consumers, amending its tariffs from March 26th, 2020 and for the duration of a quarter. These extraordinary measures are as follows: · Abolition of the fixed charge in all Low Voltage tariffs. ·Abolition of the second consumption range of the electricity charge in tariffs 1 and 1, for the consumption within the peak period (i.e. the second scale of the tariffs 1 and 1 equals the first scale for the consumption within the peak period). · Abolition of the  1 charge for every printed bill. ·Readjustment of the discount on each issued electronic bill, from Euro 1 for bimonthly bills and  0.50 for monthly bills to  5 for bimonthly bills and  2.50 for monthly bills. ·For vulnerable customers which are included in the categories B & , the Company applies an 8% discount on the competitive component of their bill. ·Application of an 8% discount in all Business Tariffs for the consumption of more than 2,000kWh within the peak period.
From the above measures, it is estimated that there will be a reduction in revenues from electricity sales amounting to approximately  40 mil.

Due to the fact that the majority of the impacts mainly comes from the measures, taken both worldwide and Greece since mid-March 2020 to reduce the spread of the pandemic and to mitigate the economic impact on businesses and individuals, it is likely that the Group's and the Parent Company's operation, financial position, operating results, cash flows and the implementation of their business and investment plans will be affected. For this reason, the Group's and the Parent Company's Management daily monitors developments and measures taken regarding the rapid spread of COVID-19 and studies any adverse or positive impacts that may arise, making estimates for the following: - The evolution of the electricity demand - The availability of the Power Production Units - The evolution of the expenditures (energy balance, payroll, other expenses etc.) -The evolution of the revenues from electricity sale and other revenues (revenues from the use of Distribution
Network) - The evolution of the expected cash flows - The possibility of breach of contracts by the suppliers (due to extraordinary events) - The possibility of reduced electricity bills collection - The possibility of changing the investment plan
For the impacts expected from the measures already taken, in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, Management reassessed the budgeted financial figures for 2020 and first half of 2021, making assumptions about the evolution of the main figures of the electricity market (liquid fuels and natural gas prices, CO allowance prices, System
2
Marginal Price, etc.), as well as for the expected evolution of electricity sales. The measures taken until now to avoid the spread of COVID-19 do not seem to have an adverse economic impact on the Group and the Parent company. On the contrary, there is an increase in operational profitability due to a significant reduction in energy balance expenditures, which exceeds revenue reduction, while at the same time the adverse impact from delayed electricity bills collection is offset. In the context of the above reassessment, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the basic assumptions (liquid fuels prices, CO allowance prices, System Marginal Price and collection of electricity bills) resulting in the
2
burdening of 2020 and first half of 2021 revised financial figures, due to COVID-19, which, however, does not affect the Management's assessment that the Group and the Parent Company may continue as a going concern. It is noted that under the above conditions the Company is in compliance with financial covenants included in its loan agreements until June 30th, 2021.

NOTES TO THE UNBUNDLED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
According to the provisions of European Directive 2009/72/EC, as well as the provisions of L. 4001/2011, which integrates the aforementioned European Directive into the national legislation, unbundling is the separation of financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) of an integrated electric utility into different financial statements for each one of its activities. The unbundled financial statements will reflect each activity's financial position, assets and liabilities, as if such activities prepared financial statements had they been separate (independent) legal entities.
PPC, as a vertically organized integrated electric utility, keeps in its internal accounting, separate accounts for its activities and prepares separate balance sheets and statements of income for each one of its activities (balance sheet and statement of income before tax ­ hereinafter referred to as "unbundled financial statements"), as if these activities were carried out by different entities, in order to avoid discriminations, cross subsidization and distortion of competition.
Further to the above, PPC should keep separate accounts for its activities carried out in the non-interconnected islands.
The accounting principles applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements are those applied for the preparation of the Company's separate and consolidated financial statements.
The unbundling methodology applied by the Company for the preparation of the accompanied unbundled financial statements was approved by the 266/2014 Decision of the Regulatory Authority for Energy. Additionaly, in the Non ­ Interconnected System the transactions of energy between PPC's Generation and Supply and HEDNO, are carried out according to RAE's Decision 641/2013.
2. ACCOUNTING UNBUNDLING METHODOLOGY
The methodology applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements consists of the following phases: · Determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled · Preparation of unbundled trial balances · Preparation of unbundled balance sheets · Preparation of the unbundled statements of income ·Quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an internal
pricing system
Determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled
The activities for unbundled financial statements are prepared, on a first level, are Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply, and Corporate.

On a second level, these activities are presented as follows:
· Interconnected System - Mines - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
· System of Crete - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
· System of other Non Interconnected Islands - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
Mines Mines include the lignite extraction activity carried out in the Lignite Centers of West Macedonia and Megalopolis.
Generation Generation includes the electricity generation activities in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands.
Distribution Distribution Network includes the rental of assets to HEDNO SA in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands.
Supply Supply reflects the Company's activity which monitors relationships with final customers in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands.
Corporate The Corporate is the adninistrative departments of the Parent Company, which provide support to PPC's activities.
The Balance Sheet and Statement of Income of the Corporate is further allocated based on certain allocation rules, which are described in detail in the following pages. Related parties are reflected as a separate activity in the group unbundled financial statements .
Preparation of unbundled trial balances
In the Company's accounting system, each the cost centre and the profit centre represents an organizational entity, in which the assets and liabilities are recorded. In order for these trial balances to be generated, the following tasks are performed, which are applied per account and cost / profit centre for the minimum account degree in General

part B' / Financial Report

282

Accounting:
·Cost / profit centers are recorded in order to identify the boundaries of activities and then all cost / profit centers to be assigned to activities with which they are related to.
·The sum totals of the cost / profit centers and accounts are reconciled with the comprehensive trial balance of the Company.
·The trial balance accounts are codified and grouped into sections of the balance sheet and of the income statement based on Company's consolidated Financial Statements.
Preparation of unbundled balance sheets
At the and of each financial year, balance sheets are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System.
The balance sheet for each activity is prepared under the principle of independent accounting.
The accounts of each balance sheet are as follows:
·Direct, which include the direct charges and credits of the accounts of the relevant profit centers of the corresponding level of activity.
·Indirect of the administration departments, which derive from the administration departments of each activity and include its allocated balance sheet accounts.
·Indirect of the Corporate, which include the allocated balance sheet accounts, which are presented in a separate line on each activity's balance sheet.
Additionaly, the Balance Sheets of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately.
Preparation of the unbundled statements of income
For each accounting period income statements are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System. Additionaly, the Income Statemetns of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately.
Income statement accounts of financial nature are allocated to activities based on the loans of each activity.
Then, income statement account balances that have remained in Corporate are allocated in the activities. For the allocation of revenues and expenses to Activities the criterion is based on direct expenses of every Activity, with the exception of expenses that relate to the system of customers' monitoring and billing that are assigned only

to Supply. Upon completion of the above allocations, the Statements of income for each Activity are prepared. The Corporate expenses and revenues allocated to the activities are presented separately in a line item in each activity. Quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an internal pricing system
Within the framework of an integrated utility products and services are exchanged among its activities, which would be recorded if these activities would operate as independent entities.
In order for these products and services to be quantified and recorded, an internal pricing system is applied if necessary (where there is no external determination of internal exchanges). The most important services and products internally exchanged in PPC among its Activities, that are presented in the Unbundled Financial Statements are the following:

Product/ Service Interconnected system Lignite Other Services Self-consumption energy System of Crete Self-consumption Energy System of other non-interconnected islands Self-consumption Energy

Activity which Renders
Mines Mines Supply
Supply
Supply

Receives
Generation Generation Mines, Generation
Generation
Generation

·Each activity's revenues from product sales or services to another activity are quantified, through the internal pricing system. Also, the activity that receives the product/ service records the related cost.
The internal revenues ­ expenses for each activity are defined as follows:
In the interconnected system: · The internal energy sales for self-consumption are calculated based on each Activity's metered consumption of
energy with the average marginal price including the Return of receivable Public Service Obligations, Transmission System Tariffs and IPTO uplift charge. · The Mines internal revenue is calculated in accordance of the agreement for the lignite supply between Mines and Generation. The lignite supply contract determines the internal lignite market, i.e the lignite sales of the activity of the Lignite General Division to the activity of the Generation General Division. The contract covers the consumption of the lignite stations on a continuous basis, as well as with the necessary stock for the specific period. The calculation of the relative amounts takes place on the monthly basis, taking into account the monthly consumption and the calorific value of the lignite delivered.
In the Non-Interconnected system: · The internal energy sales are calculated based on each activity's metered consumption of energy priced by the
average revenue of PPC's tariffs for the sale of electricity to Medium Voltage for Industrial Use customers.
