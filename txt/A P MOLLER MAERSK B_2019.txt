The Annual Report for 2019 of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (hereinafter referred to as A.P. Moller - Maersk or Maersk as the consolidated group of companies and A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S as the parent company) has been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Changes in presentation and comparative figures The IFRS 16 leases accounting standard entails lessees to recognise leases in the balance sheet as a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a related lease liability. In the income statement, the lease cost is replaced by depreciation of the leased asset and an interest expense for the financial liability.
The standard was implemented on 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, and comparative figures have not been restated in the consolidated financial statements. A.P. Moller - Maersk uses EBITDA as the key operating performance indicator, and 2018 figures have

therefore been restated in the Directors' Report and internal reporting to retrospectively reflect the effect of IFRS 16.
Maersk Supply Service has been reclassified as continuing operations, following the Board of Directors' decision to no longer pursue a separation solution. Comparison figures for the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement have been restated as if Maersk Supply Service had always been part of continuing operations.
Unless otherwise stated, all figures in parenthesis refer to the corresponding figures for the same period prior year.
Forward-looking statements The Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various factors, many of which are beyond Maersk's control, may cause the actual development and results to differ materially from expectations contained in the Annual Report.

Highlights
Strong improvement in earnings and free cash flow from improved operational performance and cost measures.

Progressing on the transformation
As part of the strategic plan to become the global integrator of container logistics, we are tracking key metrics on a quarterly basis. The metrics are related to creating synergies across our businesses as one company and generating free cash flow on the back of improved earnings to ensure a strong balance sheet and create value for our shareholders.
We significantly improved the free cash flow generation with a cash return on invested capital of 9.3% (2.8%) based on improved earnings, higher cash conversion and capital discipline. Contributing to the earnings improvements, accumulated synergies of USD 1.2bn was realised by the end of 2019 hereby exceeding our synergy target of USD 1.0bn.
The non-Ocean revenue increased by 0.1% (6.3%) when adjusted for the closure of production facilities in Maersk Container Industry.

The growth was mainly driven by strong growth in gateway terminals, only partly offset by lower revenue in freight forwarding in Logistics & Services due to front loading of volumes in 2018 in anticipation of tariffs.
Strong improvement in profitability continued
With revenue on par at USD 38.9bn (USD 39.3bn), the continued focus on improving profitability across the businesses resulted in a 14% increase in EBITDA to USD 5.7bn (USD 5.0bn) and a margin of 14.7% (12.7%). This was mainly driven by strong operational performance in Ocean focusing on cargo selection, capacity management, reliability and bunker efficiency resulting in a decrease in total costs. Gateway terminals reported a 3.9% volume growth, and with improved revenue per move and stable costs, the EBITDA margin improved by 3.2 percentage points to 28%.

EBIT improved from USD 409m to USD 1.7bn, reflecting an improvement in margin to 4.4% (1.0%), leading to a higher return on invested capital of 3.1% (0.2%), while underlying profit was USD 546m (loss of USD 61m).
Free cash flow improved due to improved earnings and reduced CAPEX
Following the strong earnings development and lower net working capital, the cash conversion ratio increased to 104% (89%), and cash flow from operating activities was USD 5.9bn (USD 4.4bn). CAPEX was USD 2.0bn (USD 3.2m) and free cash flow was USD 6.8bn (USD 5.1bn), positively impacted by the sale of Total S.A. shares of USD 2.6bn (USD 3.0bn). Adjusted for capitalised lease payments and the sale of Total S.A. shares, free cash flow was USD 2.4bn (USD 0.1bn).
CAPEX discipline remains a key focus area reflected in the accumulated CAPEX guidance for 2020-2021 of USD 3.0-4.0bn.
Cash distributions to shareholders of USD 1.3bn
A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S distributed USD 1.3bn in cash to shareholders through an ordinary dividend of USD 469m in April and USD 791m related to the share buy-back programme announced in May 2019 of DKK 10bn (around USD 1.5bn) over a period of up to 15 months.
Maersk Drilling was demerged via a listing on the Danish Stock Exchange in April, and the shares were distributed to existing shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. The combined value of both companies on the first

trading day increased by 3.3%, equal to USD 0.9bn in added value.
Net interest-bearing debt decreased to USD 11.7bn (USD 15.0bn) due to strong cash flow generation and proceeds from the sale of Total S.A. shares. Maersk remains investment grade-rated with a stable outlook from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 150 per share (DKK 150 per share), based on the improved underlying profit, the proceeds from Total S.A. shares and the strong cash flow generation in 2019.
Guidance for 2020
A.P. Moller - Maersk expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around USD 5.5bn, before restructuring and integration costs and with a high cash conversion.
The outlook for 2020 is impacted by the current outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020. As factories in China are closed for longer than usual in connection with the Chinese New Year and as a result of the COVID-19 we expect a weak start to the year.

Revenue was on par with 2018. The increase of 0.2% in Ocean was due to 0.2% higher average freight rates and higher other revenue but with a decrease in volumes. The increase in Terminals & Towage of 3.2% was due to higher volumes in Terminals, while revenue declined by 1.9% in Logistics & Services because of the very high volume in Q4 2018. The decrease of 22% in Manufacturing & Others was due to exiting the dry container business and divesting the bulk activities, both in January.

Message from the Chairman and the CEO

Message from the Chairman and the CEO

In the autumn of 2016, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced a new strategy and embarked on a multi-dimensional transformation that would change not only our company but also our industry.
At the time, we were challenged by declining revenue, low profitability, weak cash flow and high financial leverage. This combined with low and volatile oil prices, as well as low and volatile container freight rates exposed the conglomerate to high risk.
We decided to transform A.P. Moller - Maersk from being a conglomerate with diversified business interests in oil, oil services, shipping and logistics to a global leader in container logistics, building on our strong position in container shipping, ports and container-based landside logistics.
Our vision is to build a company that delivers true end-to-end logistics solutions that help our Ocean customers manage their global supply chains, while leveraging the opportunities of digital technology to significantly improve the customer experience and how we run the company.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Annual Report 2019

Directors' report

Message from the Chairman and the CEO

The aim of the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk is to set the company on a new profitable growth trajectory to maximise shareholder value, while delivering on our purpose of enabling cost competitive, simple and sustainable global trade. With that we embarked on an ambitious and fundamental transformation that would not only change the company, but also challenge and change the entire industry.
Solid progress driven by the strategy
Looking back on 2019, we passed several milestones of our ambitious transformation, including the successful listing of Maersk Drilling, which marks the completion of the separation of the energy businesses. We completed the integration of Hamburg Süd and the reorganisation of the company from the conglomerate structure of the past, to the integrated and focused company structure of the future.
"The execution of our strategy has allowed us to deliver improved financial performance, while making meaningful progress on our transformation."

Despite a backdrop of weak trade growth, ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets in 2019, the execution of our strategy has allowed us to deliver improved financial performance, while making meaningful progress on our transformation.
At the 2019 Annual General Meeting, we announced four metrics to track progress on our strategic transformation:
1. Cash return on invested capital (CROIC) increased to 9.3% in 2019 from 2.8% in 2018 due to our improved earnings and strong focus on capital discipline and free cash flow. This key measure indicates generation of free cash flow from the invested capital through earnings, cash conversion and capital discipline.
2. Non-Ocean revenue increased by 0.1% when adjusted for the closure of the dry factories in Maersk Container Industry, compared to a growth of 6.3% in 2018. This was led by strong growth in gateway terminals, only partly offset by a small decline in Logistics & Services due to extraordinary high volumes in Q4 2018 and a decline in Manufacturing & Others.
3. Gross pro t in Logistics & Services increased by 8.9% in 2019 led by the growth in inland services, intermodal, warehouse and distribution and custom house brokerage. This was a solid improvement, however, gross profit comes from a low level and we need to accelerate growth further in the years to come.
4. Finally, we achieved our synergy target on the Hamburg Süd integration and through the integration of the transport and logistics parts of our business by June 2019. By year-end 2019,

the total synergies achieved reached USD 1.2bn, mainly from closer collaboration between our liner businesses and terminals as well as procurement and network synergies.
In addition to the transformation progress, we improved the financial performance of the company. Net underlying result for continuing operations grew by USD 607m to USD 546m. Operating earnings (EBITDA) grew by USD 715m to USD 5.7bn with the EBITDA margin improving to 14.7%. As a result of the stronger earnings and cash flow, we strengthened our balance sheet further with continued focus on capital discipline and free cash flow, thus reducing net interest-bearing debt by USD 3.3bn.
The improved financial performance was achieved through a combination of strong cost control, a solid network in Ocean and increased collaboration between our terminals and liner operations. Finally, improved earnings and volumes in strategic parts of our logistics offerings in warehouse and distribution, custom house brokerage and inland services contributed to the overall improvement.
Safety remains a topic of vital concern. Sadly, in 2019 three of our colleagues and two contractors lost their lives while working for A.P. Moller - Maersk. We will continue to do our utmost to ensure a safe and secure work environment for our employees. In 2019, we launched our new safety approach, which focuses on leadership accountability, capacity for safe operations, and safety culture. We remain committed to improving our safety record and will not be satisfied until we reach our ambition of zero fatalities.

Message from the Chairman and the CEO

Simpler and better customer experience
A cornerstone of our strategy is to significantly simplify the customer experience and increase customer value. In 2019, we managed to significantly improve customer satisfaction levels as we made customer interactions more seamless, offered more value-added services and repositioned our strong brand.
We control key assets in the physical value chain, which gives us a competitive edge. We are the only end-to-end logistics provider that owns a global container liner network, a global terminal network and a sizeable share of warehouses. By integrating our operations and assets with technology, we can continuously offer new products to our customers and better meet their individual supply chain needs.

"Good leadership, strong talent and the right combination of current and new capabilities are key to ensuring that all activities stay focused on our customers and on our strategic priorities. It is embedded in the strong A.P. Moller - Maersk culture to take care of today, while actively preparing for tomorrow."

To deliver on customer requirements of transparency and predictability, we launched a new product, Maersk Spot, in May 2019. Maersk Spot offers fixed prices and a loading guarantee and was immediately well received with a strong market adoption accounting for 24% of short-term volume by year-end 2019.
In container logistics, speed and cost efficiency remain key customer concerns. We stay focused on offering easy-to-use self-service solutions that enable our customers to quickly help themselves, primarily through Maersk.com. Our website has become one of the world's largest B2B transactional websites, conducting more than USD 20bn per year in business.
A step change was made in early 2019 when we combined the sales forces of our land-based Logistics & Services products and our Ocean

segment under the A.P. Moller - Maersk brand. Going to market as one sales force enables fully integrated value propositions and much simpler interactions to the benefit of our customers.
Frontrunning a technology shift in the industry
Among industries, container logistics has not been an early adopter of new technologies. One of the main challenges in the industry is too many and too complex paper-based processes and lack of common industry standards for data flow. As the global leader of container logistics, A.P. Moller - Maersk is taking the lead to digitally transform core processes in the industry.
TradeLens, a digital platform developed jointly by IBM and Maersk in 2018, is one example where blockchain technology allows increased transparency and more efficient information exchange

saving time and costs for all players across the industry.
TradeLens is processing over 10 million discrete shipping events and thousands of documents each week. This provides shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, customs officials, port authorities and inland service providers with a common view of transactions and enables users to collaborate more efficiently with real-time access to shipping data.
Another aspect of the digital transformation is optimising utilisation of our assets. One example is in terminals, where we are introducing semiautomated operations at Pier 400, Los Angeles ­ the largest container terminal in North America. The aim is to increase efficiency and safety, and to reduce emissions. When the project is finished, truckers will see their entry/exit times at the terminal go down from 105 minutes to 35 minutes.

2020 ­ continuing to perform while we transform
Focus remains on developing our end-to-end offering through an even stronger Ocean product while expanding and scaling our logistics and services portfolio. The growth in logistics will be supported by the acquisition of the USA based company Performance Team with strong capabilities within warehousing fulfilment services, e-commerce, inland transportation and distribution services. Also, we are committed to securing longterm profitability in our terminals business and continue the strong developments from 2019.
Cost leadership is imperative in a competitive market with uncertainties.
To further fund the transformation, we continually improve our operating results while delivering strong free cash flow and reducing investments in

the Ocean business. We continue to reduce CAPEX spend, with CAPEX guidance lowered to an accumulated USD 3-4bn over the coming two years. The year 2020 will be marked by new regulations on sulphur emissions (IMO 2020) that went into effect on 1 January. We fully support the industry move towards low sulphur fuel to reduce pollution. We are well prepared to comply while mitigating the increased fuel expenses by lowering our bunker consumption and passing on the additional cost to customers.
"By integrating our operations and assets with technology, we can offer new products and value propositions to our customers and better meet their individual supply chain needs."

Good leadership, strong talent and the right combination of current and new capabilities are key to ensure that all activities stay focused on our customers and on our strategic priorities. It is embedded in the strong A.P. Moller - Maersk culture to take care of today, while actively preparing for tomorrow.
The outlook ahead is for low economic growth and low demand growth for seaborne goods. We plan accordingly and maintain flat capacity to support utilisation and low cost.
Committed to enabling cost-competitive, simple and sustainable global trade
Only through a level playing field for global trade can we enable exporters to sell their products around the world, and importers to source from the most competitive suppliers, no matter where they are located. Global trade creates jobs, economic growth and consumption opportunities that raise the quality of life.
As the world's largest operator of container vessels, we have a responsibility to pioneer when it comes to climate change. We continue to reduce our CO emissions and work towards reaching carbon neutrality in our Ocean segment by 2050. On the operational side, we have reduced our bunker consumption by 6.7% since 2018, and our CO efficiency has improved by 5.2%.
Good corporate governance remains a high priority, and in 2019 the Board of Directors added new members with the election of Bernard L. Bot and Marc Engel, bringing in supplementary capabilities in finance and logistics.

By the end of 2019, we took one step further in the integration of the business structure. Changes were made in the Executive Board with Vincent Clerc being appointed CEO of Ocean & Logistics and Henriette Hallberg Thygesen joining as CEO of Fleet & Strategic Brands. Furthermore, it was announced on 12 February 2020, that Patrick Jany will take up the position as CFO and member of the Executive Board from 1 May 2020.
These structural changes allow for even closer collaboration that will strengthen our execution power.
Thank you for your continued support
With the progress demonstrated in 2019 we have completed the first phase of our transformation. We remain committed to becoming an integrated transport and logistics company, delivering a higher return to our shareholders, while enabling global trade in an affordable, simple and sustainable way.
On behalf of the Board of Directors and the management team, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all our employees around the globe for their continued passion, efforts and dedication to A.P. Moller - Maersk who's loyalty and contributions have enabled our unique position and is the foundation for our future.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Annual Report 2019

Directors' report

Financial review

Financial review
A.P. Moller - Maersk reported an EBITDA of USD 5.7bn (USD 5.0bn) in line with the upgraded EBITDA expectations announced in October 2019. The increase in EBITDA of USD 714m, mainly driven by an increase in Ocean of USD 574m and supported by capacity management and lower costs, resulted in a higher result than set in the initial guidance for 2019. Cash flow from operating activities was strong with a continued strict capital discipline.

Financial and operational performance
A.P. Moller - Maersk reported a revenue of USD 38.9bn (USD 39.3bn), emphasising the focus on improving profitability and cash flow after a strong revenue growth when integrating Hamburg Süd in 2018.
EBITDA increased by 14% to USD 5.7bn (USD 5.0bn), reflecting a margin of 14.7% (12.7%), mainly coming from the increase of 15% in Ocean to USD 4.4bn (USD 3.8bn), driven by a lower cost base due to capacity management and lower bunker price and consumption. EBITDA includes restructuring costs of USD 104m, while the impact from foreign exchange rates was negligible.
EBIT was USD 1.7bn (USD 409m), reflecting an EBIT margin of 4.4% (1.0%), negatively impacted by net impairments and write-downs of USD 29m (USD 757m). The impairments and write-downs in 2018 were related to Maersk Supply Service, the RoRo activities and the closure of Maersk Container Industry's factories in Chile and China.

Financial expenses, net, amounted to USD 758m (USD 766m), due to lower dividends received from Total S.A. of USD 13m (USD 238m), partly compensated by lower debt in 2019.
Tax increased to USD 458m (USD 398m), mainly due to changes in temporary differences in deferred tax.
The continuing operations reported a profit of USD 509m (loss of USD 755m) while the result for discontinued operations was a loss of USD 553m (profit of USD 3.8bn). The result for 2018 was positively impacted by an accounting gain of USD 2.6bn from the closing of the Maersk Oil transaction. The net result for both continuing and discontinued operations was a loss of USD 44m (profit of USD 3.0bn).
The underlying result for continuing operations after financial items and tax was a profit of USD 546m (loss of USD 61m), due to the improved operational performance.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Annual Report 2019

Directors' report

Financial review

ROIC for continuing operations increased significantly to 3.1% (0.2%) but remains at an unsatisfactory level below the target of minimum 7.5%.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 5.9bn (USD 4.4bn), driven by EBITDA of USD 5.7bn and improvements in net working capital of USD 477m, leading to a cash conversion of 104% (89%).
Gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) was USD 2.0bn (USD 3.2bn), reflecting a continued capital discipline with most of the reduction in CAPEX coming from the Ocean segment.
Free cash flow was USD 6.8bn (USD 5.1bn), driven by cash flow from operating activities of USD 5.9bn, the sale of the remaining Total S.A. shares of USD 2.6bn, partly offset by CAPEX of USD 2.0bn. Free cash flow less capitalised lease payments was USD 5.0bn (USD 3.1bn), and USD 2.4bn (USD 0.1bn) when further adjusted for the sale of Total S.A. shares.
A.P. Moller - Maersk made net repayments of USD 2.7bn (USD 6.5bn), driven by repayments of three EUR bonds worth USD 1.0bn, repayment of USD 650m of financing from the Hamburg Süd acquisition and repayment of leases of USD 1.3bn

(USD 1.5bn), partly offset by a 2029 USD 500m bond issuance in Q2.
The contractual capital commitments totalled USD 1.7bn, of which USD 1.2bn related to commitments towards terminal concession grantors. Strong commitment to capital discipline and a focus on free cash flow generation continue to be key areas.
Capital structure, issue of bonds and credit rating
Net interest-bearing debt decreased to USD 11.7bn (USD 15.0bn), driven by cash flow from operating activities of USD 5.9bn, positive cash flow used for investing activities of USD 874m due to the sale of Total S.A. shares of USD 2.6bn in Q1 2019, partly offset by the annual dividend of USD 469m, share buy-backs of USD 791m, financial expenses, net payments of USD 736m and net new lease liabilities of USD 1.5bn. The increase in net new lease liabilities was mostly driven by a new terminal concession with Tangier-Med II, Morocco, which went into operation in January 2019.
Maersk remains investment grade-rated and holds a Baa3 (stable) rating from Moody's and a BBB (stable) rating from Standard & Poor's.

Free cash flow USD 6.8bn

Total equity was USD 28.8bn (USD 33.2bn), with the decrease mainly driven by the demerger and separate listing of Maersk Drilling of USD 3.4bn along with the USD 469m ordinary dividend paid in April and share buy-backs of USD 791m, resulting in an equity ratio of 52% (53%).
The liquidity reserve increased slightly to USD 10.5bn (USD 10.3bn), as cash balances increased mainly from the sale of the remaining Total S.A. shares, partly offset by a number of undrawn revolving facilities expiring in 2020.
The ordinary dividend of DKK 150 per A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S share of nominally DKK 1,000 (in total equal to USD 469m), declared at the Annual General Meeting on 2 April 2019, was paid on 8 April 2019.
The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000). Of the total proposed ordinary dividend, the DKK 75 per share relates to the company's dividend policy of distributing between 30-40% of the underlying net result to shareholders in dividend, while the remaining DKK 75 per share relates to the commitment of distributing a material part of the value of the proceeds from the initially received Total S.A. shares, supported by the strong free cash flow generation in 2019.
The proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 1.6% (1.8%), based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 9,608 as of 30 December 2019. Payment is expected to take place on 26 March 2020.

Directors' report

Financial review

During Q4, Maersk bought back 43,638 A shares and 174,252 B shares worth DKK 1.9bn (USD 283m).

At 31 December, A.P. Moller - Maersk owns a total of 134,279 A shares and 587,949 B shares as treasury shares, corresponding to 3.47% of the share capital.

Discontinued operations
The objective of finding structural solutions for the oil and oil-related businesses was successfully accomplished for Maersk Tankers in 2017, for Maersk Oil in 2018 and for Maersk Drilling in April 2019 as a demerger from A.P. Moller - Maersk via a separate listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen on 4 April. Finally, in Q1 2019 it was decided to retain Maersk Supply Service. The separation of the energy-related businesses is thereby finalised.

A.P. Moller - Maersk recognised a loss of USD 553m for the Maersk Drilling activity, mainly due to a negative fair value accounting adjustment of USD 628m prior to the demerger.

Share buy-back
In Q2 2019, the Board of Directors decided to exercise the authority to buy back shares in line with the previously announced intention to distribute a material part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares received in Total S.A., as part of the sale of Maersk Oil.
From 4 June to 31 December 2019, Maersk bought back 134,279 A shares and 537,143 B shares worth DKK 5.3bn (USD 791m).

Change in management
On 30 June 2019, Claus V. Hemmingsen stepped down as Vice CEO and left the company. On 11 November, Søren Toft stepped down as COO and left the company. On 25 November, Carolina Dybeck Happe announced her resignation and she will step down as CFO during 2020. On 17 December 2019, it was announced that Henriette Hallberg Thygesen was appointed member of the Executive Board as per 1 January 2020.
The Executive Board consists of Søren Skou, Carolina Dybeck Happe, Vincent Clerc, Morten H. Engelstoft and Henriette Hallberg Thygesen. On 12 February it was announced that Patrick Jany will take up the position as CFO and join the Executive Board from 1 May 2020.

Guidance for 2020

Guidance for 2020

A.P. Moller - Maersk expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around USD 5.5bn, before restructuring and integration costs.
The organic volume growth in Ocean is expected to be in line with or slightly lower than the estimated average market growth of 1-3% for 2020.

The outlook and guidance for 2020 is subject to significant uncertainties and impacted by the current outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020. As factories in China are closed for longer than usual in connection with the Chinese New Year and as a result of the COVID-19, we expect a weak start to the year.

The accumulated guidance on gross capital expenditure excl. acquisitions (CAPEX) for 20202021 is still USD 3.0-4.0bn. A high cash conversion (cash flow from operating activities compared to EBITDA) is expected for both years.

The guidance for 2020 is also subject to uncertainties related to the implementation of IMO 2020 and the impact on bunker fuel prices and freight rates combined with the weaker macroeconomic conditions and other external factors.

Sensitivities on guidance for 2020
The guidance of A.P. Moller - Maersk for 2020 depends on several factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all else being equal, the sensitivities for 2020 for four key assumptions are listed in the table below:

Market update

Market update
Global container trade growth was weak in 2019, as expected. Growth softened to around 0% in Q4 2019, and full-year growth ended at 1.4% (3.8%), considerably weaker than in 2018. The slowdown reflected broadbased weakening across all the main economies. Negative effects from escalating trade restrictions also weighed on trade growth.
Effective supply growth was contained during the year because of the moderate number of new vessels entering the market and the increase in the number of idled vessels. Therefore, despite the soft market demand, market fundamentals were more supportive of freight rates than in recent years, and freight rates increased slightly compared to 2018.

by strong exports from Europe. North-South container trade stagnated in 2019. Latin American imports decreased slightly by 0.3%, reflecting weak macroeconomics, mainly in Brazil and Argentina and partly in Mexico. Import growth in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent declined marginally by 0.4% in 2019, while African imports grew by 4.0%. Finally, intra-regional trades posted modest growth in 2019, mainly supported by strong Intra-European flows.

Modest container demand growth in 2019 reflects the slowdown in global manufacturing and global export orders. For 2020, global container demand is projected to grow by 1-3%. The continued weak global sentiment above all in the manufacturing sector reduces the likelihood of a material growth pick-up in 2020, although sentiment brightened

a bit at the end of 2019, and some improvement can be expected on the back of stabilising inventory dynamics. Aside from the cyclical slowing of the global economy, substantial risk to global container demand comes from the effectiveness of

Market developments
Container trade growth on the East-West trades grew 2.0% in 2019 (Chart 1 and Table 1). Solid trade flows in the first part of 2019 were counterbalanced by negative demand growth in the last quarter. European import growth from Asia was very strong in H1 2019 (5.1%) but moderated sharply to 0.6% in H2, bringing it closer in line with Europe's underlying economic fundamentals. North American container imports were under pressure during most of 2019 due to the US-China trade restrictions and slowing US capital expenditures, and consequently declined compared to 2018. Meanwhile, Asian imports from the US and Europe (East-West backhaul) showed solid growth in 2019, as the negative impact of trade restrictions on the US-China trade was more than offset

fiscal and monetary policy in major economies, such as the US and China. The global economy is vulnerable to a spike in oil prices caused by geopolitical tensions, and the outcome of the Brexit negotiations poses a risk to UK and European container trade. Moreover, the recent escalation of the coronavirus adds to short-term downside risks, while the longer-term impact will likely be limited. Finally, US-China trade negotiations remain a significant uncertainty.
Trade restrictions, mainly between the US and China and partly between the US and the EU, intensified in 2019, and the trade restrictive measures introduced since 2018 impact around USD 640bn worth of traded goods, corresponding to nearly 4% of the global value of traded goods. The trade restrictions have reduced

bilateral trade between the US and China and led to shifts in trade structure. So far, US importers have shifted imports away from China to other countries such as Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, India, Mexico, and Europe. Globally, the implemented trade restrictions have reduced container trade by 0.5-1.0% in 2019 via direct and indirect channels, such as deteriorating sentiment and business investments. Despite some relief of the US-China trade restrictions towards the end of 2019, uncertainty about the outcome of subsequent trade negotiations and the impact on trade remains large. Meanwhile, the US continues to threaten to introduce higher tariffs on EU imports, for example on the automotive industry. Overall, the negative impact on container volumes from the trade war is expected to be within 0.5-1.0% again in 2020. The outcome of

GEflofebcatlivceoncatapianceirtydemand Nominal capacity

The global container fleet stood at 23.2m TEU at the end of 2019, 4.1% higher than at the end of 2018. Deliveries amounted to 1,059k TEU (148 vessels) in 2019 and were evenly distributed during the year. Deliveries were dominated by vessels larger than 10k TEU. Around 208k TEU were scrapped in 2019, likely reflecting scarce market availability of some vessel segments as ships were removed temporarily from service to install fuel scrubbers, primarily in the +10k TEU segment in preparation for IMO 2020 regulations in January 2020. The reverse impact, when these vessels are redeployed back in service, will add to effective supply and increase the risk of oversupply, mainly in H2 2020. Idling totalled 6.1% (1,417 TEU) of the fleet at the end of 2019. The idle fleet bottomed out in Q2 and began to increase in the following two quarters, mainly because vessels were taken out of service for scrubber retrofitting. Consequently, effective capacity increased less than 1% in 2019 (Chart 2).

18

784k TEU were ordered in 2019, corresponding to orderbook-to-fleet ratio of 10% at the end of the year. According to Alphaliner, the nominal global container fleet will grow by 3.5% in 2020. Effective supply is projected to increase by 1-3% (internal estimate), in line with global headhaul demand.
Freight rates, as measured by the China Composite Freight Index (CCFI), were on average 0.7% higher than in 2018, supported by headhaul demand slightly outgrowing average effective capacity (Chart 3). Freight rates held up firmly in the first part of the year but began to decline in H2 as demand weakened and bunker prices fell. Freight rates fell on the Asia to North Europe route by 4.5% but strengthened by 4.8% from Asia to Mediterranean Europe. Asia to US West Coast freight rates were stable by negative 0.1%, while Asia to US East Coast fell by 1.3%. Uncertainties relating to the strength of container demand and the dynamics of instalments of fuel scrubbers continue to pose a risk to the developments of freight rates in 2020.

The shipping industry successfully prepared for the IMO 2020 fuel specification switch to 0.5% sulphur fuels in Q4 2019. Demand for high-sulphur fuel oils fell substantially and Singapore and Rotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil prices declined by 20% and 22% from Q3 to Q4, respectively, averaging USD 350/tonne (t) and USD 273/t in Q4. Demand for low-sulphur 0.5% fuel oil increased as carriers prepared ahead of the 1 January transition date. Low-sulphur fuel oil prices rose by 4.4% in Singapore and dropped by 1.5% in Rotterdam moving into Q4 from Q3, averaging USD 576/t and USD 518/t in Q4, respectively. Low-sulphur 0.5% marine gasoil (LSMGO) prices also gained, rising by 1.4% q/q to USD 599/t in Singapore and 0.7% q/q to USD 568/t in Rotterdam in Q4 over Q3.

Singapore is the largest bunker port in the world accounting for an estimated quarter of global bunker sales and has experienced an active and volatile pricing period in the last months ahead of the specification switch. Singapore's low-sulphur 0.5% fuel oil posted prices above that of LSMGO for a period of 19 trading days at the end of December 2019 till early January 2020 highlighting the tight demand of low-sulphur fuel oil in the Asian region. We expect further volatility in the fuel prices in the major trading regions through mid-2020 before some stability returns.
The other transport and logistics markets were in broad terms impacted by the dynamics and market drivers that steered the ocean industry.

According to Drewry, port throughput volumes grew by 2.3% in 2019. Ports on the US East Coast recorded solid volume growth, while US West Coast saw declining volumes, and activity in the Far East ports stagnated. In line with projections for ocean trade, global port throughput growth is expected to be slightly higher in 2020. The container port industry continues to combat structural challenges stemming from the cascading of large container vessels, reinforced carrier alliances and capacity increases in many ports. The increased load on terminals is triggering requirements for upgrades of the terminal infrastructure, equipment, manning and planning capabilities, leading to more capital expenditure and operational cost, but lower utilisation.

Weak growth in global trade volumes in 2019 weighed on the broader logistics segment. Gross margins in the freight forwarding market remain under structural pressure from digital offerings. Freight forwarders are attempting to mitigate these pressures by selling value-added services on top of basic freight forwarding products and by developing their own digital offerings to be competitive against new entrants. Additionally, the air forwarding market is under pressure as a result of the trade restrictions between the USA and China.

Technology and future supply chains
Macroeconomics, market-specific conditions, and technology are key factors that determine the success of our business. We therefore pay close attention to global economic trends and technology developments in the regions and verticals in which we operate. This enables us to adjust our strategy and market positioning to capitalise on opportunities and to manage risk.
Future supply chains may look very different to today's supply chains: closer to the end-customer, fewer intermediate and raw inputs traded, and more regional/local. As noted in the Annual Report 2018, change in the structure of global trade flows is already apparent as evidenced by the declining trade-to-GDP multiplier (Chart 4).

the need for labour. Technologies enabling recycling and closed-loop product life-cycles will impact multiple supply chains.
While technology is a key driver of change in supply chains, time-to-impact cannot be assessed without understanding the industry context, the commercial setting, industry structure and potential adoption rates. We therefore engage with external experts and industry players to develop a holistic perspective on potential impacts. Some high-level findings follow for two industry verticals.
Apparel industry -- the outlook for the global supply chain will be determined by the interaction between the pace of automation in apparel production and whether textile and yarn production

will become more distributed than today. For example, if the current trend of apparel production moving out of China to other Asian economies continues, while the textile and yarn supply chain remains largely unchanged, total containerised trade will grow more rapidly compared to a business-as-usual case. In contrast, if automation technologies prove to be commercially viable, and the yarn and textile supply chain ecosystem moves closer to new production locations, total containerised trade will be weaker compared to a business-as-usual case.
Automotive industry -- the outlook for the supply chain will be determined by the interaction of progress in battery technology and the degree to which battery production is distributed globally.

For example, if global battery production and supply becomes more China centred, automotiverelated ocean volumes will be positively impacted by increased electric vehicles sales compared to a business-as-usual case. In contrast, if battery technology evolves toward smaller and lighter units or is more distributed, automotive-related ocean volumes might be negatively impacted by increased sales compared to a business-as-usual case.

Technology is working as a key pull and push factor shaping global trade flows: by empowering individuals to demand goods whenever and wherever they choose, supply chains are being pulled closer to the end-customer and are required to be more responsive to changing demand patterns. By reducing labour-cost arbitrage through automation, technology is enabling or pushing production of goods closer to the customer on commercially viable terms. Rising tariff barriers and environmental concerns accelerate these trends.
Technology is also challenging the business models of some of our largest customers and the supply chains of entire industries. For example, electric vehicles will change the automotive supply chain and threaten the installed base of OEMs. Vertical farming techniques that enable production to occur independently of the external environment and close to the end-customer are beginning to show promise, as are innovations in the production of apparel and footwear that reduce

Container logistics play a significant role in global trade by reducing trade barriers through reducing the cost of transportation. Maersk has played a vital role in container logistics for more than 40 years and takes pride in this contribution to global growth and wealth. Maersk's strategy is to accelerate that contribution by reducing complexity and waste along the global containerised supply chains. Maersk has designed the strategy around its customers' needs and pain points, hereby creating a market opportunity that will deliver value to customers as well as profitable growth and improved performance for Maersk.

Becoming the global integrator of container logistics
The vision of becoming the global integrator of container logistics rests on three pillars: · Creating a portfolio of end-to-end products/
services. · Seamless customer engagement. · Superior delivery network end-to-end.
The first phase of strategy execution focused on improving the customer experience and the financial performance of the Ocean business to create a strong foundation for the next phases of the strategy. The tools have been better reliability, better service to customers, defining and selling unique products, as well as continuing to reap benefits from scale and other cost benefits. Maersk has seen significant progress in these areas since the strategy was launched in the fall of 2016.

Creating a portfolio of end-to-end products/services
The next phase in the strategy is about growing the business by innovating existing products combined with selling landside logistics products to our existing customers ­ as well as growth in our Terminals & Towage business.
Product innovation is critical to providing new and increased value to Maersk customers, while at the same time addressing the inefficiencies of the industry. Maersk has made good progress on adding new products in 2019, which is essential for creating a portfolio of end-to-end products/services. On the oceanside, Maersk Spot has been launched ­ a new Ocean product with equipment and load guarantee. This product has been very positively received by the customers and by yearend 2019, Maersk Spot makes up approximately

24% of Maersk's total spot volumes. On the landside, Maersk acquired the US-based customs brokerage firm Vandegrift in Q1 2019, which is a strong addition to the Logistics & Services portfolio. In the coming years, Maersk plans to add more new products and capabilities through value-creating acquisitions within areas where Maersk can add value and solve pain points for its customers, such as customs house brokerage, warehousing and distribution and supply chain management. The current M&A pipeline consists of acquisition targets each of them with a value well below USD 1bn. The value creation logic in the M&A strategy is based on creating additional value to our existing customers, hence the majority of synergies from M&A will come from commercial synergies and less from cost synergies ­ although the latter will also be pursued to the extent possible.

Seamless customer engagement
Adding more products is fundamental towards becoming the global integrator of container logistics. However, in the future, Maersk's aspiration is not just to have more products available but to be able to configure these into differentiated value propositions to suit individual customer needs (as illustrated). This requires enhanced capabilities to integrate data and to integrate operational processes, something which Maersk is currently working on and investing in.
Digitisation is a critical element of improving Maersk's operational performance, creating new products, and not least creating a seamless customer engagement. Maersk's primary customer engagement platform, Maersk.com, is one of the world's largest B2B platforms. Maersk is bringing more of its inland products onto Maersk.com, and in 2019 went live with customs house brokerage in 22 new countries, where customers with a click of a button can select customs clearance

as an integrated part of the service. Data integration, where Maersk provides customers with live data insights to optimise their supply chain is becoming increasingly important. Here Maersk has made significant progress with TradeLens, which now has Ocean partners signed up representing around 66% of global container capacity as well as 98 terminals live, and 22 customs authorities engaged in pilots or exchanging data.
Another key element of seamless customer engagement is how Maersk aspires to meet the customers as per their individual preferences, and to enable that Maersk merged the frontline organisations of Ocean and Logistics & Services in 2019. This integration effort, which involved a new organisational model in more than 130 countries and a new operating model for 22,000 colleagues, was executed throughout H1 2019, and the new model is now operational and delivering a much improved interface between Maersk and its customers.

"We have begun a journey towards having net-zero CO emissions from our own operations by 2050. This is an important ambition and one we can only deliver on in collaboration with many other stakeholders."

Strategy

The efforts to improve the customer experience is paying off, and over the past two years customer satisfaction has been steadily increasing, reaching an all-time high level in 2019.
Superior delivery network end-to-end
The foundation of Maersk's strategy is a superior delivery network end-to-end, which delivers on fundamental needs for getting goods to the right place, at the right time, at the right price, with minimum environmental impact.
Late 2017, Maersk acquired Hamburg Süd to strengthen the Ocean network, and throughout 2019 the networks of Hamburg Süd and Maersk became fully integrated delivering annual cost synergies above expectation. In 2019, Maersk has improved reliability in Ocean by 10 percentage points, placing Maersk (both the Maersk and Hamburg Sud brands) consistently in the top

quartile of global carriers in the industry. Cost leadership remains essential and in 2019 Maersk reduced its unit cost by 1.7% at fixed bunker. Going forward, Maersk remains committed on lowering the total operating costs, excluding bunker fuel cost and to deliver 1-2% unit cost at fixed bunker reductions per year. In parallel, Maersk continues reducing the CO emissions and by 2019 had reduced relative consumption by 41.8% compared to 2008 baseline. Maersk's ambition of 60% reduction by 2030, and net-zero emission by 2050, will require significant innovation in new fuel types, which Maersk is spearheading together with industry stakeholders.

between the transport and logistics businesses exceeding the USD 1.0bn target as well as from completing the integration of Hamburg Süd. More synergies remain, and Maersk is constantly looking for innovative ways to identify synergies and take out cost. In addition, Maersk is fundamentally re-architecting its process and applications landscape, re-engineering core processes end-to-end, and replacing a set of ageing legacy applications with modern, cost-efficient applications that can properly support an integrated container logistics company. Many fundamental building blocks in this effort have been selected and are being implemented with first major releases in 2020.

The Maersk organisation is changing from a conglomerate of independent businesses to one integrated container logistics company. The integration is delivering significant synergies, and by end 2019 Maersk realised USD 1.2bn in combined synergies

Growth with focus on Logistics & Services and Terminals & Towage
In 2019, Maersk had 73% of the revenue in Ocean, 15% in Logistics & Services, and 10% in Terminals & Towage. Maersk will grow the two latter

segments disproportionate to the former, including acquisitions in landside logistics, as previously described, to create a more diversified business model and rebalanced operating profit (EBIT). In APM Terminals, growth will come from further improvement of existing operations and completing ongoing terminal projects. In the future, Maersk does not expect to venture into new greenfield projects but will consider brownfield and M&A as means to deliver profitable growth in the Terminals & Towage segment.
Over the past three years, Maersk has deleveraged with more than USD 10bn via strict CAPEX discipline in Ocean and not starting new greenfield terminal projects. This has contributed to a strong balance sheet and by that the needed investment capacity to deliver on the growth plans described above and at the same time be able to distribute cash to shareholders.

Keeping track of the transformation
To measure the transformation, Maersk is tracking four transformation metrics in addition to the overall ROIC target of creating an ROIC above 7.5%.

Logistics & Services improved gross profit by 8.7% to USD 1.2bn, reflecting a gross profit margin of 20%. Cash return on invested capital (CROIC) increased to 9.3% in 2019 due to strong free cash flow. Finally, combined synergies from the Hamburg Süd acquisition and from the integration of the transport and logistics activities increased until end 2019 and came to USD 1.2bn, thereby exceeding the original target. As the bulk of the synergies are now delivered, we will stop reporting this metric going forward.

Reliability on the spot

ALL THE WAY
Reliability on the spot
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE | Providing customers with an efficient and reliable experience is essential for Maersk's growth. Maersk Spot is offering transparent prices and loading guarantee while ensuring higher operational predictability and stronger commitments from customers.

With equipment and loading guarantees, customers experience a new level of reliability that ensures a timely delivery to market.

Customers do not like disruptions to their supply chains. However, it is not uncommon to see overbookings in shipping to secure high utilisation. The industry continues to face the challenge of highly volatile overbooking rates with an average of 20-30%, making it difficult to plan operations.
For customers such as The Ramco Cements Limited, this cycle was creating a lot of frustration and uncertainty.
"We send around 120-200 containers to Colombo every week from Kattupalli port, near Chennai. Making bookings one to two weeks in advance is important to ensure that we can deliver to our customers on time, with the best deal possible," said Ramakrishnan Damodaran, Dy General Marketing Manager of The Ramco Cements Limited.

Reliability on the spot

"Even though we are proactive about our bookings, there were cases where our shipments were not loaded due to capacity issues which resulted in customers losing trust in us," Ramakrishnan added.
As a response to this viscous cycle and in efforts to continue the momentum in developing an industry leading customer experience, Maersk has taken the initiative to make online bookings easier, faster, and simpler for customers.
Drawing on solid customer relationships and strong cross-functional teamwork, the Maersk Spot product is providing ocean customers with a simple online booking process that includes full price transparency, and equipment and space guarantee.

Less uncertainty, more transparency
Efficiency, reliability and competitive pricing are the three anchors of the Maersk Spot booking experience. For short-term customers, they can count on this product to deliver transparency, assurance, strong price competitiveness, awareness and an optimised ordering flow.
"Once we started using Maersk Spot, we no longer had the uncertainty of not knowing if we could actually provide our customers with their shipments," said Ramakrishnan.
Moving away from 13 independent offline steps in the buying process to five simple integrated online steps, Maersk Spot is providing a radically simplified buying experience.

"Now that Maersk has introduced bookings on the spot, we are able to fulfil our supply chain needs with one company, in one place, seamlessly, with trust and commitment."
Ramakrishnan Damodaran, General Marketing Manager, The Ramco Cements Limited
"Not only is the flow and ordering process simplified and optimised, the attractive rates and reliability of securing equipment and space guarantee have enabled us to improve operations and provide more proactive customer service," Ramakrishnan shared.

Shippers cancel or abandon bookings without having to pay a cancellation fee

Carriers roll over containers or cancel specific departures

Carriers are forced to overbook their vessels to increase utilisation

Higher predictability and reliability
As Maersk races ahead to become the global integrator of container logistics, building and delivering products and services that facilitate end-to-end solutions for customers is imperative for growth.
"Maersk Spot is giving us more operational predictability and strong customer commitment, and our customers get a digital, affordable and reliable service. All in all, this is driving an efficient and reliable customer experience, while enabling both Maersk's growth and that of our customers," said Johan Sigsgaard, Head of Ocean Products, Europe and Middle East trade. In Q4 2019, Spot customers booked 25,000 forty-foot containers weekly, accounting for one quarter of Maersk's total shortterm volume.

Sustainability

Sustainability
In 2019, a step change in the commitment to sustainability took place across society. From government, investors and companies, to scientists, students and consumers, everyone united in calling for attention and solutions to the pressing challenges that are impacting our world. A.P. Moller - Maersk is making the pursuit of solutions that contribute to a better world a fundamental part of how we do business.

Performance highlights 2019
Our ambition is to have net-zero CO emissions from own operations by 2050 · Progress of 41.8% relative CO reduction
towards our 2030 target of 60% reduction (EEOI indicator, compared to 2008 baseline) · Identified three viable technologies for future fuels · Launched the Maersk ECO Delivery ocean product

The demands for a more environmentally and socially sustainable world continued to grow in 2019. This is evident to us in new requirements from the financial community, in the expectations expressed by our customers and in the willingness of a range of stakeholders to partner with A.P. Moller - Maersk in the pursuit of decarbonising logistics.
This focus on decarbonising logistics is one of our sustainability strategy's four priorities (see graphic on page 28). We combine these priorities with a firm focus on responsible business practices and continue to integrate the management of sustainability risks, responsibilities and opportunities into our business operations.
In each of our four priorities, on trade, climate change, food loss and ship recycling, we look for ways in which we, through our business, can pursue and scale solutions to meet significant systemic challenges for the benefit of society and, at the same time, create opportunities for our business.

Decarbonising logistics
All sectors in the world need to decarbonise by 2050, if we want to live up to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change's goal of keeping global warming well below 2°C (IPCC, 2018). This includes so-called `hard to abate-sectors', of which shipping is one.
The effects of climate change are clearly visible in changing weather patterns, including more extreme weather events, water scarcity and loss of biodiversity. These developments have galvanised interest and action in the financial sector and in the general public. They are also affecting supply chains across the world, with companies of all sizes looking for carbon efficiency and sustainable solutions to their transportation needs.
Maersk's focus continues to be on efficiency gains, with a target of a 60% reduction in CO emissions by 2030 compared to 2008. From 2019, we report on progress towards this target using Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). With this

indicator (not directly comparable with numbers in previous reports), we reached 41.8% relative reduction in 2019, with 5.2% originating from efforts made in 2019. Most prominent among these were technical retrofits of our vessels, as well as optimisation of vessel operations and route planning.
Our longer-term ambition is to have net-zero CO emissions from our own operations in 2050. Committing to this target, we can and will be instrumental in driving the transformation of the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuels.
To decarbonise, we work in three tracks: Technological innovation, market development and framework conditions.
Technology ­ explore new fuel and supply chain solutions: We will co-develop decarbonised fuel types and sustainable fuel solutions foremost with energy providers but also technology developers, researchers, investors and other shipping companies and logistics providers.

We aim to multiply the benefits of trade by reducing complexity and empowering small businesses to trade · TradeLens is set to include more than half
of global container volume data · Launched Twill in 154 countries · Provided online training to women entre-
preneurs in SheTrades from more than 30 countries
We have a firm commitment to responsible business practices · Registered zero facilitation payments on
our own vessels · Carried out safety training for top 90 senior
leaders in Maersk · Launched an updated Maersk Code of Conduct
for employees · Launched an updated Supplier Code of Conduct

· In 2019, we mapped available pathways and possible technologies for carbon neutral shipping. For this project we collaborated with Lloyds Register, University Maritime Advisory Services and DTU, Danish Technical University of Denmark. It resulted in the development of three working hypotheses for the fuels of the future: alcohol (ethanol and methanol). biomethane and ammonia.

· We established the LEO coalition, to develop a new biofuel based on lignin and ethanol, in collaboration with one other shipowner, several customers and scientific institutions.
Towards 2023, we will primarily invest in developing fuel solutions within each of the three future fuels, because to meet the deadline of a commercially viable net-zero vessel at sea by 2030, we

must proactively pursue the most likely options found at this stage. Our door remains open to other ideas and options, however.
Market ­ accelerate demand: In close collaboration with customers, scientific institutions and certification bodies, we brought the use of biofuels in shipping to a new level in 2019. We were particularly pleased to partner with our customers on these efforts to develop the market: · We piloted a biofuel made from used cooking oil
on a Triple-E vessel from Rotterdam to Shanghai. The project was carried out in collaboration with a group of global companies in the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition. · Following the successful conclusion of the pilot, we launched the Maersk ECO Delivery ocean product, where the carbon footprint of cargo transported under this name will be neutralised through use of biofuels in the Maersk network.
Policies ­ collaborate for best possible framework conditions: We will use our leverage to push for legislators and governing bodies to develop and implement policies that drive development towards carbon-neutral societies.
· In 2019, Maersk was a founding member of the Getting to Zero Coalition, whose 100-plus members are senior leaders from across the maritime, energy, infrastructure, and finance sectors. We will work with decision-makers from governments and intergovernmental organisations to ensure commercially viable net-zero vessels on the waters by 2030. The coalition will push for ambitious and relevant regulatory frameworks that support this transition and closes the competitiveness gap between CO emitting fuels and net-zero fuels.

Multiplying the benefits of trade
Enabling trade is core to our business strategy. The mission of Maersk is to connect and simplify supply chains to enable trade for our customers and for a growing world. In support of this mission, we are innovating the processes and products of global container logistics, and in broader terms, we are working to ensure that trade serves as a positive contributor to global and local development and growth.
Our approach focuses on solutions that can benefit all but will particularly benefit small and mediumsized businesses. They constitute the majority of all companies in the world, and yet the system of trade in its current form has barriers to their participation that are hard to overcome.
Our strategy includes three commitments to be achieved by 2025. They target challenges in the trade environment and aim for simplified and more inclusive trade:
1. Connect 50% of global containerised trade to digital solutions that reduce supply chain barriers. Digitising global trade can help remove friction in global supply chains and barriers to trade more generally. This can create new growth. A World Economic Forum report on enabling trade estimates that it could create more than 20 million new jobs each year. Through the TradeLens platform, which we co-developed with IBM, we help lower the barriers preventing smaller companies from participating in international trade. For TradeLens to deliver on this promise, a significant share of the logistics community needs to be included on the platform. At the end of 2019, a total of 95 container terminals were connected to TradeLens, and ocean carriers representing

29

A.P. Moller - Maersk Annual Report 2019

Directors' report

Our business

Sustainability

more than half of global container trade, as well as 15 customs authorities had committed to joining the TradeLens network.
2. Help connect 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses, including women-operated businesses, to international trade by 2025. SMEs make up 95% of all companies and offer two-thirds of all jobs. They are, however, underrepresented in trade and have lower access to global markets. By simplifying participation in global trade, we can reduce barriers and enable the creation of more jobs. On 1 January 2020, our platform Twill to connect SMEs to global trade launched in 154 countries. We also support capacity building on trade, most prominently in the International Trade Centre's project SheTrades. By the end of 2019, we had helped connect 8,000 small and medium-sized businesses to international trade.
3. Contribute to trade facilitation reforms in 30 developing countries by 2025. The WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement pushes for global trade facilitation reform to make trade cheaper, faster and more inclusive through the removal of informal barriers to trade: outdated administrative systems, lack of infrastructure, etc. By the end of 2019, through our participation in the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, we had participated in nine such efforts, in Colombia, Brazil, Morocco, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
Changing the ship recycling industry
We remain committed to our programme, which aims to change the ship recycling industry. We work with selected yards in Alang, India, and in 2019, we sent four vessels for recycling in Alang, using four different yards. We continue to see the

same standard when we recycle in India as we do when we recycle in Turkey and China, as documented in third-party audits.
A critical point for the Alang yards' continued interest in investing in sustainability is the prospect of being included in the EU's list of approved ship recycling facilities, which is updated every six months. Several yards are in process for approval. This process was not concluded by the end of 2019.
We continue as active members of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI) in support of its mission to accelerate a voluntary marketdriven approach to responsible ship recycling practices. The SRTI works through an online platform for sharing information on ship recycling. Shipowners submit data on their approaches to ship recycling to the platform. Cargo owners and financial stakeholders can use this data to make more informed decisions.
Halving food loss
Investing in unbroken cold chain offerings is an important growth opportunity for our business on land. At sea, we already carry 27% of the world's refrigerated containers and 25% of the world's food commodities. As our cold chain business grows, we can leverage our services, products and capabilities to contribute to halving food loss during transportation, in support of a more sustainable global food system and local economic development.
We have established a partnership with the World Resources Institute (WRI), and in 2019 we worked on developing metrics for measuring food loss, to allow us to systematically measure how much food is lost where and why.

As part of this work, three pilot projects were carried out to quantify the amount and causes of food losses that occur during handling and storage between the farm and the freighter. The pilots are set to identify possible solutions to reduce those losses, and candidates currently include improved handling processes, introduction of cold storage technologies and better logistics management. Scheduled for completion in early 2020, the pilots follow citrus fruits in South Africa, avocados in Kenya, and grapes in Peru.
Responsible business practices
Responsible behaviour is part of our core values, and customers, suppliers, business partners and governments all expect us to conduct our business in a responsible manner. In 2019, we launched an employee Code of Conduct, which now forms the basis of all actions and activities carried out in our name.
In recent years, we have worked to align systems and procedures as we have transformed from a conglomerate to a one company structure. As part of our compliance work on anti-corruption, competition law and foreign trade controls, we appointed 61 volunteer Business Compliance Ambassadors to serve as advisors on the ground to cover over 70 countries that are exposed to an environment with high-corruption risk.
We began implementation of our Safety Differently strategy, where activities within leadership, culture and capacity building are set to create an organisation resilient towards severe impacts from accidents. Very sadly in 2019, we suffered five fatalities in our operations, indicating that there is much more for us to do, to learn and to improve in addressing our workplace risks.

As our business expands on land with a larger share of subcontractors and labour hired through third parties, our values and commitments lead us to investigate how we manage societal impacts and responsibility issues in the inland supply chain. This is also what our customers and stakeholders increasingly expect us to do. We are conducting studies to better understand these issues and how our Responsible Procurement programme can cater for these as well as potential for collaboration with customers on mitigating impacts in selected areas, e.g. we are participating in external collaboration to mitigate the risks for people working in the trucking business.
Integrating sustainability into the business
Over the past two years, we have worked to incorporate sustainability into our commercial and operations departments, making sustainability a much more integrated part of decision-making, discussions with customers and day-to-day business. We took an additional step in this direction at the end of 2019, as we incorporated our shared value commitments further into our business. We have an unchanged sustainability agenda in both scope and ambition level, and with this further integration we aim to ensure that sustainability is a fundamental and inseparable part of how we do business.

ALL THE WAY
Keeping cool in a hot market
COLD CHAIN LOGISTICS | To address a vital need in global trade, A.P. Moller - Maersk is developing an integrated cold chain offering that will reduce food waste, minimise complexity for customers and put the business in an even stronger position to tap into the high-growth market for perishable goods.

Whether you are transporting fruits, fish or medicine, getting delicate, temperature-sensitive goods to market is a long, complicated and often wasteful journey.
Importing and exporting fresh and frozen products involves multiple players with very diverse offerings. Global cold chains are so fragmented that companies, big and small, experience frustrating inefficiencies in the physical movement of goods. The coordination efforts are complex with many handovers and little transparency that ultimately lead to waste of both time and some of the goods being transported.

Keeping cool in a hot market

Maersk's response to these customer challenges is the development of an integrated cold chain logistics offering. The ambition is to close major gaps in the supply chain and connect it through integrated end-to-end cold chain solutions that reduce cost and waste, explained Katharina Poehlmann, Global Head of Cold Chain Logistics at Maersk:
"We are creating a one-stop shop that minimises the number of parties our customers need to deal with and delivers a consistent, high-quality value proposition and customer experience," she said.
Building on leading position
Moving one in four refrigerated containers ­ commonly known as `reefers' ­ globally, Maersk is building its cold chain offering from a position of strength. Despite a modest short-term outlook for trade growth, Maersk expects global reefer volumes to continue to significantly outgrow the dry container market in the coming years. As this

projection only covers the oceanside of the cold chain, the total market represents a big opportunity for not only the Ocean business but also Logistics & Services.
"The potential in cold chain logistics really embodies what the global integrator strategy is all about. As one service provider, we can deliver differentiating value to the customers and enable them to grow their businesses," explained Poehlmann.
To this end, experts across Maersk are coming together to enable a truly integrated offering. To name a few, APM Terminals is accelerating cargo flows and contributing to more visibility with intelligent use of data. Hamburg Süd and Sealand have extensive reefer insights, strong customer relationships and fast ocean connections on key reefer trade routes which allow tailor made offerings. Inland Services, an offering originating from APM Terminals and going to market under the Maersk

brand as of August 2019, has built several cold stores and developed local, integrated customer solutions, which are being integrated into the endto-end proposition.
In addition, Maersk's assets make the value proposition stand out in the market, for instance with the ability to prioritise equipment and slots on the vessels, and to provide cold storage at critical points of customers' supply chains.
Making cold chains unbreakable
In many markets, cold storage providers operate very locally. Customers therefore must engage with several providers across geographies and the many handovers cause breaks in the cold chain.
To close this gap in these markets, Maersk is investing in more and better storage options that will establish unbroken, connected cold chains from farm to supermarket. These facilities enable customers to store the produce closer to consumers, provide access to special capabilities such as blast freezing, boxing, repacking and labelling, and create the ability to balance supply and demand over time.

"The potential in cold chain logistics really embodies what the global integrator strategy is all about. As one service provider, we can deliver differentiating value to the customers and enable them to grow their businesses."

Today, Maersk operates cold stores in several regions and the footprint is growing with numerous development projects ongoing across the globe.
"While our immediate focus is on regions that need quality storage here and now, our long-term ambition is to have a global footprint that can meet customers' need for high-quality capacity on a global scale," added Poehlmann.

Katharina Poehlmann, Global Head of Cold Chain Logistics at Maersk

The growth plan is being realised through a mix of acquisitions, greenfield investments and expansion of existing facilities. The next cold store to join Maersk's network in 2020 is located in

Seamless cold chain keeps citrus fresh across continents
For the past seasons, Moroccan shippers have faced major challenges in managing the supply chain when exporting fresh produce to Russia. Particularly, heavy penalty charges and significant delays from additional customs inspections have jeopardised reliability, quality and ultimately the selling price of the cargo.
Maersk has designed an integrated Cold Chain Management solution to address these customer pains in several ways. "We are taking responsibility for a seamless execution of all logistics services end-to-end, such as Intermodal, Ocean, Customs House Brokerage, Phytosanitary and Cold Storage, thus ensuring that the cargo arrives on time and in perfect condition," says Katharina Poehlmann.
With increased visibility, the solution is enabling customers to not only deliver their cargo fresh at the final destination in Russia, but also to control and make informed decisions during the journey to achieve the best possible market price ­ while preventing food loss.

St. Petersburg, Russia. 40% of the 23,700-square metre facility will be dedicated to Fyffes, Europe's leading banana importer and a Maersk customer, while the remaining capacity will help meet the high demands for storing and distribution of fish, meat, as well as fruit and vegetables across Russia.
Technology increases transparency
The integrated cold chain offering is based on the latest digital innovations and reefer technology that are enabling increased transparency for customers, both inside and outside the container.
One of the technologies is Remote Container Management (RCM) that creates end-to-end visibility of the conditions inside the box. Since the launch in

2017, more than 3,600 companies have signed up for RCM technology and 97% of Maersk's combined pool of more than 380,000 refrigerated containers (reefers) are supported by the technology.
With the introduction of a virtual assistant, Captain Peter, in late 2019, customer experience will become even better. The AI-enabled avatar will assist customers along the cargo journey by keeping an eye on the container's temperature, humidity, and CO levels.
Wiskerke Onions has been one of the key customers involved in the development of Captain Peter. The increased visibility makes a business-critical difference to the Dutch onion exporter:

"I choose Maersk and Captain Peter over others because I can see what is happening with my cargo. It takes months to grow onions and they can't be easily replaced if they spoil during transport."
Chayenne Wiskerke, CEO of Wiskerke Onions

"I choose Maersk and Captain Peter over others because I can see what is happening with my cargo. It takes months to grow onions and they can't be easily replaced if they spoil during transport. The full visibility on the conditions in the container is an additional "insurance" that our cargo will make it to its destination in perfect condition," said Chayenne Wiskerke, CEO of Wiskerke Onions.

Cargo visibility is also improving outside the container. For instance, a newly formed partnership with JDA on advanced warehouse management systems brings full visibility to cold storage facilities. The data transparency allows customers to sharpen their operations by improving processes and lowering inventory costs.

Reefer manufacturing in focus
In 2019, Maersk Container Industry decided to focus the business on its reefer manufacturing and cold chain technology. The launch of Sekstant, a reefer digitisation service, will further enhance transparency on container conditions for customers, offering realtime data, monitoring and reporting systems, and seamless fleet management from anywhere in the world.

Risk management
Risk management at Maersk is strategically focused and designed to contribute to the achievement of the company's business objectives in the medium term and to ensure the longevity of the company in the longer term.
Transforming Maersk to become the global integrator of container logistics is a complex process, which carries multiple risks. It is essential that risks associated with the transformation and risks inherent to our business activities are managed well to keep the potential financial and reputational impact of such risks within acceptable levels.

Risk identification
Risks are continuously identified and reported using uniform templates and tools

Risk monitoring
Development of key risks and mitigation actions are
monitored by risk deepdives and reporting

A.P. Moller - Maersk risk management
process

Risk assessment
Identified risks are analysed and assessed to determine triggers, impact and likelihood

Risk mitigation
Risk mitigation action plans are prepared and implemented across the affected businesses

Risk recording
Key risks are established, prioritised and documented, and risk owners are appointed

Effective risk management is key to growing sustainably in an increasingly volatile and uncertain business. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing risk management. The Board of Directors determines the framework for management of risks, including risk appetite. The Audit Committee monitors the execution of the risk management processes and the management of key risks. The Executive Board is responsible for overseeing day-to-day risk management.
Risk management process
Each year, the Executive Leadership Team decides the key risks to the business plan. In preparation for the discussion in the Executive Leadership Team a comprehensive risk assessment takes place.
The Executive Leadership Team appoints a risk owner (an Executive Leadership Team member) for each key risk to oversee the management of the risk, including the preparation and execution of mitigation action plans. Once the plans for the management of the risks are finalised, the risk owner presents and discusses such plans with the Executive Leadership Team and the Audit Committee in designated risk deep-dive sessions.
The risk management function monitors the status of each key risk, including the progress and effect of the mitigation action plans, and summarises the status in quarterly reports to the Executive Leadership Team. Where the progress of mitigating actions is falling behind schedule, or where mitigating actions are not achieving the effect they were designed to have, the report will highlight this, so that corrective action can be taken.
The latest risk assessment was carried out in H2 2019. It identified 10 key risks that may have a significant impact on the business plan, including

on earnings, financial position and achievement of other strategic objectives. It also identified key emerging risks that look beyond the business planning period and are threats to the business value drivers
The Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The outbreak of the COVID-19 in China introduces additional challenges and risks to Maersk's operations. Maersk has already undertaken specific measures to ensure the health and safety of its employees globally. In addition to human risk, the outbreak of the virus also poses an economic risk to Maersk's operations and its trade volumes.
Fear of the virus and the efforts to prevent its spread will see an increasing pressure on the supply-demand balance. It is expected that the COVID-19 could dampen 2020 volumes, due to the extension of the Chinese New Year holidays and emergency measures to curb the spread of the virus. It is still early days to measure the overall impact, however, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport. Also, the outbreak has led to delays in opening of Chinese shipping yards following the Chinese New Year holidays, which has delayed yard works planned, including some planned installations of scrubbers on Maersk vessels.

1 Failure of Ocean strategy Risk description The Ocean business remains volatile and there is a need to de-commoditise it to stabilise earnings. De-commoditising the Ocean business is a prerequisite for generating the earnings required to fund the transformation of the company and delivering on the integrator strategy.
2020 Risk assessment In order for the Ocean business to be stable it must be de-commoditised. In the current state of the container liner industry, most players are price takers almost entirely dependent on supply and demand. There is a need to differentiate Maersk's Ocean business by providing added value propositions to customers through development of different Ocean products.
Mitigation strategies Maersk pursues a strategy of de-commoditisation of the Ocean business through Maersk Spot and other Ocean products in combination with modest volume growth and CAPEX discipline.

2 Failure to implement IMO 2020 strategy for mitigating cost impact
Risk description The existing compliant fuels, and new fuels developed to comply with IMO 2020 regulation, cost more than HSFO bunkers, implying fuel cost increases in 2020. Alternative compliance methods, like scrubbers, will enable the use of high-sulphur fuels at a lower cost but requires additional CAPEX.
In the short term, the risk is that Maersk will not be able to recover the additional cost from its customers.
2020 Risk assessment The impact of the risk will depend on the extent to which: · a price spread exists between high sulphur-fuels
and compliant fuels, · competitors have more cost effective compliance
strategies than Maersk, · IMO 2020 enforcement may allow some com-
petitors to avoid the higher fuel bill, and · demand-supply balance makes recovery of the
added cost difficult.

Compared to 2019, the risk has reduced as competitors seem to have prepared for compliance. There is a strong push for enforcement through levy of dissuasive fines and tendered contracts are being concluded with new bunker adjustment factor clauses.

Mitigation strategies Maersk seeks to recover the added cost of low sulphur fuel from customers and has a strategy for mitigating the cost through a mix of various initiatives such as installation of scrubbers on selected vessels and increased fuel efficiency.

3 Losing cost discipline in Ocean as Maersk implements the integrator strategy
Risk description Remaining competitive and generating the earnings required to fund the transformation and deliver on the integrator strategy requires strict focus on costs in Maersk's Ocean business. Maersk must not lose focus on cost leadership as it implements its integrator strategy.
2020 Risk assessment Transforming into a global integrator of container logistics requires additional focus to build land-based products and become a customer led organisation. This might entail some dilemmas in the Ocean business, including in respect of cost excellence, as the product offering broadens and flexibility towards customers is required. Careful balancing will be needed.
Mitigation strategies Maersk has reorganised the company to gather responsibility for Ocean and Logistics & Services, including for commercial and operational aspects under one leadership. This enables a balanced and holistic decision-making in respect of transforming and performing at the same time. Furthermore, a multi-year cost excellence programme including moving to zero-based budgeting has been introduced to ensure a dynamic adoption of the cost base in the transforming business.

4 Being hit by a major cyber-attack Risk description As Maersk becomes increasingly digitalised, more devices and control systems are connected online resulting in a wider surface across the Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure that could be compromised.
Should a successful cyber-attack materialise, the services that allow the organisation to continue to operate could be compromised resulting in operational disruption. Further, a cyber-attack could cause a data breach where sensitive, protected or confidential data held by Maersk is leaked or stolen.
2020 Risk assessment Following the cyber-attack in 2017, several measures to improve cyber security have been implemented with an enhanced security posture as a result. A cyber-attack causing operational disruption could still happen due to e.g. new malware outbreak not specifically targeted at Maersk, a targeted attack on one or more brands within Maersk, a disgruntled employee or malicious third-party contractor, or an accidental employee action.
Mitigation strategies Improving and strengthening cyber security is a strategic priority for Maersk and this includes execution of a comprehensive cyber security plan, a three-level assurance model to maintain oversight and obtain confidence that the communicated level of cyber capability is reflective of reality, implementation of business continuity plans, and purchase of cyber risk insurance.
Full implementation of the cyber security plan is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

5 Failure to build a strong Logistics & Services business in the coming years
Risk description A cornerstone in Maersk's strategy is to expand its product offering to the customers into land-based Logistics & Services products to further diversify the overall business and earnings. The risk is that Maersk fails to translate its Logistics & Services strategy into a profitable long-term business.
2020 Risk assessment By consolidating its Logistics & Services activities, Maersk has a focused platform to offer customers products covering the end-to-end supply chain. Achieving profitable Logistics & Services growth calls for capable core business processes and digital platforms, strong capabilities in the frontline to sell the new products, and the ability to counter competing automated supply chain management platforms.
Mitigation strategies The main mitigating strategies pursued are to build a global, competitive end-to-end product portfolio, integrate those products and services at a data, operational and strategic level to fit customer needs, and establish a global sales team with the knowledge necessary to sell the whole Maersk portfolio from a vertical perspective.
A new function is being established to assess, design and implement changes related to products, processes and master data throughout the business.

6 Being hit by a large compliance case Risk description It is imperative for Maersk to conduct its business in compliance with legislation and regulatory standards. The risk is that Maersk is hit by a major compliance case in respect of violations of anti-corruption laws and standards, competition/anti-trust regulations, or international sanctions imposed on countries, entities or individuals, resulting in enforcement action and/or commercial, reputational and other losses.
2020 Risk assessment In respect of corruption Maersk operates in high-risk geographies and high-risk sectors (e.g. the terminals and freight forwarding sectors). Maersk is the largest container carrier and in an industry with many industry cooperation agreements. Maersk thereby naturally has the attention of competition authorities globally. There is an increasing number of jurisdictions with competition laws in place as well as a growing confidence by emerging countries to enforce their competition laws against foreign companies. International sanctions are becoming increasingly widespread and complex and require comprehensive and extensive measures to ensure compliance.
Mitigation strategies Maersk has a robust compliance programme for anti-corruption, competition law and economic sanctions and export controls designed to fulfil the global requirements and many initiatives are in place to improve focus and emphasis on compliance awareness and training.
The compliance programme is built upon detailed risk assessment and based on that, Maersk has a comprehensive mitigation plan. Maersk has an adequate compliance function continuously strengthening the compliance programmes and the mitigating measures as well as advises the business in respect of measures to ensure compliance. Maersk also has a whistleblower hotline and other means of reporting as part of the compliance programme.

7 Failure to build the industry-leading technology platforms of the future
Risk description It is a strategic priority for Maersk to digitalise its business model by building the industry leading technology platforms of the future that shall address customer needs in a connected world and enable the company's growth. Such platforms must be effectively implemented and operated in order for Maersk to remain competitive in delivering value to customers.
2020 Risk assessment Whoever is in the front of adopting technological development will own the customer relationship. It is, therefore, important to secure a digitally based competitive advantage in Ocean and Logistics & Services. Freight forwarders, software companies, supply chain management platform companies, and other digital players are also advancing in this area. However, Maersk has the asset base and geographical footprint to effectively deliver fully integrated end-toend supply chain solutions tailored to the customer's needs.
Mitigation strategies Maersk is actively developing and investing in technology enabled business platforms. The platforms are already creating value for customers, and the development and investment continue to further improve the customer experience and integrate products in end-to-end supply chain solutions tailored to the customer's needs.

8 Failure to Implement end-to-end core processes in Ocean and Logistics & Services
Risk description To support the integrator strategy, Maersk needs to build end-to-end business processes in Ocean and Logistics & Services and modernise its legacy IT landscape to support such processes.
2020 Risk assessment The implementation of the integrator strategy depends on core business processes and IT landscapes that are fit for that purpose. In order to reap the benefits from technology, the end-to-end business processes need to be adequately designed, consistently performed and seamlessly supported by IT.
Mitigation strategies Maersk has launched a programme for modernising its legacy IT-landscape to establish a platform and solution for performance of end-to-end business processes.
A new function has been established to assess, design and implement changes related to products, processes and master data.

9 Failure to sustainably complete the transformation of APM Terminals

10 Lack of organisational capabilities to drive the strategy implementation

Risk description Successfully completing the transformation of APM Terminals is strategically important for Maersk. APM Terminals is important in terms of reaching a balance in Maersk's overall business by 2023 as Logistics & Services and contributes to funding Maersk's overall transformation.
2020 Risk assessment Key elements of the risk are that the terminals business is exposed to fluctuations in the global economy and global trade, several concession agreements expire and are up for renewal in the coming years, automation of terminals may require negotiation with unions and politicians, and APM Terminals has a large presence in and dependence on Latin America and West Africa.
Mitigation strategies In 2017, APM Terminals launched a transformation programme to become `The best in class terminal operator' and ensure a strong foundation for future growth. Significant progress has been made on the transformation till date, and the programme continues into the coming years.

Risk description The strategy to become a global integrator of container logistics requires new and different capabilities in terms of business knowledge, leadership and culture. Maersk needs to build the capabilities and culture required to transform its business and deliver on the integrator strategy, including the ambition to build a strong Logistics & Services business.
2020 Risk assessment Comprehensive culture and upskilling programmes were launched in 2018 and good progress was made during 2019 to strengthen leadership capabilities and embedding the culture across the organisation. Still, the transformation could be hampered or delayed by ineffective capability uplift related to leadership, commercial upskilling and inability to insource skills or build new ones, especially for executing the Logistics & Services strategy.
Mitigation strategies Actions were launched to upscale commercial skills and capabilities in cooperation with Maersk's Commercial Academy and through recruitments and acquisitions. New Maersk behaviours and an executive development programme have helped support culture and leadership. A plan is in place to further strengthen the Logistics & Services skills and equip the frontline with adequate capabilities to sell integrated and stand-alone Logistics & Services products.

Climate-related financial disclosure
This page provides an overview of our reporting in line with TCFD recommendations

The financial sector's increased focus on climate change has resulted in requests for companies to report publicly and comprehensively on climate change strategies and risk management. A reporting framework prepared by the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) currently determines best practice and reporting leadership. 2019 is the second year where Maersk voluntarily reports in accordance with the TCFD recommendations.
The framework requires reporting on both transition risks, understood as risks and opportunities from realigning the global economic system towards low-carbon or carbon neutral solutions, and the impacts on physical risks which are risks caused by changes in weather patterns.
Governance Climate-related risks and opportunities are part of Maersk's quarterly Enterprise Risk Management system reporting to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.
Furthermore, Maersk's transition work, including its CO reduction target and efforts to decarbonise logistics, is governed by a task force headed by a member of the Executive Leadership Team and ultimately owned by the Executive Leadership Team.
Strategy Maersk's strategy is to take leadership in decarbonising shipping. It is a high-profile low-CAPEX strategy, as it needs a full transition to new net-zero fuels. Especially the energy sector is needed to create these solutions, and therefore it is crucial to send a clear message to the actors that will develop the solutions that we as the end consumer are ready to collaborate to identify these fuels.

Furthermore, it is a key pillar of Maersk's strategy to involve its customers both as partners in R&D projects, but also to already now offer a differentiated net-zero ocean transportation product.
Finally, Maersk works proactively and in partnerships to make sure that the right policies will be in place to support the transition. More is described in the sustainability section on page 27 and in full in our Sustainability Report for 2019.
Risk management To protect business value from the risks caused by the physical impacts of climate change, Maersk performed a hot spot analysis in 2018, estimating the effect of five climate hazards (heat stress, floods, cyclones, water stress and sea level rise) on ports, other fixed assets and strategic commodities within a 2020­2040 timeframe.
Building on this, we took steps in 2019 to perform an economic analysis and engage with stakeholders in the Pearl River Delta in China, which was established as a hot spot. Maersk will finalise this analysis and report on it in 2020.
This work will be instrumental in constantly evolving Maersk's approach to manage physical risk from climate change in a way that is adequate given the increased challenges Maersk will see in the future.
Maersk's proactive engagement with customers, investors and lenders in relation to framework conditions for shipping is also part of managing the risk of encountering first mover disadvantages. New net-zero fuels will likely be more expensive than the current fuels, so for Maersk's vision of commercially viable net-zero vessels to be ready in 2030, it is crucial to get the right framework conditions in place. This is something Maersk both monitors closely and works proactively to ensure.

Metrics and targets Approximately two thirds of CO emissions are related to Maersk's business from its own operations (scope 1) and roughly 97% of these come from powering its fleet. Indirect emissions that occur in the value chain (scope 3) account for approx. one third, while indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (scope 2) are negligible. Consequently, Maersk focuses and measures its efforts on decarbonising the sector in which its vessels are deployed.
Maersk's target is to have net-zero CO emissions from its own operations by 2050. This will require a commercially viable vessel design to be on water in 2030. To decouple growth in volume from emissions, Maersk works towards a target of 60% reduction in CO emissions by 2030, compared to 2008. Targets for managing the physical impacts of climate change are not available yet.

Our crew moved largely the same amount of volumes as in 2018, but with a higher profitability than in 2018.

Ocean revenue was USD 28.4bn (USD 28.4bn) with a small decrease in volumes while EBITDA increased to USD 4.4bn (USD 3.8bn) reflecting a margin of 15.3%. The improvement in profitability was a result of commercial and operational decisions to focus on profitability through cargo selections and capacity management, combined with positive effects from lower fuel prices. The average freight rate was stable despite the weak global demand and decline in bunker price, while total operating costs decreased by 2.4% from improved scheduled reliability, higher utilisation and lower bunker cost.

Financial and operational performance
Revenue was USD 28.4bn (USD 28.4bn), with a slight decrease in volumes to 13,296k FFE (13,306k FFE) as a result of weaker market growth and initiatives to improve freight rates, which increased to 1,883 USD/FFE (1,879 USD/FFE), along with increases in other revenue, mainly due to VSA income.
EBITDA increased by 15% to USD 4.4bn (USD 3.8bn), driven by stable revenue and a lower cost base mainly due to lower a bunker price and consumption.

The EBITDA margin of 15.3% increased by 2.0 percentage points, as the cost base decreased, partly due to improved capacity management and efficiencies, resulting in better utilisation and schedule reliability, and partly the reduced bunker price. Container handling costs at 39% of the total cost base was in line with 2018, while bunker cost decreased by 1.5 percentage points to 19% of the total cost base. SG&A and other costs increased by 0.5 percentage points to 13% and network costs, excluding bunker, were slightly lower in 2018.

Volumes were barely unchanged at 13,296k FFE (13,306k FFE) and below the market growth of 1.4% due to decreases in East-West and North South trades partly offset by increase in volumes in the intra-Asia trades. The decrease in East-West was mainly due to lower volumes in North America from front loading particularly towards the end of 2018, combined with commercial and operational decisions affecting the volume growth to improve profitability. The decrease in North-South was mainly driven by the weak demand on Latin America and Oceania trades seen throughout 2019, partly offset by higher headhaul volumes in East and West Africa from Asia and Middle East. Total headhaul decreased by 0.3% mainly on Latin and North America, while total backhaul increased by 0.4%.

The average loaded freight rate increased by 0.2% to 1,883 USD/FFE (1,879 USD/FFE), driven by an increase of 1.3% on East-West supported by better capacity discipline. On North-South the average freight rates increased by 1.9% driven by backhaul increase in Latin America, partly offset mainly by lower headhaul rates in Oceania. The rate increases on East-West and North-South trades were partly offset by lower rates on intra-regional trades driven by a 5.8% decrease in intra-Asia rates. The average loaded freight rate was negatively affected by developments in foreign exchange rate, the bunker price change and mix effects from higher inter-regional and backhaul volumes. Adjusted for the foreign exchange rate effects the average loaded freight rate increased by 1.2%.
Freight revenue was USD 24.9bn (USD 24.9bn), while other revenue increased by 3.1% to USD 3.5bn (USD 3.4bn), mostly driven by higher slot sales and higher revenue in hub terminals.

Demurrage and detention income was lower, driven by temporary circumstances in Asia from amongst other congestions and front loadings in 2018.
Total operating costs decreased by 2.4% to USD 24.0bn (USD 24.6bn), positively impacted by lower bunker costs, favourable impact from development in foreign exchange rates and lower container related costs, partly offset by higher SG&A costs. Network costs excluding bunker costs decreased by 0.2%, mainly due to lower port, canal and time charter expenses, partly offset by higher VSA expenses. The improved capacity management, including increased productivity in hubs, resulted in lower hub and transhipment costs, and lower port costs due to reduced calls. Adjusting for the positive impact from the developments in foreign exchange rates, the operating costs decreased by 0.9%.

Unit cost at fixed bunker price was 1.7% below 2018 driven by improved opeUrnatitiocnoasltefficiencies leading to lower consumption and better bunker efficiency and positive effects from development in foreign exchange rates. Compared to 2018, the unit cost at fixed bunker decreased by 0.2% adjusted for the positive foreign exchange rate effects.

2019 Key initiatives
The buying process for the ocean products got simpler for customers with Maersk Spot, which allows them to move their cargo in a much simpler and more reliable way providing increased sailing visibility and loading guarantee at a fixed price upfront. End of Q4 2019, measured on a four-week average basis, Maersk Spot accounted for 24% of spot-rate volumes, more than double compared to end of Q3 2019.
Maersk became a founding member of the Getting to Zero Coalition announced at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in Q3. The coalition is a vehicle for decarbonising global shipping and energy value chains by 2050. Joining Maersk in the coalition are major companies across different industries. The ambition of the Getting to Zero Coalition is closely aligned with the initial greenhouse gas strategy for international shipping adopted by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO).
The preparation for IMO 2020 continued, and several vessels have been retrofitted with scrubber installations at the end of 2019. The scrubber solution is only part of the strategy to ensure compliance with the new fuel regulations.
Following successful product trial on Mette Maersk, Maersk ECO Delivery was launched in Q4. In line with its sustainability commitment as the global integrator of container logistics, Maersk is taking concrete steps towards carbon reduction to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through innovative technologies and solutions. Maersk ECO Delivery is among these solutions and offering it to the market cement our commitment by supporting supply chain customers who share the same sustainability agenda.

Ocean

Total unit cost decreased by 2.7% to 1,953 USD/ FFE (2,008 USD/FFE), driven by a decrease in fuel cost caused by a 6.7% lower consumption, driven by improved efficiencies from improved capacity management and impacted by a decreased average bunker price of 2.9%, equal to 12 USD/tonne. The combined effect of lower average prices and lower consumption resulted in a total bunker cost decrease of 9.4% to USD 4.6bn (USD 5.0bn). Out of the total decrease, USD 0.1bn was because of the lower average bunker price, with the remaining decrease due to lower consumption partly given a 6.9% improvement in bunker efficiency to 41.2 g/ TEU*NM (44.2 g/TEU*NM) compared to 2018.
Unit cost at fixed bunker decreased by 1.7% to 1,777 USD/FFE (1,808 USD/FFE), driven by improvements in operational efficiencies, including bunker efficiency, and impacted positively by development in foreign exchange rates. Adjusting for the positive impact from the developments in foreign exchange rates, the unit cost at fixed bunker decreased by 0.2%.

Hub terminals port moves per hour increased by 13.9% to 91.8 (80.6) due to significant improvements in most terminals driven by continued optimisation of operational synergies between the hub terminals and liner activities gradually materialising throughout the year. Port Said, Egypt, and Maasvlakte II, the Netherlands, improved the most in 2019.
The fleet consisted of 307 owned vessels and 401 chartered vessels at the end of 2019. The average nominal capacity increased by 0.4% at an average of 4,132k TEU (4,115k TEU) for the full year. The total fleet ended the year at 4,125k TEU with idle capacity of 348k TEU (35 vessels), an increase from 78k TEU (five vessels) at the end of 2018, mainly due to retrofit of scrubbers. The idle capacity corresponded to 25% of the total idle capacity in the market. No vessel newbuilds were delivered in H2 2019.

Logistics & Services

Logistics & Services reported an increase in gross profit to USD 1.2bn (USD 1.1bn), supported by intermodal and new warehousing facilities.

Logistics & Services reported revenue of USD 6.0bn (USD 6.1bn), driven by increasing revenue in warehousing and distribution, offset by decrease in the sea and air freight forwarding activity. Gross profit grew to USD 1.2bn (USD 1.1bn) reflecting a gross profit margin of 20% (18%) with margins improving throughout the year. The improvement was supported by growth in most of the strategic areas, including margin optimisation in intermodal and effects from new warehousing facilities, partially offset by lower margins in sea and air freight forwarding and inland services. EBITDA increased to USD 238m (USD 191m).
Volumes grew slightly in intermodal, due to a conscious decision to optimise in certain geographical locations. Volumes in supply chain management declined slightly, and sea and air freight forwarding, volumes were down, due to exit in certain countries and the front loading of volumes in 2018 ahead of tariffs between the USA and China.

Financial and operational performance
Revenue decreased by 1.9% to USD 6.0bn (USD 6.1bn), impacted by decreasing revenue in sea and air freight forwarding, partially offset by increasing revenue in warehousing and distribution. Gross profit increased by 8.7% to USD 1.2bn (USD 1.1bn) with a gross profit margin of 20% (18%), mainly supported by growth in most of the strategic areas and margin optimisation in intermodal and new warehouse facilities becoming operational in H2 2018. However, this was partially offset by lower margins in sea and air freight forwarding, as well as a decline in inland services and supply chain management. EBITDA increased by 24% to USD 238m (USD 191m), with an EBITDA margin

of 4.0% (3.1%), positively impacted by developments in gross profit and lower maintenance costs in Star Air, partly off-set by one-offs related to inland services in 2019.
Supply chain management revenue of USD 861m (USD 867m) was negatively impacted by margin pressure driven by difficult market conditions, with Asia exports being the most affected by the uncertainties related to trade restrictions between the USA and China, and impact from foreign exchange rate.

Inland activities revenue of USD 576m (USD 595m) was negatively impacted by lower revenue in India, Costa Rica, Chile and Mauritania due to decreasing volumes and lower rates. Gross profit decreased to USD 243m (USD 258m).
Sea freight forwarding revenue was USD 546m (USD 646m), due to a volume decrease of 9.7% to 577k TEU (639k TEU), related to the decision to exit certain countries, front loading of volumes in 2018 and negative impact from foreign exchange rate. Gross profit decreased to USD 86m (USD 115m), due to volume decline with margin deterioration by 18% to 148 USD/TEU (180 USD/TEU).

2019

The acquisition of the US based customs house broker Vandegrift in the beginning of 2019 expanded the Logistics & Services product portfolio as an addition to the endto-end services offering. The integration progressed on track with the product now being digitally offered in 23 countries.
The commercial organisations of Ocean and Logistics & Services merged in Q1, where one Maersk commercial frontline combined offers ocean products, supply chain services and value-added services. The changes involved employees in amongst others, sales and customer service functions to work in a new way, in new teams, with new customers and products, to ensure improved customer experience with fewer touchpoints and a more comprehensive service offering.
Long-term logistics services contracts were concluded with customers around the world, among which some of the largest e-commerce retailers expanding the customers' reach for multiple products and product add-ons.
Maersk and Syngenta extended their partnership by signing a new contract for a fourth-party logistics (4PL) concept, which is a key element of the strategy aimed at expanding in supply chain management solutions. The journey with Syngenta underpins the strategic transformation of Maersk into a true integrated container logistics provider.
The operational integration of APM Terminals Inland Services within the Logistics & Services organisation was successfully completed. Maersk made investments in visibility tools for its logistics products and secured longterm end-to-end logistics contracts around the world, integrating ocean with its logistics services.

Terminals & Towage

Crane operator in action at APM Terminals in Moin, Costa Rica. The new terminal helped drive results in gateway terminals.

Terminals & Towage reported an increase in revenue of 3.2% to USD 3.9bn (USD 3.8bn), and an increase in EBITDA of 11% to USD 1.1bn (USD 998m) with an EBITDA margin of 28.4% (26.5%).
The positive development in revenue and EBITDA in gateway terminals was driven by ramp-up of the new terminal in Moin, Costa Rica, higher volumes, higher storage income and reduction in SG&A. Volumes grew by 3.9%, supported by volume growth of 7.3% from external customers, partly offset by lower volume from the Ocean segment of 2.2%, driven by the divestment of Izmir, Turkey, and Kobe, Japan. Higher volumes in Towage were due to increased activities in the Americas and the Asia, Middle East and Africa region.
CAPEX in Terminals was USD 438m (USD 436m), with the largest investments being a terminal modernisation project in Los Angeles, USA, and equipment replacements. Lower CAPEX in Towage of USD 92m (USD 120m) was mainly due to less cash flow for assets under construction.

In North America, volumes grew by 9.9% primarily due to increase in external customer volume in Los Angeles. Africa and Middle East volume grew by 4.6%, supported by stable economic growth. In Europe, volumes decreased by 6.1% mainly driven by the divestment of Izmir in Q4 2018 and lower volumes in Barcelona, Spain. Asia decreased by 9.7%, mainly driven by the exit from Kobe and lower volumes in Mumbai, India.

Terminals & Towage segment Terminals & Towage includes gateway terminals involving landside activities (being port activities where the customers are mainly the carriers), and towage services under the Svitzer brand.
Terminal towage is a one-customer operation. The customer is a port, a terminal or owner of an offshore facility. The contract is for specific vessels, and the customer determines which work the vessel performs. The annualised EBITDA per tug measure is the relevant measurement.
Harbour towage is a multi-customer operation in a common user facility. The customers are vessel owners and operators, either contracted for one to three years or booked call-by-call. The number of operational tug jobs (utilisation) is the relevant measurement.

Volume from the Ocean segment decreased by 2.2% (increased by 1.1% like-for-like) and volume from external customers grew by 7.3% (3.2% likefor-like). The estimated market volumes growth was 1.4%.
Utilisation at 80% (73%) was mainly due to rampup of Moin, and volume growth and temporary capacity reduction in Los Angeles. On an equityweighted basis, volume grew by 4.7% (3.7% likefor-like) and utilisation was 85% (79%).
Revenue per move increased by 4.3% to USD 263 (USD 252), driven by Moin, higher storage income in West Africa and Latin America and higher volumes in North America where rates are higher on average. This was partly offset by negative EUR foreign exchange rate impact. Adjusted for foreign exchange rate, volume mix effects and portfolio changes, revenue per move increased by 0.1%. The

volume mix effect relates to impact on revenue per move from changes in the share of volumes from terminals in different geographic locations.
Cost per move increased by 0.7% to USD 212 (USD 211), mainly driven by higher volumes in Americas, where costs are higher on average. The benefits of several cost reduction initiatives offset part of the inflationary labour cost in several terminals. Adjusted for foreign exchange rates, volume mix effects and portfolio changes, cost per move decreased by 1.4%.
The EBITDA margin increased by 2.7 percentage points in Africa and Middle East, mainly due to

higher storage revenue in the West African terminals. In Americas, the EBITDA margin increased by 2.0 percentage points, driven by ramp-up of Moin and higher volumes, partially offset by higher cost in North America. The EBITDA margin decreased by 2.9 percentage points in Europe, driven by divestment of Izmir and lower volumes. In Asia, the EBITDA margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points due to lower volumes in Mumbai and the exit from Kobe.
Results from joint ventures and associated companies
Equity-weighted EBITDA, which includes the EBITDA weighted on terminal ownership percentages of all entities (subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates) increased by 15% to USD 1.3bn (USD 1.2bn).
The share of profit in joint ventures and associated companies of USD 185m (USD 158m) was positively impacted by higher revenue in associated terminals in Africa and Middle East, supported by ramp-up of Tema. Cash contribution from joint ventures and associated companies from dividends was USD 187m (USD 189m).

Financial and operational performance
Revenue from towage activities amounted to USD 695m (USD 692m), positively impacted by increases in the Americas of USD 13m and in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region of USD 14m, partly offset by decreases in Australia of USD 20m and in Europe of USD 4m. Revenue growth adjusted for foreign exchange rate developments was 4.7%.
Harbour towage activities measured by the number of tug jobs increased by 2.9% compared to 2018, mainly driven by increased activity in the Americas and the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. For terminal towage, annualised EBITDA per tugboat remained on par with 2018 with a positive impact from new contracts entered in 2018, offset by negative foreign exchange rate impact.

Volumes in Australia decreased due to lower commodity exports and decreased market share for harbour towage in competitive ports.
Activity in Europe decreased slightly, and Svitzer's market share for harbour towage in competitive ports was negatively impacted by more intense competition from consolidation amongst towage providers and increasing supply of tugboats leading to lower volumes and utilisation.
In the Americas, activity in Brazil increased, mainly driven by new customers in ports entered during 2018 and additional volumes and market share in the ports entered in 2017. Also, the Caribbean joint venture was awarded a new contract in Saint Croix, USA, with start by mid-2019. The terminal towage activities ramped up in Costa Rica where operations partially commenced in 2018.

In the Asia, Middle East and Africa region, activity measured by revenue increased by 15% with towage operations ramping up in Tangier-Med II and in Monrovia, Liberia, as well as Bangladesh reaching full operations in 2019.
CAPEX was reduced by USD 28m to USD 92m (USD 120m), mainly impacted by lower cash outflow for assets under construction in 2019. Towage sold nine vessels with a cash flow impact of USD 7m in 2019.

Key initiatives

2019

Towage activities have been positively impacted by further cooperation with other Maersk businesses during 2019. These synergies have contributed to securing contracts in Monrovia, Liberia, and in Antwerp, Belgium.

Equity weighted EBITDA, which includes the EBITDA weighted on activities ownership percentage of all entities (subsidiaries and associated companies) decreased by 10% to USD 226m (USD 251m).
The market
Activity levels in the harbour towage markets remained stable. For harbour towage in Europe, consolidation in the industry persists, leading to stronger competitors and more intense competition. In Australia, a new competitor started up by the end of 2018, which increases competition.
The strategic focus is still to improve cost levels and productivity, while utilising and expanding the global footprint to ensure closer cooperation with targeted customers. Only few terminal towage projects were awarded in the market during 2019, but several new projects are under preparation and expected to be awarded during 2020 and 2021.

Manufacturing & Others' revenue decreased to USD 2.2bn (USD 2.8bn) while EBITDA increased to USD 205m (USD 163m).
In January, Maersk Container Industry announced to focus on growing the reefer business and exit the dry container business, including the manufacturing in Dongguan, China, impacting both revenue and EBITDA. Maersk Container Industry now focuses solely on the design, manufacture and service of reefer technology.
Maersk Supply Service ensured important contract wins, and extensions were secured in all five core geographic regions: North America, Europe, West Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, ensuring utilisation of vessels and resulting in increased backlog.

Financial and operational performance
Maersk Container Industry reported revenue of USD 586m (USD 978m) and EBITDA of USD 29m (USD 40m). The reduction in revenue was a result of exiting the dry container business in January 2019. EBITDA is negatively impacted by closing the factory with USD 31m in restructuring costs and the exit of the dry container business in general.
In 2019, the volume of Star Cool Integrated, Star Cool Units and Reefer Boxes was 41,580 (47,932). The reduction in production was a direct result of the contraction in overall market demand in 2019. The total demand from Maersk was at 36% (39%).

Despite the reduction in revenue, Maersk Container Industry expanded the EBITDA margin by 0.8 percentage points to 4.9% (4.1%), a result of the elimination of low-margin dry containers and cost control. The EBITDA margin for the continuing business of reefers exceeded 11%.

Maersk Supply Service was awarded contracts in the solutions areas, demonstrating the value of the strategic direction of offering solutions work and diversifying into new markets, thereby achieving a revenue backlog that was 6.5% higher than in 2018.

Maersk Supply Service reported a 16% increase in revenue to USD 306m (USD 263m), and an EBITDA of USD 28m (USD 3m) reflecting higher rates and utilisation. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 188m (USD 342m) due to payments of two (four) newbuildings concluding the newbuilding programme.

The activities in Others reported a revenue of USD 1.3bn (USD 1.5bn), impacted by the divestment of bulk activities originally acquired from Hamburg Süd. Revenue in Maersk Oil Trading was USD 797m (USD 769m). EBITDA in Others was USD 149m (USD 119m).

The Annual Wheel ensures that all relevant topics are covered during the year, e.g. strategy, people and capabilities, transparency, and compliance and risk.
Board evaluation
During September 2019, an externally facilitated Board evaluation process was conducted, among others covering the cooperation between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, the Chairman's role, the Board's and Board committees' work and an assessment of Board capabilities relative to those best supporting the company's strategy. All members of the Board of Directors participated in the evaluation and provided input via questionnaires, thus forming the basis of a comprehensive evaluation report. The results were discussed in plenary sessions by the Board of Directors and agreed improvements were implemented.

The main conclusions and outcomes of the board evaluation were:
The Board's work has undergone a positive development in 2018-2019 by improving dynamics, engagement and the level of challenges and sparring offered by and among the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The Board evaluation confirmed the alignment on the top strategic issues and continued focus on priorities and transparency.
The results and conclusions from the annual Board evaluation form the basis for the Nomination Committee's considerations and continued search for future candidates to the Board of Directors.
Core values
Constant Care Take care of today, actively prepare for tomorrow
Humbleness Listen, learn, share, give space to others

Board composition
Based on the strategy to move from a conglomerate to a focused transportation and logistics company, the Board initiated a process to define the Board composition of the future. As part of the Board Evaluation 2018, key competencies and areas of experience and expertise required on the Board were identified to be: Shipping, transport and logistics, IT/digital/tech and e-commerce, business transformation, innovation and entrepreneurship, asset-heavy industries, finance and accounting, risk management, global leadership, and board service in stock listed companies.
Consequently, the Nomination Committee initiated a search for Board candidates with relevant additional competencies to complete the Board's overall, collective capabilities. At the Annual General Meeting in 2019, Bernard L. Bot and Marc Engel were elected members of the Board of Directors bringing competencies within global transport and logistics.
Diversity
When assessing the composition of the Board, the Nomination Committee also considers diversity and setting of the target for the underrepresented gender on the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 139c of the Danish Companies Act. In 2015 a target for the underrepresented gender on the Board of Directors was set. Three female Board members elected by the general meeting if the Board consists of less than 12 members and four female Board members elected by the general meeting if the Board consists of 12 or more members. The target was not met by end 2019 as the Board consists of 10 members of which only

two were female. The Board's primary focus when deciding on the composition of the Board was to ensure the capabilities necessary for a successful transformation of the company to become the global integrator of container logistics. At the time of the search for new Board candidates, it was not possible to match the competencies needed with the available female candidates. The company keeps focus on driving diversity both on managerial levels and on the Board.
As the target is still considered ambitious and realistic for the company, the Board has decided to adopt the same target for the next period, with a deadline end 2023, but will continuously assess whether the target is still ambitious.
Further information on diversity can be found in the company's Sustainability report.
Recommendations for corporate governance
As a Danish listed company, A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S must comply with or explain deviations from the "Recommendations for Corporate Governance" implemented by Nasdaq Copenhagen in the Rules for issuers of shares and Section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The Board of Directors has prepared a statement on corporate governance for the financial year 2019. This statement includes a description of the company's approach to the recommendations in the "Recommendations for Corporate Governance". Reporting on compliance with the Corporate Governance recommendations can be found on https://investor.maersk.com/corporate-governance

The main elements of the company's internal control and risk management systems in connection with its financial reporting
The company's risk management and internal controls in connection with its financial reporting are planned to reduce the risk of errors and omissions in the financial reporting.
Control environment
The Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Executive Board regularly assess material risks and internal controls in connection with the company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee has a supervisory responsibility and reports to the entire Board of Directors. The responsibility for the everyday maintenance of an efficient control environment in connection with the financial reporting rests with the Executive Board. The managements of the brands and business units are responsible for ensuring an efficient control environment for the respective brand or business unit.
Based on the applicable rules and regulations, the Board of Directors and the Executive Board prepare and approve the general policies, procedures, and controls in significant areas in connection with the company's financial reporting.
The starting point is a clear organisational structure, clear chains of command, authorisation and certification procedures, and segregation of duties as well as adequate accounting and consolidation systems, including validation controls.
In addition, the company has set up policies, manuals and procedures within relevant areas in connection with its financial reporting. The policies, manuals and procedures are updated on an ongoing basis.

Risk assessment and management
At least once a year, as part of the risk assessment, the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Executive Board undertake a general identification and assessment of risks in connection with the financial reporting, including the risk of fraud, and consider measures to be implemented to reduce or eliminate such risks.
Decisions on measures to reduce or eliminate risks are based on an assessment of materiality and probability of errors and omissions.
Control activities
Specific control activities have been defined for each significant brand and business unit.
The performance of such control activities is monitored on brand and business unit as well as on corporate level. This monitoring includes controller reports with follow-up on findings and recommendations as well as an annual statement of representation from management of the most significant brands and business units.
Information and communication
The Board of Directors is overall responsible for the company having information and reporting systems in place to ensure that its financial reporting is in conformity with rules and regulations. For this purpose, the company has set out detailed requirements in policies, manuals and procedures, and a global consolidation system with related reporting instructions has been implemented. Also, risk and control catalogues have been established and collated for all significant brands and business units as well as for corporate functions.

Remuneration

Remuneration
As A.P. Moller - Maersk progresses towards its vision of becoming the global integrator of container logistics, remuneration continues to be one of the key enablers in supporting the attraction, motivation and retention of high-calibre talent.

The Remuneration Policy supports the business needs by enabling an appropriate total remuneration package that has a clear link to business strategy and aligns with shareholder interests. The objectives of the Remuneration Policy are to: · Ensure appropriate total remuneration: The
remuneration design and decisions are guided by market practice in Europe, reflected in the remuneration components offered, and the total remuneration value provided. · Link to business strategy: The Remuneration Policy supports the business plan and the need for executive leaders to focus on delivering an on-going progress to achieve the company's strategic goals, reflected in a combination of short and long-term incentive components. · Align with shareholder interest: The Remuneration Policy is designed to support the delivery of strong financial and operational results over time, which will ultimately grow shareholder value.

2015­2019 Remuneration
Remuneration awarded (USD m) Board of Directors Fixed annual fee Total
Executive Board Fixed base salary Short-term cash incentive Long-term share-based incentives Remuneration in connection with redundancy, resignations and release from duty to work Lump sum retirement payment Total

The Remuneration Policy and Incentive Guidelines applicable to members of our Executive Board and Board of Directors for 2019 were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2018. A new Remuneration Policy, prepared in accordance with the Danish Companies Act, will be presented for approval at the AGM 2020.
The following sections provide an overview of the components of Board of Directors and Executive Board remuneration, as well as the total remuneration awarded to the members for 2019.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors receives a fixed annual fee which is differentiated based on the role: · The Chairman receives a fixed amount · Ordinary Board members receive a fixed
amount and the Vice Chairman receives fixed multiples thereof.
2019 2018 2017 2016 2015

Members of the Board of Directors serving on the Board committees or performing ad hoc work beyond the normal responsibilities receive an additional fee.
Executive Board
The remuneration of Executive Board consists of a fixed base salary which is inclusive of pension and company car, short-term incentive as well as longterm incentive components.
The remuneration structure is intended to drive a "pay for performance" culture by aligning individual reward to company performance and shareholder value creation. Individual remuneration level is set and reviewed based on peer companies of similar size and complexity, to ensure they remain comparable and fit to the business.
The Executive Board members have service contracts containing company notice period which is in line with market practice for peer companies in Europe. In the event of termination by the company, the notice period can be up to and no more than 24 months.

Share price development
The Maersk B-share price increased by 34% to DKK 9,608 from its closing price at the end of 2018 of DKK 7,163, adjusted for the value of Maersk Drilling. By comparison, the benchmark indices MSCI World Transportation and OMXC25 increased by 22% and 26%, respectively. The Maersk B-share price reached its highest price of DKK 10,310 on 12 December 2019, and its lowest price of DKK 6,900 on 15 August 2019. The total market value of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S was USD 28bn at the end of 2019. The positive development of the share price was mainly led by an easing of trade tensions between the USA and China and negotiations around a potential trade deal coupled with improved financial performance over the year, leading to an earnings upgrade in October 2019.

Share capital
Maersk shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and are divided into two classes: A shares with voting rights and B shares without voting rights. Each DKK 1,000 A share entitles the holder to two votes.
The A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S share capital amounts to nominally DKK 20,816,862,000, divided between 10,756,378 A shares of nominally DKK 1,000 and 10,060,484 B shares of nominally DKK 1,000.
Ownership
The total number of registered shareholders decreased to around 73,000 during 2019. Shareholders with more than 5% of the share capital or votes held 52% of the share capital, while the 20 largest institutional shareholders together owned around 16% of the total share capital and 36% adjusted for the free-float. Danish retail investors have decreased their ownership from 16% to 11% of the total share capital since the end of 2018.

Own shares
A.P. Moller - Maersk holding of own shares comprised 3.47% of the share capital at the end of 2019, cf. note 11 in the consolidated financial statements.
Dividend

from the financial year 2019. Maersk B
In the medium-term and during the strategic phase of balancing the company between Ocean and non-Ocean, the annual pay-out ratio should be expected at the low to mid-point of the range.

and distribution will be decided from an evaluation of the outlook, cash flow, capital expenditures for organic CAPEX and M&A transactions and investment grade rating.
The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000). Of the total proposed ordinary dividend, the DKK 75 per share relates to Maersk's dividend policy of distributing between 30-40% of the underlying net result to shareholders in dividend, while the remaining DKK 75 per share relates to the commitment of distributing a material part of the value of the proceeds from the initially received Total S.A. shares, supported by the strong free cash flow generation in 2019.
The proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 1.6% (1.8%), based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 9,608 as of 30 December 2019. Payment is expected to take place on 26 March 2020.

Capital structure
The capital structure ensures that A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S at all time has sufficient financial flexibility to meet the strategic and growth objectives and to maximise the return to our shareholders.
In terms of capital allocation, a strict CAPEX discipline is applied with an accumulated CAPEX guidance for 2020-2021 of USD 3.0-4.0bn.
Driving our long-term value creative strategy, we apply the following principles for capital allocation: · We invest in maintenance and replacement in
the Ocean and non-Ocean segments. · We invest in growing our non-Ocean segment,
both organically and inorganically. · We are committed to maintaining our invest-
ment grade rating. · We target a dividend pay-out between 30-50%
of underlying net profit and aim at distributing excess cash to shareholders primarily via share buy-backs if the outlook permits.

Funding strategy
Maersk's focus is on long-term debt in order to minimise the on-going refinancing risk and secure a solid capital structure over the business cycle. Similarly, the aim is to avoid high concentrations of debt maturing within the same year. We aim at having a diversified debt portfolio, based on funding from debt capital markets, commercial bank debt, export credit agencies and ship financing institutions and from multilateral agencies.
The target is to have an average maturity of the debt portfolio, excluding the impact of leases, of at least five years, and that the total amount of debt maturities within a calendar year should not exceed USD 3bn, within the next three calendar years.
Share buy-back
The Board of Directors decided to initiate a share buy-back programme of up to DKK 10bn (around USD 1.5bn) and a maximum of 3.12 million shares to be acquired over a period of up to 15 months. The first phase ran from 4 June to 25 September 2019 with total market value of the shares acquired of DKK 3.3bn.
The second phase runs from 26 September until 28 February 2020. The shares to be acquired will be limited to a total market value of DKK 3.3bn. Prior to the second phase of the share buy-back programme, Maersk held 88,072 A shares and 403,134 B shares, equal to 2.36% of the share capital.
By the end of 2019, a total of 134,279 A shares and 587,949 B shares were owned by the company, corresponding to 3.47% of the share capital.

Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 A.P. Moller - Maersk has organised segments in `Ocean', `Logistics & Services', `Terminals & Towage' and `Manufacturing & Others'.
The Ocean segment with the activities of Maersk Liner Business (Maersk Line, Safmarine and Sealand ­ A Maersk Company) together with the Hamburg Süd brands (Hamburg Süd and Aliança) as well as strategic transhipment hubs under the APM Terminals brand. Inland activities related to Maersk Liner Business are included in the Logistics & Services segment.
The Logistics & Services segment with the logistics and supply chain management services, container inland services, inland haulage activities (intermodal), trade finance services and freight forwarding.
The Terminals & Towage segment including gateway terminals, involving landside activities such as port activities where the customers are mainly the carriers, and towage services under the Svitzer brand.
The Manufacturing & Others segment with Maersk Container Industry and others. Due to the reassessment in 2019, Maersk Supply Service was classified as continuing operations and consequently 2018 figures have been restated.
The segment disclosures reflect the information which the Executive Board receives monthly in its capacity as `chief operating decision maker' as defined in IFRS 8. Following the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases, the Executive Board reviews comparable 2018 proforma numbers as if IFRS 16 was implemented in 2018. The allocation of resources and the segment performance are evaluated based on revenue and profitability measured on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
1 Reference is made to the income statement for a reconciliation from EBITDA to profit/loss.

Table 1.5 Accrued income included in trade receivables in the balance sheet constitutes contract assets comprising unbilled amounts to customers representing the group's right to consideration for the services transferred to date. Any amount previously recognised as accrued income is reclassified to trade receivables at the time it is invoiced to the customer.
Under the payment terms generally applicable to the group's revenue generating activities, prepayments are received only to a limited extent. Typically, payment is due upon or after completion of the services.
Part of the deferred income presented in the balance sheet constitutes contract liabilities which represent advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognised.
There were no significant changes in accrued income and deferred income during the reporting period.
Impairment losses disclosed in note 18 relate to receivables arising from contracts with customers.

Table 6.2 and Table 6.3 Impairment analysis The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on the higher of its value in use or fair value less cost to sell. The value in use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans approved by management. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. The discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e. project and/ or country-specific risk premium. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.

Goodwill impairment test The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments and cash-generating units based on the management structure.
The most significant goodwill amount relates to the Ocean segment, where the impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from five-year business plans and a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected economic growth of 2% p.a. in both 2019 and 2018. A discount rate of 7.7% (7.7%) has been applied.
The key assumptions for Terminals & Towage's value calculations are container moves, revenue and cost per move and discount rate. The cash flow projections cover the concession period and extension options where deemed likely that they will be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period.

Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 As part of the group's activities, customary leasing agreements are entered into, especially regarding the chartering of vessels and leasing of containers and other equipment. In some cases, the leasing agreements comprise purchase options exercisable by the group and options for extending the lease term. The group also enters into arrangements that provide the right to use some existing infrastructure or land as required to carry out the terminal business.
In 2018, the group recognised leased assets and corresponding liabilities in relation to leases that were classified as `finance leases' under IAS 17. The assets were presented in property, plant and equipment and the finance lease liabilities as part of the group's borrowings. Following the adoption of IFRS 16, all capitalised leases are presented as right-of-use assets, including those previously presented under property, plant and equipment.

Leases to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed, but for which lease term has not yet commenced have an undiscounted value of USD 481m. They comprise of 48 contracts commencing in 2020 and 2021.
Certain terminal concession agreements contain variable payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e. number of containers handled or depend on an index, or a combination hereof. Such payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.

To optimise lease costs during the contract period, the group sometimes provides residual value guarantees in relation to equipment leases. At the end of 2019, the expected residual values were reviewed to reflect the actual residual values achieved on comparable assets and expectations about future prices. As at 31 December 2019, USD 489m is expected to be payable and is included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.

Table 10.1, Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 Discontinued operations include Maersk Oil up to closing in March 2018, as well as Maersk Drilling up to demerger in April 2019, which concluded the separation of the energy-related businesses. The results of the discontinued operations are presented in one separate line in the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement.

1 The tax relates to the profit from the ordinary activities of discontinued operations. There is no tax related to the gain on sale of Maersk Oil. The gain on sale of Maersk Oil was USD 2.6bn in 2018.

In the consolidated financial statements, the results for Maersk Oil and Maersk Drilling are classified under discontinued operations with a net loss of USD 553m (profit of USD 3.8bn). Total cash flow from the discontinued operations was negative by USD 372m (positive USD 4.0bn).

Maersk Drilling activity In Q3 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced that it would pursue a demerger through a separate listing of Maersk Drilling in 2019. On 2 April 2019, the Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Directors' proposal to complete the demerger and separate listing of Maersk Drilling.

Period ended 2 April 2019 A.P. Moller - Maersk recognised a loss of USD 553m for the Maersk Drilling activity, mainly due to a negative fair value adjustment of USD 628m in Q1 2019. The cash flow from the demerger is summarised in Table 10.3.

For the measurement of the fair value of Maersk Drilling, A.P. Moller - Maersk has used the market cap of Maersk Drilling at the closing price of the new listed company on the first day of trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen on 4 April 2019 as fair value distributed to the shareholders. The fair value of the new listed company of USD 3.4bn has resulted in a negative fair value adjustment of USD 628m being recognised in Q1 2019. Measurement of the fair value of the disposal group is categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurement is based on observable market data.

The net cash flow effect of USD 372m for the period mainly relates to cash and bank balances disposed to Maersk Drilling at demerger. As part of the demerger, A.P. Moller - Maersk is subject to a statutory demerger liability for liabilities existing as of 4 March 2019 assigned to The Drilling Company of 1972 A/S, pursuant of the Danish Companies Act section 254, subsection 2. The liability is deemed remote.
Maersk Oil On 21 August 2017, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced the sale of Maersk Oil to Total S.A. for USD 7,450m in a combined share and debt transaction. The transaction, which was based on a locked box mechanism from 30 June 2017, closed on 8 March 2018 with an accounting gain of USD 2.6bn.
In addition to the net cash proceeds of USD 2.0bn after closing adjustments and free cash flow of USD 0.3bn up to closing, A.P. Moller - Maersk received USD 97.5m shares in Total S.A., equivalent to an ownership interest of 3.7%.
The market value of Total S.A. shares was USD 5.6bn at closing on 8 March 2018. The accounting gain comprises of the original gain calculated on 30 June 2017 of USD 2.8bn reduced by the profit recognised in the period from 1 July 2017 up to closing of USD 1.0bn and addition of the locked box interest and positive Total S.A. share price development totalling USD 0.8bn.
Period ended 8 March 2018 Maersk Oil reported a profit of USD 148m in 2018 before elimination of internal interests. The gain and cash flow from closing the transaction is summarised in Table 10.3.

Secondary decommissioning liability As part of the divestment of Mærsk Olie & Gas A/S (MOGAS) to Total S.A. in 2018, A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (APMM) has assumed a secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the offshore facilities in Denmark by issuance of a declaration. APMM assesses the risk of economic outflows because of this secondary liability as very remote.

Table 11.2 On 24 May 2019, the Board of Directors of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (APMM) announced a share buy-back programme in order to exercise the authority given at the Annual General Meeting in April 2019 of acquiring up to 15% of the share capital over two years of up to DKK 10bn (around USD 1.5bn) and a maximum of 3.12 million shares to be acquired over a period of up to 15 months. The authorisation is to remain in force until 30 April 2021.
The first phase of the programme was initiated on 4 June 2019 and was completed on 25 September 2019.
During the second phase of the programme running from 26 September 2019 to 28 February 2020, the company will buy back A and B shares for an amount of up to DKK 3.3bn.
The share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to adjust the capital structure of APMM and to meet obligations under long-term incentive programmes. Shares which are not used for hedging purposes for the longterm incentive programmes will be proposed cancelled at the Annual General Meetings in 2020 and 2021.
No shares may be bought back at a price exceeding the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade and ii) the highest current independent bid at Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of trading.
The maximum number of A and B shares that may be purchased on each business day may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of A and B shares, respectively, on Nasdaq Copenhagen or other regulated markets, on which the purchase is carried out, over last 20 trading days prior to the date of purchase.
Disposals of own shares are primarily related to the restricted shares programme.

Table 12.1 Restricted shares plan The restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis since 2013. Grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board from 2018.

The fair value of restricted shares (A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S B shares) granted to 92 (105) employees and five (five) members of the Executive Board was USD 7m (USD 8m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted restricted shares recognised in the income statement is USD 5m (USD 8m).

The transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board the vesting period is five years.
The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.

The fair value per restricted share at the time of grant is DKK 8,668 (DKK 9,273), which is equal to the volume weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2019.
On 1 April 2019, the restricted shares originally granted in 2016 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price at that date was DKK 8,668. The average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2019 is 1.7 years (1.4 years).

Table 12.2 Share option plans In addition to the plan described above, A.P. Moller - Maersk has share option plans for members of the Executive Board and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the time of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.
The share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.
The fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of the Executive Board and 75 (80) employees was USD 9m (USD 7m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted share options recognised in the income statement is USD 5m (USD 6m).
No share options were exercised during 2018 and 2019.
The average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2019 is 5.2 years (5.5 years) and the exercise price for outstanding share options is DKK 9,057 (DKK 10,006).
1 At the time of grant. 2 Average exercise prices were reduced following the
demerger of Maersk Drilling and have been restated.

Table 12.3 The fair value per option granted to members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,782 (DKK 1,712) at the time of grant, based on Black & Scholes' option pricing model. The fair value per option granted to employees not members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,914 (DKK 1,875) at the time of grant based on the same option pricing model.

Table 14.1 As employer, the group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which it operates. Generally, the pension plans within the group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprise's share of the obligation is not available.
In 2020, the group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 27m to funded defined benefit plans (USD 27m in 2019).

Table 14.2 The majority of the group's defined benefit liabilities are in the UK by 78% and the USA by 13%. All the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the USA are funded. Although all the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.
Overall, the plans have an average duration of 16 years, and approx. 57% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.
As well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the group is also subject to the risk of higher than expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation, although some minimum and maximum limits apply.

Table 14.3 Rates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations, and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections, 1.25% for all UK plans.

Table 14.5 Except for an insignificant portion, the plan assets held by the group are quoted investments.

Table 14.4 The liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19.

The group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a trustee board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the trustees agree with the group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.

The expected contribution to the UK plans for 2020 are USD 23m (USD 21m in 2019) of which USD 20m (USD 0m in 2019) is deficit recovery contributions. In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF) and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the group are not refundable in any circumstance, and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the group's assumptions. In 2019, an adjustment of USD 2m (USD 2m) was applied in this respect.

Table 14.6 Multi-employer plans Under collective agreements, certain entities in the group participate together with other employers in defined benefit pension plans as well as welfare/medical plans (multi-employer plans).
For the defined benefit pension plans, the group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. In 2019, the group's contributions are estimated at USD 83m (USD 74m), while the contributions to be paid in 2020 are estimated at USD 79m. In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man-hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.
No reliable basis exists for the allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the plans where the group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employers totalled USD 0.7bn (USD 0.9bn). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculations in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future.
The welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. As for the defined benefit pension plans, the contributions are based on man-hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

Table 15.1 Restructuring includes provisions for decided and publicly announced restructurings. Legal disputes, etc. include among other things indirect tax and duty disputes. Onerous and unfavourable contracts are mainly related to Hamburg Süd's unfavourable lease contracts acquired in 2017. Other includes provisions for warranties and risk under certain self-insurance programmes. The provisions are subject to considerable uncertainty, cf. note 25.

Reversals of provisions primarily relate to unfavourable contracts, which were adjusted to right-of-use assets as a practical expedient upon application of IFRS 16, and to legal disputes and contractual disagreements, which are recognised in the income statement under operating costs and tax.

Table 16.1 Hedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and option contracts are used to hedge the currency risk related to recognised and unrecognised transactions. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are used to hedge interest rate exposure on borrowings. Price hedge derivatives are used to hedge crude oil prices and bunker prices.
The hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relation between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points and change in basis spread are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (USD 1m).
For information about risk management strategy, currencies, maturities, etc., reference is made to note 17.
Table 16.2 and Table 16.3 Hedge of borrowings Cross-currency swaps are used to swap all non-USD issued bonds. Fixed to floating rate swaps are designated as a combination of fair value and cash flow hedges. The principal amounts in USD equivalents are: EUR 733m (EUR 1,723m), GBP 92m (GBP 89m), JPY 206m (JPY 204m) and NOK 250m (NOK 252m). The remaining swaps are fixed to fixed rate or floating to fixed rate swaps and are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
The hedge ratio is 1:1. The maturity of the hedge instrument 0-5 years is (USD equivalents): EUR 671m (EUR 1,746m), JPY 92m (JPY 91m) and NOK 341m (NOK 344m). 5-10 years: EUR 839m (EUR 859m), GBP 394m (GBP 380m), JPY 114m (JPY 113m) and NOK 250m (NOK 252m). Above 10 years: EUR 90m (EUR 92m).
Cross-currency swaps are designated as a combination of hedge of principal cash flow and hedge of interests at a weighted average rate of 4.0% (4.5%).

Interest rate swaps are all denominated in USD and pay either floating (fair value hedge) or fixed interest rates (cash flow hedge). The hedge ratio is 1:1, and the weighted average interest rate is 2.4% (2.5%) excluding margin on loans. The maturity of the interest rate swaps 0-5 years is USD 730m (USD 918m) and 5-10 years USD 1,352m (USD 1,130m).

Table 16.4 Hedge of operating cash flows and investments in foreign currencies Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively.

For cash flow hedges related to borrowings, a loss of USD 54m (loss of USD 80m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve is a loss of USD 103m (loss of USD 49m). Reference is made to other comprehensive income.
The carrying amount of the borrowings in fair value hedge relation is USD 2,181m (USD 2,768m), and the accumulated fair value adjustment of the loans is a loss of USD 53m (loss of USD 13m). The gain on the hedging instrument in fair value hedges recognised in the income statement for the year amounts to USD 45m (loss of USD 15m), and the loss on hedged item amounts to USD 40m (gain of USD 15m).
Due to bond buy-back in 2019, ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement with a loss of USD 4m (gain of USD 20m).

Hedges of future revenue and operating costs mature within one year. There are no hedges of investments at the end of 2019 (2018: Mature within one year).
For hedges related to operating cash flows and investments a gain of USD 48m (loss of USD 89m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to a gain of USD 14m (loss of USD 34m).
Other economic hedges (no hedge accounting applied) Furthermore, the group enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.
For information about currencies, maturities, etc., reference is made to note 17.

Table 17.2 Financial instruments measured at fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels:
Level 1 -- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Financial instruments carried at amortised cost Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.

Level 2 -- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.

Level 3 -- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Fair value of listed securities is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the group's profit or equity significantly.

Table 18.1 The group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: · Market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk · Credit risk · Liquidity risk
The group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the group's financial performance. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the group's entities.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and share price, will affect the group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses below relate to the position of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk, interest rate risk and share price risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2019. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate, interest rate and share price sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates, interest rates and share price.

Currency risk The group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from Ocean activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as EUR, DKK, HKD, SGD and CAD. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including Terminals & Towage, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the group's exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the group's profit. The group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows: · Net cash flows in other significant currencies than
USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon; · Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged; · Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all significant currencies to which the group is exposed is estimated to have a positive impact on the group's profit before tax by USD 0.2bn (negative USD 0.1bn) and to affect the group's equity, excluding tax, by USD 0.0bn (negatively by USD 0.3bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 16 and 17, and are thus not an expression of the group's total currency risk.

Interest rate risk The group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP and JPY. The group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The duration of the group's debt portfolio is 2.2 (2.2) excluding IFRS 16 leases. A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 11m and negatively USD 14, respectively (negatively by approx. USD 16m and USD 18m, respectively).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Table 18.2 and Table 18.3 Credit risk Trade receivables The group has exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been impaired.

Table 18.4 Other financial assets at amortised cost Other financial assets at amortised cost comprise loan receivables, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
Liquidity risk The group's objective is to maintain a liquidity profile in line with an investment grade credit rating. Capital is managed for the group. The equity share of total equity and liabilities was 52.0% at the end of 2019 (59.0%).
In addition to the liquidity reserve, the group has USD 0.0bn undrawn committed loans which are dedicated to financing of specific assets, part of which will therefore only become available at certain times in the future.
Based on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.
The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the group was about five years (about four years at 31 December 2018).
1 Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, securities and cash and bank balances, excluding securities and balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions.

Approx. 67% (69%) of the provision for bad debt is related to trade receivables overdue by more than one year.

Table 18.5 It is of great importance for the group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the group's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the group's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.

The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

Table 19.1 Operating lease commitments As part of the group's activities, customary agreements are entered into regarding charter and operating leases of ships, containers, port facilities, etc. From 1 January 2019, the group has recognised right-of-use assets for these leases, except for short-term and low-value leases, see note 8 for further information.
1 In 2018, about 35% of the time charter payments in Ocean are estimated to relate to operational costs for the assets. In 2019, the short-term and low-value leases do not include any payment for operational costs.
2 Manufacturing & Others include unallocated and eliminations.
3 The net present value has been calculated using a discount rate of 6% in 2018.

Table 19.2, Table 19.3 and Table 19.4 The decrease in capital commitments is primarily related to contractual payments during 2019.
USD 53m of the total capital commitments is related to the newbuilding programme for tugs, at a total contract price of USD 62m including owner-furnished equipment. The remaining capital commitments of USD 1.7bn relate to investments mainly in hubs and gateway terminals within the Ocean and Terminals & Towage segments.
The capital commitments will be financed by cash flow from operating activities as well as existing and new loan facilities.

Amounts in USD million

Note 24 Significant accounting policies

Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements for 2019 for A.P. Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. Møller Holding A/S.
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2018, except for the changes to the accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2019 and were endorsed by the EU: · Leases (IFRS 16) · Uncertainty over income tax treatments (IFRIC 23).
Leases (IFRS 16) Effective 1 January 2019, A.P. Moller - Maersk applied the new reporting standard on Leases, IFRS 16. All leases are recognised as right-of-use assets with corresponding lease liabilities at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by A.P. Moller - Maersk.
Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and an interest expense. The interest expense is charged to the income statement over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straightline basis.
A.P. Moller - Maersk transitioned to IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach, therefore previous period comparative figures are not adjusted in the financial statements. Additionally, the IAS 17 definition of a lease and its related interpretations have been retained.

Lease liabilities classified as finance leases at 31 December 2018 were transitioned to IFRS 16 at their carrying amount of USD 2.3bn.
At 31 December 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk had noncancellable operating lease commitments of USD 12.0bn. As part of the transition, A.P. Moller - Maersk applied the following adjustments before discounting lease payments: · Service components included in the pricing of vessel
charter fees are not included as part of the lease liability. These costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. · Terminal concession agreements to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed, but which will only begin operations during Q1 2019 or later were not capitalised at transition. · A.P. Moller - Maersk did not apply the new standard to leases with a remaining term of 12 months or less from 1 January 2019. Additionally, leases with maximum lease term less than 12 months are exempted from provisions of the new standard.
The table below bridges operating lease commitments related to continuing operations to IFRS 16 lease liabilities on 1 January 2019:

Reconciliation of commitments to lease liability (USDm)

Operating lease obligations (continuing operations) Adjustment for commitments not yet commenced Adjustments for service components Optional period payments Other adjustments Undiscounted lease liabilities Discounting effect Lease liability

12,041
-2,240 -1,266
758 -283 9,010 -2,765 6,245

A weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 6.6% was applied. The incremental borrowing rate was based on reference interest rates derived for a period up to 10 years based on corporate bond yields in major currencies, i.e. USD, EUR and SEK.

On transition, A.P. Moller - Maersk's opening balance of gross debt increased by USD 6.2bn to USD 18.1bn, while property, plant and equipment increased to USD 39.9bn. The increase in property, plant and equipment of USD 6.2bn mainly related to ships, container, etc. (USD 3.1bn) and concession agreements (USD 2.4bn).
In connection with the transition to the new standard, management has applied judgement and formed assumptions in relation to assessing the incremental borrowing rate, service components and extension options of leasing arrangements. Management has formed its judgements and assumptions based on historical experience, internal and external data points.
Uncertainty over income tax treatments (IFRIC 23) A.P. Moller - Maersk follows the guidelines in IFRIC 23 for accounting for uncertain income tax positions and the implementation of the interpretation standard has not resulted in a significant change to the measurement of recognised uncertain tax positions.
Following the application of IFRIC 23, A.P. Moller - Maersk presents uncertain tax positions as either non-current or current tax payables. The 2018 ending balances have been restated by USD 410m from provisions to tax liabilities.
Interest rate benchmark reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 & IFRS 7) A.P. Moller - Maersk has elected to early adopt the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, `Interest Rate Benchmark Reform`. The transition provisions require that the amendments are adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow reserve at that date. The reliefs specify that the IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. Hence there are reliefs in the amendments that apply to the hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform.
In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to A.P. Moller - Maersk are: · When considering the `highly probable` requirement,
A.P. Moller - Maersk has assumed that the different

IBOR interest rates on which our hedged debts are based do not change as a result of the IBOR reform. · In assessing whether an economic relationship between the hedged cash flows and the hedging instruments is expected to exist throughout the term of hedge, A.P. Moller - Maersk has assumed that the IBOR interest rates on which the cash flows of the hedged debt and the interest rate swaps that hedge it are based are not altered by IBOR reform. · Whether the benchmark interest component in a fair value hedge is a separately identifiable component is not assessed on an ongoing basis. · A.P. Moller - Maersk will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty as the hedge relationships are still economic relationships. · A.P. Moller - Maersk has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relation to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect. · There is no ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss as a result of the early adoption of the amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7.
The IBOR's that A.P. Moller - Maersk is affected by are: USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR, NIBOR and STIBOR.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.
Joint arrangements are entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agree-

Amounts in USD million

Note 24 Significant accounting policies ­ continued

ments with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.
Entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, which have been prepared in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intragroup income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.
Non-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively but shown as separate items.
Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.

The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate. The functional currency of oil and oil-related business within discontinued operations is USD.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
Segment information The allocation of business activities into segments reflects A.P. Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting. The reportable segments are as follows:

Ocean

Global container shipping activities including strategic transhipment hubs

Logistics & Services

Freight forwarding, supply chain management, inland haulage and other logistic services

Terminals & Towage

Gateway terminal activities, towage and related marine activities

Manufacturing Production of reefer and dry containers,

& Others

trading and sale of bunker oil and other

businesses

Operating segments have not been aggregated.

The reportable segments comprise:
Ocean Ocean activities, defined as operating activities under Maersk Line, Safmarine, Sealand ­ A Maersk Company and Hamburg Süd brands with Ocean container freight being the main revenue stream. Ocean container freight is defined as the cost-per-weight measure of transporting goods on board a container vessel across the ocean, including demurrage and detention, terminal handling, documentation services, container services as well as container storage.
Hub activities, defined as operating activities under the APM Terminals brand generating revenue by providing port services only in major transhipment ports such as Rotterdam, Maasvlakte-II, Algeciras, Tangier, TangierMed II, Port Said, and joint ventures in Salalah, Tanjung Pelepas and Bremerhaven. The respective terminals are included under the Ocean segment, as the primary purpose of those ports is to provide transhipment services to Maersk's Ocean business, whereas third-party volumes sold in those locations are considered secondary.
Logistics & Services Damco activities, defined as all operating activities under the Damco brand, a provider of logistics, freight forwarding and supply chain management services.
Inland haulage activities (intermodal), defined as all operating activities under Maersk Line, Safmarine, Sealand ­ A Maersk Company brands with the main stream of revenue deriving from the transportation of containers from vendors (shippers) to the port of shipment, and from discharge port to the point of stripping (consignee) by truck and/or rail. Inland haulage activities operating under the Hamburg Süd brand are still part of the Ocean activity.
APM Terminals inland activities, defined as operating activities in inland activities facilities fully or partially controlled by APM Terminals, with the main revenue stream being inland services such as full container storage, bonded warehousing, empty depot, local transportation, etc.

Trade Finance, a function providing export finance solutions, post-shipment and import finance solutions.
Star Air activities, operating cargo aircraft on behalf of UPS.
Terminals & Towage Terminals activities, defined as operating activities in ports fully or partially controlled by the APM Terminals brand, with the main revenue stream being port activities not considered a hub activity as described above.
Towage activities, defined as all operating activities under the Svitzer brand, a provider of offshore towage and salvage services.
Manufacturing & Others Maersk Container Industry, a container manufacturer that produces reefer containers.
Maersk Supply Service provides marine services and integrated solutions to the energy sector worldwide with a large fleet of anchor handling tug supply vessels and subsea support vessels.
Maersk Oil Trading is dedicated to sourcing marine fuels and lubricants for A.P. Moller - Maersk's fleet in addition to refinery activities and sales to external parties including Maersk Tankers.
Hamburg Süd tramp activity, bulk and tanker activity acquired as part of the Hamburg Süd acquisition.
Other businesses, consisting of Maersk Training, a provider of training services to the maritime, oil and gas, offshore wind and crane industries.
The reportable segments do not comprise costs in A.P. Moller - Maersk's corporate functions. These functions are reported as unallocated items.
Revenue between segments is limited, except for the Terminals & Towage segment, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Ocean segment as well as the sale of containers from Maersk Container Industry to the

Ocean segment. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Income statement Revenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon the transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.
Revenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Detention and demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the time of the customer's late return or pick-up of containers. Retrospective volume rebates provided to certain customers which give rise to variable consideration are based on the expected value method and allocated to ocean freight revenue.
Revenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction.
Revenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.
Share of pro t/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.
Tax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years of those. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists

of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Earnings per share are calculated as A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' share of the profit/loss for the year divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding A.P. Moller - Maersk's holding of own shares. Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of share-based compensation issued by the parent company.
Statement of comprehensive income Other comprehensive income consists of gains and losses not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.
On disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a non-USD functional currency is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.
Other comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.
Balance sheet Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful

lives of the assets. Intangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and brand names are amortised over a useful life of 15 and 20 years, respectively. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.
For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:

Ships, etc. Containers, etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure
Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc.

20-25 years 12 years 10-50 years 10-20 years or concession period, if shorter
5-20 years
3-7 years

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
The cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.

The cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.
Right-of-use assets: The group mainly leases vessels, containers, concessions arrangements and real estate property. Lease contracts for vessels and containers are typically made for fixed periods of about five years but may have extension options as described below. Concession arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the group. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Intercompany leases will continue to be presented according to IFRS 8 - Segment Reporting, as operating leases in accordance with the old lease standard, IAS 17.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use.
Assets are held for sale, when the carrying amount of an individual non-current asset, or disposal groups, will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate

110 A.P. Moller - Maersk Annual Report 2019

sale in their present condition and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.
Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.
Equity instruments, etc., including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for non-listed securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.
Inventories mainly consist of bunkers, containers (manufacturing), spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured in accordance with IFRS 9 applying

a provision matrix to calculate the minimum impairment. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit/loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.
The translation reserve comprises A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of equity investments (at FVOCI), net of tax. Reserve for hedges includes the accumulated fair value of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, net of tax as well as forward points and currency basis spread.
Equity-settled performance shares, restricted shares and share options allocated to the employees of A.P. Moller - Maersk as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding adjustment in equity. Cash-settled performance awards allocated to employees below executive levels as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme is recognised as staff costs over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment in other payables.
At the end of each reporting period, A.P. Moller - Maersk revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity and other payables.
Provisions are recognised when A.P. Moller - Maersk has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events. The item includes, among other things, legal disputes, provisions for onerous contracts, unfavourable contracts acquired as part of a business combination as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under

certain insurance programmes, primarily in the US. Provisions are recognised based on best estimates and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.
Pension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Pension plans where A.P. Moller - Maersk, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises ­ so-called multi-employer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans, where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.
Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends, and no taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial liabilities

are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are measured at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable to determine, or else at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate.
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.
The following lease payments are included in the net present value: · fixed payments (including in-substance fixed pay-
ments), less any lease incentives receivable · variable lease payment that are based on an index
or a rate · amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under
residual value guarantees · the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.
Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Extension and termination options in lease contracts are included in those contracts A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise those options. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Most of the extension and termination options held, are exercisable only by A.P. Moller - Maersk and not by the respective lessor.

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee. Where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise specific purchase options, those options are included in the measurement of the lease liability with corresponding right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset's useful life rather than lease term.
Lease payments are discounted at the implicit interest rate, to the extent this can be determined, otherwise discounted using incremental borrowing rates (IBRs). A.P. Moller Maersk's IBR reflects the group's credit risk, leased amount and contract duration; nature and quality of the asset's security and economic environment in which the leased assets operate. To determine the IBR, where possible, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect changes in financing conditions since that financing was received. Where such financing is not available, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted by credit risk and specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geographical risks, etc.
Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost with each lease payment allocated between the repayment of the liability and financing cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period using the IBR that was used to discount the lease payments.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge highly probable future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred

to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attributed to the hedging relationship. Currency basis spread, and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and deferred in equity.
The ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.
Cash flow statement Cash flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arising from investments and divestments, received dividends, principal payments of loans, instalments on finance lease liabilities, paid and received financial items and equity transactions. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a non-cash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing costs are included in cash flow from financing.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's cash management.
Business combinations and disposal of subsidiaries Upon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date when control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and

any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
When A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain (or loss) on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of contingent consideration at the time of sale. Contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement with restatement of comparative figures.
Assets and liabilities held for sale from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet with no restatement of comparative figures. Elimination between continuing and discontinued operations is presented to reflect continuing operations as post-separation, which entails the elimination of interest, borrowing, dividends and capital increases.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets, etc., are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less cost to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.

In addition to the above general accounting policies, the following are significant about discontinued operations. For drilling activities, revenue is recognised in accordance with the agreed day rates for the work performed to date. Compensations received, or receivable, for early termination are recognised as revenue with deferral of an estimated value of any obligations to stand ready for new engagements in the remaining contract period.
Oil and gas revenue are recognised as revenue upon discharge from the production site, reflecting the production entitlement quantities. In agreements where tax is settled in oil, an amount corresponding to the sales value is recognised as both revenue and tax.
Income tax also consists of oil tax based on gross measures. Oil tax on gross measures is a special tax in certain countries on the production of hydrocarbons and is separately disclosed within tax.
Intangible assets regarding acquired oil resources (concession rights, etc.) are amortised over a useful life of production until the fields' expected production periods end ­ a period of up to 20 years until classification as assets held for sale.
In property, plant and equipment, oil production facilities, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation generally takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil until classification as assets held for sale.
The cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment.
The useful lives of new assets are 25 years for rigs and up to 20 years for oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields.
Provisions include provisions for the abandonment of oil fields.

Amounts in USD million

Note 25 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its judgements and estimates based on historical experience, independent advice and external data points as well as in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or to settle claims that are raised against A.P. Moller - Maersk, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change, or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. This note includes the areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk is particularly exposed to a material adjustment of the carrying amounts as at the end of 2018.
General Aspects of uncertainty In its assumption setting, management deals with different aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is whether an asset or liability exists where the assessment

forms the basis for recognition or derecognition decisions, including assessment of control. Another aspect is the measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions about the value of the assets and liabilities that are deemed to exist. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows and the risks inherent in these.
Container freight rates The future development in container freight rates is an uncertain and significant factor impacting especially Maersk Line, whose financial results are directly affected by fluctuations in container freight rates. Freight rates are influenced by the global economic environment and trade patterns, as well as by industry-specific trends in respect of capacity supply and demand. In addition, the new global low sulphur bunker fuel regulation (IMO 2020), which came into effect in January 2020, is expected to increase the cost of compliant fuels significantly. Alternatively, installing scrubbers on vessels enables the use of lower cost fuels, but requires capital expenditure. There is significant uncertainty that the increased cost regarding implementation and compliance with the IMO 2020 requirements cannot be recovered from customers through the freight rate.

Oil prices The future development in the oil price is an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk either directly or indirectly. Maersk Line is directly impacted by the price of bunker oil, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. APM Terminals is indirectly impacted by the oil price as terminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g. Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Russia and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences on the countries' economies, which not only affect volume handled in the terminals, but also exchange rates.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment A.P. Moller - Maersk carries goodwill of USD 637m (USD 645m) and intangible assets with indefinite lives of USD 31m (USD 34m). The majority of non-current assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Management assesses impairment indicators across this asset base. Judgement is applied in the definition of cash-generating units and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions for impairment tests.

The determination of cash-generating units differs for the various businesses. Ocean operates its fleet of container vessels, containers and hub terminals in an integrated network, for which reason the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit. In addition, the intermodal activities reported under Logistics & Services are included in the Ocean cash-generating unit for impairment testing to apply consistency between the asset base and related cash flows. In Logistics & Services, apart from intermodal, each entity is defined as a cash-generating unit. In gateway terminals, each terminal is considered individually in impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio, which is the case for certain terminals in Northern Europe and Global Ports Investments, Russia. Towage groups vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing management's ongoing follow-up. Projected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use. External data is used to the extent possible, and centralised processes, involving corporate functions, ensure that indexes or data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances. Current market values for vessels, etc. are estimated using acknowledged brokers.

Impairment considerations In Ocean, although average bunker cost reduced by 2.9%, the impact of IMO 2020 on bunker supply and the uncertainty around cost recovery, in addition to the weakness in the broader macroeconomic backdrop, are impairment indicators. Trade protectionism has reduced the global container outlook and recession risks have increased. In addition, the estimated fair value of the fleet continues to be lower than the carrying amount. Consequently, an estimate of the recoverable amount has been prepared by a value in use calculation. The cash flow projection is based on forecasts as per Q3 2019 covering plans for 2020-24. The key sensitivities are: development in freight rates, container volumes, bunker costs, effect of cost savings as well as the discount rate. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes and continued pressure on, but increasing freight rates, and continued cost efficiency. The impairment test continues to show headroom from value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.
In Terminals & Towage, management assesses impairment triggers and based on these, estimates recoverable amounts on the individual terminals. For APM Terminals' interest in Global Ports Investments, being the share of equity and significant intangible assets acquired, management assesses the recoverable amount of its interest on an ongoing basis. Uncertain variables in the estimate are the economic outlook in Russia, local competition, effect on volume, operating expenses and discount rate. The carrying amount of the investment may not be sustainable in the next few years, if markets develop significantly adversely compared to current expectations. Estimates of recoverable amounts were also prepared for other terminals where decreasing volumes triggered impairment tests. Key sensitivities are: expected volumes, local port rates, concession right extensions as well as discount rate. The impairment tests showed headroom from value in use calculations compared to carrying amount. Therefore, no impairment was recognised in 2019 compared to USD 20m in 2018 related to terminals in markets with challenging commercial conditions. Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in certain

oil-producing countries can potentially put further pressure on carrying amounts of terminals in these countries.
Maersk Container Industry decided to consolidate the manufacture of reefer containers at the facility in Qingdao, China, and exit the dry container business completely. Consequently, operation ceased at the facilities in San Antonio, Chile, and Dongguan, China. The closure of the facilities triggered a write-down of assets of USD 66m in 2018. The recoverable amounts for both closed factories are measured at fair value categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurements are not based on observable market data and relate mainly to land and buildings which by nature are uncertain. In 2019, a USD 52m reversal of the write-down was recognised.
The recoverable amounts for both factories are measured at fair value categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurements are not based on observable market data and relate mainly to land and buildings which by nature are uncertain.
Reference is made to notes 6 and 7 for information about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and discount rates.
Amortisation, depreciation and residual values Useful lives are estimated based on experience. Management decides from time to time to revise the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. Please refer to note 24 for the useful lives typically used for new assets.
Residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of vessels and rigs, the uncertainty as to future economic conditions and the future price of steel, which is considered the main determinant of the residual price. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. The long-term view is prioritised to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.

Operations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash A.P. Moller - Maersk operates worldwide, and in this respect, has operations in countries where access to repatriating surplus cash is limited. In these countries, management makes judgements as to how these transactions and balance sheet items are recognised in the financial statements.
Provisions for pension and other employee benefits For defined benefit schemes, management makes assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and discount rates. When setting these assumptions, management takes advice from the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country-by-country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a planby-plan basis. Refer to note 14 for information about key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions.
Plan assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.
Provisions for legal disputes, uncertain tax positions, etc. Management's estimate of the provisions regarding legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. The resolution of legal disputes, through either negotiations or litigation, can take several years to complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.
A.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have been made where the probability of our tax position being upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. Claims, for which the probability of our tax position being upheld is assessed by management to be at least 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area, and country risk provisions and uncertain tax liabilities are recognised where

the aggregated probability of our tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.
Deferred tax assets Judgement has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to utilise the assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 98m (USD 142m) for continuing operations, excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected within a foreseeable future.
Vessel sharing agreements (Cost sharing arrangements) Vessel sharing agreements in shipping require that some vessels are committed towards specific service routes. The committed vessel's capacity is then shared with one or more container shipping providers in proportion to each party's contribution to the joint service. In practice, it is not always possible to provide tonnage precisely as agreed in the sharing arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes place on basis of relative capacity over/under utilized on a monthly or other mutually agreed cycle. At A.P. Moller - Maersk, these capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at that time.
Leasing A.P. Moller - Maersk enters into a substantial amount of lease contracts, some of which combine leasing and service components in the same leasing arrangement, such as time charter contracts. Judgement is applied in determining the stand-alone value of each component using specialised tools to streamline the valuation process. Similarly, determining variable lease payments requires significant judgement and understanding of facts and circumstances that give rise to variable payments. In the group, variable payments are linked to the uncertain

Note 25 Significant accounting estimates and judgements ­ continued

period for which container equipment is used outside the firm contract period, due to flexible redelivery periods and certain terminal concession agreements for which payments are linked to future performance such as number of TEUs handled or depend on an index.
A significant amount of lease contracts contains extension or purchase options or termination options or various combinations of these options. Assessment of the exercise or non-exercise of such options impacts the value of right-of-use asset recognised. Such assessments are reviewed whenever a significant event or change in circumstances occurs.
IFRS 16 requires that a discount rate is applied to determine the present value of lease payments. Significant judgement is required in determining appropriate rates, therefore management applies a formalised process for determining applicable discount rates using specialist staff in corporate functions.

Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. During Q1 2019, Maersk Supply Service no longer fulfilled the requirement to be classified as discontinued operations and assets held for sale and was thus reclassified as continuing business. Comparison figures for the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement have been restated as if Maersk Supply Service had always been part of continuing businesses. Following the reclassification as a continuing business, Maersk Supply Service forms part of the Manufacturing & Others reportable segment. Comparative figures have been restated. The impact on 2019 of the reclassifications on key accounting lines were: Revenue (USD 261m), EBITDA (USD 3m), loss for the period ­ continuing operations (USD 430m) and Equity (USD 13m).

Notes
Parent company financial statements Activities comprise holding of shares in subsidiaries and associated companies, as well as funding, procurement and cash management. The subsidiary Maersk Drilling Holding A/S shares were distributed as part of the Maersk Drilling demerger through separate listing in 2019. In the parent company financial statements, shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised at cost, cf. note 21, less impairment losses, and in the income statement, dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income. The net result for the year was a loss of USD 10m (profit of USD 8.7bn). The main differences are gain on sale and dividends, both reduced compared to 2018. Cash flow from operating activities was negative USD 368m (negative USD 190m). Total assets amounted to USD 38.3bn (USD 47.7bn) and total equity was USD 24.7bn (USD 29.4bn) at 31 December 2019.

Dividends 1 A.P. Moller Finance SA, Orion Limited and Maersk FPSOs
A/S have each paid around USD 0.1bn in dividend. 2018 dividends are mainly from Maersk Drilling Holding A/S USD 3.3bn and Maersk Oil Trading and Investments USD 0.4bn. Dividends from other equity investments in 2018 relate to Total S.A. shares.

Impairment losses and fair value adjustments 3 Impairment losses to recoverable amount relate mostly
to fair value adjustment of Maersk Supply Service A/S, Damco International A/S and Maersk FPSOs A/S. (In 2018 mainly, Maersk Drilling Holding A/S, USD 2.2bn based on fair value less cost to sell and Maersk Supply Service A/S of USD 0.4bn, based on fair value less cost to sell).
In Q3 2018, the company announced that it would pursue a demerger through a separate listing of Maersk Drilling in 2019. On 2 April 2019, the Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Directors' proposal to complete the demerger and separate listing of Maersk Drilling.

Reversal of impairment losses 2 Reversal of impairment losses relates to A.P. Moller
Finance SA, Star Air A/S and Maersk Container Industry A/S (in 2018 A.P. Moller Finance SA).

The fair value of Maersk Drilling Holding A/S shares distributed was USD 3.4bn, resulting in a loss of USD 0.6bn on the demerger. Note 10 in the consolidated financial statements holds more details.

Reversal of write-down of loan receivables 4 Loan receivables from Maersk Supply Service A/S and
Maersk Container Industry A/S were written down to recoverable amount in 2018. Part of the loan to Maersk Supply Service A/S is converted to capital injection and the write-down is partly reversed in 2019 to revised recoverable value. The loan to Maersk Container Industry A/S is settled at a higher value than carrying value and the difference between amount settled and carrying value is included in this item.

Table 11.1 Restricted shares plan The restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis since 2013. Grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board from 2018.
The transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board the vesting period is five years.

The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.

Table 11.2 The fair value of restricted shares (A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S B shares) granted to 92 (105) employees and five (five) members of the Executive Board was USD 7m (USD 8m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted restricted shares recognised in the income statement is USD 1m (USD 1m).
The fair value per restricted share at the time of grant was DKK 8,668 (DKK 9,273), which is equal to the volume weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2019.
On 1 April 2019, the restricted shares originally granted in 2016 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price at that date was DKK 8,668. The average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2019 is 1.7 years (1.4 years).
Share option plans In addition to the plan described above, A.P. Moller - Maersk has share option plan for members of the Executive Board and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The share options were granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent on the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the time of granting. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.
1 At the time of grant. 2 Average exercise prices were reduced following the
demerger of Maersk Drilling and have been restated.

Table 11.3 The share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.
The fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of the Executive Board and 75 (80) employees was USD 9m (USD 7m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted share options recognised in the income statement is USD 1m (USD 1m).
No share options were exercised during 2018 and 2019.
The average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2019 is 5.2 years (5.5 years) and the exercise price for outstanding share options is DKK 9,057 (DKK 10,006).
The fair value per option granted to members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,782 (DKK 1,712) at the time of grant based on Black & Scholes' option pricing model. The fair value per option granted to employees not members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,914 (DKK 2,281) at the time of grant based on the same option pricing model.

Table 14.1 Hedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and option contracts are used to hedge the currency risk related to recognised and unrecognised transactions. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are used to hedge interest rate exposure on borrowings.
The hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relation between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points and change in basis spread are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (USD 1m).
For information about risk management strategy, currencies, maturities, etc. reference is made to note 16.
Table 14.2 and Table 14.3 Hedge of borrowings Cross-currency swaps are used to swap all non-USD issued bonds. Fixed to floating rate swaps are designated as a combination of fair value and cash flow hedges. The principal amounts in USD equivalents are: EUR 733m (EUR

1,723m), GBP 92m (GBP 89m), JPY 206m (JPY 204m) and NOK 250m (NOK 252m). The remaining swaps are fixed to fixed rate or floating to fixed rate swaps and are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
The hedge ratio is 1:1. The maturity of the hedge instrument 0-5 years is (USD equivalents): EUR 671m (EUR 1,746m), JPY 92m (JPY 91m) and NOK 341m (NOK 344m). 5-10 years: EUR 839m (EUR 859m), GBP 394m (GBP 380m), JPY 114m (JPY 113m) and NOK 250m (NOK 252m). Above 10 years: EUR 90m (EUR 92m).
Cross-currency swaps are designated as a combination of hedge of principal cash flow and hedge of interests at a weighted average rate of 4.0% (4.5%).
Interest rate swaps are all denominated in USD and pay floating rate. The hedge ratio is 1:1, and the weighted average interest rate is 3.0% (2.8%) excluding margin on loans. The maturity of the interest rate swaps 5-10 years is USD 900m (USD 500m).
For cash flow hedges related to borrowings, a loss of USD 30m (loss of USD 64m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve is a loss of USD 64m (loss of USD 49m). Reference is made to other comprehensive income.

The gain on the hedging instrument in fair value hedges recognised in the income statement for the year amounts to USD 45m (loss of USD 15m), and the loss on hedged item amounts to USD 40m (gain of USD 15m).
Due to bond buy-back in 2019, ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement with a loss of USD 4m (gain of USD 20m).

Table 15.2 Financial instruments measured at fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels:
Level 1 -- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 -- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
Level 3 -- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.

Financial instruments carried at amortised cost Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
Fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.

The company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the company's financial performance. The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's businesses.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2019.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2019. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rate.

The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows: · Net cash flows in other significant currencies than
USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; · Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies, to which the company is exposed, is estimated to have a negative impact on the company's profit before tax by USD 0.3bn (negative USD 0.1bn) and the company's equity, excluding tax, by negative USD 0.3bn (negative USD 0.1bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. note 14 and 15, and are thus not an expression of the company's total currency risk.
Table 16.1 Interest rate risk The company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, GBP, JPY and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained with interest rate swaps.

Currency risk The company's currency risk arises primarily from its treasury activities where financing is obtained and provided in a wide range of currencies other than USD such as EUR, GBP and NOK.

A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 0.2m and USD 0.1m, respectively (positively USD 0.2m and USD 0.1m, respectively).

The main purpose of hedging the company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the company's profit.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Table 16.2 Credit risk The company has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
Financial assets at amortised cost comprise loan receivables, lease receivables and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated basis of 12 month expected credit losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.

Table 16.3 Liquidity risk It is of great importance for the company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S applies the simple approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been impaired.

Other financial assets at amortised cost include loans to subsidiaries. As of 31 December 2019, the loans amount to USD 20.7bn (USD 23.2bn) and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12-month expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the group. Loan write-downs in 2018 to Maersk Supply Service A/S and Maersk Container Industry A/S of USD 0.2bn are partly reversed in 2019.

Guarantees amount to USD 0.4bn (USD 0.5bn). Thereof, USD 0.4bn (USD 0.5bn) is related to subsidiaries. The guarantees are not expected to be realised, but they can mature within one year.
Except for customary agreements within the company's activities, no material agreements have been entered into that will take effect, change or expire upon changes of the control over the company.
The company is involved in a number of legal disputes. The company is also involved in tax disputes in certain

countries. Some of these involve significant amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty.
Tax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends. Through participation in joint taxation scheme with A.P. Møller Holding A/S, the company is jointly and severally liable for taxes payable, etc. in Denmark.

Note 21 Significant accounting policies

The financial statements for 2019 for A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. The financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The accounting policies of the company are consistent with those applied in the financial statements 2018, apart from the implementation of IFRS 16 (leases) and IFRIC 23 (uncertainties in income taxes). Both have immaterial impact on the financial statements of the company. Moreover, in December 2019, the company elected to early adopt the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 & IFRS 7 included in IASB's project `Interest Rate Benchmark Reform`.
Interest rate benchmark reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 & IFRS 7) The company has elected to early adopt the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 & IFRS 7, `Interest Rate Benchmark Reform'. The transition provisions require that the amendments are adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow reserve at that date.

The reliefs specify that the IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. Hence, there are reliefs in the amendments that apply to the hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform.
In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the company are: · When considering the `highly probable' requirement,
the company has assumed that the different IBOR interest rates on which our hedged debts are based do not change as a result of the IBOR reform. · In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis, the company has assumed that the IBOR interest rates on which the cash flows of the hedged debt and the interest rate swaps that hedge it are based are not altered by IBOR reform. · The company will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty as the hedge relationships are still economic relationships. · The company has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relation to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect. · There is no ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss as a result of the early adoption of the amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7.

The IBORs' that the company is affected by are: USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR, NIBOR and STIBOR.
The accounting policies are furthermore consistent with the accounting policies for the group's financial statements (note 24 in the consolidated financial statements) with the following exceptions: · Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are
measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount; · Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies
are recognised as income at the time of declaration unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary; · No segment information is disclosed; · Value of granted share options, restricted shares and performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. At the time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount with A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S and the counter posting made in equity. At the time of exercising, the proceeds are included in the company's equity.

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 are effective from 1 January 2020 and are endorsed by the EU. Amendments to IFRS 3 are also effective from 1 January 2020 and are expected to be endorsed by the EU. IFRS 17 is effective 1 January 2021 but there is some uncertainty around its EU endorsement date.
The company follows most of the guidelines in the amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, therefore the implementation is not expected to result in a significant change to the presentation of the financial statements.
IFRS 17: An analysis of the impact is being assessed and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the implementation date.
The IASB has also issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 that are effective from 1 January 2020 and are endorsed by the EU. In December 2019, the company has elected to early adopt those amendments.

New financial reporting requirements The company has not yet adopted the following accounting standards/requirements: · Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material · Amendments to IFRS 3 ­ Business Combinations:
Definition of a Business · IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts

Note 22 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

When preparing the financial statements of the company, management undertakes a number of accounting estimates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify the company's assets and liabilities.
Estimates that are material to the company's financial reporting are made on the basis of, inter alia, determination of impairment of financial non-current assets including subsidiaries and associated companies (including assets held for sale) and recognition and measurements of provisions. Reference is made to notes 4 and 7.

Management assesses impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries and associated companies and determines recoverable amount generally consistent with the assumptions described in notes 6, 7 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting estimates and judgements are described in further detail in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements (pages 67-138 and 145-147, respectively) give a true and fair view of the group's and the parent company's financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.

summary of significant accounting policies for the group as well as for the parent company. Collectively referred to as the "financial statements".
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the nancial statements section of our report.

Our opinion is consistent with our Auditor's Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

What we have audited
The consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including

Independence
We are independent of the group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.
Appointment
We were first appointed auditors of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S on 12 April 2012 for the financial year 2012. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of eight years including the financial year 2019.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

141 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Annual Report 2019

Financials

Independent Auditor's Report

Revenue recognition

Key audit matter
Recognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the variety of different revenue streams within the segments.
We focused on this area due to the significance of amounts involved and because recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, and judgements made by Management originating from different customer behavior, market conditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments. Further, the volume of transactions and extent of different revenue streams require various IT setups of revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inherent risk to the revenue recognition process.
Reference is made to notes 1 and 25 in the consolidated financial statements.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.
We tested the IT setups supporting the revenue recognition as well as relevant internal controls and Management's monitoring of internal controls.
We used data analytics on selected revenue streams and performed substantive procedures over invoicing and relevant contracts in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue. Further, we tested timing to ensure that the revenue is recognised in the correct financial year.

Recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment

Key audit matter
The most significant risks in relation to Management's assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment relate to the definition of cash-generating units (CGUs), identification of CGUs with indicators of impairment and, where relevant, the estimate of the fair values less costs to sell and the values in use, including determination of key assumptions.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
In addressing the risks, we considered the appropriateness of the defined CGUs within the businesses. We examined the methodology used by Management to assess the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment assigned to CGUs, and the process for identifying CGUs that required impairment testing to determine compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.

Bearing in mind the generally long-lived nature of the assets, the most critical assumptions in estimating the future cash flows are Management's long-term outlook for freight and terminal rates, volumes growth, bunker price and capital expenditures as well as determining the discount rates.

We performed detailed testing for the assets where indicators of impairment were identified. For those assets, we tested the fair values less costs to sell or the values in use, including analysed the reasonableness of key assumptions in relation to the ongoing operation of the assets.

We focused on this area, as the carrying amounts are significant and because Management is required to exercise considerable judgement because of the inherent complexity in estimating of the fair values less costs to sell or the values in use.
Reference is made to notes 7 and 25 in the consolidated financial statements.

We corroborated Management's estimates of future cash flows and challenged whether these are appropriate in respect of key assumptions, such as freight and terminal rates, volume growth, bunker price and capital expenditures.
We used our internal valuation specialists to independently calculate the discount rates. In calculating the discount rates, the key inputs used were independently sourced from market data, and we assessed the methodology applied. We compared the discount rates used by Management to our calculated rates.

Further, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant fair values less costs to sell and values in use models prepared by Management.

Statement on Directors' report
Management is responsible for Directors' Report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover Directors' Report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read Directors' Report and, in doing so, consider whether Directors' Report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, we considered whether Directors' Report includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Directors' Report is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Directors' Report.
Management's responsibilities for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

142 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Annual Report 2019

Financials

Independent Auditor's Report

In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material mis-
statement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's and the parent company's internal control. · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. · Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the

direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor's Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
