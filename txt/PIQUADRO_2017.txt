INFORMATION ON OPERATIONS
The Group's business
The Piquadro Group operates in the leather goods market and designs, manufactures and markets goods under its own brand names (Piquadro and The Bridge); these goods are distinguished by a focus on design and on technical and functional innovation, which is then transferred to the manufacture of bags, suitcases and accessories. The flexibility of the business model adopted by the Group allows it to maintain control over all of the critical phases of the production and distribution chain. Indeed, the Group carries out the design, planning, production, purchasing, quality, marketing, communication and distribution phases wholly within the confines of its organisation and only resorts to outsourcing for a part of the production activities, although it also retains control over the quality and efficiency of the phases that are currently outsourced. As regards Piquadro-branded products, as of 31 March 2018, part of the small leather goods and of some lines of briefcases, which accounts for about 34.9% of the Piquadro-branded turnover, were produced internally, through the Subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods Zhongshan Co. Ltd. at the plant located in Zhongshan in the region of Guangdong (People's Republic of China). Production activities, which are partially carried out by companies outside the Group for Piquadro and The Bridge-branded products, are outsourced to external suppliers of proven competence and quality, mainly located in China, Hong Kong, Italy, India and the Czech Republic. This activity is carried out on the basis of prototypes that are engineered and supplied by the Group, whose own employees then carry out direct checks of the quality of the manufactured products. The products are sold through a network of specialist stores that are able to enhance the prestige of the Piquadro and The Bridge brands. For this purpose, the Group makes use of a distribution network focused on two channels:
(i) a direct channel which, at 31 March 2018, included 63 directly operated single-brand stores (the socalled "Directly Operated Stores" or "DOSs), of which 55 Piquadro-brand stores and 8 The Bridgebrand stores;
(ii) an indirect channel (Wholesale), which is represented by multi-brand shops/department stores, singlebrand shops run by third parties linked to the Group by franchise agreements (51 shops at 31 March 2018, of which 44 Piquadro-brand stores and 7 The Bridge-brand stores) and by distributors who then resell the articles in specialist multi-brand shops.
In the financial year ended 31 March 2018, about 31% of the Group's consolidated revenues were achieved through the direct Piquadro-brand channel (+6.7% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017), while 44.6% was achieved through the indirect Piquadro-brand channel (+2.7% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017) and 24.3% through the sale of The Bridge-branded products.
Operations
In the financial year ended 31 March 2018 the Piquadro Group recorded, at revenue level, an increasing performance of 28.6% compared to the FY 2016/2017. In fact, the Piquadro Group reported net sales revenues equal to Euro 97,627 thousand compared to Euro 75,912 thousand recorded in the previous year. The increase in revenues, which is commented on in detail below in this Report, was attributable both to the inclusion of The Bridge S.p.A. in the consolidation area for the entire tax year and to an increase in sales of Piquadro-branded products (+4.3%). While excluding sales from The Bridge S.p.A., sales volumes, in terms of quantities sold during the financial year ended 31 March 2018, were equal to about 1,072 thousand units, down by about 4.2% compared to the value posted in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (about 1,119 thousand units sold). While excluding sales from The Bridge S.p.A., as regards average selling prices, the financial year ended 31 March 2018 reported an increase equal to about 4.3% compared to the previous year, including the mix effect.
Sales revenues
In the financial year ended 31 March 2018 the Piquadro Group reported sales revenues equal to Euro 97,627 thousand, up by 28.6% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. The increase in the turnover was determined both by the inclusion of The Bridge S.p.A. in the consolidation area for the entire tax year, which recorded revenues from sales of The Bridge-branded products for Euro 23,760 thousand, and by the growth of the sales of Piquadro-branded products, in particular in the DOS channel. The latter channel also includes the sales from the Group's e-commerce website, which showed an increase of 19.7% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. The relevant tables report the breakdown of sales revenues by brand (Piquadro and The Bridge). The brand is then further broken down into direct (DOS) and indirect (Wholesale) sales channels. The latter segment is not significant

for The Bridge brand: for this reason, the breakdown of the two channels is not commented on below in this Annual Financial Report. Below are reported the breakdowns of revenues by distribution channel and geographical area.

Breakdown of revenues by distribution channel

The table below reports the breakdown of consolidated sales revenues by distribution channel, expressed in thousands of Euro for the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017:

With reference to the Piquadro brand, the revenues reported by the DOS channel increased by 6.7% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017; this increase was mainly determined both by the marginal increase in the quantities sold in the already existing shops in the previous year. The DOS channel also included the sales from the Group's e-commerce website, which showed an increase of 19.7%. Assuming that the perimeter remained unchanged and then deducted the sales recorded by the shops which were not present in the previous financial year, the sales revenues reported by the DOS channel recorded an increase equal to about 3.3% (assuming an equal number of days of opening and constant rates of exchange, the Same Store Sales Growth ­ SSSG ­ figures reported an increase equal to about 3.4%).

The strategy planned by the Group is aimed at also developing sales activities through the DOS shops in view of the capacity to maximise the prestige of the Piquadro and The Bridge brands, in addition to allowing distribution to be controlled more directly and greater attention to be paid to satisfying the end consumer.

With reference to the Piquadro brand, sales reported by the Wholesale channel, which accounted for 44.6% of the Group's total turnover at 31 March 2018, recorded an increase of 2.7% compared to the FY 2016/2017. This increase was mainly driven by higher sales in domestic and European markets. The sales from the Wholesale channel in the domestic market, which account for 33.0% of consolidated sales (40.9% at 31 March 2017) showed an increase of 3.8%. Sales reported by the Wholesale channel in the European market, at 31 March 2018, accounted for 10.6% % of the Wholesale sales of the Piquadro Group, showing an increase of 13.3%. At 31 March 2018, sales reported by the Wholesale channel in the non-EU market accounted for 1.1% of consolidated sales (3.0% at 31 March 2017) showing a decrease of 54.4% (equal to about Euro 1.2 million).

Breakdown of revenues by geographical area The table below reports the breakdown of net revenues by geographical area (in thousands of Euro):

From a geographical point of view, at 31 March 2018, the Group's revenues showed an increase of 31.3% in the sales on the Italian market, which accounts for a percentage of the Group's total turnover which is still high, equal to 76.0% (74.5% of consolidated sales at 31 March 2017). Without considering the increase in revenues due to the sale of The Bridge-branded products, the sales relating to Piquadro-branded products in the Italian market showed an increase of 6.1%.

On the contrary, in the European market, the Group recorded a turnover of Euro 20.6 million, equal to 21.1% of consolidated sales (20.3% of consolidated sales at 31 March 2017), up by 33.6% compared to the FY 2016/2017. Without considering the increase in revenues due to the sale of The Bridge-branded products, the sales relating to Piquadro-branded products in the European market showed an increase of 9.8%. In the non-European geographical area (named "Rest of the World"), where the Group sells in 23 Countries, turnover decreased by 29.1% (equal to about Euro 1.1 million) compared to the FY 2016/2017.
To complete the analysis of turnover reported above, the Management believes that the main factors which had a significant impact on the Group's volume of sales revenues in the current financial year are linked to the following:
(i) inclusion of The Bridge S.p.A. in the consolidation area for the entire tax year; (ii) a positive SSSG data in the comparable Piquadro shops, equal to about 3.4% at current exchange rates; (iii) an increase in average prices, including the mix effect, equal to about 4.3% in the financial year ended 31
March 2018 compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017, net of the effect of the acquisition of The Bridge S.p.A.; (iv) an increase of 2.7% in the Wholesale turnover of Piquadro.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 saw a performance of the Group's profitability showing a sharp increase compared to the same period in the previous year, with an improved operating result compared to the FY 2016/2017 (from Euro 5,689 thousand ­ equal to 7.5% of total sales revenues - in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 7,871 thousand ­ equal to 8% of total sales revenues - in the financial year ended 31 March 2018). It should be noted that the operating result of the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 was affected by the positive effect, equal to Euro 1,088 thousand, relating to the disposal of the point of sale located at Saint Honoré, the only one managed by the French subsidiary Piquadro France SARL.
In the opinion of the Management, the performance of the operating result, compared to the previous financial year, was attributable to the combined effect of the following key factors:
d) an increased profitability in the DOS segment (DOSs and e-commerce) as a result of positive performances in terms of SSSG from Directly Operated Stores, specifically at the Italian shops, and of an increased profitability from sales recorded through the e-commerce website operated by the Group;
e) an increase in the margins from the Wholesale segment, as a result of higher sales; f) the contribution given by The Bridge S.p.A., whose positive differential at operating result level
was equal to about Euro 700 thousand.
In general the Piquadro Group reported an improvement in manufacturing margins, also due to a more favourable Euro/USD exchange rate, which affected direct production costs. At pre-tax result level, the Group recorded an improved result by 30.4%, from Euro 5,371 thousand at 31 March 2017 to Euro 7,006 thousand recorded in the financial year ended 31 March 2018.
Summary economic-financial data and alternative performance indicators
The Piquadro Group uses the Alternative Performance Indicators (APIs) in order to provide information on the performance of profitability of the businesses in which it operates, as well as on its own financial position and results of operations, in a more effective manner. In accordance with the guidelines published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA/2015/1415) on 5 October 2015 and consistently with the CONSOB notice no. 92543 of 3 December 2015, the content and the criterion to determine the APIs used in these financial statements are described below.
g) EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation, or Gross Operating Margin) is an economic indicator that is not defined by the International Accounting Standards. EBITDA is a unit of measurement utilised by the Management to monitor and assess the Group's operational performance. The Management believes that EBITDA is an important parameter for the measurement of the Group's performance, as it is not affected by the volatility due to the effects of the various criteria for the determination of taxable income, by the amount and characteristics of the capital employed, as well as by the amortisation and depreciation policies. EBITDA is defined as the Earnings for the period before depreciation and write-downs of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets, financial income and charges and the income taxes for the period.

h) Operating result (EBIT ­ Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is the Earnings for the period before financial income and charges and income taxes.

i) The Net Financial Position ("NFP") utilised as a financial indicator of borrowing, is represented

as the sum of the following positive and negative components of the Statement of Financial

Position, as required by CONSOB Notice no. 6064293 of 28 July 2006. Positive components: cash and cash equivalents, liquid securities under current assets, short-term financial receivables. Negative components: payables to banks, payables to other lenders, leasing and factoring Companies. j) The ROI, i.e. the return on net invested capital, is given by the ratio of net Operating Margin to net invested capital (for the related breakdown reference is made to the paragraph on the

"Balance sheet" structure) and is expressed as a percentage. This indicator is used as a financial

target in both internal (business plans) and external (analysists and investors) presentations and intends to measure the ability to produce wealth through operations and therefore to remunerate both net worth and borrowed capital. k) The ROE, i.e. the return on equity, is given by the ratio of net profit to equity and is expressed as a percentage. This indicator is used as a financial target in both internal (business plans) and external (analysists and investors) presentations and intends to measure the profitability obtained

by investors on account of risks.

l) The ROS, i.e. the average operating result by revenue unit. This ratio expresses the Company's profitability in relation to the revenue flow's ability to generate remuneration.
m) Net Working Capital: this item includes "Trade receivables", "Inventories", current non-financial "Other Receivables", net of "Trade payables" and current non-financial "Other Payables".
n) The cash flow is given by cash flows from operating activities (operating cash flow), net of distributed dividends. The operating cash flow is calculated on the basis of the gross operating margin, to which must be added the changes in net working capital, net of increases in the

provision for bad debts, the uses of the provisions for risks and the Staff Severance Pay, operating

and financial investments, financial income and charges and taxes. This indicator is used as a financial target in both internal (business plans) and external (analysists and investors) presentations and intends to measure the Company's ability to generate cash and therefore its ability to self-finance its operations.

Non-recurring EBITDA in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 included the effects arising from the disposal of the DOS store located in Paris at Rue Saint Honoré, which took place on 26 July 2016, including the capital gain realised, as well as the revenues realised and the costs incurred by Piquadro France SARL in the financial year ended 31 March 2017. While not considering non-recurring elements, EBITDA for the FY 2017/2018 amounted to Euro 10.8 million, up by about 45.5% compared to the recurring EBITDA at 31 March 2017, equal to about Euro 7.4 million.
The Group's amortisation and depreciation were equal to Euro 2,746 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 (Euro 2,540 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2017) and are broken down as follows: Euro 711 thousand relating to intangible assets and Euro 2,035 thousand relating to property, plant and equipment.
Net write-downs, equal to Euro 165 thousand, mainly related to the write-down of furniture and fittings of some points of sales in Asia and to the closure of the point of sale located in Russia.

Non-recurring EBIT in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 included the effects arising from the disposal of the DOS store located in Paris at Rue Saint Honoré, as already referred to above; therefore, net of this effect, EBIT at 31 March 2018 showed an increase of about 71.0% compared to the previous financial year.

The result from financial operations, which posted a negative value of Euro 866 thousand (against a negative value of Euro 318 thousand at 31 March 2017), was mainly attributable to the differential between foreign exchange gains and losses, equal to Euro 456 thousand at 31 March 2018 (against a positive value of Euro 128 thousand at 31 March 2017), as well as to the costs relating to the adjustment to the value of the option for the acquisition of The Bridge S.p.A. made by an independent appraiser, equal to about Euro 104 thousand, in addition to the performance of net financial debt.

The pre-tax result recorded by the Group in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 came to about Euro 7,006 thousand (up by 30% against the value recorded in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, equal to Euro 5,371 thousand) and was affected by income taxes, including the effects of deferred taxation, equal to Euro 2,233 thousand (Euro 1,966 thousand at 31 March 2017), at an overall tax rate amounting to 31.8% compared to 36.6% of the previous financial year.

The results obtained in the last financial year were positive and were achieved through increased efficiency in the design, manufacturing and distribution processes, as a result of constant and ever increasing research to optimise the flows of the entire process (from product development to distribution to the end consumer) and through the strengthening of the typical consumer's brand perception.

Increases in property, plant and equipment, equal to Euro 1,213 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 (Euro 1,375 thousand at 31 March 2017) were mainly attributable to the sundry equipment purchased for new DOSs opened in the period under consideration and the refurbishment of some existing shops for Euro 991 thousand, purchases of workshop plant and machinery for Euro 201 thousand and the refurbishment of premises at the Company's headquarters for Euro 21 thousand.

The main reasons for the trend in the Net Financial Position, compared to 31 March 2017, are attributable to the following factors:
· an operating free cash flow of Euro 9.9 million for the period; · the payment of dividends of Euro 2.0 million; · investments of Euro 1.7 million in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; · an increase of Euro 1.6 million in other working capital items.

Human Resources

The products that the Group offers are conceived, manufactured and distributed according to the guidelines of an organisational model whose feature is that it monitors all the most critical phases of the chain, from conception and manufacturing to subsequent distribution. This entails great care with the correct management of human resources, which, while respecting the different local environments in which the Group operates, must necessarily lead to intense personal involvement, above all in what the Group considers the strategic phases for the success of the brands. As at 31 March 2018 the Group had 805 members of staff compared to 761 units at 31 March 2017. The change was mainly due to an increase in the units of both the Italian companies for the Group's point of sales and the subsidiary. Below is reported the breakdown of staff by Country:

Country Italy China Hong Kong Germany Spain Taiwan France Switzerland UK Russia USA Total

31 March 2018 385 337 5 1 19 17 0 4 6 27 4 805

31 March 2017 358 325 7 1 15 18 0 4 5 24 4 761

With reference to the Group's organisational structure, at 31 March 2018, 32.3% of staff operated in the Production area, 33.9% in the Retail area, 21.2% in the support functions (Administration, IT Systems, Purchasing, Human Resources, Marketing, etc.), 8.0% in the Research and Development area and 4.6% in the Sales area.

Corporate social responsibility
The Piquadro Group has been committed to corporate social responsibility starting from 2010, when the Parent Company started its first solidarity initiative in support of local areas, the "Happy Box" project implemented in cooperation with the Palmieri Family Foundation established by Marco Palmieri, Chairman of Piquadro, and by his wife Beatrice in order to give continuity to their philanthropic activity through the enhancement of diversities. As an acknowledgment of its value to local areas, the project obtained the Sponsorship of the Municipality of Bologna.
Health, safety and environment
For the Piquadro Group, safety and working environments are protected by complying with the regulations in force in the individual countries. The Group is committed to pursuing high standards in the protection of the health and safety of its employees at work; in this regard, the Italian companies have adopted a specific management procedure, including a "safety organisation chart", which has been prepared following the analysis and assessment of risks arising at work and from the duties performed by employees. The Piquadro Group takes actions to ensure the physical and moral integrity of its own in-house employees and collaborators, as well as working conditions that respect the personal dignity in a safe and healthy workplace, in full compliance with the current regulations governing the prevention of accidents at work and the protection of workers. In the course of the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Italian companies continued their path to the implementation of an increasingly efficient system of measures aimed at improving safety at work on an ongoing basis, while monitoring, among other things, any possible near-miss and exhorting its employees to report any possible critical issues regarding safety. Piquadro believes that the desired benefits can be multiplied only through the implementation of a shared system and the main tool to achieve these objectives lies in the compliance by the entire workforce with the safety policies adopted.

PIQUADRO GROUP

Therefore, the Company is committed to spreading a well-established safety culture, among all its in-house workers and collaborators, while developing risk awareness and promoting a responsible behaviour on the part of its personnel. Furthermore, the Group's Code of Ethics requires the commitment of all collaborators in order to give their contribution to risk prevention and the protection of their own health and safety, as well as of that of their colleagues and third parties, without prejudice to the individual responsibilities pursuant to the provisions of law governing the matter. For this purpose, it calls for a general absolute prohibition, within the scope of the Company's activities, on the abuse of alcohol or the use of drugs, as well as the prohibition on smoking at work, in compliance with the provisions of law and in any case wherever smoking might entail a danger to the Company's facilities and assets or to the health or safety of colleagues and third parties. The system implemented by the Italian Group companies also considers the risks of interference that can arise inside the points of sales and, in this regard, training course requirements have been also met within the retail system.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY
The Piquadro brand's Research and Development activity is carried out by the Parent Company in house through a dedicated team that currently consists of 15 persons mainly engaged in the product Research and Development department and the style office at the head office of the Company. Furthermore, the plants of the Chinese subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods Zhongshan Co. Ltd. employ a team of 31 people dedicated to prototyping and the implementation of new models according to the instructions defined by the central organisation. Piquadro-branded products are conceived within the Group and occasionally in collaboration with outside industrial designers, taking account of the information regarding market trends supplied by the Group's internal departments (Product Management and Sales departments). In this manner, the Group develops its collections trying to meet the needs of end customers that are not yet satisfied by the market. The internal unit dedicated to the design of products manages operating activities and also coordinates the external consultants of which the Group makes use. In some cases, in fact, the Group only uses external designers for the product design phase, while the development and implementation phase is in any case carried out in house.
In the financial year ended 31 March 2018 the Group's Research and Development activity for the Piquadro brand was particularly focused on the development of travel products, which will be strategic in next years, by setting up and putting collections such as PC2Plus and Seeker on the market, in addition to the development of a new line named "CUBICA". The CONNEQU App, which is the core of the BAGMOTIC project and which allows for new opportunities of interaction with suitcases and bags, was upgraded with new functionalities during the year; the new products are now equipped with i) an integrated battery that recharges smartphones and tablets simply by contact, ii) an alert device for theft or loss, iii) a device to check the remaining battery level of the powerbank, iv) a handle used to weigh the trolley and to provide information on which airlines allow passengers to take it in the cabin, v) a Bluetooth padlock and vi) a device named Tracker GSM Wi-Fi that allows its traceability all over the world. Efforts continued which were devoted to setting up the new continuous collections, in particular for the BRIEF line created with a technical fabric and washed leather.
On the contrary, the Research and Development activity involving The Bridge brand is carried out by subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A. through a team of 18 people.
RELATIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
The "Regulation bearing provisions governing transactions with related parties" was adopted by CONSOB Resolution no. 17221 of 12 March 2010, as amended by CONSOB resolution no. 17389 of 23 June 2010. On 18 November 2010 the Board of Directors of Piquadro S.p.A. adopted the procedure concerning related parties, which was also drawn up by taking account of the instructions subsequently provided by CONSOB for the application of the new regulations by DEM/10078683 notice of 24 September 2010.

PERFORMANCE OF PIQUADRO S.p.A.

In reporting the performance of the Group, the main events were already implicitly illustrated in relation to the Parent Company whose revenues from the separate financial statements, including relations with Group Companies, account for about 72% of consolidated revenues.

Operations
The financial year ended 31 March 2018 saw an increase in sales revenues equal to 4.9% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. The performance of revenues, which is commented on in detail below in this Report, mainly derives from the domestic market, where the Company holds a leadership position. As regards average selling prices of Piquadro-branded products, the financial year ended 31 March 2018 reported an increase equal to about 4.3%, including the mix effect.

Sales revenues
In the financial year ended 31 March 2018 the Company reported net sales revenues equal to Euro 70,505 thousand, up by 4.9% compared to the revenues reported in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (Euro 67,240 thousand). The performance of revenues is attributable to the positive performances recorded both in the domestic market (+7.3%), in the European market (+6.7%), and in the DOS and Wholesale channels; Italy reported revenues up by 7.3% compared to the previous financial year, while Europre showed an increase of 6.7% compared to the previous year and the Rest of the World recorded a decrease of 45.8% due to a reduction in the orders mainly relating to the Asia and US areas.

Breakdown of revenues by distribution channel

The table below reports the breakdown of sales revenues of Piquadro S.p.A. by distribution channel, expressed in thousands of Euro for the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017:

4.9%

The revenues reported by the DOS channel increased by 9.2% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017; this rise was determined by a general increase in sales revenues arising from a strategy planned by the Company and aimed at developing sales activities through the DOS shops in view of the capacity to maximise the prestige of the Piquadro brand, in addition to allowing distribution to be controlled more directly and greater attention to be paid to satisfying the end consumer.

Sales reported by the Wholesale channel, which account for about 61.6% of the Company's total turnover, recorded an increase of 2.3% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017 and were mainly affected from the increase both in the domestic and European markets.

31 March 2017

5,280

EBITDA for the period came to Euro 9.4 million against Euro 6.2 million reported in the FY 2016/2017, accounting for 13.3% of the Company's revenues at 31 March 2018 (9.2% in the financial year ended 31 March 2017).

In the FY 2017/2018, the Company used Euro 3.6 million for marketing and communication activities, in order to develop and promote the Piquadro brand (Euro 3.7 million in the FY 2016/2017).

During the financial year ended 31 March 2018 amortisation and depreciation amounted to about Euro 1,790 thousand (about Euro 1,835 thousand at 31 March 2017). The accrual to the provision for bad debts from customers amounted to Euro 600 thousand (Euro 440 thousand at 31 March 2017).

The result from financial operations, which posted a negative value equal to about -Euro 112 thousand (against a positive value of Euro 9 thousand at 31 March 2017), was attributable to the adjustment to the value of investee The Bridge, defined by an independent appraiser, for Euro 180 thousand, as well as to the differential between foreign exchange gains and losses which posted a negative value equal to Euro 431 thousand at 31 March 2018 (against a positive value equal to Euro 179 thousand at 31 March 2017) and to a positive value of Euro 220 thousand arising from the net effect resulting from the write-down and revaluation of equity investments held by the Parent Company (for more details, see note 34).

The pre-tax result recorded by the Company in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 came to Euro 7.3 million (Euro 4.3 million at 31 March 2017) and was affected by income taxes, including the effects of deferred taxation, equal to about Euro 2.0 million for an overall tax rate amounting to 26.9% (30.9% for the financial year ended 31 March 2017).

The net result recorded by the Company in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 recorded an increase of 75.6%, from Euro 3.0 million in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 5.3 million in the financial year ended 31 March 2018.

The main reasons for the performance of the Net Financial Position are attributable to the following factors:
· a Free cash flow of about Euro 8.5 million generated in the year; · dividends paid in relation to the profit for the FY 2016/2017 equal to Euro 2.0 million (with a pay-out
equal to about 66.6% of the operating profit of the Company); · investments in property, plant and equipment for Euro 211 thousand, in intangible assets for Euro 730
thousand and non-current financial assets for Euro 506 thousand; · an increase of Euro 2.6 million in other items relating to working capital.

Human Resources

The products that the Company offers are conceived, manufactured and distributed according to the guidelines of an organisational model whose feature is that it monitors all the most critical phases of the chain, from conception and manufacturing to subsequent distribution. This entails great care with the correct management of human resources, which must necessarily lead to intense personal involvement, above all in what the Company considers the strategic phases for the success of the Piquadro brand. As at 31 March 2018 Piquadro S.p.A. had 284 members of staff, compared to 266 units at 31 March 2017. Below is reported the breakdown of staff by area:

Health, safety and environment
Piquadro S.p.A. continues to pursue high standards in the protection of the health and safety of its employees at work. The Company continued its path to the improvement of collective awareness of safety issues during the financial year ended 31 March 2018. In particular the prevention and protection measures aimed at improving safety on an ongoing basis are becoming increasingly specific and verifiable. During the period under consideration, data on accidents are completely encouraging since no significant critical issues can be found which relate to workplaces and/or the working conditions of operators. The recording of possible Near Miss events constitutes an active safety management tool, as well as a method to spread the culture of "Shares Responsibility". At all company levels, the safety asset is regarded as a whole. Work cannot disregard the check of safety conditions. Furthermore, Piquadro's policy is also shared with outsourcers, such as suppliers and maintainers, through a careful selection of eligible firms and active supervision. This shared system is expected to be able to positively affect the performance of the whole product chain throughout the sales network spread all over the country. As regards the retail channel, the efforts are above all evident which relate to the management of so-called "risks of interference" and to the management of training course requirements of a type of workers which is always very dynamic. The same attention paid to workers' health and safety issues was also confirmed in relation to environment. It is confirmed that Piquadro's activity has no impact on the environment and does not present characteristics such as to be capable of causing events with negative effects on the territory and the environment. The good relations with the closest stakeholders and the Local Entities confirm a total absence of critical issues.
Relations with related parties
The "Regulation bearing provisions governing transactions with related parties", which was adopted by CONSOB Resolution no. 17221 of 12 March 2010, as amended by CONSOB resolution no. 17389 of 23 June 2010, implemented article 2391-bis of the Italian Civil Code. On 18 November 2010 the Company's Board of Directors adopted the procedure concerning related parties, which was also drawn up by taking account of the instructions subsequently provided by CONSOB for the application of the new regulations by DEM/10078683 notice of 24 September 2010. The said procedure, which is published on the website of Piquadro (www.piquadro.com), has the purpose to determine the criteria to be complied with for the approval of the transactions with related parties to be effected by Piquadro or its subsidiaries, in order to ensure transparency, as well as the material and procedural correctness of the transactions themselves. The identification of the transactions with related parties is made as required by the CONSOB regulation referred to. In the financial year ended 31 March 2018 several intergroup transactions were effected, all of which were implemented within the ordinary course of business and at arm's length. Intergroup relations concerned both production activities (Piquadro S.p.A. directly controls Companies which produce leather goods for the Group) and commercial activities (Piquadro S.p.A. directly or indirectly controls all foreign Companies in the retail chain which manage Piquadro-branded shops). The Companies in the Piquadro Group also maintain financial relations, which were also established within the ordinary course of business and at arm's length. Relations with related parties are largely commented on in the separate financial statements under Note 38 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE YEAR-END 2 June 2018 saw the execution of the contract for the sale and the completion of the acquisition of Lancel International S.A. ("Lancel International") ­ a Swiss company wholly owned by the Richemont Group, which owns the "Lancel" brand and holds 99.9958% of the share capital of the French company Lancel Sogedi S.A. and of the Spanish and Italian companies that operate the Lancel boutiques opened in Spain and Italy (Lancel International and its subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as the "Lancel Group"). Maison Lancel, which is based in Paris and was founded in 1876, creates and distributes quality luxury leather goods, as well as stylish gifts and accessories, for men and women. Maison Lancel has developed a selected network of 60 DOSs and 11 franchise stores. Lancel operates in 39 countries, including China, through its retail and wholesale sales network. During the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Lancel Group achieved sales of Euro 50 million. Richemont will receive a share of profits realised by the Lancel Group during the ten years after the closing as consideration for the acquisition; the total share of profits that may be allocated to Richemont based on this mechanism may not exceed Euro 35 million.
OUTLOOK During the FY 2018/2019 the Piquadro Group will even more speed up its process of international expansion, also as a result of the acquisition of Maison Lancel. Therefore, the Management expects that in the FY 2018/2019 the Group's turnover will achieve, including the acquisition of Lancel International SA, sales in an amount of around Euro 150 million and record growth rates, the perimeter remaining equal, in line with those recorded in the financial year ended 31 March 2018. As regards the profitability, the Management expects, within the current perimeter that includes the Piquadro and The Bridge brands, increased manufacturing margins, even when the EUR/USD exchange rate remains in line with the previous year. The Management will monitor margins and operating costs and work hardly to implement the turnaround of Maison Lancel, in order to be able to increase commitments in Research and Development and to increase visibility and knowledge of the brands at an international level. In light of the information commented on above and of the financial and capital soundness of the Piquadro Group, the consolidated financial statements and the separate financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. were prepared on a going concern basis.

OTHER INFORMATION
The Group's business is generally exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Piquadro Group's financial risks are managed centrally within precise organisational policies which govern the management of the risks and the control of all the transactions which are closely relevant to the composition of financial and/or trade assets and liabilities.
In order to minimise these risks, the Group has established control times and methods which allow the Board of Directors to give its approval as to all transactions which bind the Group to third-party lenders.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to ensure that it is able to meet its financial obligations at any time, maintaining an adequate level of available cash and diversifying the instruments for raising financial resources by obtaining adequate credit lines. The Group keeps a surplus of credit lines available in order to be able to take up business opportunities that cannot be planned for or in order to cover unexpected cash outflows. The excess cash is invested temporarily on the money market in transactions that can be liquidated immediately. The essential tool for the measurement, management and daily monitoring of the liquidity risk is the cash budget, which provides an overview of the liquidity that is always up-to-date. Daily planning and cash flow forecasts are carried out on the basis of this overview. It is believed that the funds and credit lines currently available, in addition to the cash flow generated by the business, will suffice to meet the Group requirements.
Credit risk
The credits of the Group, particularly in Italy, are rather fragmented as a result of sales being to a diverse clientele that is made up of leather goods retailers, stationery retailers and international distributors or, through the sales of the DOS channel, end consumers. Receivables outstanding at the end of the financial year were mainly trade receivables, as resulting from the explanatory notes to the statement of financial position to which reference is made. Historically there have not been any significant or particularly problematic situations regarding the solvency of customers, insomuch as it is the Group's policy to sell to customers after assessing carefully their credit rating and therefore remaining within prefixed credit limits, periodically monitoring the situation of expired loans. Accordingly, the credit risk to which the Group is exposed is considered to be limited as a whole.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the currency parities could change in an unfavourable way in the period between the moment in which the target exchange rate is defined, that is the date when commitments arise to receive and pay amounts in foreign currency at a future date, and the time at which those commitments become firstly orders and finally turnover (for purchase or sale). In the absence of foreign exchange risk hedging on specific commercial transactions, there is no application of hedge accounting.
The Group pays the contract work done (external production) in US dollars, while the wages and salaries relating to the employees of the subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods Zhongshan Co. Ltd. are paid in Renminbi. The operating costs incurred by the Company and by the Group's European subsidiaries are mainly denominated in Euro. The result of this is that the net result of the Group is partially affected by the fluctuations of the exchange rate between USD and the Euro and, to a lesser extent, between the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Parent Company carried out currency (USD) forward purchases in order to hedge expected payments of invoices of foreign subcontractors and of the subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods Zhongshan Co. Ltd. If these derivative financial instruments have fulfilled all the conditions laid down for the accounting treatment of hedging derivatives (hedge accounting), they are accounted for at fair value against an entry in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of an uncontrolled increase in charges arising from the payment of real floating interest rate on medium- to long-term loans raised by the Group.
PIQUADRO GROUP
27

The purpose of the interest risk management is to limit and stabilise payable flows due to interest paid on such loans. Hedging activities were carried out on every occasion that it was considered useful with regard to the taking out of loans. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposure to interest rate risks. However, in cases in which the derivative financial instruments do not fulfil all the conditions laid down for the accounting treatment of hedging derivatives (hedge accounting), these have been accounted for at fair value against an entry in the Income Statement. The forecast outflows, connected with the repayment of the liability, are determined by making reference to the provisions laid down in the loan agreement (amortisation schedule).

Delegated powers to increase Share Capital and authorisations to purchase treasury shares
No delegated powers to increase the Share Capital had been granted as at the date of this Report.
The Shareholders' Meeting of Piquadro held on 20 July 2017 resolved to authorise a plan for the purchase of the Company's ordinary shares, in one or more instalments, up to the maximum number permitted by law, having regard to the treasury shares held directly and to those held by Subsidiary companies.
The authorisation to purchase treasury shares was granted up to the approval of the financial statements at 31 March 2018, while the authorisation to dispose of them was granted without any time limit.
The plan to purchase treasury shares pursues the following objectives: (a) to support stabilisation of the stock performance and liquidity, and, in this framework, to acquire the
Company's shares at prices lower than their actual value, based on the income prospects of the business, with the consequent enhancement of the Company; (b) to establish an "inventory of securities" so that the Issuer may maintain, and dispose of, shares for a possible use of the same as consideration in extraordinary operations, including in exchange of equity investments, with other parties within transactions of interest to the Company itself.
The purchase price of the shares will be identified from time to time, having regard to the methods selected to carry out the transaction and in accordance with the legislative, regulatory provisions or permitted market practices, within a minimum and maximum number that can be determined according to the following criteria: (i) in any case, the minimum consideration for the purchase shall not be less, by 20%, than the reference price
that the stock shall have recorded on the trading day prior to every individual transaction; (ii) in any case, the maximum consideration for the purchase shall not be higher, by 10%, than the reference
price that the stock shall have recorded on the trading day prior to every individual transaction.
Except for the implementation of the distribution plans, with or without payment, of options on shares or shares, which will take place at the prices set in the plans themselves, the consideration for any other sale of treasury shares, which will be set by the Board with the right of sub-delegating powers to one or more Directors, may not be less, by 20% at least, than the reference price that the stock shall have recorded on the trading day prior to every individual transaction.
Purchases may take place according to methods other than those specified above pursuant to article 132, paragraph 3, of the TUF or other provisions applicable from time to time at the time of the transaction.

The disposal of the shares may take place according to the most appropriate methods in the interests of the Company, and in any case in accordance with the applicable regulations and the permitted market practices. Except for the implementation of the distribution plans, with or without payment, of options on shares or shares, which will take place at the prices set in the plans themselves, the consideration for any other sale of treasury shares, which will be set by the Board with the right of sub-delegating powers to one or more Directors, may not be less, by 20% at least, than the reference price that the stock shall have recorded on the trading day prior to every individual transaction. Piquadro, in accordance with the terms and conditions and according to the procedures set out in the regulations in force, is required to notify the competent Authorities of the transactions of purchase or sale carried out, in terms of number of shares acquired/sold, average price, total number of shares acquired/sold as at the date of the notice and the amount invested on the same date. As at the date of this Report, no transaction had been carried out for the purchase of treasury shares on the part of the Company and the Company did not hold any treasury share. Clauses of Change of control Neither Piquadro S.p.A. nor any of its subsidiaries have entered into significant agreements which become effective, are amended or are terminated in case of change of control of the contracting Company. Indemnity due to the Directors in the case of resignation, dismissal or termination of the relationship following a takeover bid No agreements have been entered into between the Company and the Directors which provide for indemnities in the case of resignation or dismissal/disqualification without cause or if the employment relationship is terminated following a take-over bid.

Sales revenues achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 reported an increase of 28.6% compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017, from Euro 75,912 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 97,627 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2018. The increase in sales revenues arises from the positive performance recorded in the DOS channel and from the inclusion of The bridge S.p.A. in the consolidation area for a total of 12 months (in the previous financial year the revenues of The Bridge only related to the first three months of 2017). Below are reported the breakdowns of revenues by distribution channel:

Piquadro Wholesale channel

Sales revenues achieved in the Wholesale channel in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 reported an increase equal to 2.7%, from Euro 42,423 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 43,565 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2018. This increase was mainly driven by higher sales in domestic and European markets. The sales in the Wholesale channel in the domestic market, which account for 33.0% % of consolidated sales (40.9 % at 31 March 2017) showed an increase of 3.8%. At 31 March 2018 the sales in the Wholesale channel in the European market accounted for 17.2% of sales recorded by the Piquadro Group in the Wholesale channel, showing an increase of 13.3%. At 31 March 2018 the sales in the Wholesale channel in the non-EU market accounted for 1.1% of consolidated sales (3.0% at 31 March 2017), showing a reduction of 54.0%.

In the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Group opened 7 new franchise shops (as at 31 March 2018, the franchise shops opened were 45) of which 2 in Italy, 2 in Europe and 3 in the Rest of the World and closed 8 shops, of which 2 in Italy and 6 in the Rest of the World.

Piquadro DOSs

Sales revenues achieved in the DOS Channel - which includes sales generated from the e-commerce website of the Group, showing an increase of 19.7% - in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 reported an increase of 6.7%, from Euro 28,405 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 30,303 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2018. In terms of impact on the total sales revenues, the values in the DOS channel remained in line, in percentage terms, with those posted in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (an impact of 41.0% at 31 March 2018 against a percentage of 40.1% in the FY 2016/2017). The increase, which is equal to Euro 1,898 thousand in absolute terms, is also due to the following factors:
(i) an increase in the quantities sold, equal to about 12.8%; (ii) SSSG, which recorded an increase, in the tax year ended 31 March 2018, equal to 3.3% (assuming an equal
number of days of opening and constant rates of exchange, the Same Store Sales Growth ­ SSSG- reported an increase equal to about 3.4%); (iii) the opening by the Group of 3 new DOS shops (as detailed below) during the financial year ended 31 March 2018, which entailed an increase in turnover equal to Euro 300 thousand (corresponding to a growth of about 1.1% in the total turnover from the DOS channel); (iv) the opening by the Group of 2 new DOS shops (as detailed below) during the financial year ended 31 March 2017 which contributed, for twelve months, to the turnover recorded at 31 March 2018 and which entailed an increase in turnover equal to Euro 1,000 thousand (corresponding to a growth of about 3.5% in the total turnover from the DOS channel);

PIQUADRO GROUP
39

(v) 3 shops were closed (of which 1 in Italy, 1 in Russia and 1 in Asia) which accounted for Euro 543 thousand, equal to about 1.9% of the turnover in the DOS channel of the previous year.

In general, it should be noted that in the DOS channel one of the significant factors for achieving high volumes of sales is the position of the outlets. Indeed, the Group tries to open its points of sale in the main streets (business and/or shopping ways) of each city in which it operates; such strategy has had a positive effect in terms of increase in sales revenues. Placing stores in strategic areas involves higher initial costs in some cases (with the payment, in some cases, of key money, especially in Europe) and subsequently higher rental charges compared to less central locations; however, these costs are subsequently recovered thanks to the higher sales volumes that the strategic position allows to achieve. During the FY 2017/2018 the Group did not pay any key money. The opening of the DOSs in outlets allows the Group to dispose of those product stock which, for a variety of reasons (change in colour fashions, end of range etc.), could be difficult to sell at the full selling price, in this way solving the problems linked to possible obsolescence of inventories of finished products. On the basis of the data processed by the Company in relation to the turnover per individual Piquadro shop, the perimeter remaining unchanged (Same Store Sales Growth analysis, "SSSG", or considering the same DOS points of sale existing as at both 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018), the performance in the turnover of the DOS channel showed an increase of about 3.3% (assuming an equal number of days of opening and constant rates of exchange, the Same Store Sales Growth ­ SSSG - reported an increase equal to about 3.4%). For a better understanding of the DOS channel, below are reported the 63 shops which were opened as at 31 March 2018, together with the month of the start of operations:

EBITDA and operating result
As per the details provided in the previous paragraphs as to the changes that occurred in any individual Income Statement item in the financial years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2018, in general the increase in EBITDA was attributable to the contribution given by The Bridge S.p.A. for Euro 1,196 thousand and by the improvement in profitability of the Piquadro brand, against the capital gain generated from the disposal of the shop located in Paris, at Rue Saint Honoré, in the previous year ended 31 March 2017.

The table below reports the data relating to the EBITDA, broken down by sales channel, and to the Group's operating result, for the financial years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017:

Specifically, EBITDA increased from Euro 8,794 thousand (11.6% of revenues) in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 10,782 thousand (11.0% of revenues) in the financial year ended 31 March 2018; the operating result increased from Euro 5,689 thousand (7.5% as a percentage impact on revenues) in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to Euro 7,871 thousand (8.1% as a percentage impact on revenues) in the financial year ended 31 March 2018.

In the opinion of the Management, the performance of the operating result, compared to the previous financial year, was attributable to the combined effect of the following key factors:
o) an increased profitability in the DOS segment (DOSs and e-commerce) as a result of positive performances in terms of SSSG from Directly Operated Stores, specifically at the Italian and Russian shops, and of an increased profitability from sales recorded through the e-commerce website operated by the Group;
p) an increase in the margins from the Wholesale segment, as a result of an increase in turnover both in the domestic market and in the European market;
q) the consolidation of The Bridge S.p.A. for the entire financial year ended 31 March 2018 (the epriod of consolidation for the previous year had been equal to 3 months), whose positive contribution at operating result level was equal to about Euro 768 thousand;
r) an increase in personnel costs, which was also due to higher costs recorded following the strengthening of the Group's corporate structure;
s) the disposal of the point of sale located at Saint Honoré, which was the only shop operated by the French subsidiary Piquadro France SARL and which had generated, during the financial year ended 31 March 2017, a positive effect of Euro 1,088 thousand on the operating result;
t) lower write-down of assets for about Euro 400 thousand, which had been due to the closure of the point of sale located in Paris, at Rue Saint Honoré, in the previous year.

The increase in financial charges at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 was mainly attributable to higher foreign exchange losses, both realised and estimated, for Euro 613 thousand (about Euro 1,146 thousand at 31 March 2018 and about Euro 533 thousand at 31 March 2017), as well as to the charges arising from the evaluation of the option for the acquisition of 20% of the share capital of The Bridge S.p.A., equal to Euro 104 thousand, net of additional charges included in the financial statements at 31 March 2017, equal to Euro 332 thousand and relating to the acquisition of The Bridge S.p.A. Financial income and charges of The Bridge S.p.A. recorded a negative balance of Euro (143) thousand at 31 March 2018, showing a deterioration of about Euro 73 thousand compared to the corresponding value at 31 March 2017 as a result of foreign exchange losses of Euro 16 thousand, higher financial costs for Euro 80 thousand determined by the collection of sales invoices, due to the different period of consolidation in the two financial years, as well as of lower bank charges for Euro 40 thousand and charges arising from the discounting-back of the staff severance pay for about Euro 20 thousand.

PIQUADRO GROUP
56

The Group's business
Piquadro S.p.A. (hereinafter also referred to as "Piquadro", the "Company" or "the Parent Company") and its Subsidiaries (collectively "the Piquadro Group" or "the Group") design, produce and market leather goods - bags, suitcases and accessories - characterised by attention to design and functional and technical innovation. The Company was established on 26 April 2005. The Share Capital has been subscribed through the contribution of the branch of business relating to operating activities on the part of the former Piquadro S.p.A (now Piqubo S.p.A., the ultimate company controlling the Company), which became effective for legal, accounting and tax purposes on 2 May 2005. Effective from 14 June 2007, the registered office of Piquadro S.p.A. was moved from Riola di Vergato (Bologna), via Canova no. 123/O-P-Q-R to Località Sassuriano 246, Silla di Gaggio Montano (Bologna). As of today's date, the Company is owned by Marco Palmieri through Piqubo S.p.A., which is 100% owned. Piqubo S.p.A., in fact, holds 93.34% of the Share Capital of Piquadro Holding S.p.A., which in its turn holds 68.37% of the Share Capital of Piquadro S.p.A., a Company which is listed on the Milan Stock Exchange since 25 October 2007. It should be noted that for a better understanding of the economic performance of the Company and of the Group, reference is made to the extensive information reported in the Report on operations prepared by the Directors. The data of these financial statements can be compared to the same of the previous financial year, except as reported below.
These financial statements were prepared by the Board of Directors on 11 June 2018 and will be submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting called on first call for 19 July 2018.
Main events that occurred in the course of the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and related significant accounting effects
No events are reported which occurred during the financial year ended 31 March 2018, with significant accounting effects.
Structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the relevant Accounting Standards
In compliance with Regulation (EU) no. 1606/2002, the consolidated financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. at 31 March 2018 were prepared in accordance with the IAS/IFRS (International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, hereinafter also referred to as "IFRS") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and endorsed by the European Union, as supplemented by the related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), which was previously named Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), as well as by the related measures issued in the implementation of article 9 of Legislative Decree no. 38/2005.
Basis of preparation
This document reports the consolidated financial statements, including the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated Income Statement, the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the consolidated cash flow statement and the statement of changes in consolidated equity for the financial years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 and the related explanatory notes. IFRS means all the "International Financial Reporting Standards" (IFRS), all the International Accounting Standards (IAS), all the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), previously named Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). Specifically, it should be noted that IFRS were consistently applied to all periods presented in this document.
As to the procedures for presentation of the financial statements' schedules, the Company adopted the distinction "current/non-current" for the statement of financial position, the single-step scheme for the Income Statement, classifying costs by nature and the indirect method of representation for the Cash Flow Statement. The Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented in a separate document, as permitted by IAS 1 (revised) with respect to the Income Statement. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in Euro, i.e. the current money used in the economies in which the Group mainly operates.

(*) Piquadro UK Limited has made use of the right of exemption from control for 2016 according to the provisions of the New Section 479A of the 2006 Companies Act. For this purpose it is stated that Piquadro UK Limited is included in this Annual Financial Report.

All Group Companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

There are no differences relating to the consolidation area compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2017.

Accounting policies

The accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements at 31 March 2018, which do not differ from those used in the previous financial year, are indicated below.

Consolidation criteria and techniques

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and of the Companies over which it exercises control, either directly or indirectly, starting from the date when the control was acquired up to the date when control ceases. In this case, control is exercised both by virtue of the direct or indirect possession of the majority of voting shares and as a result of the exercise of a dominant influence expressed by the power to affect, also indirectly by virtue of contractual or legal agreements, the financial and operational decisions of the entities, obtaining the relative benefits thereof, also regardless of shareholding relations. The existence of potential voting rights exercisable as at the reporting date is taken into account for the purposes of determining control.

The Companies that the Parent Company Piquadro S.p.A. controls, either directly or indirectly, and either legally or in practice, are consolidated according to the line-by-line consolidation method, which consists in reporting all the asset and liability items in their entirety from the date on which control was acquired up to the date when control ceases.

The main consolidation criteria adopted for the application of the line-by-line method are the following:
u) Subsidiary Companies are consolidated starting from the date when control is actually transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated on the date when control is transferred outside the Group;
v) if required, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiary companies in order to bring the accounting criteria used in line with those adopted by the Group;
w) assets and liabilities, income and charges of companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis are fully recognised in the consolidated financial statements; the book value of the equity investments is derecognised against the corresponding portion of Equity of the investee companies, entering the individual elements of balance sheet assets and liabilities at their current value at the date of acquisition of control. Any residual difference, if positive, is entered under the asset item "Goodwill"; if negative, in the Income Statement;
x) debt and credit relationships, costs and revenues, financial income and charges between Companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis, as well as the effects of all transactions effected between the same are derecognised;
y) the portions of Equity and of the result for the period attributable to minority interests are indicated separately in consolidated Equity and Income Statement, respectively.
Financial statements expressed in currencies other than that of the Group's consolidated financial statements, i.e. the Euro, are consolidated following the methodology described above after translating them into Euro. The translation is made as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date of the consolidated financial statements;
(ii) costs and revenues are translated at the average exchange rate of the financial year; (iii) exchange rate differences generated by the translation of the economic values at a rate other than the
closing rate and those generated by the translation of the opening Equity at an exchange rate other than the closing rate of the reporting period are classified under a special Equity item up to the sale of the equity investment;

PIQUADRO GROUP
60

(iv) goodwill and fair value adjustments generated by the acquisition of a foreign company are recognised in the related currency as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated using the period-end exchange rate.

The financial statements expressed in a foreign currency other than that of the Countries which have adopted the Euro are translated into Euro by applying the rules indicated above. Below are reported the exchange rates applied for the FY 2017/2018 (foreign currency corresponding to Euro 1):

Foreign Currency

Intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased or internally produced are entered under assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and when the cost of the asset may be determined reliably. These assets are valued at their purchase or production cost. Intangible assets relate to assets without an identifiable physical substance, which are controlled by the company and are able to generate future economic benefits, as well as any possible goodwill.

Intangible assets with a definite useful life are systematically amortised over their useful life, to be intended as the estimated period in which assets will be used by the company. Goodwill and any other intangible assets, where existing, with an indefinite useful life are not amortised, but are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, for the purposes of verifying the existence of impairment losses (if any). The rates applied are:

Development Costs Patents Trademarks Key money (Rights to replace third parties in lease agreements for points of sale) Concessions

25% 33.3% 10% lease term 33.3%

(i) Research and Development costs

Research costs are charged to the Income Statement in the financial year in which they are incurred. Development costs are instead entered under intangible assets where all the following conditions are fulfilled:
· the project is clearly identified and the related costs can be identified and measured reliably; · the technical feasibility of the project has been demonstrated; · the intention to complete the project and to sell the intangible assets generated by the project has been
demonstrated; · a potential market exists or, in the case of internal use, the benefit of the intangible asset has been
demonstrated for the production of the intangible assets generated by the project; · the technical and financial resources necessary for the completion of the project are available.

Amortisation of Development costs entered under intangible assets will start from the date when the result generated by the project is marketable. Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over a period of 4 years, which represents the estimated useful life of capitalised expenses.

PIQUADRO GROUP
61

(ii) Industrial patent and intellectual property rights, Licences and other Rights
Charges relating to the acquisition of industrial patent and intellectual property Rights, Licences and other Rights are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred for their purchase.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to allocate the cost incurred for the acquisition of the right over the shorter of the period of the expected use and the term of the related contracts, starting from the time when the acquired Right may be exercised; usually, this period has a duration of 5 years.
(iii) Trademarks
Trademarks have a definite useful life and are valued at cost. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis in order to distribute their value over the estimated useful life and in any case for a period not exceeding 10 years.
(iv) Key money
Amortisation of the key money (that is payments to third parties to obtain the rights to take over lease agreements for points of sale) is calculated on a straight-line basis according to the lease term of the points of sale.
The recoverability of the entry value of intangible assets, including goodwill, if any, is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets".
(v) Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries, classified under non-current assets, is stated, upon initial recognition, at the cost consisting of the excess consideration paid and of the amount stated for minority interests, recognised as at the date of acquisition, compared to the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the consideration is less than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is stated through profit or loss. Goodwill is regarded by the Piquadro Group as an asset with indefinite useful life. Accordingly, this asset is not amortised but is tested for impairment periodically. Goodwill is allocated to the operating units that generate cash flows that are identifiable separately and are monitored in order to allow the impairment test to be conducted.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are entered at their purchase price or production cost, including any directlyattributable additional charges required to make the assets available for use. Costs incurred subsequent to the purchase are capitalised only if they increase the future economic benefits inherent in the asset to which they refer. The assets whose sale is highly probable as at the reporting date of the financial statements are classified under current assets under item "Current assets available for sale" and measured at the lower of the book value and the related fair value, net of estimated selling costs. The sale of an asset classified under non-current assets is highly probable when the Management has defined, by a formal resolution, a plan for the disposal of the asset (or of the disposal group) and activities have been started to identify a purchaser and to complete the plan. Furthermore, the asset (or the disposal group) has been offered for sale at a reasonable price compared to its current fair value. The sale is expected to be completed within a year of the date of classification and the actions required to complete the sale plan show that it is improbable that the plan can be significantly amended or cancelled.
Property, plant and equipment under finance leases, through which all risks and rewards attached to ownership are substantially transferred to the Group, are entered under the relevant classes of property, plant and equipment and are depreciated by applying the same depreciation rates reported below which have been adopted for the related relevant class, provided the lease term is less than the useful life represented by such rates and there is no reasonable certainty of the transfer of the ownership of the leased asset at the natural expiry of the agreement; in this case, the depreciation period is represented by the term of the lease agreement. Assets are entered against the entry of short- and medium-term payables to the lessor financial entity; rentals paid are allocated between financial charges and reduction in borrowings.
PIQUADRO GROUP
62

Leases in which the lessor substantially retains the risks and rewards attached to ownership of the assets are classified as operating leases. Costs for rentals arising from operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis on the basis of the contract term.

Property, plant and equipment are systematically depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life, to be intended as the estimated period in which the asset will be used by the company. The value to be depreciated is represented by the entry value as reduced by the presumed net transfer value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be determined reasonably. Land is not subject to depreciation, even if purchased jointly with a building, as well as the tangible assets intended for transfer which are valued at the lower of the entry value and their fair value, net of disposal charges. The rates applied are:

Land Buildings Leasehold improvements (shops) Machinery and moulds General systems Industrial and business equipment Office electronic machines Fittings Motor vehicles and means of internal transport Cars

* or over the term of the lease agreement should the same be lower and there is not reasonable certainty of the renewal of the same at the natural expiry of the contract.

Should the asset being depreciated be made up of elements that can be clearly identified and whose useful life significantly differs from that of the other parts making up the asset, depreciation is made separately for each of the parties making up the asset (component approach).

Ordinary maintenance costs are fully charged to the Income Statement. Costs for improvements, refurbishment and transformation increasing the value of property, plant and equipment are charged as an increase in the relevant assets and depreciated separately. Financial charges directly attributable to the construction or production of a tangible asset are capitalised as an increase in the asset under construction, up to the time when it is available for use.

The recoverability of the entry value of property, plant and equipment is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets" below.

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the so-called purchase method (as defined by IFRS 3 (revised) "Business combinations"). The purchase method requires, after having identified the purchaser within the business combination and having determined the acquisition cost, all assets and liabilities acquired (including the so-called contingent liabilities) to be measured at fair value. Goodwill (if any) is determined only on a residual basis as the difference between the cost of the business combination and the relevant portion of the difference between acquired assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If negative, it is recognised as a positive component of the result for the period in which the business combination takes place. Transaction costs are directly charged to the Income Statement.

Business combinations of entities under common control

Business combinations of entities under common control are business combinations of entities which are ultimately controlled by the same persons both before and after the business combination and the control is not of a temporary nature. The presence of minority interests in each of the entities being combined before or after the combination

PIQUADRO GROUP
63

transaction is not significant in order to determine whether the combination involves entities under common control. Business combinations of entities under common control are accounted for so that the net assets of the acquired entity and of the acquiring entity are recognised at the book values they had in the respective accounts before the transaction (continuity of values), without recognising, in the consolidated financial statements, surplus values (if any) arising from these combinations and accounted for in the separate financial statements of the Company.
Equity investments in Associated companies and other companies
If existing, investments in associated companies are valued at Equity. Equity investments in other companies are measured at fair value; if the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, the investment is valued at cost. The recoverability of their entry value is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets".
Receivables and other non-current and current assets
Receivables and the other non-current and current assets are classified under financial assets "Loans and receivables". These are non-derivative financial instruments which mainly relate to receivables from customers and which are not listed on an active market, from which fixed or determinable payments are expected. They are included in the current portion, except for those with a maturity exceeding twelve months compared to the reporting date, which are classified under the non-current portion. Initially these assets are recognised at fair value; subsequently, they are valued at amortised cost on the basis of the actual interest rate method. Should an objective evidence exist of any impairment, the asset is reduced so as to be equal to the discounted value of the flows that may be obtained in the future. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement. If the reasons for the previous write-downs no longer apply in the subsequent periods, the value of the assets is restored up to the amount of the value which would be derived from the application of amortised cost had no write-down been made.
Inventories
Inventories are valued and entered at the lower of the purchase or production cost, including additional charges, as determined according to the weighted average cost method, and the value of presumed realisable value inferable from the market performance.
Cash and cash equivalents
The item relating to cash and cash equivalents includes cash, current bank accounts, demand deposits and other short-term high-liquidity financial investments, which are readily convertible into cash, or which can be transformed into cash and cash equivalents within 90 days of the date of original acquisition, and are subject to a non-significant risk of changes in value.
Impairment of assets
Assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are tested for impairment at least annually, as well as whenever there is evidence of any possible impairment loss. Assets subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in situations indicate that the book value might not be recoverable. The impairment loss is recognised in an amount equal to the excess book value compared to recoverable value, equal to the greater of current value, net of selling costs, and value in use. In order to assess an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are expected to arise which can be identified separately (cash generating units) as required by IAS 36. The abovementioned impairment test necessarily requires the use of subjective evaluations based on the information available within the Group, target market prospects and historical trends. Furthermore, if it is assumed that a potential impairment loss might have occurred, the Group proceeds with its determination by using appropriate valuation techniques. The same impairment tests and the same valuation techniques are applied to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with definite useful life when there is any evidence that there might be difficulties in recovering the related net book value through their use. The correct identification of any indicator of a potential impairment loss, as well as the estimates for its determination, mainly
PIQUADRO GROUP
64

depend on factors and conditions that can vary over time, even significantly, thus affecting the evaluations and estimates made by the Directors. The evaluation requiring goodwill to be recognised at a value not exceeding its recoverable value (Impairment test) is performed by testing, as first step, the recoverability of the value of goodwill divided into Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The recoverable value is calculated in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 36 and is determined as value in use by discounting the cash flows expected to arise from the use of the asset or of a CGU, as well as from the value that is expected from its disposal at the end of its useful life. This process entails the use of estimates and assumptions to determine both the amount of future cash flows and the corresponding discount rates. Future cash flows are based on the most recent economic and financial plans prepared by the Management of each CGU with reference to the operation of production assets and to the market context.
Equity
The Share Capital is made up of the outstanding ordinary shares and is entered at its nominal value. Costs relating to the issue of shares or options are classified as a reduction in Equity (net of the tax benefit related thereto) as a deduction of the income arising from the issue of such instruments.
In case of purchase of treasury shares, the price paid, including directly-attributable additional charges (if any), is deducted from the Group's Equity up to the time of cancellation, reissue or disposal of the shares. When the said treasury shares are resold or reissued, the price received, net of directly-attributable additional charges (if any) and of the related tax effect, is accounted for as an increase in the Group's Equity.
Entries are made in the translation reserve at the time of recognition of the exchange rate differences relating to the consolidation of the Companies which prepare the financial statements in a currency other than the Euro. Entries are made in the legal reserve through provisions recognised pursuant to article 2430 of the Italian Civil Code, or the reserve is increased to an extent equal to the 20th part of the net profits achieved by the Parent Company until the reserve in question reaches a fifth of the Share Capital of the Parent Company. Once a fifth of the Share Capital is reached, if for whatever reason the reserve is decreased, it shall be replenished with the minimum annual provisions as indicated above.
Hedging financial instruments
The Group carries out transactions in derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The Group does not hold financial instruments of a speculative nature, as required by the risk policy approved by the Board of Directors. Consistently with IAS 39, hedging financial instruments are accounted for according to the procedures laid down for hedge accounting if all the following conditions are fulfilled:
(i) at inception of the hedge, there is formal documentation of the hedging relationship and the company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge;
(ii) the hedge is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value (fair value hedge) or cash flows (cash flow hedge) that are attributable to the hedged risk;
(iii) for cash flow hedges, any forecast transaction being hedged is highly probable and presents an exposure to the changes in cash flows which could finally affect the economic result for the period;
(iv) hedge effectiveness is reliably measurable, i.e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured;
(v) the hedge must be assessed on an on-going basis and be highly effective for the entire life of the derivative.
The criterion for measuring hedging instruments is represented by their fair value as at the designated date. The fair value of foreign exchange derivatives is calculated in relation to their intrinsic value and time value. On each closing date of the financial statements, hedging financial instruments are tested for effectiveness, in order to verify whether the hedge meets the requirements to be qualified as effective and to be accounted for according to hedge accounting. When the financial instruments are eligible for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatments will be applied:
Fair value hedge - If a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a balance sheet asset or liability attributable to a specific risk that might impact the Income Statement, the profit or loss arising from the subsequent measurements at fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in
PIQUADRO GROUP
65

the Income Statement. The profit or loss on the hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, modify the book value of this item and are recognised in the Income Statement.

Cash flow hedge - If a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in future cash flows of an asset or liability entered in the accounts or of a forecast transaction which is highly probable and which could have effects on the Income Statement, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the ineffective portion (if any) is recognised in the Income Statement. If a hedging instrument or a hedging relationship are terminated, but the transaction being hedged has not yet been effected, the combined profits and losses, which have been entered under the Statement of Comprehensive Income up to that time, are recognised in the Income Statement at the time when the related transaction is carried out. If the transaction being hedged is no longer deemed probable, the profits or losses not yet realised and deferred to Equity are immediately recognised in the Income Statement. If the hedge accounting cannot be applied, the profits or losses arising from the measurement at fair value of the derivative financial instrument are immediately entered in the Income Statement.

Earnings per share

Basic Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Group's economic result by the weighted average of the ordinary shares outstanding in the financial year, excluding treasury shares (if any).

Diluted Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Group's economic result by the weighted average of the ordinary shares outstanding in the financial year, excluding treasury shares (if any). For the purposes of the calculation of the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average of outstanding shares is modified by assuming the conversion of all potential shares having dilutive effects, while the Group's net result is adjusted to take account of the effects, net of taxes, of the conversion.

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are related to loans, trade payables and other obligations to pay and are initially recognised at fair value, while they are subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the actual interest rate method. Should a change occur in the expected cash flows and should it be possible to estimate them reliably, the value of the loans is recalculated to reflect this change on the basis of the present value of the new expected cash flows and of the internal rate of return determined initially. Financial liabilities are classified under current liabilities, unless the Group has an unconditional right to delay their payment for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Financial liabilities are derecognised from the accounts at the time of their discharge or when the Group has transferred all the risks and charges relating to the instruments themselves. As the Group's financial liabilities have been incurred at variable interest rates, their fair value is substantially in line with the balance sheet value.

Risk factors

The Piquadro Group is exposed to risks associated with its own business, which are specifically referable to the following cases:
(i) Credit risk arising from business transactions or financing activities; (ii) Liquidity risk relating to the availability of financial resources and to the access to the credit market; (iii) Market risk which is identified in detail as follows;
o Foreign exchange risk, relating to operations in currencies other than currencies of denomination;
o Interest rate risk, relating to the Group's exposure on financial instruments which bear interest.

Credit risk

The operational management of this risk is delegated to the Credit Management function which is shared by the Administration, Finance and Control Department with the Sales Department and is carried out as follows:
(i) assessing the credit standing of the customers; (ii) monitoring the related expected incoming flows; (iii) the appropriate payment reminder actions; (iv) debt collection actions, if any.

The write-down necessary to bring the nominal value in line with the expected collectable value has been determined by analysing all of the expired loans in the accounts and using all the available information on individual debtors. Loans which are the object of disputes and for which there is a legal or insolvency procedure have been fully written down, while fixed write-down percentages have been applied to all the other receivables, again taking account of both legal and actual situations. Below is reported the summary statement of the changes in the Provision for bad debts.

Liquidity risk
The financial requirements of the Group are affected by the dynamics of receipts from customers in the Wholesale channel, a segment which is mainly made up of points of sale/shops; as a consequence, credits are highly fragmented, with variable average payment times. Nevertheless, the Group is able to finance the growing requirements of net working Capital with ease, through the cash flows generated by operations, including the short-term receipts generated by the DOS channel and, when necessary, through recourse to short-term loans. In support of the above, below are reported the main ratios of financial management:

Cash Ratio (*) Quick Ratio (**) Current Ratio (***) Net financial debt/EBITDA Interest coverage ratio (****)

31 March 2018 0.56
1.30 1.83 0.34 9.09

(*)Cash and cash equivalents/Current liabilities (**) (Current assets- inventories)/Current liabilities (***)Current assets, including inventories/Current liabilities (****)Operating result/Financial income (charges)

The various liquidity ratios reported above (Cash, Quick and Current Ratios) show that the Group's current operations have a good ability to generate cash flows which ensure an adequate coverage of short-term commitments. In addition, the management ratios do not show any problematic aspects as regards the coverage of costs deriving from the debt structure through operating profitability. Furthermore, policies and processes have been adopted which are aimed at optimising the management of financial resources, thus reducing liquidity risks:
(i) maintaining an adequate level of available funds; (ii) obtaining adequate credit lines; (iii) monitoring the perspective liquidity conditions, in relation to the corporate process

Below are reported the main assumptions for the table above: (i) Loans payable: the future cash flows have been provided directly by the banks concerned; (ii) Current bank accounts: by virtue of the worst case in which the worst scenario is equal to the repayment on demand of the use of the credit line, the related cash out has been charged to the first time band; (iii) Foreign exchange forwards: the cash out in Euro has been reported which has been envisaged as per contract at the time of the subscription of the derivative instruments; (iv) Finance leases: instalments, plus interest, have been reported.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group could rely on about Euro 46,970 thousand of credit lines (about Euro 40,855 thousand at 31 March 2017), of which unused lines of about Euro 23,497 thousand (about Euro 21,192 thousand at 31 March 2017) and on cash and cash equivalents of about Euro 23,552 thousand (Euro 15,288 thousand at 31 March 2017). As regards the balance of Current Assets, and specifically the coverage of payables to suppliers, it is also ensured by the amount of net trade receivables, which amounted to Euro 27,618 thousand at 31 March 2018 (Euro 27,747 thousand at 31 March 2017).

PIQUADRO GROUP

Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is subject to market risk arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies, as it operates in an international context in which transactions, mainly those with suppliers, are settled in US Dollars (USD); furthermore, wages and salaries of the employees of the subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods in Zhongshan Co. Ltd. are paid in Renminbi. It follows that the Group's net result is partially affected by the fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate and, to a lower extent, the Renminbi/Euro exchange rate. The necessity to manage and control financial risks has induced the Management to adopt a risk containment strategy, better defined as "hedge accounting policy". This consists in continuously hedging the risks relating to purchases over a time period of six months on the basis of the amount of the orders issued that shall be settled in US dollars. This conduct can be classified as a "Cash flow hedge" or the hedge of the risk of changes in the future cash flows; these flows can be related to assets or liabilities entered in the accounts or to highly probable future transactions. In compliance with IAS 39, the portion of profit or loss accrued on the hedging instrument, which is considered effective for hedging purposes, has been recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and classified under a special Equity reserve.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Parent Company executed forward currency contracts for USD 19,000 thousand, equal to an aggregate counter-value of Euro 16,233 thousand, with an average exchange rate of USD 1,170. During the financial year ended 31 March 2017, the Parent Company executed forward currency contracts for USD 11,750 thousand, equal to an aggregate counter-value of Euro 10,426 thousand, with an average exchange rate of USD 1.127.
Furthermore, it should be noted that some Group Companies are located in Countries which do not belong to the European Monetary Union, i.e. China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Russia and the United States of America. As the relevant currency is the Euro, the Income Statements of these Companies are translated into Euro at the average exchange rate for the period and, the revenues and margins being equal in the local currency, any changes in the exchange rates may entail effects on the Euro counter-value of revenues, costs and economic results. The effects of these changes, as well as those deriving from the translation of Balance sheets, are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, as required by the Accounting Standards.
For an analysis of the effects of these risks, reference is made to the table reported below (sensitivity analysis):

Capital risk Management

The Group manages the Capital with the objective of supporting the core business and optimising the value for Shareholders, while maintaining a correct structure of the Capital and reducing its cost. The Group monitors the Capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, which is calculated as the ratio between net debt and net Invested Capital.

Employee benefits

PIQUADRO GROUP
72

Employee benefits substantially include the Provisions for Staff Severance Pay (TFR, Trattamento di Fine Rapporto) of the Italian Company of the Group and pension funds.
Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006, the 2007 Finance Law, introduced considerable amendments as regards the allocation of funds of the Provision for TFR. Until 31 December 2006, TFR was included within the scope of postemployment benefit plans, of the "defined benefit" type of plans and was measured according to IAS 19, using the Projected Unit Credit method made by independent actuaries. This calculation consists in estimating the amount of the benefit that an employee will receive on the alleged date of termination of the employment relationship using demographic and financial assumptions. The amount that is thus calculated is then discounted back and reproportioned on the basis of the length of service built up against the total length of service and is a reasonable estimate of the benefits that each employee has already accrued with respect to the work performed. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions used are recognised in the Income Statement. As a result of the reform of supplementary pension schemes, the Provision for TFR, as regards the portion accrued from 1 January 2007, is to be considered as being substantially assimilated to a "defined contribution plan". In particular, these amendments introduced the possibility for workers to choose where to allocate the TFR that is accruing. In companies with more than 50 employees, the new TFR flows may be allocated by the worker to selected pension schemes or kept in the company and transferred to INPS (Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale, National Social Security Institute).
In short, following the reform on supplementary pension schemes, the Group has carried out an actuarial measurement of the TFR accrued before 2007, without further including the component relating to future pay increases. On the contrary, the portion accrued after 2007 has been accounted for according to the procedures attributable to defined contribution plans.
Provisions for risks and charges
Provisions for risk and charges cover certain or probable costs and charges of a fixed nature, whose timing or amount was uncertain at the closing date of the financial year. Provisions are recognised when:
(i) it is probable that a current obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of paste events;
(ii) it is probable that the fulfilment of the obligation will require the payment of a consideration;
(iii) the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are entered at the value representing the best estimate of the amount that the Group would rationally pay to discharge the obligation or to transfer it to third parties at the closing date of the period. When the financial effect of time is significant and the payment dates of the obligations can be estimated reliably, the provision is discounted back; the increase in the Provision connected with the passage of time is charged to the Income Statement under item "Financial income (Charges)". The Provision for supplementary clientele indemnity, as well as any other Provisions for risks and charges, is set aside on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the future probable liability, taking account of the available elements and also taking account of the estimates made by independent third-party actuaries.
Income taxes
Taxes for the period represent the sum of current and deferred taxes. Current taxes are determined on the basis of a realistic forecast of charges to be paid in the application of the tax regulations in force; the related debt is reported net of advances, taxes withheld and tax credits that can be offset, under item "Current tax payables". If there is a credit, the amount is reported under item "Current tax receivables " under current assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities entered in the accounts and the corresponding values recognised for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are entered when it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified under noncurrent assets and liabilities and are offset if they refer to taxes that can be offset. The balance of the set-off is entered under item "Deferred tax assets" if positive and under item "Deferred tax liabilities" if negative".
PIQUADRO GROUP
73

Both current and deferred taxes are recognised under item "Income tax expenses" in the Income Statement, except when these taxes are originated from transactions whose effects are recognised directly in Equity. In this case, the contra-entry of the recognition of the current tax debt, of deferred tax assets and liabilities is charged as a reduction in the Equity item from which the effect being recorded originated. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the tax rates which are expected to be applied in the tax year when these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be discharged.
Furthermore, for a better representation of the rules laid down under "IAS 12 ­ Income Taxes" in relation to the offsetting of deferred taxation, the Group has deemed it appropriate to reclassify portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities where there is a legal right to setoff current tax assets and the corresponding current tax liabilities.
Currency translation
Receivables and payables initially expressed in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company which recognises the receivable/payable (foreign currency) are translated into the functional currency of said Company at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates on which the related transactions take place. The exchange rate differences realised on the occasion of the collection of receivables and the payment of debts in foreign currency are entered in the Income Statement. As at the reporting date of the financial statements, receivables and payables in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at that date, charging any changes in the value of the receivable/payable to the Income Statement (estimated foreign exchange gains and losses).
Revenue recognition
Revenues are recognised at the time of the transfer of all the risks and charges arising from the ownership of the transferred assets. Revenues and income are recognised net of returns, discounts, allowances and premiums, as well as of the taxes connected to the sale or performance of services. With reference to the main types of revenues achieved by the Group, they are recognised on the basis of the following criteria and as required by IAS 18: Sales of goods - retail segment. The Group operates in the retail business through its own network of DOSs. Revenues are accounted for at the time of the delivery of the goods to the customers, when all the risks are substantially transferred. Sales are usually collected directly or through credit cards. Sales of goods - Wholesale segment. The Group distributes products in the Wholesale market. The related revenues are accounted for at the time of the shipment of the goods, when all the risks are substantially transferred. Performance of services. These revenues are accounted for proportionally to the state of completion of the service rendered as at the relevant date. Sales based on repurchase commitments. Revenues and receivables from the buyer are recognised at the time of the delivery of the goods, while reversing the value of the sold goods from the assets. As at the reporting date, revenues and receivables are reversed on the basis of the sales made by the buyer in relation to the sold goods, with a consequent change in the item "Inventories".
Financial income and revenues from services are recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost recognition
Costs are recognised when they relate to goods and services purchased and/or received during the period or relate to the systematic apportionment of an expense from which future benefits derive that can be apportioned over time. Financial charges and charges from services are recognised on an accruals basis.
Use of estimates
The process of drawing up the financial statements involves the Group's Management making accounting estimates based on complex and/or subjective judgements; these estimates are based on past experiences and assumptions that are considered reasonable and realistic on the basis of information known at the moment of making the estimate. The use of these accounting estimates affects the value of assets and liabilities and the disclosure on potential assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date, as well as the amount of revenues and costs in the relevant period. The final results, or the actual economic effect that is recognised when the event takes place, of the
PIQUADRO GROUP
74

financial statement items for which the abovementioned estimates and assumptions were used, may differ from those reported in the financial statements that recognise the effects arising from the event that is subject to estimation, due to the uncertainty that is characteristic of assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of each change are reported immediately in the accounts.

Main estimates adopted by the Management
Below are briefly described the aspects which, more than others, require greater subjectivity on the part of the Directors in working out the estimates and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions applied could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial data:

Impairment of assets: in accordance with the Accounting Standards applied by the Group, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a definite life are subject to verification in order to ascertain if an impairment has occurred. This impairment shall be recognised by means of a write-down when indicators exist that could lead to an expectation of difficulties in recovering the relative book value through usage of the asset. Verifying that the abovementioned indicators exist requires the Directors to exercise subjective valuations based on information available within the Group and inferable from the market, as well as using past experience. Moreover, should the likelihood of a potential impairment be ascertained, the Group will set about calculating this using the evaluation techniques that it considers appropriate. Correctly identifying the items that indicate the existence of a potential impairment and the estimates used for calculating the same depend on factors which can vary over time and affect the valuations and estimates carried out by the Directors;

Amortisation and depreciation of fixed assets: the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful economic life of the Group's fixed assets is determined by the Directors at the time when the fixed asset has been purchased; it is based on past experience for similar fixed assets, market conditions and expectations regarding future events which could have an impact on the useful life, including changes in technology. Therefore, the actual economic life may differ from the estimated useful life. The Group periodically evaluates technological and sector changes in order to update the residual useful life. This periodical update could involve a variation in the depreciation period and therefore also in the depreciation rate for future financial years.

Deferred taxes: deferred tax assets are accounted for on the basis of the income expected in the future financial years. The measurement of the expected income for the purposes of accounting for deferred taxes depends on factors which can vary over time and determine significant effects on the measurement of deferred tax assets.

Provisions for legal and tax risks: provisions are made for legal and tax risks, if required, which represent the risk of being the losing party. The amount of the Provisions (if any) entered in the accounts relating to such risks represents the best estimate at that time made by Management. This estimate entails the adoption of assumptions which depend on factors which can vary over time and which could therefore have effects compared to the current estimates made by the Directors for the preparation of the financial statements.

Below are reported the critical accounting estimates of the process of drawing up the financial statements for which the Management has availed itself of the support and valuations of independent third-party experts (actuaries and financial advisors). Please note that future amendments (if any) to the conditions underlying the judgments, assumptions and estimates adopted could have an impact on the results of financial years after 2017/2018.

Actuarial calculation of defined-benefit pension plans: the estimates, demographic and economic-financial assumptions adopted, with the support of the valuations of an actuarial expert, in the actuarial calculation for the determination of defined-benefit plans within post-employment benefits are broken down as follows:

Annual rate of inflation
1.75% for 2018 and 1.75% for 2017

Probability of exit of the employee from the Group Frequency of 0.15% for 2018 and 0.15% for 2017

Probability of advance payments of the TFR
3.50% for 2018 and 3.50% for 2017

PIQUADRO GROUP
75

Finally, it is specified that the actuarial valuations have been made by using the curve of the interest rates of the corporate securities with rating AA.
Segment reporting ­ breakdown of segments by divisions
In order to provide disclosures regarding the economic, financial and equity position by segment (segment reporting), the Group has chosen the distinction by brands/distribution channels as the primary model for presenting segment data. This method of representation reflects how the Group's business is organised and the structure of its internal reporting on the basis of the consideration that risks and rewards are influenced by the distribution channels used by the Group.
The distribution channels selected as those being presented are the following ones: (i) Piquadro Brand - DOS channel; (ii) Piquadro Brand - Wholesale channel; (iii) "The Bridge" Brand.
In fact, the Group distributes its products through two distribution channels: (i) a direct channel, which includes single-brand stores directly operated by the Group (the so-called "Directly Operated Stores" or "DOSs"); (ii) an indirect channel ("Wholesale"), which is represented by multi-brand shops/department stores, single-brand shops run by third parties linked to the Group by franchise agreements and distributors, under both Piquadro and The Bridge brands. All of the shops are, directly or indirectly, selected (through agents and importers) on the basis of their coherence with the positioning of the Piquadro and The Bridge brands, their location, the level of service guaranteed to the end customer, the visibility that they are able to guarantee the Group's products and, finally, the soundness of their equity and financial position. These consolidated financial statements provide segment information as reported above.
Amendments to Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards, amendments and interpretations
The following accounting standards, amendments and IFRS interpretations were applied by the Group for the first time as from 1 January 2017:
z) Amendment to IAS 7 "Disclosure Initiative" (published on 29 January 2016). The document's purpose is to provide some clarifications in order to improve disclosures on financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments require information that allows the users of the financial statements to understand the changes in liabilities arising from financing transactions. The Group has provided this disclosure in paragraph 14.
aa) Amendment to IAS 12 "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" (published on 19 January 2016). The document's purpose is to provide some clarifications on the recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealised losses in the measurement of "Available for Sale" financial assets upon the occurrence of certain circumstances and based on estimated taxable income for future financial years. The adoption of these amendments has not entailed any impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the European Union but not yet applicable and not adopted in advance by the Piquadro Group at 31 March 2018.
PIQUADRO GROUP

IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers (published on 28 May 2014 and supplemented by additional clarifications published on 12 April 2016), which is intended to replace IAS 18 ­ Revenue and IAS 11 ­ Construction Contracts, as well as the interpretations IFRIC 13 ­ Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 ­ Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 ­ Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC 31 ­ Revenues-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. The standard establishes a new method to account for revenues, which shall apply to any and all contracts entered into with customers, except for those that fall within the scope of application of other IAS/IFRS, such as leases, insurance contracts and financial instruments. According to the new model, the basic steps to account for revenues are: -identify the contract with a customer; -identify the performance obligations in the contract; -determine the transaction price; -allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; -recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard shall apply from 1 January 2018. The amendments to IFRS 15, Clarifications to IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers were endorsed by the European Union on 6 November 2017. On the basis of the analyses conducted, the directors expect that the application of IFRS 15 will have no significant impact on the amounts stated on account of revenues and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements. Final version of IFRS 9 ­ Financial Instruments (published on 24 July 2014). The document describes the results of the project to replace IAS 39: - i introducing new criteria for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities (together with the measurement of changes in financial liabilities which are not substantial); - with reference to impairment, the new standard requires credit losses to be estimated on the basis of the expected-loss model (rather than the incurred-loss model used by IAS 39), using supportable information, which is reasonably available without undue cost and which includes historical data, both present and prospective; -introducing a new hedge accounting model (increased eligibility for hedge accounting, change in the method to account for forward contracts and options when they are embedded in a hedge accounting relationship, changes in the effectiveness test). The new standard shall apply to the financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. On the basis of the analyses conducted, the directors expect that the application of IFRS 9 will have no significant impact on the amounts and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements. IFRS 16 ­ Leases (published on 13 January 2016), intended to replace IAS 17 ­ Leases, as well as the interpretations IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The new standard provides a new definition of lease and sets out a control model (right of use) of an asset, distinguishing leases from service contracts, on the basis of whether the following key requirements are met, i.e. an identified asset, the right to substitute an identified asset, the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset underlying the contract. The standard provides for a single model to account for and measure lease agreements for lessees, which provides for the recognition of the leased asset, including under operating leases, among assets against an entry under borrowings, while also providing for the possibility of not recognising agreements involving "low-value assets" and agreements with a term equal to or less than 12 months as leases. On the contrary, the Standard does not include significant amendments for lessors. The standard will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted, only for the Companies that have already applied IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Directors expect that the application of IFRS 16 might have a significant impact on the amounts and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements; however, it is not possible to provide estimated effects until the Company has completed a detailed analysis. The impact will mainly concern the accounting for property lease payments.
Document named "Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts" (published on 12 September 2016). As regards the entities the core business of which consists of insurance, the amendments are aimed at clarifying the concerns about the application of the new standard IFRS 9 (from 1 January 2018) to financial assets, before the IASB replaces the current standard IFRS 4 with the new standard that is currently being prepared, on the basis of which financial liabilities are measured. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed by the European Union
As at the reporting date of these Financial Statements, the competent bodies of the European Union had not yet completed the endorsement process required for the adoption of the amendments and standards described below.
PIQUADRO GROUP
77

· On 18 May 2017 the IASB published IFRS 17 ­ Insurance Contracts, which is intended to replace IFRS 4 ­ Insurance Contracts. The purpose of the new standard is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that gives a true view of the rights and obligations arising from insurance contracts. The IASB has developed the standard in order to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses of existing accounting policies, providing a single principle-based framework to take account of any type of insurance contract, including reinsurance contracts held by an insurer. The standard will be applicable from 1 January 2021, with early adoption permitted, only for entities that apply IFRS 9 ­ Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The directors expect that the adoption of this standard will not entail any significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IFRS 2 "Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions" (published on 20 June 2016), which contains some clarifications relating to the accounting treatment of the effects of vesting conditions in the case of cash-settled share-based payments, the classification of share-based payments with characteristics of net settlement and the accounting treatment of amendments to the terms and conditions of a sharebased payment that change its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled. The amendments shall apply from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-2016 Cycle", published on 8 December 2016 (including IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards - Deletion of short-term exemptions for first-time adopters, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures ­ Measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss: an investment-by-investment choice or a consistent policy choice, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ­ Clarification of the scope of the Standard), which partially make additions to the pre-existing standards. The most amendments shall apply from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· IFRIC 22 "Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration" (published on 8 December 2016). The purpose of the interpretation is to provide guidelines for transactions effected in foreign currency where non-cash prepayments or advances are stated in the accounts before the recognition of the related asset, cost or revenue. This document provides instructions on how an entity must set the date of a transaction, and, accordingly, the spot exchange rate to be used when foreign currency transactions take place, within which payments are made or received in advance. IFRIC 22 will be applicable from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IAS 40 "Transfers of Investment Property" (published on 8 December 2016). These amendments clarify the transfers of a property to, or from, investment property. Specifically, an entity must reclassify a property to, or from, investment property only when there is evidence that a change occurred in the intended use of the property. This change must be attributed to a specific event that has occurred and, therefore, it must not be limited to a change in the intentions of the entity's Management. These amendments will be applicable from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· On 7 June 2017 the IASB published the interpretation IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The document deals with the uncertainty over income tax treatments and provides for uncertainties in measuring tax assets or liabilities to be recognised only when it is probable that the entity will pay or recover the amount in question. Furthermore, the document does not provide for any new disclosure obligation but points out that the entity shall establish whether it is necessary to provide information on the considerations made by the management in relation to the uncertainty over tax treatments, in accordance with IAS 1. The new interpretation will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of this interpretation will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IFRS 9 "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (published on 12 October 2017). This document specifies that the instruments providing for early redemption might pass the "SPPI" test even when the "reasonable additional compensation" to be paid for early redemption is a "negative compensation" for the lending entity. The amendment will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect
PIQUADRO GROUP
78

that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. · Amendment to IAS 28 "Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (published on 12 October 2017)". This document clarifies the requirements to apply IFRS 9, including impairment requirements, to other long-term interests in associates and joint ventures for which the equity method is not applied. The amendment will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. · "Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle", published on 12 December 2017 (including IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements ­ Remeasurement of previously held interests in a joint operation, IAS 12 Income Taxes ­ Income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity, IAS 23 Borrowing costs - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ­ Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation) which adopt the amendments to some standards within the related annual improvement process. The amendments will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. · Amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 "Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture" (published on 11 September 2014). The document was published for the purpose of solving the present conflict between IAS 28 and IFRS 10 relating to the measurement of profits or losses arising from the sale or contribution of a non-monetary asset to a joint venture or associate in exchange for an interest in the latter's capital. At present the IASB has suspended the application of this amendment. · IFRS 14 ­ Regulatory Deferral Accounts (published on 30 January 2014) which only allows IFRS first-time adopter entities to continue to recognise the amounts relating to Rate Regulation Activities according to the previous accounting standards adopted. Since the Group is not a first-time adopter, this standard is not applicable.

In the course of the FY 2017/2018 no trigger events occurred as to the key moneys outstanding at the year-end (Milan ­ Via della Spiga, Bologna - Piazza Maggiore, Rome ­ Cinecittà, Milan ­ Corso Buenos Aires, Pescara, Milan ­ Fiordaliso Shopping Mall, Verona ­ Piazza delle Erbe, Venice, Forte dei Marmi, Florence and London), which could indicate potential impairment losses of the same. The trademark item relates to the value of the trademark recognised in the accounts of The Bridge S.p.A..
Note 2 ­ Goodwill The goodwill item arises from the purchase and sale of the investment in The Bridge, which has been accounted for as required by IFRS 3 and, therefore, a measurement of fair values of acquired assets or liabilities has been carried out for the purposes of accounting for business combinations. The differential between the price paid and the
PIQUADRO GROUP
81

corresponding share of equity of the acquired company has been allocated to goodwill. The value of goodwill also includes the measurement of third-party goodwill based on IFRS 3, which has been determined on the basis of the valuation of the put option relating to 20% of shares of The Bridge S.p.A. on the basis of future results of operations and cash flows. This option may be exercised between 1 April and 15 June 2012 or between 15 June 2023 and 15 July 2023. The Group verifies whether goodwill may be recovered at least once a year or more frequently if there is evidence of any impairment loss. This check is carried out by determining the recoverable value of the relevant Cash Generating Unit (CGU), i.e. "The Bridge", through the "Discounted cash flow" method. The impairment test relating to goodwill stated at 31 March 2018 was approved by the Board of Directors on 11 June 2018.
The rate (WACC) used reflects the current market valuation of the time value of money for the period under consideration and the specific risks of the Piquadro Group company.
The discount rate used corresponds to an estimate, net of tax, determined on the basis of the following main assumptions: · risk-free rate equal to the average yield on the relevant 10-year government bonds; · indebtedness depending on the financial structure of comparables.
For the purposes of conducting the impairment test on goodwill, the discounted cash flow has been calculated on the basis of the 2019-2023 plan that was approved by the Directors of subsidiary The Bridge on 29 May 2018. The plan is based on the Management's best estimate on the future operating performance of the Company. It should be noted that during the current year The Bridge recorded better final results than those forecast in the plan that had been approved during the previous year.
The WACC used to discount future cash flows, equal to 8.5%, has been determined on the basis of the following assumptions: · The average cost of capital results from the weighted average cost of debt (prepared by considering the relevant rates plus a "spread"); · the cost of net worth is determined by using the levered beta value and the financial structure of a panel of comparables in the sector, only except for specific risk-free rate and risk premium per country; · the terminal value has been determined on the basis of a long-term growth rate (g) that is prudentially equal to zero.
On the basis of an agreement signed for the acquisition of the remaining 20% of The Bridge, a portion of deferred price and the value of the put & call option to be settled in future years shall be measured depending on the results of operations and cash flows that will be realised by the CGU; the value of goodwill has been recognised initially by using the best estimate of the current value of the deferred exercise price and of the option, determined on the basis of the business plan envisaged initially.
The impairment test conducted in accordance with IAS 36 and by applying criteria shared by the Board of Directors has not reported any impairment loss on the stated goodwill. The outcome of the test was positive, showing a carrying amount of Euro 9,843 thousand and a cover of Euro 6,282 thousand. Furthermore, also on the basis of the instructions laid down in the document no. 4 that was prepared jointly by the Bank of Italy, CONSOB and ISVAP on 3 March 2010, the Group has taken steps to prepare the sensitivity analysis based on the results of the impairment test with respect to the changes in the basic assumptions that affect the value in use of the CGU. Likewise, the analyses did not report any impairment loss in the case of a positive change of 3.5% in the WACC and of 10% in cash flows.

Increases in property, plant and equipment, equal to Euro 1,213 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March

2018 (Euro 1,375 thousand in the financial year ended 31 March 2017) were mainly attributable to sundry

equipment acquired for the new DOSs opened during the year under consideration and for the refurbishment of

some existing shops for Euro 991 thousand, to the purchase of workshop plant and machinery for Euro 201

thousand and to non-routine works at the Company's headquarters for Euro 21 thousand.

Net write-downs, equal to Euro 165 thousand, related to the write-down of furniture and fittings for the disposal of some points of sales during the financial year ended 31 March 2018.

The change in the consolidation area reflects the acquisition of control over The Bridge S.p.A., as illustrated in the notes to the paragraph on "Business Combinations" of the Annual Financial Report at 31 March 2017.

As at 31 March 2018 trade receivables amounted to Euro 27,618 thousand, against Euro 27,747 thousand at 31 March 2017 with a decrease of 0.5% compared to 31 March 2017. Net of the change in the trade receivables of The Bridge S.p.A. (equal to an increase of Euro 474 thousand), mainly due to the increase in the Wholesale revenues of the subsidiary, net current trade receivables showed a decrease of Euro 129 thousand, which was mainly attributable to a better credit management and to lower average timing for collection. The adjustment to the face value of receivables from customers at their presumed realisable value is obtained through a special Provision for bad debts, whose changes are showed in the table below:

There was also the recognition of a receivable of Euro 800 thousand from the minority interests of The Bridge S.p.A. in relation to liabilities, including potential liabilities, arising from the outcome of the Tax Audit in progress. The subsidiary The Bridge has been involved in a tax audit since September 2016, which was completed on 16 March 2017 through the service of a report of findings (Processo Verbale di Constatazione, PVC). Following a thorough examination of the PVC on the part of tax advisors, a specific provision was set aside for the amount of liabilities for higher tax, sanctions and interest, which are expected to arise, with an appreciable degree of probability, in relation to the objections contained in the PVC. Against this liability, Il Ponte Pelletteria S.p.A., which is the selling party and a minority shareholder of The Bridge S.p.A., has undertaken to reimburse Piquadro S.p.A. for an amount equal to the costs that were accounted for in the 2016 financial statements in relation to liabilities, including potential liabilities, arising from the completion of the tax audit. There is no problem of recoverability in relation to this credit. On 25 May 2018, the dispute was settled by signing an interview report (assessment by agreement) whereby a liability was set out which, also considering litigation management costs, is not significantly different from the amount set aside in the aforesaid provision for risks.

Accrued income and prepaid expenses mainly related to prepaid expenses on rents (equal to Euro 467 thousand, of which Euro 32 thousand relating to The Bridge S.p.A.), as well as to costs relating to advertising, media and fairs (Euro 704 thousand, of which Euro 452 thousand for The Bridge S.p.A.), maintenance contracts, hiring and insurance costs (Euro 76 thousand, of which Euro 20 thousand relating to The Bridge S.p.A.).

As referred to in the paragraph on the "Introduction", the balance of the previous year has been reclassified for a better understanding of the financial statements, in an amount of Euro 62 thousand relating to receivables from employees, from "Other current liabilities", where they had been stated as a reduction in payables to personnel, to "Other current assets".

Note 10 ­ Derivative assets As at 31 March 2018 no derivative assets were outstanding.

Note 11 ­ Tax receivables
As at 31 March 2018 tax receivables were equal to Euro 275 thousand (Euro 1,011 thousand at 31 March 2017) and mainly related to the payable for current taxes for the period.

From the sensitivity analysis carried out on this item, some changes in the provision arise, at the same time as the main actuarial assumptions vary, which are not significant. The change in the consolidation area reflects the acquisition of control over The Bridge S.p.A., as illustrated in the notes in the paragraph on "Business Combinations" of the Annual Financial Report at 31 March 2017.

The "Provision for supplementary clientele indemnity" represents the potential liability with respect to agents in the event of Group Companies' terminating agreements or agents retiring. As at 31 March 2018 the balance of this provision was equal to Euro 1,118 thousand, up by Euro 223 thousand compared to 31 March 2017 (Euro 895 thousand). "Other Provisions for risks", equal to Euro 1,080 thousand, are made up as follows:
- the financial statements of subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A. include the recognition of liabilities that are regarded as probable for Euro 800 thousand, in relation to the PVC that has already been referred to above. Specifically, on 16 march 2017 the Florence Tax Police Unit completed the tax audit that had been started on 9 September 2016, through the service of a Report of Findings (Processo Verbale di Constatazione, "PVC"). In analysing the objections raised in the PVC, the Directors have deemed appropriate to recognise, on a prudential basis, an amount of tax, sanctions and interest corresponding to that for which there is a risk of sustaining a future outlay. On 25 May 2018, the dispute was settled by signing an interview report (assessment by agreement) whereby a liability was set out which, also considering litigation management costs, is not significantly different from the amount set aside in the aforesaid provision for risks.
- The remaining amount relates to accruals to provisions for risks of the Parent Company Piquadro S.p.A., as detailed below, for Euro 253 thousand. Specifically, this item includes the provision for risks for returns on sales, equal to Euro 61 thousand, the provision for risks on repairs for Euro 10 thousand, the provision for risks on legal disputes for Euro 48 thousand and the provision for risks for taxes that are regarded as probable, equal to Euro 130 thousand, as detailed below. This provision includes the liabilities that are

regarded as probable, recognised in relation to the PVC involving Piquadro S.p.A. and includes taxes, interest and charges for tax advice. On 31 May 2017 the Bologna Tax Police Unit concluded the tax audit that had been started on 1 February 2017, through the service of a Report of Findings (Processo Verbale di Constatazione, "PVC"). In analysing the objections raised in the PVC, the Company has deemed appropriate to recognise, on a prudential basis, an amount of tax, sanctions and interest corresponding to that for which there is a risk of sustaining a future outlay, in a provision for risks among liabilities. There had been no developments in that regard as at the date of these notes.
Note 19 ­ Deferred tax liabilities
The amount of deferred tax liabilities, equal to Euro 0 thousand (Euro 193 thousand at 31 March 2017) related to revenues that will be recognised for tax purposes during the next financial years; reference is made to the information reported in Note 6 above.
Current liabilities
Note 20 ­ Borrowings
As at 31 March 2018 current borrowings were equal to Euro 12,345 thousand compared to Euro 5,987 thousand at 31 March2017. The balance related to a current portion of loans for Euro 5,345 thousand, to payables to banks for the advance on dividends distributed on the profit at 31 March 2017 for Euro 2,000 thousand and to the short-term loan for Euro 5,000 thousand. For more details reference is made to Note 14 above.

At 31 March 2018 the Net Financial Position was negative for about Euro 3.7 million, showing an improvement of about Euro 4.6 million compared to the debt recognised at 31 March 2017, equal to about Euro 8.2 million. The main reasons for the trend in the net financial position, compared to 31 March 2017, are attributable to the following factors:
· an operating free cash flow of Euro 9.9 million for the period; · the payment of dividends of Euro 2.0 million; · investments of Euro 1.7 million in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; · an increase of Euro 1.6 million in other working capital items.

Note 22 ­ Derivative liabilities
As at 31 March 2018 derivative liabilities, equal to Euro 159 thousand (Euro 11 thousand at 31 March 2017), related to the hedges of exchange rates connected to purchases of raw materials in US dollars and for contract work done in China, as well as to the measurement of the Interest Rate Swap (IRS) derivative contract linked to the Mediocredito loan, with an initial amount of Euro 5,700 thousand. The Company hedges the exchange risk connected to purchases of raw materials in US dollars and for contract work done in China. In consideration for this risk, the Company makes use of instruments to hedge the risk attached to the related rate, trying to fix and crystallise the exchange rate at a level that is in line with the budget forecasts. During the year there were no transfers between the various fair value levels. Furthermore, the effect on fair value measurement following the application of IFRS 13 concerning the inclusion of non-performance risks was not significant.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 14 OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE No. 39 OF JANUARY 27, 2010
AND ARTICLE 10 OF THE EU REGULATION 537/2014
To the Shareholders of Piquadro S.p.A.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. and its subsidiaries ("Piquadro group" or "Group"), which comprise the statement of financial position as of March 31, 2018, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in net equity, cash flows statement for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as of March, 31 2018, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of national regulations issued pursuant to art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/05.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Piquadro S.p.A. (the "Company") in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment test on goodwill
Description of the key audit matter
The consolidated financial statements of the Piquadro Group as of 31 March 2018 report goodwill of Euro 4,658 thousand relating to the cash-generating unit (CGU) called "The Bridge" deriving from acquisitions of the subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A., finalized in the previous year.

2
The goodwill is not amortised but subjected to an impairment test at least once a year, as foreseen in IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. The impairment test is carried out by comparing the recoverable amount of the CGU identified by the Group - determined according to the value in use method - and the carrying amount, which takes into account both the goodwill and the other assets allocated to individual CGUs.
The assessment process adopted by Management to identify possible impairment losses involved making certain assumptions regarding, in particular, the estimated cash flows of each CGU, the appropriate discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate (g-rate). The assumptions reflected in the long-term plans of the CGUs concerned are influenced by future expectations and market conditions, which are affected by uncertainties. In view of the significance of the goodwill reported in the financial statements and the subjective nature of the estimates made to determine the cash flows of the CGUs and the key variables of the impairment model, we considered the impairment test on goodwill to be a key audit matter of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of 31 March 2018.
Note 2 of the consolidated financial statement presents information about the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis that describes the effects of changing the key variables used to carry out the impairment test.
Audit procedures
We first examined the approach taken by Management to determine the value in use of the CGUs, analysing the methods and assumptions applied by Management to carry out the impairment test.
In the context of our audit work we performed the following procedures, among others, partly with assistance from experts of the Deloitte network:
· observation and understanding of the relevant controls implemented by Piquadro Group over the impairment testing process;
· analysis of the reasonableness of the principal assumptions made in order to forecast cash flows, partly by analysing external data and obtaining information from Management that we deemed to be significant;
· analysis of actual values in comparison with the original plans, in order to assess the nature of variances and the reliability of the budgeting process;
· assessment of the reasonableness of the discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate (g-rate), partly via the appropriate identification of and reference to external sources that are normally used in professional practice and to key data for main comparable;
· verification of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to determine the value in use of the CGUs;
· verification that the carrying amount of the CGUs was determined properly;
· verification of the sensitivity analysis prepared by Management.
We also examined the adequacy of the information disclosed about the impairment test and its consistency with the requirements of IAS 36.

Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of national regulations issued pursuant to art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/05 and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic alternatives to such choices.
The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

4
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence applicable in Italy, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report.
Other information communicated pursuant to art. 10 of the EU Regulation 537/2014
The Shareholders' Meeting of Piquadro S.p.A. has appointed us on July 26, 2016 as auditors of the Company for the years from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2025.
We declare that we have not provided prohibited non-audit services referred to in art. 5 (1) of EU Regulation 537/2014 and that we have remained independent of the Company in conducting the audit.
We confirm that the opinion on the financial statements expressed in this report is consistent with the additional report to the Board of Statutory Auditors, in its role of Audit Committee, referred to in art. 11 of the said Regulation.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinion pursuant to art. 14 paragraph 2 (e) of Legislative Decree 39/10 and art. 123-bis, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree 58/98
The Directors of Piquadro S.p.A. are responsible for the preparation of the report on operations and the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure of Piquadro Group as of March 31st, 2018, including their consistency with the related consolidated financial statements and their compliance with the law.

In our opinion, the above-mentioned report on operations and some specific information contained in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure are consistent with the consolidated financial statements of Piquadro Group as of March 31, 2018 and are prepared in accordance with the law.

5
With reference to the statement referred to in art. 14, paragraph 2 (e), of Legislative Decree 39/10, made on the basis of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the related context acquired during the audit, we have nothing to report.
Statement pursuant to art. 4 of the Consob Regulation for the implementation of Legislative Decree 30 December 2016, no. 254 The Directors of Piquadro S.p.A. are responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree 30 December 2016, no. 254.

The Company's business
Piquadro S.p.A. designs and markets leather goods - bags, suitcases and accessories - characterised by attention to design and functional and technical innovation.
PIQUADRO GROUP
123

The Company was established on 26 April 2005. The Share Capital has been subscribed through the contribution of the branch of business relating to operating activities on the part of the former Piquadro S.p.A (then renamed Piqubo S.p.A., the ultimate company controlling the Company), which became effective for legal, accounting and tax purposes on 2 May 2005. Effective from 14 June 2007, the registered office of Piquadro S.p.A. was moved from Riola di Vergato (Bologna), via Canova no. 123/O-P-Q-R to Località Sassuriano 246, Silla di Gaggio Montano (Bologna). As of today's date, the Company is owned by Marco Palmieri through Piqubo S.p.A., which is 100% owned. Piqubo S.p.A., in fact, holds 93.34% of the Share Capital of Piquadro Holding S.p.A., which in its turn holds 68.3% of the Share Capital of Piquadro S.p.A., the shares of which are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange since 25 October 2007. The flexibility of the business model adopted by the Company allows it to maintain control over all of the critical phases of the production and distribution chain. Indeed, the Company carries out the design, planning, purchasing, quality, marketing, communication and distribution phases wholly within the confines of its organisation and only resorts to outsourcing for a part of the production activities, although it also retains control over the quality and efficiency of the phases that are currently outsourced. The Company is particularly focused on the activity of design, planning and development of the product, which is carried out by an internal team whose commitment is aimed at maintaining quality and style innovation which have always characterised the Company's products. In this regard, the design team, in light of the well-established experience of the persons who compose it, represents a fundamental resource for the Company. The Company makes use of a delocalised production model at the Chinese plant which is leased to the subsidiary Uni Best Leather Goods Zhongshan Co. Ltd., located in the region of Guangdong, China and at third-party workshops located abroad (mainly in China), which are generally divided on the basis of the type of product. About 34.9% of production is carried out internally within the Piquadro Group, at the Chinese plant of Zhongshan Guangdong, while the residual part is outsourced. This model, in the opinion of the Management, ensures flexibility and efficiency of the production cycle, thus reducing fixed costs, while retaining control over the critical phases of the value chain, also for the purpose of ensuring product quality.
Main events that occurred in the course of the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and related significant accounting effects
No events occurred during the financial year ended 31 March 2018, which had significant accounting effects.
Financial statements formats adopted and reporting currency
At the time of the preparation of the separate financial statements at 31 March 2017 and at 31 March 2018, the Management of Piquadro S.p.A. selected the following formats from among those specified under IAS 1 (revised), as it considered them to be more suitable to represent the Company's equity, economic and financial position:
· classification of the statement of financial position reporting current assets/liabilities and non-current assets/liabilities;
· classification of costs in the Income Statement by nature; · classification in the Statement of Comprehensive Income presented in a separate document with respect to
the Income Statement, as permitted by IAS 1 (revised); · preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows according to the indirect method.
The format of the Statement of Comprehensive Income has been amended in order to reflect the breakdown into components that can be reclassified and components that cannot be reclassified through profit and loss, as required by the amendments to IAS 1 introduced by Regulation (EC) no. 475/2012 (as illustrated in the paragraph on "Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations").
For a better recognition and ease of reading, except as regards the statement of financial position and the Income Statement, the accounting data both in the Financial Statements Formats and in these Notes to the Financial Statements, are reported in thousands of Euro. The reporting currency of these separate financial statements is the Euro.
The Management believe that no significant non-recurring events or transactions occurred either in the FY 2017/2018 or in the FY 2016/2017, nor any atypical or unusual transactions.
PIQUADRO GROUP

In compliance with Regulation (EU) no. 1606/2002, the separate financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A at 31 March 2018 were prepared in accordance with IAS/IFRS (International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, hereinafter also referred to as "IFRS") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and endorsed by the European Union, as supplemented by the related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), which was previously named Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), as well as by the related measures issued in the implementation of article 9 of Legislative Decree no. 38/2005.

Accounting policies

The accounting policies used in preparing the separate financial statements at 31 March 2018, which do not differ from those used in the previous financial year, are indicated below.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased or internally produced are entered under assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and when the cost of the asset may be determined reliably. These assets are valued at their purchase or production cost. Intangible assets relate to assets without an identifiable physical substance, which are controlled by the company and are able to generate future economic benefits, as well as any possible goodwill.

Intangible assets with a definite useful life are systematically amortised over their useful life, to be intended as the estimated period in which assets will be used by the company. Goodwill and any other intangible asset, where existing, with an indefinite useful life are not amortised, but are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, for the purposes of verifying the existence of impairment losses (if any). The rates applied are:

Development costs

25%

Patents

33.3%

Trademarks

10%

Key money (Rights to replace third parties in lease lease term

agreements for points of sale)

Concessions

33.3%

(i) Research and Development costs
Research costs are charged to the Income Statement in the financial year in which they are incurred. Development costs entered under intangible assets where all the following conditions are fulfilled:
a) the project is clearly identified and the related costs can be identified and measured reliably; b) the technical feasibility of the project has been demonstrated; c) the intention to complete the project and to sell the intangible assets generated by the project has been
demonstrated; d) a potential market exists or, in the case of internal use, the benefit of the intangible asset has been
demonstrated for the production of the intangible assets generated by the project; e) the technical and financial resources necessary for the completion of the project are available.
Amortisation of Development costs entered under intangible assets will start from the date when the result generated by the project is marketable. Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over a period of 4 years, which represents the estimated useful life of capitalised expenses.
(ii) Industrial patent and intellectual property rights, Licences and similar Rights
Charges relating to the acquisition of industrial patent and intellectual property Rights, Licences and similar Rights are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred for their purchase.

PIQUADRO GROUP
125

Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to allocate the cost incurred for the acquisition of the right over the shorter of the period of the expected use and the term of the related contracts, starting from the time when the acquired right may be exercised; usually, this period has a duration of 5 years.

(iii) Key money

Amortisation of the key money (that is payments to third parties to obtain the rights to take over lease agreements for points of sale) is calculated on a straight-line basis according to the lease term of the points of sale. The recoverability of the entry value of intangible assets, including goodwill, is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets".

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are entered at their purchase price or production cost, including any directlyattributable additional charges required to make the assets available for use. Costs incurred subsequent to the purchase are capitalised only if they increase the future economic benefits inherent in the asset to which they refer. The assets whose sale is highly probable as at the reporting date of the financial statements are separated from property, plant and equipment and classified under current assets under item "Current assets available for sale" and measured at the lower of the book value and the related fair value, net of estimated selling costs. The sale of an asset classified under non-current assets is highly probable when the Management has defined, by a formal resolution, a plan for the disposal of the asset (or of the disposal group) and activities have been started to identify a purchaser and to complete the plan. Furthermore, the asset (or the disposal group) has been offered for sale at a reasonable price compared to its current fair value. Furthermore, the sale is expected to be completed within a year of the date of classification and the actions required to complete the sale plan show that it is improbable that the plan can be significantly amended or cancelled.

Property, plant and equipment under finance leases, through which all risks and rewards attached to ownership are substantially transferred to the Company, are entered under the relevant classes of property, plant and equipment and are depreciated by applying the same depreciation rates reported below which have been adopted for the related relevant class, provided the lease term is less than the useful life represented by such rates and there is no reasonable certainty of the transfer of the ownership of the leased asset at the natural expiry of the agreement; in this case, the depreciation period is represented by the term of the lease agreement. Assets are entered against the entry of short- and medium-term payables to the lessor financial entity; rentals paid are allocated between financial charges and reduction in borrowings.

Leases in which the lessor substantially retains the risks and rewards attached to ownership of the assets are classified as operating leases. Costs for rentals arising from operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis on the basis of the contract term.

Property, plant and equipment are systematically depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life, to be intended as the estimated period in which the asset will be used by the company. The value to be depreciated is represented by the entry value as reduced by the presumed net transfer value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be determined reasonably. Land is not subject to depreciation, even if purchased jointly with a building, as well as the tangible assets intended for transfer which are valued at the lower of the entry value and their fair value, net of disposal charges. The rates applied are:

Land Buildings Leasehold improvements (shops) Machinery and moulds General systems Industrial and business equipment Office electronic machines Fittings Motor vehicles and means of internal transport

Unlimited useful life 3% 17.5%* 17.5% 17.5% 25% 20% 12% 20%

PIQUADRO GROUP
126

Cars

25%

* Or over the term of the lease agreement should the same be lower and there is not reasonable certainty of the renewal of the same at

the natural expiry of the contract.

Should the asset being depreciated be made up of elements that can be clearly identified and whose useful life significantly differs from that of the other parts making up the asset, depreciation is made separately for each of the parties making up the asset (component approach).

Ordinary maintenance costs are fully charged to the Income Statement. Costs for improvements, refurbishment and transformation increasing the value of property, plant and equipment are charged as an increase in the relevant assets and depreciated separately.

Financial charges directly attributable to the construction or production of a tangible asset are capitalised as an increase in the asset under construction, up to the time when it is available for use.

The recoverability of the entry value of property, plant and equipment is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets" below.

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the so-called purchase method (as defined by IFRS 3 (revised) "Business combinations"). The purchase method requires, after having identified the purchaser within the business combination and having determined the acquisition cost, all assets and liabilities acquired (including the so-called contingent liabilities) to be measured at fair value. Goodwill (if any) is determined only on a residual basis as the difference between the cost of the business combination and the relevant portion of the difference between acquired assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If negative, it is recognised as a positive component of the result for the period in which the business combination takes place. Transaction costs are directly charged to the Income Statement.

Business combinations of entities under common control

Business combinations of entities under common control are business combinations of entities which are ultimately controlled by the same persons both before and after the business combination and the control is not of a temporary nature. The presence of minority interests in each of the entities being combined before or after the combination transaction is not significant in order to determine whether the combination involves entities under common control. Business combinations of entities under common control are accounted for so that the net assets of the acquired entity and of the acquiring entity are recognised at the book values they had in the respective accounts before the transaction (continuity of values), without recognising, in the consolidated financial statements, surplus values (if any) arising from these combinations and accounted for in the separate financial statements of the Company.

Equity investments

Equity investments in Subsidiaries are accounted for at cost, which is possibly reduced for lasting impairment losses as required by IAS 36. The original value is reinstated in the subsequent financial years if the reasons for the write-down no longer apply. Equity investments in other companies are measured at fair value; if the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, the investment is valued at cost. The recoverability of their entry value is verified by adopting the criteria indicated in point "Impairment losses of assets".

Receivables and other non-current and current assets

Receivables and the other non-current and current assets are classified under financial assets "Loans and receivables". These are non-derivative financial instruments which mainly relate to receivables from customers and which are not listed on an active market, from which fixed or determinable payments are expected. They are included in the current portion, except for those with a maturity exceeding twelve months compared to the reporting date, which are classified under the non-current portion. Initially these assets are recognised at fair value;
PIQUADRO GROUP
127

subsequently, they are valued at amortised cost on the basis of the actual interest rate method. Should an objective evidence exist of any impairment, the asset is reduced so as to be equal to the discounted value of the flows that may be obtained in the future. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement. If the reasons for the previous write-downs no longer apply in the subsequent periods, the value of the assets is reinstated up to the amount of the value which would be derived from the application of amortised cost had no write-down been made.
Inventories
Inventories are valued and entered at the lower of the purchase or production cost, including additional charges, as determined according to the weighted average cost method, and the value of presumed realisable value inferable from the market performance.
Cash and cash equivalents
The item relating to cash and cash equivalents includes cash, current bank accounts, demand deposits and other short-term high-liquidity financial investments, which are readily convertible into cash, or which can be transformed into cash and cash equivalents within 90 days of the date of original acquisition, and are subject to a non-significant risk of changes in value.
Impairment losses of assets
When events occur that make an impairment of an asset expected, its recoverability is checked by comparing its entry value with the related recoverable value, represented by the higher of the fair value, net of disposal charges, and the value in use. In the absence of a binding sale agreement, the fair value is estimated on the basis of the values expressed by an active market, by recent transactions or on the basis of the best information available in order to reflect the amount that the business could obtain by selling the asset. The value in use is determined by discounting back the expected cash flows deriving from the use of the asset and, if they are significant and if they can be determined reasonably, from its transfer at the end of its useful life. Cash flows are determined on the basis of reasonable assumptions that can be proved and that represent a best estimate of the future economic conditions that will arise during the residual useful life of the asset, giving greater importance to external factors. Valuation is carried out for individual assets or for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows deriving from their on-going use (the so-called cash generating unit). An impairment is recognised in the Income Statement should the entry value of the asset or of the cash generating unit to which it is allocated be higher than the recoverable value. If the reasons for the write-downs previously made no longer apply, the assets, excluding goodwill, are reinstated and the adjustment is charged as a revaluation (reinstatement of value) in the Income Statement. The revaluation is made at the lower of the recoverable value and the entry value, including the write-downs previously made and reduced by the amortisation rates which would have been allocated had no write down been made.
Equity
The Share Capital is made up of the outstanding ordinary shares and is entered at its nominal value. Any costs relating to the issue of shares or options are classified as a reduction in Equity (net of the tax benefit related thereto) as a deduction of the income arising from the issue of such instruments.
In case of purchase of treasury shares, the price paid, including directly-attributable additional charges (if any), is deducted from the Companies' Equity up to the time of cancellation, reissue or disposal of the shares. When the said treasury shares are resold or reissued, the price received, net of directly attributable additional charges (if any) and of the related tax effect, is accounted for as an increase in the Company's Equity.
Reserve for financial assets/liabilities at fair value
This reserve refers to the effect of accounting for derivative instruments which are eligible for hedge accounting under Equity.
Legal reserve
PIQUADRO GROUP
128

Entries are made in the legal reserve through provisions recognised pursuant to art. 2430 of the Italian Civil Code, or the reserve is increased to an extent equal to the 20th part of the net profits achieved by the Company until the reserve in question reaches a fifth of the Share Capital. Once a fifth of the Share Capital is reached, if for whatever reason the reserve is decreased, it shall be replenished with the minimum annual provisions as indicated above.
Hedging financial instruments
The Company carries out transactions in derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The Company does not hold financial instruments of a speculative nature, as required by the risk policy approved by the Board of Directors. Consistently with IAS 39, hedging financial instruments are accounted for according to the procedures laid down for hedge accounting if all the following conditions are fulfilled:
i. at inception of the hedge, there is formal documentation of the hedging relationship and the company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge;
ii. the hedge is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value (fair value hedge) or cash flows (cash flow hedge) that are attributable to the hedged risk;
iii. for cash flow hedges, any forecast transaction being hedged is highly probable and presents an exposure to the changes in cash flows which could finally affect the economic result for the period;
iv. hedge effectiveness is reliably measurable, i.e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured;
v. the hedge must be assessed on an on-going basis and be highly effective for the entire life of the derivative.
The criterion for measuring hedging instruments is represented by their fair value as at the designated date. The fair value of foreign exchange derivatives is calculated in relation to their intrinsic value and time value. On each closing date of the financial statements, hedging financial instruments are tested for effectiveness, in order to verify whether the hedge meets the requirements to be qualified as effective and to be accounted for according to hedge accounting. When the financial instruments are eligible for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatments will be applied:
Fair value hedge - If a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a balance sheet asset or liability attributable to a specific risk that might impact the Income Statement, the profit or loss arising from the subsequent measurements at fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the Income Statement. The profit or loss on the hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, modify the book value of this item and are recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash flow hedge - If a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in future cash flows of an asset or liability entered in the accounts or of a forecast transaction which is highly probable and which could have effects on the Income Statement, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are taken to the Statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion (if any) is recognised in the Income Statement. If a hedging instrument or a hedging relationship are terminated, but the transaction being hedged has not yet been effected, the combined profits and losses, which have been entered under the Statement of Comprehensive Income up to that time, are recognised in the Income Statement at the time when the related transaction is carried out. If the transaction being hedged is no longer deemed probable, the profits or losses not yet realised and deferred to Equity are immediately recognised in the Income Statement. If the hedge accounting cannot be applied, the profits or losses arising from the measurement at fair value of the derivative financial instrument are immediately entered in the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are related to loans, trade payables and other obligations to pay and are initially recognised at fair value, while they are subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the actual interest rate method. Should a change occur in the expected cash flows and should it be possible to estimate them reliably, the value of the loans is recalculated to reflect this change on the basis of the present value of the new expected cash flows and of the internal rate of return determined initially. Financial liabilities are classified under current liabilities, unless the Company has an unconditional right to delay their payment for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
PIQUADRO GROUP
129

Financial liabilities are derecognised from the accounts at the time of their discharge or when the Company has transferred all the risks and charges relating to the instruments themselves. As the Company's financial liabilities have been incurred at variable interest rates, their fair value is substantially in line with the balance sheet value.

RISK FACTORS
The Company is exposed to risks associated with its own business, which are specifically referable to the following cases:
- Credit risk arising from business transactions or financing activities; - Liquidity risk relating to the availability of financial resources and to the access to the credit market; - Market risk which is identified in detail as follows:
o Foreign exchange risk, relating to operations in currencies other than currencies of denomination; o Interest rate risks, relating to the Company's exposure on financial instruments which bear interest.
Credit risk
The operational management of this risk is delegated to the Credit Management function which is shared by the Administration, Finance and Control Department with the Sales Department and is carried out as follows:
- assessing the credit standing of the customers; - monitoring the related expected incoming flows; - the appropriate payment reminder actions; - debt collection actions, if any. The write-down necessary to bring the nominal value in line with the expected collectable value has been determined by analysing all of the expired loans in the accounts and using all the available information on individual debtors.

PIQUADRO GROUP

Loans which are the object of disputes and for which there is a legal or insolvency procedure have been fully written down, while fixed write-down percentages have been applied to all the other receivables, again taking account of both legal and actual situations.

Liquidity risk
The financial requirements are affected by the dynamics of receipts from customers in the Wholesale channel, a segment which is mainly made up of points of sale/shops; as a consequence, credits are highly fragmented, with variable average payment times. Nevertheless, the Company is able to finance the growing requirements of net working Capital with ease, through the cash flows generated by operations, including the short-term receipts generated by the DOS channel and, when necessary, through recourse to short-term loans.
Furthermore, policies and processes have been adopted which are aimed at optimising the management of financial resources, thus reducing liquidity risks:
i. maintaining an adequate level of available funds; ii. obtaining adequate credit lines;

iii. monitoring the perspective liquidity conditions, in relation to the corporate process.

Below are reported the main assumptions for the table above: (i) Loans payable: the future cash flows have been provided directly by the banks concerned; (ii) Current bank accounts: by virtue of the worst case in which the worst scenario is equal to the repayment on demand of the use of the credit line, the related cash out has been charged to the first time band; (iii) Foreign exchange forwards: the cash out in Euro has been reported which has been envisaged as per contract at the time of the subscription of the derivative instruments; (iv) Finance leases: instalments, plus interest, have been reported.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group could rely on credit lines of about Euro 46,970 thousand (about Euro 40,855 thousand at 31 March 2017), of which unused lines of about Euro 23,497 thousand (about Euro 21,192 thousand at 31 March 2017) and on cash and cash equivalents of about Euro 23,552 thousand (Euro 15,288 thousand at 31 March 2017). As regards the balance of Current Assets, and specifically the coverage of payables to suppliers, it is also ensured by the amount of Net trade receivables, which amounted to Euro 27,618 thousand at 31 March 2018 (Euro 27,747 thousand at 31 March 2017).

MARKET RISK
Foreign exchange risk
The Company is subject to market risks arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies, as it operates in an international context in which transactions, mainly those with suppliers, are settled in US Dollars (USD). It follows that the Company's net result is partially affected by the fluctuations in the Euro and US Dollars exchange rate. The necessity to manage and control financial risks has induced the Management to adopt a risk containment strategy, better defined as "hedge accounting policy". This consists in continuously hedging the risks relating to purchases over a time period of six months on the basis of the amount of the orders issued that shall be settled in US dollars. This conduct can be classified as a "cash flow hedge" or the hedge of the risk of changes in the future cash flows; these flows can be related to assets or liabilities entered in the accounts or to highly probable future transactions. In compliance with IAS 39, the portions of profit or loss accrued on the hedging instrument, which is considered effective for hedging purposes, has been recognised directly in Equity under a special reserve.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the Parent Company executed forward currency contracts for USD 19,000 thousand, equal to an aggregate counter-value of Euro 16,233 thousand, with an average exchange rate of USD 1.170. During the financial year ended 31 March 2017, the Parent Company executed forward currency contracts for USD 11,750 thousand, equal to an aggregate counter-value of Euro 10,426 thousand, with an average exchange rate of USD 1.127.
For an analysis of the effects of these risks, reference is made to the table reported below (sensitivity analysis):

Capital risk Management

The Company manages the Capital with the objective of supporting the core business and optimising the value for Shareholders, while maintaining a correct structure of the Capital and reducing its cost. Piquadro S.p.A. monitors the Capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, which is calculated as the ratio between net debt and Net Invested Capital.

Employee benefits

PIQUADRO GROUP
136

Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006, the 2007 Finance Law, introduced considerable amendments as regards the allocation of funds of the Provision for TFR. Until 31 December 2006, TFR was included within the scope of postemployment benefit plans, of the "defined benefit" type of plans and was measured according to IAS 19, using the Projected Unit Credit method made by independent actuaries. This calculation consists in estimating the amount of the benefit that an employee will receive on the alleged date of termination of the employment relationship using demographic and financial assumptions. The amount that is thus calculated is then discounted back and reproportioned on the basis of the length of service built up against the total length of service and is a reasonable estimate of the benefits that each employee has already accrued with respect to the work performed. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions used are recognised in the Income Statement. As a result of the reform of supplementary pension schemes, the Provision for TFR, as regards the portion accrued from 1 January 2007, is to be considered as being substantially assimilated to a "defined contribution plan". In particular, these amendments introduced the possibility for workers to choose where to allocate the TFR that is accruing. In companies with more than 50 employees, the new TFR flows may be allocated by the worker to selected pension schemes or kept in the company and transferred to INPS (Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale, National Social Security Institute).
In short, following the reform on supplementary pension schemes, the Company has carried out an actuarial measurement of the TFR accrued before 2007, without further including the component relating to future pay increases. On the contrary, the portion accrued after 2007 has been accounted for according to the procedures attributable to defined contribution plans.
June 2012 saw the issue of Regulation (EC) no. 475/2012, which adopted, at EU level, the revised version of IAS 19 (Employee benefits), which will be applicable effective from 1 April 2013 on a mandatory and retrospective basis, as required by IAS 8 (Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors). As required by this standard, the Company applied said changes starting from the 2012/2013 consolidated financial statements. Specifically, IAS 19 revised provides for the recognition of changes in actuarial gains/losses ("remeasurements") for defined-benefit plans (e.g. the Staff Severance Pay [Trattamento di Fine Rapporto ­ TFR]) under Other Comprehensive Income, thus eliminating any other options previously envisaged (including that adopted by the Piquadro Group, which recognised said components under personnel costs in the Income Statement). Any cost relating to work performance, as well as any interest expense relating to the time value component in actuarial calculations (reclassified under financial charges) remained in the Income Statement. Below are the effects of the retrospective application of said changes in previous financial statements:
- the reclassification for Euro 32 thousand from the reserve of "Retained earnings" to the reserve for "Employee benefits" (classified under Other reserves), against actuarial effects recognised before 31 March 2013;
- the reclassification of actuarial effects relating to the FY 2012/2013, equal to Euro 6 thousand (including the related tax effect) from the profit for the period to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Provisions for risks and charges
Provisions for risk and charges cover certain or probable costs and charges of a fixed nature, whose timing or amount was uncertain at the closing date of the financial year. Provisions are recognised when: (i) it is probable that a current obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of past events; (ii) it is probable that the fulfilment of the obligation will require the payment of a consideration; (iii) the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are entered at the value representing the best estimate of the amount that the Company would rationally pay to discharge the obligation or to transfer it to third parties at the closing date of the period. When the financial effect of time is significant and the payment dates of the obligations can be estimated reliably, the provision is discounted back; the increase in the Provision connected with the passage of time is charged to the Income Statement under item "Financial income (Charges)". The Provision for supplementary clientele indemnity, as well as any other Provisions for risks and charges, is allocated on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the future probable liability, taking account of the available elements and also taking account of the estimates made by independent third-party actuaries.
Income taxes
PIQUADRO GROUP
137

Taxes for the period represent the sum of current and deferred taxes.
Current taxes are determined on the basis of a realistic forecast of charges to be paid in the application of the tax regulations in force; the related debt is reported net of advances, taxes withheld and tax credits that can be offset, under item "Current tax payables". If there is a credit, the amount is reported under item "Current tax receivables " under current assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities entered in the accounts and the corresponding values recognised for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are entered when it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified under noncurrent assets and liabilities and are offset if they refer to taxes that can be offset. The balance of the set-off is entered under item "Deferred tax assets" if positive and under item "Deferred tax liabilities" if negative". Both current and deferred taxes are recognised under item "Income tax expenses" in the Income Statement, except when these taxes are originated from transactions whose effects are recognised directly in Equity. In this case, the contra-entry of the recognition of the debt for current taxes, of deferred tax assets and liabilities is charged as a reduction in the Equity item from which the effect being recorded originated. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the tax rates which are expected to be applied in the tax year when these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be discharged. Furthermore, for a better representation of the provisions laid down under "IAS 12 ­ Income Taxes" in relation to the offsetting of deferred taxation, the Group has deemed it appropriate to reclassify portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities where there is a legal right to setoff current tax assets and the corresponding current tax liabilities.
Currency translation
Receivables and payables initially expressed in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company which recognises the receivable/payable (foreign currency) are translated into the functional currency of the said Company at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates on which the related transactions take place. The exchange rate differences realised on the occasion of the collection of receivables and the payment of debts in foreign currency are entered in the Income Statement. As at the reporting date of the financial statements, receivables and payables in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at that date, charging any changes in the value of the receivable/payable to the Income Statement (estimated foreign exchange gains and losses).
Revenue recognition
Revenues are recognised at the time of the transfer of all the risks and charges arising from the ownership of the transferred assets. Revenues and income are recognised net of returns, discounts, allowances and premiums, as well as of the taxes connected to the sale or performance of services. With reference to the main types of revenues achieved by the Company, they are recognised on the basis of the following criteria and as required by IAS 18: Sales of goods - retail segment. The Company operates in the retail business through its own network of DOSs. Revenues are accounted for at the time of the delivery of the goods to the customers, when all the risks are substantially transferred. Sales are usually collected directly or through credit cards. Sales of goods - Wholesale segment. The Company distributes products in the Wholesale market. The related revenues are accounted for at the time of the shipment of the goods, when all the risks are substantially transferred. Performance of services. These revenues are accounted for proportionally to the state of completion of the service rendered as at the relevant date. Sales based on repurchase commitments. Revenues and receivables from the buyer are recognised at the time of the delivery of the goods, while reversing the value of the sold goods from the assets. As at the reporting date, revenues and receivables are reversed on the basis of the sales made by the buyer in relation to the sold goods. The difference between the book value (which corresponds to the production cost) and the estimated resale value is recognised under the item "Inventories".
Financial income and revenues from services are recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost recognition
PIQUADRO GROUP
138

Costs are recognised when they relate to goods and services purchased and/or received during the period or relate to the systematic apportionment of an expense from which future benefits derive that can be apportioned over time.
Financial charges and charges from services are recognised on an accruals basis.
Use of estimates
The process of drawing up the financial statements involves the Management making accounting estimates based on complex and/or subjective judgements; these estimates are based on past experiences and assumptions that are considered reasonable and realistic on the basis of information known at the moment of making the estimate. The use of these accounting estimates affects the value of assets and liabilities and the disclosure on potential assets and liabilities as at the reporting date, as well as the amount of revenues and costs in the relevant period. The final results, or the actual economic effect that is recognised when the event takes place, of the financial statement items for which the abovementioned estimates and assumptions were used, may differ from those reported in the financial statements that recognise the effects arising from the event that is subject to estimation, due to the uncertainty that is characteristic of assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based.
Main estimates adopted by the Management
Below are briefly described the Accounting Standards which, more than others, require greater subjectivity on the part of the Directors in working out the estimates and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions applied could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial data:
Impairment of assets: property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a definite life are subject to verification in order to ascertain if an impairment has occurred. This impairment shall be recognised by means of a write-down when indicators exist that could lead to an expectation of difficulties in recovering the relative net book value through usage of the asset. Verifying that the abovementioned indicators exist requires Directors to exercise subjective valuations based on information available and inferable from the market, as well as using past experience. Moreover, should the likelihood of a potential impairment be ascertained, the Company will set about calculating this using the evaluation techniques that it considers appropriate. Correctly identifying the items that indicate the existence of a potential impairment and the estimates used for calculating the same depend on factors which can vary over time and affect the valuations and estimates carried out by the Directors.
Amortisation and depreciation of fixed assets: the amortisation and depreciation of fixed assets constitute a significant cost for the Company. The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful economic life of the Company's fixed assets is determined by the Directors at the time when the fixed asset has been purchased; it is based on past experience for similar fixed assets, market conditions and expectations regarding future events which could have an impact on the useful life, including changes in technology. Therefore, the actual economic life may differ from the estimated useful life. The Company periodically evaluates technological and sector changes in order to update the residual useful life. This periodical update could involve a variation in the depreciation period and therefore also in the depreciation rates for future financial years.
Deferred taxes: deferred tax assets are accounted for on the basis of the income expected in the future financial years. The measurement of the expected income for the purposes of accounting for deferred taxes depends on factors which can vary over time and determine significant effects on the measurement of deferred tax assets.
Provisions for legal and tax risks: provisions are made for legal and tax risks, if required, which represent the risk of being the losing party. The amount of the Provisions (if any) entered in the accounts statements relating to such risks represents the best estimate at that time made by Management. This estimate entails the adoption of assumptions which depend on factors which can vary over time and which could therefore have effects compared to the current estimated made by the Directors for the preparation of the financial statements.
Below are reported the critical accounting estimates of the process of drawing up the financial statements for which the Management has availed itself of the support and valuations of independent third-party experts (actuaries and financial advisors). Please note that future amendments (if any) to the conditions underlying the judgments, assumptions and estimates adopted could have an impact on the results of financial years after 2016/2017.
PIQUADRO GROUP
139

Actuarial calculation of defined-benefit pension plans: the estimates, demographic and economic-financial assumptions adopted, with the support of the valuations of an actuarial expert, in the actuarial calculation for the determination of defined-benefit plans within post-employment benefits are broken down as follows:

Annual rate of inflation
1.75% for 2018 and 1.75% for 2017

Probability of exit of the employee from the Company
Frequency of 0.15% for 2018 and 0.15% for 2017

Probability of advance payments of the TFR 3.50% for 2018 and 3.50% for 2017

Finally, it is specified that the actuarial valuations have been made by using the curve of the interest rates of the corporate securities with rating AA 10+.

Amendments to Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards, amendments and interpretations
The following accounting standards, amendments and IFRS interpretations were applied by the Group for the first time as from 1 January 2017:
gg) Amendment to IAS 7 "Disclosure Initiative" (published on 29 January 2016). The document's purpose is to provide some clarifications in order to improve disclosures on financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments require information that allows the users of the financial statements to understand the changes in liabilities arising from financing transactions. The Group has provided this disclosure in paragraph 15.
hh) Amendment to IAS 12 "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" (published on 19 January 2016). The document's purpose is to provide some clarifications on the recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealised losses in the measurement of "Available for Sale" financial assets upon the occurrence of certain circumstances and based on estimated taxable income for future financial years. The adoption of these amendments has not entailed any impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the European Union but not yet applicable and not adopted in advance by the Piquadro Group at 31 March 2018.
IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers (published on 28 May 2014 and supplemented by additional clarifications published on 12 April 2016), which is intended to replace IAS 18 ­ Revenue and IAS 11 ­ Construction Contracts, as well as the interpretations IFRIC 13 ­ Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 ­ Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 ­ Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC 31 ­ Revenues-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. The standard establishes a new method to account for revenues, which shall apply to any and all contracts entered into with customers, except for those that fall within the scope of application of other IAS/IFRS, such as leases, insurance contracts and financial instruments. According to the new model, the basic steps to account for revenues are: -identify the contract with a customer; -identify the performance obligations in the contract; -determine the transaction price; -allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; -recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard shall apply from 1 January 2018. The amendments to IFRS 15, Clarifications to IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers were endorsed by the European Union on 6 November 2017. On the basis of the analyses conducted, the directors expect that the application of IFRS 15 will have no significant impact on the amounts stated on account of revenues and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements. Final version of IFRS 9 ­ Financial Instruments (published on 24 July 2014). The document describes the results of the project to replace IAS 39: - i introducing new criteria for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities (together with the measurement of changes in financial liabilities which are not substantial); - with reference to impairment, the new standard requires credit losses to be estimated on the basis of the expected-loss
PIQUADRO GROUP
140

model (rather than the incurred-loss model used by IAS 39), using supportable information, which is reasonably available without undue cost and which includes historical data, both present and prospective; -introducing a new hedge accounting model (increased eligibility for hedge accounting, change in the method to account for forward contracts and options when they are embedded in a hedge accounting relationship, changes in the effectiveness test). The new standard shall apply to the financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. On the basis of the analyses conducted, the directors expect that the application of IFRS 9 will have no significant impact on the amounts and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements. IFRS 16 ­ Leases (published on 13 January 2016), intended to replace IAS 17 ­ Leases, as well as the interpretations IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The new standard provides a new definition of lease and sets out a control model (right of use) of an asset, distinguishing leases from service contracts, on the basis of whether the following key requirements are met, i.e. an identified asset, the right to substitute an identified asset, the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset underlying the contract. The standard provides for a single model to account for and measure lease agreements for lessees, which provides for the recognition of the leased asset, including under operating leases, among assets against an entry under borrowings, while also providing for the possibility of not recognising agreements involving "low-value assets" and agreements with a term equal to or less than 12 months as leases. On the contrary, the Standard does not include significant amendments for lessors. The standard will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted, only for the Companies that have already applied IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Directors expect that the application of IFRS 16 might have a significant impact on the amounts and on the related disclosure reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements; however, it is not possible to provide estimated effects until the Company has completed a detailed analysis. The impact will mainly concern the accounting for property lease payments.
Document named "Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts" (published on 12 September 2016). As regards the entities the core business of which consists of insurance, the amendments are aimed at clarifying the concerns about the application of the new standard IFRS 9 (from 1 January 2018) to financial assets, before the IASB replaces the current standard IFRS 4 with the new standard that is currently being prepared, on the basis of which financial liabilities are measured. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed by the European Union
As at the reporting date of these Financial Statements, the competent bodies of the European Union had not yet completed the endorsement process required for the adoption of the amendments and standards described below.
· On 18 May 2017 the IASB published IFRS 17 ­ Insurance Contracts, which is intended to replace IFRS 4 ­ Insurance Contracts. The purpose of the new standard is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that gives a true view of the rights and obligations arising from insurance contracts. The IASB has developed the standard in order to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses of existing accounting policies, providing a single principle-based framework to take account of any type of insurance contract, including reinsurance contracts held by an insurer. The standard will be applicable from 1 January 2021, with early adoption permitted, only for entities that apply IFRS 9 ­ Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 ­ Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The directors expect that the adoption of this standard will not entail any significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IFRS 2 "Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions" (published on 20 June 2016), which contains some clarifications relating to the accounting treatment of the effects of vesting conditions in the case of cash-settled share-based payments, the classification of share-based payments with characteristics of net settlement and the accounting treatment of amendments to the terms and conditions of a sharebased payment that change its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled. The amendments shall apply from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

· Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-2016 Cycle", published on 8 December 2016 (including IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards - Deletion of short-term exemptions for first-time adopters, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures ­ Measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss: an investment-by-investment choice or a consistent policy choice, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ­ Clarification of the scope of the Standard), which partially make additions to the pre-existing standards. The most amendments shall apply from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· IFRIC 22 "Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration" (published on 8 December 2016). The purpose of the interpretation is to provide guidelines for transactions effected in foreign currency where non-cash prepayments or advances are stated in the accounts before the recognition of the related asset, cost or revenue. This document provides instructions on how an entity must set the date of a transaction, and, accordingly, the spot exchange rate to be used when foreign currency transactions take place, within which payments are made or received in advance. IFRIC 22 will be applicable from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IAS 40 "Transfers of Investment Property" (published on 8 December 2016). These amendments clarify the transfers of a property to, or from, investment property. Specifically, an entity must reclassify a property to, or from, investment property only when there is evidence that a change occurred in the intended use of the property. This change must be attributed to a specific event that has occurred and, therefore, it must not be limited to a change in the intentions of the entity's Management. These amendments will be applicable from 1 January 2018. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· On 7 June 2017 the IASB published the interpretation IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The document deals with the uncertainty over income tax treatments and provides for uncertainties in measuring tax assets or liabilities to be recognised only when it is probable that the entity will pay or recover the amount in question. Furthermore, the document does not provide for any new disclosure obligation but points out that the entity shall establish whether it is necessary to provide information on the considerations made by the management in relation to the uncertainty over tax treatments, in accordance with IAS 1. The new interpretation will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of this interpretation will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IFRS 9 "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (published on 12 October 2017). This document specifies that the instruments providing for early redemption might pass the "SPPI" test even when the "reasonable additional compensation" to be paid for early redemption is a "negative compensation" for the lending entity. The amendment will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IAS 28 "Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (published on 12 October 2017)". This document clarifies the requirements to apply IFRS 9, including impairment requirements, to other long-term interests in associates and joint ventures for which the equity method is not applied. The amendment will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· "Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle", published on 12 December 2017 (including IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements ­ Remeasurement of previously held interests in a joint operation, IAS 12 Income Taxes ­ Income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity, IAS 23 Borrowing costs - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ­ Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation) which adopt the amendments to some standards within the related annual improvement process. The amendments will be applicable from 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The directors expect that the adoption of these amendments will not entail any significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 "Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture" (published on 11 September 2014). The document was published for the purpose of solving the present conflict between IAS 28 and IFRS 10 relating to the measurement of profits or losses arising from the sale

or contribution of a non-monetary asset to a joint venture or associate in exchange for an interest in the latter's capital. At present the IASB has suspended the application of this amendment. · IFRS 14 ­ Regulatory Deferral Accounts (published on 30 January 2014) which only allows IFRS first-time adopter entities to continue to recognise the amounts relating to Rate Regulation Activities according to the previous accounting standards adopted. Since the Group is not a first-time adopter, this standard is not applicable.

The increase in non-current financial assets related to the payments on account of capital made in favour of Subsidiary OOO Piquadro Russia and of The Bridge S.p.A.. Write-downs and revaluations for the year were due to the realignment between the book value of the subsidiary in in Piquadro and the related Equity value. Finally, other changes related to reclassifications made during the year for a more correct recognition in the accounts. The Company has conducted the impairment test of investee The Bridge, which shows a differential between the book value of the investee and the equity equal to Euro 3,627 thousand, in order to recognise losses and/or value reinstatements (if any) to be charged to Profit or Loss, following the procedure required by IAS 36 and thus comparing the book value of the investee and the value in use given by the present value of estimated cash flows that are expected to arise from the continuing use of the asset involved in the impairment test.

The Unlevered Discounted Cash Flow method has been used, which arises from the plan for the 2019-2023 period that was approved by the Company on 29 May 2018. The plan is based on the Management's best estimate on the future operating performance of subsidiary The Bridge and does not include any possible non-recurring operation and/or operations that had not yet been defined on the closing date of the financial year. The impairment test was approved by the Company's Board of Directors' meeting held on 11 June 2018.

The terminal value has been calculated based on the "perpetual annuity" formula, assuming a "g-rate" growth rate equal to zero on a prudential basis and considering an operating cash flow based on the last year of explicit forecasts, as adjusted in order to project a stable situation "perpetually", specifically using the following main

PIQUADRO GROUP
147

assumptions: - balancing between investments and amortisation and depreciation (with a view to considering an investment level required to maintain the business continuity); - change in working capital equal to zero. The value obtained by adding discounted cash flows for the explicit period to the terminal value ("Enterprise Value"), must be reduced by the net financial debt as at the date of valuation, 31 March 2018, in order to obtain the economic value of the tested equity investments ("Equity Value"). The average cost of capital is the result of the weighted average cost of debt (prepared by considering the relevant rates, plus a "spread"). The cost of net worth is determined by using the levered beta value and the financial structure of a panel of comparables in the sector. The WACC used has been equal to 8.5%.
The impairment test conducted on this equity investment has not reported any impairment loss to be charged to profit or loss as at 31 March 2018.
Furthermore, also on the basis of the instructions laid down in the document no. 4 that was prepared jointly by the Bank of Italy, CONSOB and ISVAP on 3 March 2010, the Company has taken steps to prepare the sensitivity analysis based on the results of the impairment test with respect to the changes in the basic assumptions that may affect the value in use of the equity investment. Likewise, the analyses did not report any impairment loss in the case of a positive change of 3.5% in the WACC or of 10% in cash flows.

Note 4 - Receivables from others
Receivables from others (equal to Euro 304 thousand as at 31 March 2018 compared to Euro 292 thousand as at 31 March 2017) relate to guarantee deposits paid by the Company for various utilities, including those relating to the operation of Company-owned shops.

Note 5 ­ Receivables from subsidiaries
At 31 March 2018 these amounted to Euro 7,325 thousand, including the long-term portion of the loan granted to subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A. at arm's length during the previous year. For the purposes of a more detailed reporting as previously referred to in the paragraph on the £Introduction", the accounts also include the reclassification of the long-term portion of the loan for the previous year, equal to Euro 7,298 thousand. For more details on the current portion of the aforesaid loan, see note 9.

Gross trade receivables showed a balance of Euro 22,594 thousand at 31 March 2018, showing a decrease of Euro 181 thousand compared to the balance as at 31 March 2017. This decrease was mainly attributable to a better credit management and to lower average collection times.

The adjustment to the face value of receivables from customers at their presumed realisable value was obtained through a special Provision for bad debts, whose changes are showed in the table below:

The decrease in receivables from Subsidiaries was mainly due to a more accurate management of intercompany relations between them and the Paent Company. Three loans are recognised between the Parent Company and Piquadro Swiss, Piquadro Deutschland and The Bridge S.p.A., respectively, all disbursed at arm's length. The receivable relating to The Bridge S.p.A. totalled Euro 8,298 thousand at 31 March 2018 (Euro 8,320 thousand at 31 March 2017). The related long-term portion has been reclassified to non-current assets, for which reference is made to note 5.

Other assets were mainly made up of advances to suppliers for Euro 356 housand and INAIL advances of Euro 66 thousand.

There was also the recognition of a receivable of Euro 792 thousand from the minority interests of The Bridge S.p.A. in relation to liabilities, including potential liabilities, arising from the outcome of the Tax Audit in progress. The subsidiary The Bridge has been involved in a tax audit since September 2016, which was completed on 16 March 2017 through the service of a report of findings (Processo Verbale di Constatazione, PVC). Following a thorough examination of the PVC on the part of tax advisors, a specific provision was set aside for the amount of liabilities for higher tax, sanctions and interest, which are expected to arise, with an appreciable degree of probability, in relation to the objections contained in the PVC. Against this liability, Il Ponte Pelletteria S.p.A., which is the selling party and a minority shareholder of The Bridge S.p.A., has undertaken to reimburse Piquadro S.p.A. for an amount equal to the costs that were accounted for in the 2016 financial statements in relation to liabilities, including potential liabilities, arising from the completion of the tax audit. There is no problem of recoverability in relation to this credit. On 25 May 2018, the dispute was settled by signing an interview report (assessment by agreement) whereby a liability was set out which, also considering litigation management costs, is not significantly different from the amount set aside in the aforesaid provision for risks.

There were no developments concerning this tax dispute as at the date of these notes.

There had been no developments in that regard as at the date of these notes.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 14 OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE No. 39 OF JANUARY 27, 2010
AND ARTICLE 10 OF THE EU REGULATION 537/2014
To the Shareholders of Piquadro S.p.A.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Piquadro (the "Company"), which comprise the balance sheet as at March 31, 2018, the income statement and the comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2018, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of national regulations issued pursuant to art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/05.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment test on investments
Description of key audit matter
The financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. as of 31 March 2018 report investments in subsidiaries totalling Euro 9,729 thousand of which Euro 4,208 thousand related to investment in The Bridge S.p.A.

In the Company's financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost adjusted for impairment losses. In line with "IAS 36 Impairment of assets", if any impairment indicator exists, the Company carries out an impairment test by comparing the recoverable amount of the investments determined according to the value in use method ­ to their carrying amount. In particular, as of 31 March 2018, the requirement to perform the impairment test existed only for the investment in The Bridge S.p.A. and the outcome proved no need to record any impairment loss.
The valuation process adopted by management is complex and is based on a series of assumptions, such as the forecast cash flows, the appropriate discounting rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate (g-rate). These assumptions are, by nature, influenced by future expectations regarding the evolution of external market conditions, which constitute an element of uncertainty in the estimate.
Considering the significance of the negative differences between the book value of the above investment and the corresponding portion of equity, the subjectivity of the estimates relating to the determination of the cash flows and the key assumptions of the impairment test, we considered the impairment test was a key audit matter for the financial statements of the Company.
Note 3 of the financial statements present information about the investments, including the impairment test, which comprises a sensitivity analysis that describes the effects of changing the key assumptions used to carry out the impairment test.
Audit procedures adopted
We first examined the approach taken by Management to determine the value of the Investments in subsidiaries, analysing the methods and assumptions applied by Management to carry out the impairment test.
In the context of our audit work we performed the following procedures, among others, partly with assistance from experts of the Deloitte network:
· observation and understanding of the relevant controls implemented by Piquadro Group over the impairment testing process and the identification of impairment indicator;
· analysis of the reasonableness of the principal assumptions made in order to forecast cash flows, partly by analysing external data and obtaining information from Management that we deemed to be significant;
· analysis of actual values in comparison with the original plans, in order to assess the nature of variances and the reliability of the budgeting process;
· assessment of the reasonableness of the discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate (g-rate), partly via the appropriate identification of and reference to external sources that are normally used in professional practice and to key data for main comparables;
· verification of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to determine the value in use of the investment in the Bridge S.p.A.;
· verification of the sensitivity analysis prepared by Management.
We also examined the adequacy of the information disclosed by the Group about the impairment test and its consistency with the requirements of IAS 36.

Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of national regulations issued pursuant to art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/05 and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the Company or for the termination of the operations or have no realistic alternative to such choices.
The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

4
We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence applicable in Italy, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report.
Other information communicated pursuant to art. 10 of the EU Regulation 537/2014
The Shareholders' Meeting of Piquadro S.p.A. has appointed us on July 26, 2016 as auditors of the Company for the years from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2025.
We declare that we have not provided prohibited non-audit services referred to in art. 5 (1) of EU Regulation 537/2014 and that we have remained independent of the Company in conducting the audit.
We confirm that the opinion on the financial statements expressed in this report is consistent with the additional report to the Board of Statutory Auditors, in its role of Audit Committee, referred to in art. 11 of the said Regulation.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinion pursuant to art. 14, paragraph 2 (e), of Legislative Decree 39/10 and art. 123-bis, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree 58/98
The Directors of Piquadro S.p.A. are responsible for the preparation of the report on operations and the report on corporate governance and ownership structure of Piquadro S.p.A. as at March 31, 2018, including their consistency with the related financial statements and their compliance with the law.
We have carried out the procedures set forth in the Auditing Standard (SA Italia) n. 720B in order to express an opinion on the consistency of the report on operations and some specific information contained in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure set forth in art. 123-bis, n. 4 of Legislative Decree 58/98 with the financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. as at March 31, 2018 and on their compliance with the law, as well as to make a statement about any material misstatement. In our opinion, the above-mentioned report on operations and information contained in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure are consistent with the financial statements of Piquadro S.p.A. as at March 31, 2018 and are prepared in accordance with the law.

5
With reference to the statement referred to in art. 14, paragraph 2 (e), of Legislative Decree 39/10, made on the basis of the knowledge and understanding of the entity and of the related context acquired during the audit, we have nothing to report.
