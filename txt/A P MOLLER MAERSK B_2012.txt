Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller In memoriam (1913­2012)

Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller left an indelible mark on the A.P. Moller - Maersk Group, Denmark and the international business community.
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller dedicated his life to the businesses that his father had founded and which they developed together until A.P. Møllers death in 1965.
Even as a boy, the young Mærsk was involved in the office, at the shipyard and on the vessels. He was therefore no stranger to the business when he first joined the Company.
He began his apprenticeship in 1930, and the experience he gained from shipping and banking companies in Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom and France was significant in shaping the unique part that Mærsk McKinney Møller was to play in international business.

Mr. Møller understood the big picture as well as the numerous small details that make up the whole. He also understood the need to keep focussing on new areas. He was able to look at an issue from all angles and to challenge experts before making the final decision. The decision would then be carried out during busy hours everywhere in offices, on ships, platforms, rigs, at shipyards, terminals and in aircrafts by teams of talented and inspired individuals, followed by an attentive Mr. Møller.
The strength that comes from stable ownership was very important to Mr. Møller. The Foundations created by his father form a guarantee for long-term stability of Group operations and this weighed heavily on Mr. Møllers mind. As chairman of the Foundations, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller was responsible for the inward consolidation of values, as well as the many public donations, both large and small, that have benefited society at large.

Mr. Møller ­ as he was called, just like his father ­ joined the Company in 1938 and became a partner in the Firm A.P. Moller in 1940. He managed the Companys interests in the USA from 1940 to 1947.
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller took over the helm in 1965, paying profound respect to his fathers work and the values that he had created and instilled. However, his attention was also directed towards new opportunities of an increasingly globalised world.

Mr. Møller followed the business to the very end of his life. He attended the Annual General Meeting and dinner just four days before his death on 16 April 2012.
Mr. Møllers parting words to the Groups Board of Directors and management team after the dinner were "Good Night and Goodbye ­ and Thank You".

Mr. Møllers approach to the business was focussed, showing constant care and a great sense of responsibility towards the Company. His rare energy and unlimited commitment, combined with the support of his staff, helped expand the Company into all parts of the world.

It all began in 1904...

Todays A.P. Moller - Maersk Group builds on more than 100 years of experience in global trade.

staff. That was the foundation for todays Governance Commitments.

Mr. A.P. Møller (1876­1965) initiated and developed the original shipping company into a diverse group of businesses.
A.P. Møller was born into a shipping family and his father Peter Mærsk Møller strongly supported the start up of the company. Through his daily work, A.P. Møller expressed the family principles and values in management and eventually imbued them on his

A.P. Møller led the activities within shipping, energy and industries to establish the Group as a leading company not only in Denmark, but also on the international business scene.
To secure the future of his lifetimes work, A.P. Møller established Foundations to own and manage the Group.

Before returning to Denmark in 1904, A.P. Møller was employed in trading houses and shipping companies in England, Germany and Russia. Upon his return, A.P. Møller took up a position with a leading ship owner in Copenhagen, but with the provision that he could invest in his own ships.
1904
The Steamship Company Svendborg was founded by A.P. Møller, supported by his father Peter Mærsk Møller and leading citizens of Svendborg. The steam ship SVENDBORG was acquired in October 1904.

1912
To facilitate expansion, A.P. Møller founded the Steamship Company of 1912 and established his own business.

1913
The Maersk fleet consisted of nine ships.

1921
The motor ship Leise Mærsk entered the Maersk Fleet; incidentally LEISE MÆRSK became the first ship on a Maersk Lines first voyage in 1928.

1930
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møllers career began in Denmark. Later, Mr. Møller worked in shipping, brokerage and banking in Germany, England and France until 1938, where he returned to Copenhagen to work in his fathers company.

1928
That year turned out to be a pivotal year for Maersk.

1918
A.P. Møller was able to realise the ambition to combine shipping with shipbuilding. Odense Steel Shipyard was founded and ships would be built at this yard until 1966.
Maersk ships called ports in Europe, Africa and the Americas.

Global consumption of petroleum products increased and in 1928 A.P. Møller seized the opportunity to add five crude oil tankers to the fleet ­ the beginning of Maersk Tankers.
Maersk Lines first voyage took place in 1928, inaugurating the Panama Line between the USA and the Far East.
New markets were explored as Maersk ships traded in Asia and Australia for the first time.

Agents were contracted to handle Maersk Lines business in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo, supported by the offices in New York and Copenhagen.
In the period from its inauguration in 1918 to 1939, Odense Steel Shipyard delivered 79 ships; of these 29 entered the Maersk Fleet.

1940
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller became a partner in his fathers firm and travelled to New York to manage the fleet during the German occupation of Denmark.

Maersk Line expanded its network, initially in the Far East and later to the Arabian Gulf and Africa.

1962
The A.P. Moller Group was awarded the concession for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in Denmark.
1964
A.P. Møllers last major initiative before his death in 1965 was to support the expansion plans of the Danish merchant Herman Salling. The result was Dansk Supermarked Group, the retail arm of Maersk.

The Foundations
A.P. Møllers concern that his life's work would be taken over by investors who had a different view on running a business was resolved by the establishment of three foundations; The Family Foundation, The A.P. Moller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Moller Foundation and The Relief Foundation.
Albeit the purposes were different, the common goal was to ensure that the Groups businesses would be managed according to A.P. Møllers principles and values.

1940-1945
150 sailors and 25 of the Maersk Fleets 46 ships were lost to war causes.
Towards the end of the period, focus was to acquire replacement tonnage and regain market shares. Immediately after Liberation in May 1945 seven new buildings entered the fleet from the Odense Steel Shipyard and the surviving ships were recovered from the warring countries.

1955
In response to the growing energy demand in the world market, Maersk Tankers acquired larger and larger ships. One of those was REGINA MÆRSK, the first ship to have its hull painted in the distinct Maersk Blue.

Quietly, privately and later through the Foundations, A.P. Møller donated funds to support a range of causes, mainly of national importance.
A.P. Møller chaired the Foundations until 1965, when Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller became Chairman. The family commitment continues as Ane Mærsk Mc-Kinney Uggla succeeded her father in 2012 in The A.P. Moller and Chastine McKinney Moller Foundation, which owns the majority of voting shares in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.

1946
Maersk Line resumed its service between the USA and the Far East. Soon afterwards the first roundthe-world sailings took place, via the Suez and Panama canals.

1959
The Lindø shipyard was established to build ships up to 200,000 tons. In 1969 the yard was expanded to a capacity of 650,000 tons.

The shipping activities were expanded with special vessels transporting bulk cargoes, cars and refined oil products as well as supply vessels for off-shore.

The Group invested in industrial companies producing refined oil products and the relatively new product called plastic.

Following the divestments of several business units during the 2000s, A.P. Moller - Maersk presented its focused strategy within shipping and energy.

The symbols and the names in the Group are valuable for us, not least because of their background with the founding family.
The Mærsk name derives from Peter Mærsk Møllers side of the family.
His middle name came from his mother, Kiersten Pedersdatter Mærsk, whose family originally was from West Slesvig. The first known bearer of the name was Anders Nielsen Mersch, who lived in the area between 1617 and 1698.

2011
Maersk Drilling continued its expansion with the order for four drill ships.

Mærsk (also spelled mersk or marsk) is Danish for marshland, which is the typical landscape in West Slesvig. In the international context, MAERSK is used.

1928
The first logo was implemented as part of Maersk Lines efforts to market its new liner service from the USA to the Far East.

2004
By far its largest donation, The Moller Foundation built the Opera in Copenhagen to the Danish state.

Board of Directors Left to right: John Axel Poulsen, Erik Rasmussen, Robert Routs, Lars Pallesen, vice chairman Niels Jacobsen, vice chairman Ane Mærsk Mc-Kinney Uggla, chairman Michael Pram Rasmussen, Leise Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller, Jan Leschly, Jan Tøpholm, Arne Karlsson, Sir John Bond.

With an equity ratio of 52.9% (51.4%) and a liquidity buffer of USD 13.6bn (USD 11.3bn), the Group is well prepared and determined to execute on its long-term growth aspirations and seize market opportunities within its core businesses despite continued constraints in the financial markets.
Maersk Line made a profit of USD 461m (loss of USD 553m) and a ROIC of 2.4% (negative 3.1%). The result was positively affected by improved volumes, rates and unit costs. The average freight rates were 1.9% higher at 2,881 USD/FFE (2,828 USD/FFE) and volumes increased by 5% to 8.5m FFE (8.1m FFE). Bunker consumption per FFE was reduced by 11% and headquarters headcount was reduced significantly.
Maersk Line announced and implemented significant general rate increases on most trades backed by active capacity adjustments in the form of slow steaming, scrappings, idling and blanked sailings. The total fleet capacity increased by 4% to 2.6m TEU (2.5m TEU). The capacity growth in owned fleet was partly offset by redelivery of time charter vessels. Maersk Line maintained its market share for the full year. Cash flow from operating activities

was USD 1.8bn (USD 899m) and cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 3.6bn (USD 3.2bn).
Maersk Oil made a profit of USD 2.4bn (USD 2.1bn) and a ROIC of 36.6% (37.2%). The result was positively affected by the one-off tax income of USD 899m from the settlement of an Algerian tax dispute and a USD 91m gain from a partial divestment of interests in Brazil. This was partly offset by a 23% decline in the Groups share of oil and gas production to 257,000 boepd (333,000 boepd), primarily due to a lower share of production in Qatar and Denmark.
Development of the portfolio included maturation of the significant projects Chissonga in Angola and Johan Sver drup in Norway, and an agreement of further development of the Al Shaheen field in Qatar and start-up of Dunga Phase II production in Kazakhstan. Exploration expenses were USD 1.1bn (USD 1.1bn). Cash flow from operating activities was USD 3.9bn (USD 4.3bn) and cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 2.0bn (USD 3.8bn).
APM Terminals made a profit of USD 723m (USD 648m) and ROIC was 13.6% (13.1%). The result was positively affected by pre-tax divestment gains of USD 123m (USD

28m). Number of containers handled increased by 6% to 35.4m TEU (33.5m TEU), ahead of the market growth of 4%, boosted by additions to the portfolio.
The main portfolio changes were the acquisition of a 37.5% co-controlling stake in Global Ports Investments PLC, Russia, as well as the take-over of operations in Gothenburg, Sweden. New terminal projects were secured in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, and in Ningbo, China. Cash flow from operating activities was USD 975m (USD 912m) and cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 1.4bn (USD 688m).

Europe segment and entered into an agreement to divest the Handygas segment. The Handygas transaction will take place in 2013. The divestments are equivalent to 14% of the fleet measured on invested capital.
Damco made a profit of USD 55m (USD 63m) and ROIC was 13.5% (24.4%). Damco significantly increased its service offerings within the airfreight market through the acquisition in 2011 of NTS International Transport Services in China. In October 2012, Damco acquired the freight forwarder Pacific Network Global Logistics, strengthening its position in Oceania.

Maersk Drilling made a profit of USD 359m (USD 488m) and ROIC was 8.3% (12.5%). The result was negatively impacted by delayed start-up and maintenance yard stays of two units.

SVITZER made a profit of USD 9m (USD 102m) after impairment of goodwill of USD 102m related to the Adsteam activities acquired in 2007. ROIC was 0.6% (6.4%).

During 2012, Maersk Drilling has entered into three new major contracts and has now secured contracts for five out of seven newbuildings to be delivered in 2013-2015. The revenue backlog increased to USD 7.0bn (USD 4.9bn), and the one-year forward coverage by the end of 2012 was 98% (98% at the end of 2011). Operational uptime averaged 92.1% (95.6%). Cash flow from operating activities was USD 651m (USD 825m) and cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 589m (USD 600m).
Maersk Supply Service made a profit of USD 132m (USD 243m) and a ROIC of 6.1% (11.2%), negatively affected by general oversupply in most segments of the market, except in the emergency response and rescue segment.

Dansk Supermarked Group made a profit of DKK 1.3bn (DKK 5.4bn including gain from sale of Netto, UK) and a ROIC of 8.2% (35.1%). The Group opened 71 new stores and closed 55 stores of which 37 were Tøj & Sko stores.
Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG made a profit of USD 336m (USD 10m) and a ROIC of 33.9% (0.4%), positively affected by divestment gains of USD 245m.
Share price and dividend During 2012, the Maersk B-share price increased by 12.3% to DKK 42,600. The dividend payout proposed by the Board of Directors is DKK 1,200 per share of DKK 1,000, representing a dividend yield of 2.8% based on the B-share closing price as of 31 December 2012.

Maersk Tankers made a loss of USD 312m (loss of USD 153m) and a negative ROIC of 8.3% (negative 4.3%). The result was negatively affected by a USD 268m impairment loss. Maersk Tankers divested the Small Northwest

Outlook for 2013

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012

Outlook for 2013
The Group expects a result for 2013 below the 2012 result (USD 4.0bn). The operational result is expected to be in line with 2012 (USD 2.9bn) excluding impairment losses, divestment gains and gain from the tax settlement in Algeria.

Cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be somewhat higher than the USD 6.3bn in 2012, while cash flow from operating activities is expected to be stable.

Maersk Drilling has almost full contract coverage in 2013 and expects a result above the 2012 result (USD 359m).

Maersk Line expects a result above 2012 (USD 461m) based primarily on further unit cost reductions. Global demand for seaborne containers is expected to increase by 4-5% in 2013, lower on the Asia­Europe trades but supported by higher growth for imports to emerging economies.
Maersk Oil expects a result significantly below the result for 2012 (USD 2.4bn), which included a one-off tax income of USD 899m from the settlement of an Algerian tax dispute. The operational result is expected to be below the operational result for 2012 (USD 1.5bn) excluding one-off tax impacts, impairment losses and gains. Maersk Oil expects its share of production to be 240,000250,000 boepd, lower in the first half than the second half of 2013 at an average oil price of USD 105 per barrel. The lower production share is predominantly caused by a natural decline and reduced ownership share in Denmark, countered by start-up in El Merk and Gryphon. Exploration expenses are expected to be above USD 1.0bn.
APM Terminals expects a result above 2012 (USD 723m) and to grow ahead of the market, supported by volumes from new terminals, whilst improving productivity in existing facilities.

The total result from all other activities is expected to be above the 2012 result excluding divestment gains and impairment losses.
The outlook for 2013 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global econom y. The Groups expected result depends on a number of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other things being equal, the sensitivities for four key value drivers are listed in the table below.

Message from the Group CEO
The Group delivered a satisfactory result in 2012, continuing to execute on its strategy including a significant investment programme with focus on building and expanding four world class businesses over the next five years. The result and return on invested capital were above 2011 but below the target of 10% over the cycle, mainly due to continued poor shipping markets affecting container and tanker earnings.

The non-shipping activities continue to deliver good results. Our business units are competitive and achieve high marks from customers and partners for performance and reliability. Maersk Line managed to reduce costs and improve rates after a difficult start to the year in particular due to low container freight rates.
Promoting growth As global growth remains subdued with 2.5% in 2012 and a similar level expected for 2013, the weakness in the main shipping corridors is expected to continue in the short term. By focusing our transport and infrastructure investments on growing markets, the Group can help unleash economic potential in countries where supply chain bottlenecks are barriers to growth.

strong pillars in the Group each with profits above USD 1.0bn and world class operational performance.
The Group was successful in exiting activities no longer deemed core businesses such as Maersk LNG and the large FPSO Maersk Peregrino, freeing up capital totalling up to USD 3.4bn for investments in continuing businesses.
The Group also made progress on safety measures continuing last years positive development. Still, the number of casualties remains too high. In 2012, 17 colleagues lost their lives at work. We consider one fatality to be one too many, and we are committed to eliminating fatalities through systematic safety improvements.

The container vessels received for Maersk Lines African and South American networks, the acquisition of Global Ports in Russia, and construction of a major container terminal in Mexico are examples of such investments and partnerships with governments. The Group will continue to leverage its global presence to pursue more opportunities in growth markets in order to achieve a healthy geographical mix long term.
Further, the Group is constantly developing its portfolio of businesses to ensure that positions are strengthened in the most promising segments of the industries in which its businesses operate.
Stating our ambitions The Group held its first capital markets day in October 2012. In a volatile world, strategies and objectives will periodically be revised, but by stating our ambitions we aim to lift our performance and motivate the entire organisation to work together to build an even stronger company to the benefit of our shareholders and partners across our businesses and across the world. Maersk Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling have all made progress towards achieving their objectives of becoming

Delivering on priorities With the expectation of continued slow growth in 2013, focus on operation and performance in our business units become key for the Group to deliver a good result and live up to the expectation of our partners and customers.
Part of this will be to secure progress on a number of very significant projects across the Groups strategic core businesses:
For Maersk Oil, the most important target is to deliver progress as planned on key projects such as El Merk in Algeria, Chissonga in Angola, and Johan Sverdrup in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.
In Maersk Drilling, three new drilling rigs are coming into the fleet at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. The aim is to get them delivered and put into operation without delays or extra cost.
Maersk Line will keep managing its capacity effectively during the introduction of the first new Triple-E ships which will come into the fleet this year.

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012

Message from the Group CEO

APM Terminals top priority is to effectively execute on the Santos terminal project in Brazil (opening early 2013) and the Maasvlakte II project in The Netherlands.
Another priority is to optimise our balance sheets for further growth. It emerges from the Groups significant growth plans which in 2013 entail investments of around USD 9bn. On top of the commitments already made, the Group expects attractive opportunities to occur in the coming years. All business units will therefore engage in an effort to clean their balance sheets of underperforming assets and terminate marginal non-core activities to release capital for the most profitable investments. Other capital effectiveness initiatives will be introduced to enable the Groups ability to pursue attractive growth oppor-

tunities. The Group has maintained its financial flexibility and is well-prepared to execute on its investment plans. It has a strong liquidity buffer and no need for near-term refinancing. On balance, 2012 was a good year for the A.P. Moller Maersk Group and I want to thank our employees and leaders for their strong performance and dedication.

Building on the strength of the Group

Building on the strength of the Group
The Groups aspiration is to continue building a first class conglomerate. This will be achieved through a disciplined allocation of capital across Group businesses, active portfolio management, a clear funding strategy, operational excellence, technological innovation and development of human resources.

Strategic direction

The Group will continue to focus investments in the four core growth businesses Maersk Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling. Investments in the opportunistic core businesses Maersk Supply Service, Maersk Tankers, Damco and SVITZER will be continued on the basis of continuous evaluation of opportunities. The strategic investments Dansk Supermarked Group and Danske Bank will grow mainly through own cash flow generation and own resources. Assets managed for value will continue to be developed to optimise value.
The Groups target is to achieve a return on invested capital (ROIC) above 10% with at least USD 1.0bn profit contribution from each of the four core growth businesses and to deliver gradually increasing value and thereby continue the historical trend of increasing dividends per share supported by earnings growth.
The overall emphasis on active portfolio management will continue. The portfolio of businesses and assets is evaluated in the annual review process. The existing strong position in growth markets will remain a focus area going forward as the Group is in a good position to assist developing countries and capitalise on their growth.

Capital allocation Today 70% of the Groups invested capital is within the four core growth businesses. By allocating more than 90% of the Groups capital expenditures to the four core growth businesses, their share of invested capital will reach at least 75% of the Groups invested capital by 2017. The total amount of the invested capital in the Group is expected to grow 30-40% during the same period as result of a high investment level.
The Group will also continue to build winning businesses and strengthen the respective competitive positions of its smaller core businesses. An opportunistic approach will be taken if their respective markets present opportunities worth pursuing.
The allocation of capital and the Groups annual strategy review is a fully integrated process. Strategies including detailed plans and opportunities for the coming years are developed with each business unit. The total capital requirements across businesses are prioritised with a view to optimising the portfolio of the Group in line with financial policies. Evaluation parameters include industry attractiveness, financial return forecasts, business

performance and overall strategic aspirations. The resulting plan provides the framework for each business unit. Planned portfolio adjustments are integrated into the plan.
In line with the direction of investments towards more profitable and less volatile business areas, Maersk Lines share of the Groups invested capital is likely to see a relative decline from 38% today towards a 25-30% range, while Maersk Oils, APM Terminals and Maersk Drillings combined share of the invested capital will see a relative increase from 32% towards a 45-50% range over the coming 4-5 years.

Company, Inc.

Portfolio management The overall emphasis on active portfolio management will continue. In order to secure the most optimal business portfolio, the Group is assessing the composition of its assets. In connection with this optimisation the Group is participating in both strategic and opportunistic acquisitions and divestments of companies as well as of individual assets.
Over the last five years, the Group has divested companies and assets of more than USD 10.4bn with pre-tax gains of USD 4.4bn.
The Group has during 2012 announced and completed a series of investments and divestments across the different segments. The main acquisitions/investments for the Group in 2012 were: ·37.5% stake in Global Ports Investments PLC, Russia ·A pro rata contribution of USD 250m in Danske Banks
DKK 7.15bn (USD 1.2bn) capital increase in October 2012

In addition, Maersk Tankers has entered into an agreement to divest its Handygas segment (11 vessels). The transaction is expected to be completed in 2013.
The portfolio optimisation will continue over the next years to enhance the strategic focus of the Group, but also to take advantage of opportunities which may arise in the various industries in which the Group operates.
Funding strategy To support growth, secure liquidity and balance the risk to returns, the Group has developed a funding strategy to cater for this. The main elements are to: ·Secure long-term commitment to support business
strategy ·Continue to obtain funding from diversified sources
ensuring access to funding in volatile times ·Support an adequate liquidity reserve to have finan-
cial flexibility at all times ·Maintain a conservative capital structure and fund-

flow, some volatility in the financial profile is expected. Based on the size of the committed loan facilities, including investment specific financing, the maturity of the loan facilities and the capital commitments, the Groups funding position is deemed satisfactory.
Operational excellence Operational excellence translates the strategy into tangible actions.
The Groups operational performance is monitored through quarterly benchmarking of key financial and operational metrics, relative to key competitors. These benchmarks are used to set specific targets, build an incentive structure, and confirm individual KPIs throughout the Group.
The Groups ambition is that all core businesses become top quartile performers within their industries and actions are defined to progress in this direction.

Maersk Oil Maersk Oils aspiration is to grow the business by almost 50% to reach a share of production of 400,000 boepd by 2020, which implies significant capital expenditure in the coming years. Maersk Oils return on invested capital will decline from the 30% ROIC-level delivered in 20102012; however, it is expected to stay double-digit during the business expansion phase. In the coming years, there will be a continued emphasis on building a strong, transparent organisation.
APM Terminals Over the next five years, APM Terminals will continue to focus on their strong operational performance and to gener ate at least 50% of revenue from 3rd party cust omers. Further to this, APM Terminals will continue to pursue investments in attractive terminals in growth markets, whilst improving operations in existing facilities. APM Terminals financial ambition is to deliver USD 1.0bn to the Groups profit by 2016.

There are many levels and elements in performance management of which the majority are within each business unit.
Maersk Line Maersk Lines ambition is to lift the financial performance from an above average industry performer today to a clear top quartile performer and to deliver returns above the cost of capital during the next five years. This is to be achieved through a combination of further building scalable cost leadership, while continuing to maintain the leading brand position as the most reliable carrier in the industry. Maersk Line is to grow in line with the market, funded by own cash flow.

Maersk Drilling Maersk Drillings financial ambition is to deliver USD 1.0bn to the Groups profit by 2018. This is to be achieved by world class and safe operations while building a rig fleet of a size sufficient to be a preferred drilling partner of key customers. Maersk Drilling plans to extend the fleet to 30 high-end rigs for operation mainly in harsh environments and deep water within the next five years.
To build value across the Group, the main priorities for the opportunistic core and the strategic investments are: ·Maersk Supply Service ­ Build on leadership position ·Maersk Tankers ­ Protect value during cycle lows ·Damco ­ Profitable growth

Technological innovation The Group invests to ensure cutting-edge technology solutions across its businesses. Innovation is focused on: ·Delivering better services ·Protecting employees ·Minimising environmental impact ·Creating new business opportunities ·Ensuring cost-effectiveness.
Technological innovation is carried out by technology divisions within the Groups business units, in close co operation with manufacturers, shipyards, suppliers, universities and research institutes. Below are examples from four of the Groups core business units.

extra oil production from enhanced oil recovery and gas from fields judged non-commercial using existing technologies.
Terminals Taking the next leap in automation: Lift-Automated Guided Vehicles The new terminal at Rotterdam, Maasvlakte II will have: ·The biggest and most advanced quay cranes in the
world. They will be the first to be operated remotely from a central control room, allowing for more efficient operation and increased crane speeds ·The first Lift-Automated Guided Vehicles (L-AGV) that improve port efficiency. They will also use battery technology to drive them, reducing vehicle emissions to zero ·An automated bespoke software package will control all the automated equipment at the terminal. This will optimise equipment use.

Shipping Improving vessel efficiency: the ECO Retrofit Technology Programme An array of retrofit initiatives, tailored for individual vessel types. Examples include: ·Fitting bulbous bows optimised for reduced fuel
consumption ·Adding economisers to auxiliary engines ·Reusing waste heat from auxiliary engines.
Projected net savings in 2013 are expected to be USD 20m.
Oil Rocket science (TriGen) gives new life to mature oil fields With a rocket engine, low quality gas can be turned into clean energy, pure water and CO2. This CO2 can in turn be used to recover more oil from mature fields. The engine: ·Burns low quality gas, which might otherwise be
wasted ·Transforms generated heat into electric power ·Has pure water as a by-product; a valuable resource
in dry areas ·Creates CO2 which can be pumped into mature oil
fields to improve oil recovery. All CO2 used in this way is sequestered in oil reservoirs.
As the demand for energy and oil increases, the potential for TriGen Technology is huge - both for generating

Terminal automation will increase productivity by 2530% compared to conventional terminal designs as well as reduce the space needed to handle the same volume.
Drilling Training innovation: Highly advanced simulator complex exceeds all known standards In 2012, Maersk Drilling, together with Maersk Training Centre, built the most advanced drilling simulator complex in the drilling industry, which will enable: ·More team training. Improving interactions between
crew members on rigs helps prevent accidents ·More realistic scenarios. It is possible to simulate the
extreme well control situations that crews may actually need to deal with.
These new facilities at Maersk Training Centre in Svendborg, Denmark, will be used to train many of the 3,000 new employees Maersk Drilling is planning to employ over the coming years.
Human Resources Human Resources work closely with the businesses to ensure that the Group has an engaged, motivated workforce and a clear link between performance and rewards. The key HR challenges for the Group are to secure a sufficient number of highly qualified and well-trained employees to manage the planned growth.

Building on the strength of the Group

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 27

Performance management and engagement Employee engagement is an important priority for the Group as engaged employees deliver high performance and secure a good and positive work environment. The annual Employee Engagement Survey had a 91% response rate in 2012, the highest to date, indicating the level of importance, employees place in the survey.
Leadership development The Group is investing in developing the future leaders of its businesses.
The management centre, Rolighed, north of Copenhagen, Denmark, opened late 2011. Rolighed has become a place where leaders and global talents from different locations

and business units meet to develop and share their experiences and skills, and to interact with senior leaders. Rolighed hosts management team meetings, leadership development programmes, and expert speakers come to share their latest thinking. Such interactions are a platform for continuously developing leaders and businesses.
Diversity and inclusion The Group continued its focus on diversity and inclusion during 2012, supporting leaders in managing diverse teams and implementing initiatives to accelerate career progression of women as well as talents in growth markets.
Globally, the Groups representation of women in senior management was 5% (4%) at vice president level,

28 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012

Building on the strength of the Group

10% (9%) in senior management and 20% (21%) in middle management (excluding Dansk Supermarked Group and most joint venture companies).
The Groups on-going ambition to expand in growth markets is also reflected in the efforts to strengthen recruitment and other HR activities to ensure a solid foundation for a long term presence in these locations.
In 2012, the Group achieved nominations for the Diversity in the Workplace Award by the Danish Institute for Human Rights and for European Diversity Awards in the category Company of the Year. The aspiration is to be a world-recognised inclusive employer, embracing and leveraging multiple forms of diversity, constantly committed to further improving in this area.
Data-driven decision-making A new global Human Resources system was implemented during 2012, replacing around 90 different Human Resources IT solutions across the Group. The Human Resources system supports the human resources administration and offers comprehensive self-service functionalities for employees and managers.
Key priorities in the business units The Groups Human Resources department works in close cooperation with the Human Resources departments in the business units. The four core growth businesses each have their key priorities and focus areas to support their respective strategies.
Maersk Line Simplicity, focus and teamwork In supporting the strategy of cost leadership, the Human Resources focus will be on driving the strategy and related "Must Win Battles" through the organisation including the three cultural amplifiers identified as critical for success; simplicity, focus and teamwork.
The second priority area is to drive improvements in the performance management approach and culture to ensure that Maersk Line can deliver superior performance to the Group.
The HR team will support the focus areas by providing global data and develop plans for talent management, succession planning and diversity.

Maersk Oil Attracting and retaining talent The demand for experienced and talented oil and gas professionals is increasing significantly. The industry is facing challenges given portfolios with complex and numerous projects to be executed.
Maersk Oil has to continue attracting and retaining talent to sustain a strong and well-balanced people pipeline.
Maersk Oil wants to ensure that junior staff recruited for one of the most attractive graduate programmes in the industry can benefit from the coaching and mentoring of the more experienced professionals. Accelerated development is a focus area of the younger generations and of the company, and Maersk Oil ensures that opportunities to learn are available.
Similarly, Maersk Oil focuses on attracting experienced professionals to complement the work force.
Lately, in an effort to monitor the pace of growth and demand for professionals, the Maersk Oil leadership team has refocused manpower efforts to ensure that the humanresources are allocated to the projects with the highest value creation. The prioritisation is done by the global technical functions in close partnership with the country organisations.
APM Terminals Safe operations Safety is APM Terminals license to operate. In order to further emphasise and refocus the safety culture, an experienced senior executive with comprehensive insight in all aspects of the business has been appointed as an internal Safety Activist. This change has substantially increased the focus on safety from all employees during 2012.
APM Terminals is an industry leader with a strong and continuing record of growth, meaning that APM Terminals can attract good people but also that competitors wish to hire employees from APM Terminals.
The engagement survey results, which indirectly measure the quality of APM Terminals leadership, the productivity of the workforce and the likelihood of retaining staff, continue to improve and in 2012 entered the upper quartile of a global range of benchmark companies.

Building on the strength of the Group

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 29

To further support the emphasis on the importance of leadership, all levels of management and supervision are now covered by a leadership development suite of training programmes.
Recognising the importance of reward as a motivator for long term performance, an APM Terminals incentive plan for managing directors was introduced in 2012 intended to aid retention.
Maersk Drilling Recruiting and integrating 3,000 new employees The growth strategy entails hiring and integration of 3,000 new employees by 2018. The first 1,300 will be hired between 2013 and 2015. Recruitment represents a significant challenge due to shortage of skilled people for the general growth in the drilling industry.

Sustainability The Group is active in industries that are core to global economic growth and development: trade, energy and infrastructure. Combined with the Groups growth and prospects in emerging economies, sustainability challenges and opportunities are present throughout the Groups activities.
The Groups sustainability strategy focuses on integrating sustainable practices into the activities in each of the operating businesses. Supporting this strategy are targets for each of the sustainability issues that have been determined most material to the Group. A Sustainability Council oversees compliance with Group standards and the integration of sustainability across the businesses. The Council reports to the Executive Board which has overall responsibility for sustainability matters.

To ensure a sustainable increase in the workforce, Maersk Drilling has launched several initiatives such as increased intake on talent programmes to develop more competencies, improved induction process to decrease time to competency and integrate new employees quickly, and a driller trainee programme to develop allround competencies.
Individual and team training is conducted through a structured training programme which includes the use of the most advanced offshore drilling simulator in the world. To ensure a safe and efficient operation of the new rigs in compliance with the processes, systems and values, the teams on the new units will be a combination of experienced employees and new hires enabling an effective integration of the new employees.

Safety The safety of employees is a key priority, and the Group continuously monitors performance and pushes for improvements. The number of fatal accidents that occurred during operations grew in 2012. This is unacceptable and the Group fundamentally believes that all fatal accidents can be prevented. The rise in fatal accidents in 2012 confirms the decision to increase the focus on process safety and risk management.
CO2 emissions The Group has achieved an 8% improvement in CO2 efficiency since 2010, mainly driven by large improvements in the container business. Both the relative and absolute CO2 emissions decreased in 2012. The improved efficiency in shipping affects the Groups CO2 performance substan-

tially, as more than 80% of the emissions are derived from Maersk Line. CO2 reductions were also achieved in the oil business where Maersk Oil has reduced CO2 emissions from flaring from operated producing facilities by 86% since 2007. In 2012, the Group raised its relative CO2 reduction target from 10% to 20% from 2010 to 2020.
Corruption Corruption negatively impacts communities where the Group does business as well as the global economic development. Due to the global nature of the Groups activities, the Group has an opportunity to support global improvements in this area. An internal anti-corruption training programme has been implemented across the Group. Since 2010, more than 25,000 employees have been trained in anti-corruption. The Group is also involved in industry efforts to eliminate facilitation payments in the shipping, freight forwarding, and the oil industry.
Human rights management As with the overall sustainability strategy, the Groups long-term approach is to integrate human rights management into existing systems. The Group mapped in 2012 the human rights risks and gaps, carrying out 11 workshops. Overall, a majority of the Groups human rights issues are addressed through programmes on responsible procurement, global labour principles, anticorruption and safety.

Responsible procurement The ability to manage risks in the supply chain has since the launch of the Responsible Procurement programme in 2011 taken a step forward. The Group has approached 1,985 external vendors (equivalent to 32% of the Groups total external spend) and assessed 178 (7%). Of the assessed external vendors, the Group has audited 23, and the prevailing issues identified during the audits were working hours, overtime compensation, and subcontractor transparency. Ten vendors have signed formalised improvement plans to rectify the identified issues, while the responsible procurement team is in dialogue with the others to implement more improvement plans where needed in the future.
Increasing transparency and building trust The Groups separate Sustainability Report for 2012 provides detailed information on the Groups sustainability performance. It is also the Groups Communication on Progress as required by the UN Global Compact. The Sustainability Report complies with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act on corporate social responsibility reporting. The report is available on: www.maersk.com/Sustainability/Documents/Maersk_ Sustainability_Report_2012.pdf

Building four world class businesses

Maersk Line
Maersk Line improved its profit in 2012 by USD 1.0bn, delivering a profit of USD 461m, although the year started out with global freight rates at unsustainable levels and all time high bunker prices. From the second half of 2011 to the second half of 2012, the result improved USD 1.7bn. The improved profit was driven by a detailed profitability improvement programme with key focus on cost reductions, surcharges collection and rate increases, enabled through active capacity adjustments.

·Profit of USD 461m (loss of USD 553m) ·ROIC was 2.4% (negative 3.1%) ·Cash flow from operating activities was USD 1.8bn
(USD 899m) ·Cash flow from capital expenditure (investments) was
USD 3.6bn (USD 3.2bn) ·Average rate increased by 1.9% to 2,881 USD/FFE
(2,828 USD/FFE) ·Active capacity adjustments through idling, slow
steaming and blanked sailings ·Unit cost decreased by 1.7% to 3,054 USD/FFE (3,108
USD/FFE) ·Significant headquarters staff reduction implemented
in June 2012 ·Volumes grew 5% to 8.5m FFE (8.1m FFE).
Market development The global market for container demand grew an estimated 2% in 2012 compared to 2011. Demand growth deteriorated during the year from 5% in Q1 to only 0-1% in Q3 and Q4 compared to the corresponding quarters in 2011. Above all, European imports were weak with westbound Asia-Europe container demand dropping 7-9% in Q3 and Q4 year-over-year. This development reflected the weak European economy and in particular the debt crisis in the Mediterranean countries. Imports to the USA also softened and only saw a minor peak in demand during Q3. For the full year 2012, the total Asia-Europe trade declined nearly 2%, while volumes on the transpacific trade grew 2%.
Despite the low demand growth and a significant amount of deliveries of new container vessels, a stable supply/ demand balance was achieved. The nominal increase in capacity from deliveries of new vessels was 8.1% in 2012, but through slow steaming, scrappings, idling and blanked sailings, the industry managed to balance the effective capacity growth with the overall head haul demand growth.

On the back of the price war in the second half of 2011, global container freight rates started at very low levels in 2012. Especially, the Asia-Europe trade was hard hit with spot market rates at around USD 700-750 per TEU in January 2012. These rate levels were significantly below operating costs, and with bunker prices peaking at an all-time high above USD 700 per ton in March 2012, the industry experienced significant losses in Q1 2012. The industry was successful in getting general rate increases (GRI) through across most trade lanes. Especially, the USD 750 per TEU rate increase on the Asia-Europe trade effective from 1 March 2012 paved the way for GRIs in other key trades such as Africa and Latin America. Despite the significant focus on general rate increases, the market experienced a constant downward pressure on rates in the second half of 2012 due to the deteriorating demand growth in Q3 and Q4.
Initiatives in 2012 With freight rates at very low levels in Q1, Maersk Line started the year with losses amounting to around USD 8m per day and a Q1 2012 loss of USD 599m.
A profitability improvement programme was established to bring Maersk Line back to profitability and an overall review of the headquarters activities led to a significant reduction in headquarters staff implemented in June 2012. The profitability programme focused on executing on general rate increases, driving collection of demurrage and detention, right-sizing the vessel network to support the general rate increases and finally reducing overall costs.
Financial performance Profit was USD 461m compared to a loss of USD 553m in 2011. The improvement was driven by increase in freight rates and operational cost savings mainly from vessel network efficiencies. The result improved the return on invested capital (ROIC), from negative 3.1% in 2011 to

Building four world class businesses

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 37

positive 2.4% in 2012, however still below weighted average cost of capital.
Cash flow from operating activities of USD 1.8bn was signficantly higher than 2011 impacted by improved profitalility partly offset by an increase in working capital.

Asia were strong growth trades for volumes with respectively 19%, 10% and 7% growth. For the Africa trade, the focus on yield management reduced loss making cargo, but consequently also reduced overall volumes. Asia­Europe, Africa and Intra-Asia were the trades with strongest growth in rate levels.

Revenue increased by 8% to USD 27.1bn, positively affected by volumes increasing 5% to 8.5m FFE and average freight rates increasing 1.9% to 2,881 USD/FFE. Maersk Line maintained its market share for the full year. The average freight rate excluding BAF increased by 4.6% to 2,274 USD/FFE compared to 2011, supported by active capacity adjustments throughout the year in the form of idling, slow steaming and blanked sailings.
On the main Asia-Europe trades, the head haul volumes decreased by 2%, while backhaul volumes increased by 16% to overall growth of 3%, compared to 2011. Average freight rates for Asia-Europe trades increased by 6%, with head haul and backhaul increasing 10% and 2%, respectively. Intra-Asia, Latin America and West & Central

Total cost per FFE decreased by 1.7% to 3,054 USD/FFE mainly driven by decreasing bunker consumption per FFE and operational cost savings. Maersk Line continued to utilise super slow steaming to reduce emissions and save bunker cost. The bunker price was 7% higher in 2012 but total bunker costs decreased by 1% to USD 6.7bn compared to 2011.
Reliability of the Daily Maersk service has on average been above 98% since the introduction in 2011. In terms of overall reliability, Maersk Line is still the most reliable carrier with a scheduled reliability for 2012 of 91%. Daily Maersk has been very well received by customers and overall customer satisfaction is high.
Maersk Lines fleet increased by 4% to 2.6m TEU total capacity. The fleet consisted of 270 owned vessels and 326 chartered vessels by the end of 2012.The owned fleet was increased by 6% as 17 newbuild vessels with 100,000 TEU capacity were delivered. The vessels are designed for Africa and Latin America trades ­ two key growth markets for the Group. Apart from the focus on reducing slot cost and emission of greenhouse gasses, the vessels are attractive due to their substantial reefer capacity. Other adjustments to the owned fleet were delivery of two multi purpose vessels totalling 36,000 DWT, while one vessel of 750 TEU was sold.

11 vessels had increased capacity of 1,400 TEU per vessel primarily through bridge elevation. The chartered fleet declined by 1% to 1.1m TEU capacity. The chartered fleet was reduced by 65 vessels compared to 2011 as part of optimising the network countered by need for more tonnage to implement further slow steaming. In addition to this, the Group owned five and chartered six multi purpose vessels. 25 vessels totalling 395,100 TEU are on order for delivery during 2013-2015. The first five out of 20 Triple-E container vessels suited for the Asia-Europe trade will be delivered in 2013.
Strategic focus Global container demand growth is forecasted to remain modest at 4-5% range in 2013. Especially, the Asia-Europe trade outlook is bleak with westbound demand expected to stay flat. The challenging demand side is coupled with a significant amount of new tonnage being delivered corresponding to a capacity increase of 11% or 1.8m TEU. Thus, without significant capacity adjustments, the con-

tainer shipping market is most likely expected to see a continued downward pressure on freight rates in 2013.
Maersk Line has defined five key focus areas for 2013. The reefer rate restructuring initiative will focus on restoring profitability in the refrigerated cargo business through a global rate restructuring. The rates and contracting initiative will focus on keeping rates at a sustainable level. The network cost initiative will focus on building a more cost-effective vessel network, while the total unit cost initiative will aim for the lowest achievable cost in the market. Finally, the volume and market share initiative will focus on maintaining the global position of Maersk Line.
Safety performance The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 0.76 per million exposure hours compared to 0.63 per million exposure hours in 2011.

Maersk Oil
Maersk Oil continues to progress the portfolio of development projects, including Dunga Phase II production start in Kazakhstan, and further maturation of Chissonga in Angola and Johan Sverdrup in Norway, both with planned production start in 2017-18. Also, the agreement to further development of the Al Shaheen field in Qatar constitutes a milestone.

·Profit of USD 2.4bn (USD 2.1bn), positively impacted by one-off tax income of USD 899m in Algeria and a USD 91m gain from a partial divestment of interests in Brazil
·ROIC was 36.6% (37.2%) ·Cash flow from operating activities was USD 3.9bn
(USD 4.3bn) ·Entitlement share of production declined by 23% to
257,000 boepd (333,000 boepd) ·Average oil price was 1% higher at USD 112 per barrel
(USD 111 per barrel) ·Exploration expenses were USD 1.1bn (USD 1.1bn).

Production The average daily share of oil and gas production in 2012 was 257,000 boepd in line with previously announced expectations of 258,000 boepd; 23% lower than in 2011 (333,000 boepd).
In Qatar, the production share was 103,000 boepd (157,000 boepd); 34% lower than in 2011 due to a contractual production sharing and cost recovery mechanism, while the gross production from the field continued unchanged at a level of 300,000 boepd.

Initiatives in 2012 Maersk Oil has exploration and production activities in 11 countries and has an entitlement production of some 257,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from six countries. Maersk Oil is maturing oil and gas resources through a large exploration programme and execution of a number of development projects.
At the A.P. Moller - Maersk Capital Markets Day on 9 October 2012, Maersk Oil disclosed information about its reserves and resources base and gave insights into the plans to increase production by almost 50% towards 2020 by reaching a daily entitlement production level of 400,000 barrels. More information from the Capital Markets Day can be found at: http://investor.maersk.com/events.cfm?altevent =otherevents
At the end of 2011, Maersk Oil had entitlement reserves and resources of 1.38bn barrels of oil equivalent including proved reserves (1P) of 443m barrels of oil equivalent. The reserves and resources are estimated according to international standards (Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System) and the reserves are audited by an independent third party. The reserves and resource figures will be updated annually and the figures for end of 2012 will be released together with the Q1 report in 2013.

Production share in Denmark was 91,000 boepd (113,000 boepd); 19% lower than in 2011 largely due to the entry of Nordsøfonden (the Danish state-owned North Sea Fund) as partner with 20% interest in DUC (Dansk Undergrunds Consortium) on 8 July 2012. The effect of the change on the Groups net profit is neutral as the Danish state participation replaces a 20% profit share collected since the agreement was made in 2003. Further the natural decline of the largely mature Danish fields affected the production negatively.
The share of production in the UK of 28,000 boepd was at the same level as in 2011 (27,000 boepd). The Gryphon

FPSO, which was damaged in a storm in early 2011, is expected to come back into production in Q1 2013.
In Algeria, the share of production of 27,000 boepd was slightly higher compared to 2011 (25,000 boepd), positively affected by improved contract terms with the Algerian national oil company from the settlement of the tax dispute in Q1 2012 but offset by the natural maturation of the fields.

Development Maersk Oil has a diverse project portfolio and project delivery plan in place to deliver on the production target of 400,000 boepd by 2020. Five major projects are sanctioned by the authorities and execution is progressing towards first production by 2014.
In Algeria, development of the El Merk field continues with first oil expected in Q1 2013.

The share of production in Kazakhstan and Brazil was in 2011 3,000 boepd (3,000 boepd) and 5,000 boepd (8,000 boepd) respectively.

In Angola, work continues on the development plan for the Chissonga discovery in Block 16 and drilling of the 4th appraisal well was completed late 2012. The development will likely comprise a stand-alone FPSO with first oil expected in 2017-18.

In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, a second appraisal well was successfully completed on the Swara Tika structure, and further pre-development activities are planned for 2013. Maersk Oil increased its shareholding in HKN Energy from 20% to 30% (corresponding to 22.5% equity in the Sarsang production sharing contract).
In Kazakhstan, the first Dunga Phase II well was brought on-stream in December 2012 as scheduled and over the next three years another 197 wells will be drilled and brought into production.

42 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012

In Norway, three appraisal wells were completed on the Avaldsnes part of the major Johan Sverdrup discovery. A preliminary agreement between the involved licences is in place and continued appraisal activities should lead to a concept selection by the end of 2013 and first production in 2018. The Zidane-2 well encountered a high pressure gas reservoir and evaluation of the commerciality of the combined Zidane 1 and 2 discoveries is ongoing. To support a development of Zidane and other future discoveries in Mid Norway, an interest in a planned gas pipeline has been secured.
In Qatar, a new field development plan for 2012 including further investments of USD 1.5bn, covering among others 51 new wells, has been agreed with Qatar Petroleum with the aim of increasing recovery and extending a stable production plateau at 300,000 boepd from the Al Shaheen field.

cial potential of the structure, which is adjacent to the Chissonga discovery. Exploration and appraisal drilling in Block 16 will continue in early 2013. Further exploration and appraisal drilling has also been planned for Blocks 8 and 23, but timing is dependent on rig availability, which increasingly has become a challenge due to the overheated drilling market in the West Africa region.
In Brazil, Maersk Oil participated in drilling of four exploration/appraisal wells and several wells are planned for 2013. In Blocks BM-C-37 and BM-C-38, Maersk Oil realised value by providing the business partner with 20% additional interest and operatorship in exchange for cash and full carry in up to six wells.
In Greenland, acquisition of 3D seismic data was successfully completed in the Baffin Bay, and Maersk Oil participated in a shallow core sampling programme.

In the UK, the Golden Eagle development project is progressing towards a production start in 2014. Maersk Oil acquired the remaining 30% interest in the Maersk Oil operated Dumbarton and Lochranza fields as well as the Global Producer III FPSO. With the acquisition Maersk Oil now has 100% interest in both fields as well as in the FPSO.
In the USA, the Jack deepwater development project in the US Gulf of Mexico is progressing as planned towards production start in 2014. Further appraisal drilling of the Buckskin discovery is planned for 2013.
Exploration Successful exploration is crucial to Maersk Oils aspiration to increase the daily entitlement production by 50% to 400,000 boepd by 2020. The current production profile reflects that Maersk Oil is in a catch-up phase with respect to replacing reserves. Exploration activities have been scaled up and a number of high impact discoveries have been made over the last couple of years. New prospects are continually being matured through the global portfolio and by focusing on prolific basins with familiar geology and risks. Maersk Oil has been able to add resources at competitive finding costs.
Maersk Oil completed 23 exploration/appraisal wells compared to 14 in 2011.

In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the high exploration level continues in the Sarsang block and by year-end drilling of two exploration prospects was in progress.
In Kazakhstan, three exploration wells were completed with encouraging results and allowed progression of the Dunga Phase III, which could bring the gross production to a level above 30,000 barrels per day.
In Norway, Maersk Oil submitted applications in two exploration licence rounds with expected awards mid2013. The T-Rex exploration well did not discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities and was therefore abandoned. Drilling of the Albert exploration well commenced in December.
In the UK, seven exploration/appraisal wells were completed including appraisal wells on Culzean, Ockley and Jackdaw. Maersk Oil was awarded nine new licences in the UKs 27th licensing round and potential award in 2013 of three additional licences awaits the outcome of ongoing environmental assessments.
In the USA, Maersk Oil continues to build its prospect portfolio and was awarded seven new blocks in the US Central Gulf of Mexico bid round. Drilling of the Oceano grapher prospect is planned for 2013.

In Angola, the Caporolo discovery was made in Block 16 and further drilling is planned to decide on the commer-

Financial performance Maersk Oils profit for 2012 was USD 2.4bn (USD 2.1bn) and ROIC was 36.6% (37.2%). The result was positively affected by the one-off tax income of USD 899m from the settlement of an Algerian tax dispute, a USD 91m gain from a partial divestment of interests in Brazil and a strong average oil price of USD 112 per barrel (USD 111 per barrel). This was partly offset by the expected decline of the entitlement share of oil and gas production to 257,000 boepd (333,000 boepd) due to a lower production share in Qatar and lower production in Denmark.
The Gryphon FPSO has been out of production from early 2011. However, the loss of production and property damage in 2012 are partly recoverable under the existing insurance policies, and for 2012 a compensation of USD 407m has been received. It should be noted that negotiations are still in progress to determine the final insurance proceeds from the insurance companies.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 3.9bn (USD 4.3bn) and cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 2.0bn (USD 3.8bn affected by the USD 2.4bn acquisition of SK Energy in Brazil). Exploration activity remained high with completion of 23 (14) exploration/ appraisal wells, leading to exploration expenses of USD 1.1bn (USD 1.1bn).
Strategic focus With the current development plans and a sustained high level of exploration, Maersk Oil is entering a period with planned annual development capital expenditure in the range of USD 3-5bn compared to USD 1-3bn in recent years, in order to replenish the portfolio. Exploration expenses are expected to be above USD 1.0bn per year.
Safety performance The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 0.75 per million working hours compared to 0.91 per million exposure hours in 2011.

APM Terminals
APM Terminals delivered an increase in profit and a ROIC of 13.6% (13.1%). The expansion into high growth markets continued, notably with the acquisition of a 37.5% co-controlling stake in Global Ports Investments PLC, a portfolio of very attractive port assets in Russia and neighbouring countries. The increased presence in high growth areas presents an opportunity but increases also geopolitical exposure.

·Profit of USD 723m (USD 648m), impacted by pre-tax divestment gains of USD 123m (USD 28m)
·ROIC was 13.6% (13.1%). Excluding the impact of portfolio changes and one offs, underlying ROIC was 12.5% (12.4%)
·Cash flow from operating activities was USD 975m (USD 912m)
·Number of containers handled increased by 6% to 35.4m TEU (33.5m TEU), ahead of the market growth of 4%, boosted by additions to the portfolio
·New terminal projects were secured in Lazaro Car denas, Mexico, and Ningbo, China, and a new inland project secured in Mombasa, Kenya
·APM Terminals took control of the operations in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the terminal in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, opened.

terminals with crane specifications and operational capabilities to match future market requirements.
Initiatives in 2012 The larger vessels being deployed and an increased appreciation by the customers of the value of having the fastest possible turnaround time in port prompted APM Terminals to launch a Global Transformation Project to lift the operational performance. The project aims at improving productivity by 15%. The crane lift per hour improved by 8% across the terminal portfolio during 2012.
APM Terminals continued to work on developing attractive propositions to unlock value in long term partnerships. Volumes from 3rd party customers reached 48% of the total in 2012 (46%).

Market development The global container terminal market measured in TEU increased by 4% during 2012. The growth rate was stronger during the first half of 2012 than during the second half. The trade lane from Asia to Europe in particular softened during the second half, which affected port volumes in both Asia and in Europe.
APM Terminals experienced renewed interest from shipping lines wishing to secure access to modern container

In the first half of 2012, operations in some terminals in North Africa, Europe and the Middle East were negatively affected by local political unrest or labour issues. Operations were fairly smooth during the second half of 2012 with only a relatively minor issue affecting operations in Los Angeles in December.
In late October, Hurricane Sandy landed on the US east coast, closing the ports of New York and New Jersey including APM Terminals Port Elizabeth facility. Operations

were impacted for more than a week in the entire port, but APM Terminals was successful in being the first terminal in the area to recommence operations after the hurricane.
Portfolio APM Terminals announced during 2012 the following developments with portfolio implications: ·On 28 November, a 37.5% co-controlling stake in the
publicly listed company, Global Ports, was acquired. Global Ports is the leading operator of container terminals in Russia and the Baltics. The enterprise value of the share acquisition was around USD 900m. As a result, APM Terminals added three container terminals in Russia, two container terminals in Finland and a major oil and oil products terminal in Estonia to its global network. ·APM Terminals took control of the operations in the Skandia Container Terminal in Gothenburg, Sweden, effective 4 January 2012. The facility is Scandinavias largest container terminal and handles about 0.8m TEU per year. ·A 32 year concession contract was signed with the Port Authority of the port of Lazaro Cardenas (APILAC), Mexico, for the design, financing, construction, opera-

tion and maintenance of a new specialised container terminal at the port. APM Terminals will invest over USD 900m in the new deepwater 4.1m TEU capacity project. ·The Container Terminal Wilhelmshaven (CTW) opened on 21 September 2012. APM Terminals holds a 30% share in Germanys only deep-water terminal. CTW has a 2.7m TEU capacity. ·Brasil Terminal Portuario (BTP) in Santos, Brazil, received ship-to-shore cranes and other crucial equipment in its finalisation phase. This joint venture will result in a 2.2m TEU facility with a 15 meter draft to accommodate the larger vessels coming into the Latin American trade lanes. The start of operations has been slightly delayed and is now expected during first half of 2013. APM Terminals holds a 50% share of BTP. ·The Group signed a cooperation agreement to enlarge the Meishan box facility at Ningbo, China, intending to take a 25% stake in the development of three new berths at the terminal. ·APM Terminals acquired a 50% stake in an inland container depot in Mombasa, Kenya. APM Terminals will take charge of the operational management of the depot.

·APM Terminals disposed half of the 50% stake in the Xiamen terminal in China with an after tax gain of USD 20m.
·M aersk Equipment Service Company Inc., USA, was divested in March 2012 with an after tax gain of USD 46m.
·APM Terminals proposal to operate all Port of Virginia facilities in Hampton Roads, USA, under a long-term concession agreement with the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) was met with competing proposals submitted by the existing operator Virginia International Terminals (VIT) as well as infrastructure investment units of two financial services and investment firms. The VPA is currently considering all proposals.
Financial performance APM Terminals delivered a profit of USD 723m (USD 648m) and a ROIC of 13.6% (13.1%). Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, underlying ROIC was 12.5% (12.4%).
APM Terminals is actively pursuing an investment strategy with focus on growth markets. 38 out of 62 container terminals operate in growth markets and 78% of EBITDA was generated in these markets.

The number of containers handled by APM Terminals (measured in crane lifts weighted with APM Terminals ownership interest) increased by 6% compared to 2011. This was ahead of the market growth of 4%, boosted by additions to the portfolio.
During the second half of 2012, APM Terminals volumes were adversely affected by the global economic slowdown and notably the decline in volume carried on the Asia-Europe trade lane. Positive developments in Africa and Latin America were to a large extent able to compensate for this.
Revenue grew by 2% compared to 2011. This was lower than the volume growth rate, mainly due to the divestment of Maersk Equipment Service Company in Q1, which impacted revenue without having a corresponding volume impact. The 44% tariff reduction imposed by the Tariff Authorities for Major Ports in India (TAMP) on Gateway Terminals India in Mumbai affected revenue negatively by USD 46m.
The EBITDA margin increased to 22.9% (22.6%).
Pre-tax gains of USD 123m were primarily achieved through the divestment of half of the 50% stake in Xiamen, China, and Maersk Equipment Service Company.
Strategic focus The expected market growth rate for 2013 is 4-5%. APM Terminals expects volume growth above market growth, supported by new additions to the portfolio and various performance improvement drives.
APM Terminals aims to become the leading port and inland operator in the world by 2016. APM Terminals will secure this position by serving the global shipping lines and cargo owners in long term partnerships through safe and excellent operations and by actively managing the portfolio and developing port infrastructure and inland services in high growth markets.

Maersk Drilling
With high forward contract coverage and an order book of seven large rigs with delivery in 2013-2015, Maersk Drilling is on track towards its strategic aspiration of delivering a profit of USD 1.0bn by 2018. The full year result for 2012 was negatively impacted by start-up issues on two drilling rigs.

·Profit of USD 359m (USD 488m) ·ROIC was 8.3% (12.5%) ·Cash flow from operating activities was USD 651m
(USD 825m) ·Forward contract coverage of 98% for 2013 and 76%
for 2014 ·Operational uptime averaged 92.1% (95.6%).
Market development The oil price has during 2012 remained supportive for continued increases in oil companies exploration and development spending.

The increasing demand is primarily seen from the main growth regions in West Africa and the US Gulf of Mexico while uncertainty has arisen concerning the demand in Brazil. Recent discoveries in other emerging deepwater regions such as East Africa will also contribute to growth in the future.
Initiatives in 2012 Throughout 2012, with the exception of one jack-up rig, all of Maersk Drillings 16 jack-up rigs and floaters, the ten drilling barges in Venezuela and the managed semisubmersible rig have been on contract.

The market for Norwegian jack-up rigs remained strong with full utilisation throughout the year. The market is expected to remain tight in the years ahead and there are currently no jack-up rigs available until Q2 2014 and thus oil and gas companies are already now showing interest in securing rig capacity well beyond 2014.

Maersk Drillings operational uptime averaged 92.1% in 2012 (95.6%). For the floating rigs the operational uptime averaged 85.1% (92.4%), while the operational uptime for the jack-up rigs averaged 95.3% (97.0%). The operational uptime was negatively affected by start-up issues for one jack-up rig and one floating rig.

The market for international premium jack-up rigs ( outside Norway) enjoys significantly higher utilisation and day rates compared to older jack-up rigs, due to the safety and efficiency gains offered to the operators.
The market for ultra deepwater floaters (7,500ft+) was characterised by full utilisation in 2012 and day rate levels returned to pre-crisis levels at around USD 600,000 with some variations across regions and countries reflecting differences in operating cost levels and taxes.
Despite the newbuilding order book, the ultra deepwater market is expected to remain tight and the number of rigs with 2013 availability is limited and operators are already securing ultra deepwater rig capacity for commencement in 2014.
Oil supply from deepwater fields is needed to balance demand for oil, and to deliver the required deepwater oil production. Considerable exploration and development drilling will need to take place over the years to come.

Six yard stays for planned surveys and upgrades were completed in 2012. The yard stays were completed on time and on budget.
Contracts signed in 2012 ·A newbuild ultra harsh, high specification jack-up rig

The contract duration is three years and commencement is expected by end 2013 upon delivery and mobilisation to the US Gulf of Mexico. The estimated contract value includes mobilisation, but excludes cost escalation and performance bonus. ·A second drillship in the series, USD 694m. The contract duration is three years plus a two-year option and commencement is expected in Q2 2014 upon mobilisation to the US Gulf of Mexico.
By the end of 2012, Maersk Drillings forward contract coverage was 98% for 2013, 76% for 2014, 51% for 2015 and 41% for 2016. The total revenue backlog for Maersk Drilling by the end of 2012 amounted to USD 7.0bn (USD 4.9bn).
Fleet and newbuilding programme Maersk Drilling currently owns and operates six ultra harsh jack-up rigs operating in Norway, three ultra

deepwater semi-submersible rigs operating in the US Gulf of Mexico, Angola and Egypt, and six international premium jack-up rigs operating in Southeast Asia, West Africa and the North Sea. Furthermore, Maersk Drilling owns and operates a mid-water semi-submersible rig in the Caspian Sea, and manages a mid-water semi-submersible rig on behalf of its Chinese owners.
Maersk Drilling owns and operates ten drilling barges in Venezuela, which in 2012 generated revenue of USD 194m (USD 178m).
Maersk Drilling participates in the 50/50% joint venture Egyptian Drilling Company, which owns and operates 64 land and four jack-up rigs. In 2012, the joint venture generated total revenue of USD 424m (USD 447m).
Maersk Drilling has currently seven rigs under construction or on order. The order book includes three ultra harsh jack-up rigs, of which the first two will be delivered in 2014, while the third rig will be delivered in 2015. Additionally, the order book contains four ultra deepwater drillships ­ one to be delivered late in 2013 and the rest in 2014. The newbuilding programme is progressing according to plan.
Of the seven newbuild rigs, contracts have already been secured for five totalling a contract backlog of 17 rig years and estimated revenue backlog of around USD 2.9bn.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 651m (USD 825m) after a slight increase in working capital of USD 25m (USD 52m).
After investment cash flow of USD 589m (USD 600m), the total free cash flow was USD 62m (USD 225m).
Strategic focus The focus areas for growth are Norway, leveraging the market leading position in the ultra harsh jack-up market, and the deepwater regions in the US Gulf of Mexico and West Africa where Maersk Drilling aims to build strong positions.
With full contract coverage for 2013, Maersk Drilling has a high degree of earnings visibility. The main risks relate to operational performance, cost inflation and delivery of newbuildings and yard stays for existing rigs on time and budget. Longer term Maersk Drilling will be exposed in the event of a lower oil price which will negatively impact oil companies exploration and development spending.

As a consequence of the significant growth and taking many new rigs into operation in 2013-2015, Maersk Drilling expects additional costs associated with training and start-up of operations, which will negatively impact the result in 2013, 2014 and 2015. After delivery from the yard, the rigs will carry operational costs without earning full revenue until contract commencement. Depending on the location of operation this may be for periods of 2-3 months per rig.
Safety performance The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 0.53 per million exposure hours compared to 0.21 per million exposure hours in 2011.
The increase in the LTIF is disappointing and whereas the safety performance is still relatively strong, a number of initiatives have been implemented in order to improve the safety performance.

Maersk Supply Service

· Profit of USD 132m (USD 243m) · ROIC was 6.1% (11.2%) ·Cash flow from operating activities was USD 305m
(USD 375m).
The profit was negatively affected by general oversupply in most segments of the market, except in the emergency response and rescue segment. Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased due to investment in Canadian newbuildings and modification of a number of existing vessels.

ESVAGT became part of Maersk Supply Services reporting segment effective 1 January 2012 and within the emergency response and rescue segment, ESVAGT achieved high utilisation in 2012 and all time high turnover and profit.
ESVAGT took delivery of three vessels during 2012. All went directly on long term contracts (duration five and ten years), two in Norway and one in Denmark. The newbuildings are ESVAGTs most advanced vessels todate and bring the fleet to 35 vessels

Maersk Supply Service had a reasonable contract coverage going into 2012 with continued focus on employing spot fleet in key strategic markets such as West and East Africa, Brazil, Australia and Canada where a number of new contracts and extensions were made.
For the anchor handling tug supply vessels, the newbuilding activity in the market slowed down with very few new orders being placed, whereas the significant order book for platform supply vessels continued to grow. A number of subsea support vessels were ordered on speculation during the year.

Two anchor handling tug supply vessels are on order with options for up to four additional vessels. The vessels are built for the Canadian market and optimised for the local operating profile with reduced emissions and fuel consumption. One vessel was sold, bringing the Maersk Supply Service fleet to 65 vessels.
Contract coverage for 2013 is 57% and for 2014 29% excluding options.
The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 0.74 per million exposure hours compared to 0.75 per million exposure hours in 2011.

Maersk Tankers

· Loss of USD 312m (loss of USD 153m) · ROIC was negative by 8.3% (negative 4.3%) ·Cash Flow from operating activities was USD 142m
(USD 95m) ·Impairment losses of USD 268m ·Divested the Small Northwest Europe segment and
the Handygas segment ·Time charter fleet reduced by 25 vessels.
Vessel oversupply and slower demand growth continue to drive the unfavourable market balances in most segments. During the year, the market conditions led Maersk Tankers to adjust the medium term outlook, resulting in USD 268m impairment loss on Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), product handy-tankers and the small product tanker segment. Significant uncertainty regarding valuation of vessels remains.
Significant VLCC tonnage will be added to the market in 2013 with demand growth expected to be unchanged. General overcapacity and weak demand growth affected the product tanker segments negatively in 2012. Expectations for 2013 remain unchanged with a relatively flat demand/supply development.

In the gas segment, earnings are expected to come under pressure from increasing vessel supply in 2013.
Maersk Tankers has started several initiatives to improve profitability. A project was launched, consisting of commercial improvement and cost reduction initiatives. Significant savings have been achieved in 2012 with bunker initiatives being the largest contributor with reductions of 7% corresponding to USD 48m.
Maersk Tankers divested the Small Northwest Europe segment as part of the strategy to optimise, to focus on fewer segments and to release capital for new investments. Such investments include the potential retrofitting of VLCCs, which would result in efficiency gains and a positive environmental impact due to reductions in fuel consumption. Maersk Tankers has also significantly reduced the time charter fleet.
Maersk Tankers entered into an agreement to divest the Handygas segment. The transaction will take place in 2013.
In addition to the above initiatives Maersk Tankers has decided to cold lay-up two VLCC vessels.

·Profit of USD 55m (USD 63m), positively impacted by pre-tax divestment gains of USD 19m
·ROIC was 13.5% (24.4%) ·Cash flow from operating activities was negative by
USD 97m (positive by USD 93m).
Damco recorded significant growth in 2012, partly due to impact from acquisitions. Further, products grew volume well ahead of the market and net revenue in 2012 was up to USD 3.3bn, an increase of 18.9%.
Damco shipped 6% more ocean volumes compared to 2011. Airfreight tonnage almost doubled, recording a growth over last year of 91%. The growth in airfreight was partly due to the full year effect of the NTS acquisition in August 2011 (a China based freight forwarder), but also due to strong growth in selected focus industries. Supply Chain Management volumes returned to growth and ended 5% higher than prior year level.

Cash flow from operating activities was negative by USD 97m (positive USD 93m) driven by increased working capital employed.
Damco announced early in 2012 a restructuring of its European operations, which were split in East and West. In October, Damco acquired the freight forwarder Pacific Network Global Logistics, which significantly strengthened its position in Oceania. In September, Damco announced that the global headquarter will relocate from Copenhagen, Denmark, to The Hague, The Netherlands. The move is scheduled to be completed in Q1 2013.
The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 0.51 per million exposure hours compared to 0.81 per million exposure hours in 2011.

The worsening market conditions as well as implementation costs related to new business caused downward pressure on Damcos unit margin profitability, which had a negative impact on Damcos performance in 2012.

Within harbour towage, activity was largely unchanged compared to the year before. Strong activity growth in Australia (7%) was offset by declining activity in Europe (-3%). Terminal towage developed as expected. SVITZER managed to charter recently delivered vessels to new terminal towage contracts and extended a number of existing contracts. Within salvage, activity was weak during large parts of the year with some increase during Q4.
Total revenue increased by 2.7% and EBITDA-margin increased to 29% (27%) driven by several initiatives to improve top line performance and strengthen cost control.

was in addition negatively impacted by provision for bad debts (USD 5m), a tax claim from the 2007 divestment of crew boat activities (USD 5m) and impairment of the Ocean Towage division (USD 7m).
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 257m (USD 131m) following the improved operational results and significant collections of salvage receivables.
In September 2012, SVITZER launched a new strategy, coupled with a new organisational structure, to improve returns in its harbour towage activities, increase its share of long term towage contracts and raise safety standards.
The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 1.46 per million exposure hours compared to 0.78 per million exposure hours in 2011.

The UK towage market has been bleak over a longer period of time, and with a continued poor outlook, an impairment of goodwill was recognised in Q4 of USD 102m, related to the Adsteam activities acquired in 2007. Profit

The market for grocery retail The Danish retail market for fast moving consumer goods grew by 2.3% in 2012. The market experienced a continued shift in volume from supermarkets towards discounters due to the continued slowdown in the economic environment, more store openings in the discount segment relative to supermarkets and a new law allowing extended opening hours including Sundays.
Short term, the discount segment is expected to continue its growth especially helped by the extended opening hours. Long term, discounters are expected to grow ahead of supermarkets but not at the same pace as historically.

Dansk Supermarked increased its market share in Denmark to 34.0% (33.6%). The increase mainly took place in the second half of 2012. Dansk Supermarkeds market share also increased in Poland and remained stable in Germany and Sweden.
The non-food business continued to be under pressure primarily due to the economic environment together with the growing importance of online shopping, which was also reflected in the online shops, www.bilka.dk and www.salling.dk, which both experienced a continued strong growth in 2012. However, there was an overall decline in the non-food business.
Initiatives in 2012 A major transformation of Dansk Supermarked was initiated in 2012 to make a step change in the coming years to secure the position as the preferred choice of customers in all its retail formats. Every week, Dansk Supermarked delivers around 9m shopping trips and the ambition is to continuously improve the shopping experience to create value for the customers.
The transformation was initiated with a number of cost reducing projects to fund the transformation. Specifically, better prices have been negotiated with suppliers and a number of functions have been reorganised or reduced to get a lean and more agile set-up.
Strategic priorities in the coming years include improve customer insight, develop and refresh the formats,

As part of Dansk Supermarkeds international growth strategy the remaining 25% of the shares in Netto, Germany (OHG Netto Supermarkt GmbH & Co.) was acquired effective from the end of December 2012 and Dansk Super marked is now the sole owner of the company.
Financial performance Revenue for 2012 was DKK 55.6bn, an increase of DKK 2.1bn compared to 2011 adjusted for the sale of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK. In total, 71 new stores were opened of which 48 outside Denmark. A total of 55 stores across all countries were closed.
Profit was negatively impacted by impairment losses of DKK 221m (DKK 67m) mainly related to closed stores including two føtex stores and 37 Tøj & Sko stores. Ad-

ditionally, a sharp decline in the performance of Netto, Sweden, partly due to implementation of a new ERP system and refurbishment of Salling, Aalborg, impacted the result negatively.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure was DKK 2.1bn (positive by DKK 3.4bn). Excluding the cash received from the sale of Netto, UK the comparable capital expend iture in 2011 was DKK 2.9bn. The decrease of DKK 818m was mainly related to investments in fewer stores, relocation and refurbishment of existing stores.
The expectation for 2013 is a total growth of 4-6% in revenue together with improvements in the profitability.
Safety performance The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 13.46 per million exposure hours compared to 13.95 per million exposure hours in 2011.

Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG

·Profit of USD 336m (USD 10m), of which USD 245m stem from divestment gains
·ROIC was 33.9% (0.4%) ·Divestment of Maersk LNG completed, resulting in a
USD 80m gain ·Divestment of FPSO Maersk Peregrino completed,
resulting in a USD 163m gain ·Free cash flow was USD 2.7bn (USD 254m).
Market development During the last three years, the FPSO market has seen an increase in divestments amongst contractors. The financial return on most FPSO contracts does not match the associated risks and costs, which have forced smaller contractors to exit the market creating fewer, but larger players to bid for projects today. Maersk FPSOs has taken part in divestments when the right opportunities with the right buyers have arisen.
At the end of 2012, Maersk FPSOs fleet consisted of four units operating in the North Sea and Congo on long-term contracts running for up to nine years. Two of the units, FPSO North Sea Producer and FGSO NKossa II, are joint

ventures where Maersk FPSOs has 50% and 51% ownership, respectively.
Initiatives in 2012 Following the divestment of FPSO Maersk NgujimaYin in December 2011, an agreement was signed on 31 July 2012 to divest FPSO Maersk Peregrino at a price of USD 1.2bn. The divestment activities generated a total accounting gain of USD 245m in 2012 and a cash flow of USD 2.6bn. In the Groups consolidated figures an additional profit of USD 53m was recognised on the FPSO Maersk Peregrino transaction.
In Q3 2012, Maersk FPSOs signed a new contract for FPSO North Sea Producer, with a positive financial effect dating from 1 January 2012.
Drilling preparations on the Volve field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea have recommenced during 2012 and it has been decided to transfer the Volve production module and the operating company from Maersk FPSOs to Maersk Drilling as of 1 January 2013. Furthermore, it was agreed to start a process which, if successful, will lead to a transfer of ownership of the FPSO Maersk Curlew to third party.

Maersk Container Industry

Maersk Container Industry (MCI) experienced a high demand for reefer containers and reefer machines in the first part of 2012 as a result of sound fundamentals in the market. In the latter part of 2012, demand weakened influenced by an attempt from shipping lines to drive freight rates higher by reducing capacity. However, the fundamentals in the market seem intact driven by the underlying growth in reefer transported commodities and cargo conversion from conventional reefer bulk vessels to reefer containers.
During the year, MCI produced reefer container number 300,000 and reefer machine number 125,000. The production of the Star Cool reefer machine started in 2005

and for the first time MCI sold more reefer machines than reefer containers in a year.
Revenue was USD 1.1bn (USD 1.2bn) and the profit was USD 60m (USD 69m). ROIC was 27.7% (33.1%).
The building of the new reefer factory in Chile is progressing according to plan and is expected to be operational by the end of 2013.
The lost time injury frequency (LTIF) for 2012 was 1.47 per million exposure hours compared to 1.45 per million exposure hours in 2011.

Danske Bank

The Group owns 20% of the shares in Danske Bank, the largest Danish bank, which has operations in a number of countries, including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Ireland and Northern Ireland. The banks profit was DKK 4.7bn (DKK 1.7bn), of which 20%, corresponding to DKK 952m (DKK 343m), is included in the Groups profit.

The Group participated pro rata in Danske Banks DKK 7.15bn (USD 1.2bn) capital increase in October 2012.

Ro/Ro and related activities
Ro/Ro and related activities comprise the Groups ownership interests in DFDS and Höegh Autoliners, etc. The profit was USD 55m (USD 34m) and ROIC was 7.7% (5.3%).

Unallocated activities comprise revenue and costs, etc. as well as financial items which are not attributed to reportable segments, including in particular interest and exchange rate adjustments on borrowings. Furthermore, the purchase of bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of companies in the Group, as well as oil hedging activities that are not allocated to segments, are included on a net basis in unallocated activities.

The bunker purchase activity increased slightly compared to last year. The financial items were negative by USD 755m (negative by USD 855m). The two main contributors to this positive development were reduced net interest expenses (including hedging and fair value adjustments) primarily from short-term placements, as well as currency adjustments.

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 61

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group
Financial report

The A.P. Moller - Maersk Groups profit for the year increased by DKK 5.3bn to DKK 23.4bn (DKK 18.1bn) and the equity totalled DKK 222.5bn (DKK 207.9bn).

INCOME STATEMENT Revenue increased by 6% to DKK 342.1bn (DKK 322.5bn). Measured in USD, revenue decreased by 2% to 59.0bn (USD 60.2bn), positively impacted by higher oil prices and container volumes and negatively offset by lower container freight rates and lower share of oil production.
Operating costs increased by DKK 26.3bn to DKK 271.9bn (DKK 245.6bn), primarily due to increasing container volumes and increasing bunker prices.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses increased by DKK 2.1bn to DKK 31.0bn (DKK 28.9bn). The Group recognised impairment losses of net DKK 2.3bn (DKK 1.7bn), mainly related to Maersk Tankers and Svitzer.
Gain on sale of non-current assets, net, decreased to DKK 3.7bn (DKK 4.8bn). In 2012, the gains primarily related to the sale of the FPSO Maersk Peregrino, the LNG activities, and a partial divestment of an oil activity in Brazil, whereas 2011 primarily was attributable to divestment of Netto Foodstores Limited, UK.

TAX Companies in the Group are taxed under different tax regimes, depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to some of the Groups activities.
As a general rule, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage-based or similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the fleets tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid, mainly based on calculated net income in those countries.
In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the normal corporate tax rate. Furthermore, for the period 1 January to 8 July the Danish government received 20% of the profit before tax from the Danish sector of the North Sea, calculated according to tax rules. This profit share is treated as tax in the financial statements. In other countries, the government receives a share of the oil production in addition to the tax payment. Such government shares are excluded from revenue and hence not included as tax.

Share of the result in associated companies increased by DKK 0.6bn to DKK 1.3bn (DKK 0.7bn) due to higher profit in Danske Bank and Höegh Autoliners.
Net financial expenses were reduced to DKK 4.4bn (DKK 4.6bn). The two main contributors to this positive development was lower net interest expenses including hedging and positive fair value adjustments primarily from short-term placements, as well as currency adjustments.

In 2012, the total tax charge for the Group was DKK 19.1bn (DKK 32.4bn). The decrease was primarily caused by the settlement of an Algerian tax dispute resulting in a oneoff income of DKK 5.2bn. Of the total tax charge, taxes payable to Denmark were DKK 9.3bn in 2012 (DKK 11.0bn), of which DKK 6.1bn related to the special hydrocarbon tax and profit share to the Danish state (DKK 7.7bn), and DKK 3.2bn represented corporate tax on oil activities (DKK 3.3bn). The shipping activities tax payment was DKK 57m (DKK 56m).

Financial report

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income for the year was DKK 21.7bn (DKK 19.9bn) and includes the profit for the year of DKK 23.4bn (DKK 18.1bn) and other comprehensive income which was negative by DKK 1.7bn (positive DKK 1.8bn). Other comprehensive income mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow hedges and actuarial gains and losses.
BALANCE SHEET At 31 December 2012, total assets amounted to DKK 420.7bn (DKK 404.7bn).

21.7bn (DKK 19.9bn), and dividend was deducted by DKK 5.5bn (DKK 4.9bn).
Deferred tax liabilities totalled DKK 7.9bn (DKK 6.0bn) at 31 December 2012, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled DKK 3.8bn (DKK 4.9bn). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of DKK 4.0bn (DKK 4.0bn) have not been recognised, cf. note 13 to consolidated financial statements.
LEGAL DISPUTES, ETC. The Group is involved in a number of legal disputes. Moreover, the Group is party to a number of tax disputes, some of which involve substantial amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty.

Intangible assets increased to DKK 34.2bn (DKK 28.8bn) mainly due to acquired terminal concession rights.
Property, plant and equipment of DKK 261.4bn (DKK 254.8bn) increased by DKK 6.6bn, with investments in the year of DKK 47.0bn (DKK 43.2bn). Depreciation for the year was DKK 26.7bn (DKK 25.7bn), and net impairment losses of DKK 1.7bn (DKK 1.4bn) were recognised. Sale of tangible assets accounted for DKK 8.8bn (DKK 10.0bn), primarily related to oil facilities in Denmark due to the entry of Nordsøfonden (the Danish stateowned North Sea Fund) as partner in DUC (Dansk Undergrunds Consortium) and FPSO Maersk Peregrino. Currency adjustments were a decrease of DKK 3.2bn (increase of DKK 5.0bn) due to the development in USD versus DKK.
Shares in associated companies amounted to DKK 35.5bn (DKK 32.5bn), hereof Danske Bank DKK 27.7bn (DKK 25.2bn).

PENSIONS, ETC. The actuarial net liability in relation to defined benefit plans recognised in the financial statements totalled DKK 2.5bn (DKK 2.5bn) at 31 December 2012. Developments in the actuarial assumptions as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements resulted in actuarial losses of DKK 253m (loss of DKK 844m), which are included in other comprehensive income. In 2012, the Group paid DKK 584m (DKK 558m) to defined benefit plans.
CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities DKK 44.2bn (DKK 38.9bn) was positively affected by less taxes paid, which was partly offset by lower earnings before depreciation and amortisation. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was DKK 36.6bn (DKK 52.3bn). The decrease was mainly due to sale of the FPSO Maersk Peregrino, the LNG activities, and a partial divestment of an oil activity in Brazil partly being offset by the investments in vessels, oil rights as well as the capital increase in Danske Bank.

Derivatives were as of 31 December 2012 a net liability of DKK 135m (DKK 3.3bn). The reduced liability is primarily related to the appreciation of NOK and DKK.
Total cash and cash equivalents, consisting of securities held for trading as well as cash and bank balances, totalled DKK 15.2bn (DKK 15.2bn) at 31 December 2012. Assets held for sale of net DKK 3.0bn (DKK 8.7bn) comprised assets expected to be sold during 2013 including 11 handygas vessels.

Operating lease commitments The present value of the operating lease commitments totalled DKK 63.4bn (DKK 66.8bn) at 31 December 2012 using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into the following main items: ·Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of DKK 31.9bn (DKK
39.2bn) primarily relating to vessels on time charter ·APM Terminals of DKK 24.6bn (DKK 21.5bn) primarily
relating to future concession fees for port facilities ·Other commitments of DKK 6.9bn (DKK 6.1bn)

Equity totalled DKK 222.5bn (DKK 207.9bn). The increase About half of the time charter payments in Maersk Line

includes comprehensive income for the year of DKK

and one third of the time charter payments in Maersk

Financial report

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 63

Tankers are estimated to relate to operational costs for the assets. The use of chartered vessels reduces the risk related to fluctuations in demand. The average term to maturity of commitments related to the charters was 2.4 years (2.7 years) for Maersk Line and 4.3 years (4.2 years) for Maersk Tankers.
In APM Terminals, the majority of the commitments relating to future concession fees for port facilities have long maturities with most of the concession agreements being longer than 20 years.
Capital commitments Capital commitments related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment totalled DKK 78.1bn (DKK 84.9bn) at 31 December 2012 and are primarily related to Maersk Line DKK 19.2.bn (DKK 30.0bn), Maersk Drilling DKK 19.2bn (DKK 17.4bn), Maersk Oil DKK 19.3bn (DKK 16.5bn) and APM Terminals DKK 18.3bn (DKK 16.3bn).
A total of 25 container vessels, 7 drilling units and 12 other vessels are in the order book at year-end.
The capital commitments will be financed by a combination of the Groups future cash flow from operating activities, investment specific loans and existing committed corporate facilities.

PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The activities of the parent company comprise the global container services in Maersk Line, parts of offshore and other shipping activities and the oil and gas activities in the Danish sector of the North Sea. In addition, activities include the holding of shares in subsidiaries and associated companies.
In the parent company financial statements, shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised at cost, cf. note 1, less impairment losses, and in the income statement, dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income.
Profit for the year was DKK 8.4bn (DKK 10.5bn), primarily impacted by lower dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies, while tax was lower due to lower profit before tax.
Cash flow from operating activities was DKK 17.1bn (DKK 17.4bn). Main deviations were decrease in dividends received from subsidiaries and associated companies, partly offset by decrease in paid taxes. At 31 December 2012, total assets amounted to DKK 278.5bn (DKK 262.8bn) and equity totalled DKK 116.5bn (DKK 113.3bn).

Risk management

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 67

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group
Risk management

The Group is exposed to a range of different risks due to its global presence and variety of businesses. This requires a portfolio approach to risks where the downside risks are carefully evaluated and balanced against the upside potential and where risks are assessed from a portfolio perspective.

Risk management process Management of the Groups risks is anchored in an Enterprise Risk Management framework, where the most significant risks and mitigation plans are consolidated bi-annually in a Group key risk overview. The Group key risk overview is discussed with the Groups Executive Board and Board of Directors.
Strategic risks Supply and demand imbalance in Maersk Line The Group is exposed to substantial fluctuations in freight rates, particularly in Maersk Line, due to significant structural imbalances between supply and demand. To mitigate this risk, Maersk Line differentiates its services to build customer loyalty and furthermore enters into customer contracts to secure rates and volumes. Furthermore, scrapping of vessels, slow steaming and cancellations are used to reduce capacity and cost in periods of excess tonnage.
Oil production The Groups projected oil production depends on continuity of existing production, progression of pending field development projects and extension of existing licenses and contracts. In order to efficiently progress discoveries to productions, a defined project maturation process has been adopted in the Group. The Group additionally focuses on recruitment, stakeholder management and termination of non-commercial projects.
Political risks The Groups global presence exposes both assets and earnings to geopolitical events. Political actions such as

trade barriers, new taxes, currency restrictions, expropriation etc. could impact the Groups result and cash flows. Key mitigations to manage these risks include engagement with political bodies and authorities, local partnerships, monitoring of regulatory initiatives, corporate social responsibility and spread of geographical risks.
Financial risks Liquidity The Group must have sufficient funds available to fund its operations and investment programme and service its debt. The Group has a financial policy and closely monitors cash flow forecasts, financial ratios and the liquidity reserve. Further, the Group aims to secure funding before committing investments and seeks to diversify financing sources through corporate bonds and private placements.
Credit risk The Group has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
Foreign exchange rate The Groups income from shipping and oil related activities is mainly USD denominated while the related expenses are in both USD and a wide range of other currencies. The Groups exposure to currency fluctuations is mitigated by various hedge programs.

68 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012

Risk management

Oil price The Group has substantial income from oil and gas activities and substantial costs to bunker fuel. Both items are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the oil price (crude oil price and bunker oil price respectively). The Group seeks to recover bunker fuel costs from customers through the Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF). The net oil price position is being monitored closely and managed at Group level.
Operational risks Major safety incidents Controlling the risk of major safety incidents is inherent in the Groups businesses, particularly in the oil and offshore businesses. To mitigate these risks, safety training, safety risk management systems, certification and classification of equipment and procedures, quality assurance and processes for knowledge sharing across the Group are in place. When activities are performed in partnerships or in joint ventures where the Group is not in full control of the activities, the Group seeks to protect sustainable interests and values through cooperation and shareholder agreements, etc.

Major environmental incidents Controlling the risk of major environmental incidents is inherent in the Groups businesses, particularly in the oil, offshore and tanker business. The risk is mitigated through training, environmental management systems, oil spill procedures, membership of cross industry response organisations, double hull policy and by taking limited equity shares in operations in high risk areas. Where activities are performed in cooperation or joint ventures and the Group is not in full control of the activities, the Group constantly seeks to protect sustainable interests and values through cooperation and shareholder agreements, etc.
War, terrorism or piracy attack Due to its global operational presence the Group faces a threat of war, terrorism and piracy attacks in various areas. Main mitigations are disaster and contingency planning, security measures at offices, vessels and installations, armed guards on vessels, voyage planning and monitoring and intelligence.

Risk management

A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S ­ Annual Report 2012 69

Information risk The Groups global presence, size and complexity dictate a need for having the right information available at the right time, maintaining the integrity of protected information and preventing disclosure of confidential information.
This is secured through an information security policy, IT governance, technical controls, information security user training and awareness campaigns and business continuity plans.
Procedures and controls Continued strengthening of the business areas competitiveness, including customer focus and cost control, has a material impact on the Groups results and development.
Part of the activities in APM Terminals and Maersk Oil are performed in cooperation and joint ventures where the Group is not in full control of the activities. Through cooperation and shareholder agreements, etc., with stateowned partners among others, the Group constantly seeks to protect sustainable interests and values as well as to ensure implementation of initiatives to improve the Groups competitiveness and results.
Compliance risks Human rights It is a priority for the Group to be compliant with the global human rights standards associated with the new expectations and standards set by OECD for multinational enterprises. The Group has implemented a Responsible Procurement Programme, health and safety management programmes and global labour principles in place to mitigate the risk of non-compliance.
Tax The Group is exposed to a large number of different tax regimes in 130 countries and there is a risk of unexpected tax expenses due to uncertainty in the interpretation of local tax regulations or failure in compliance. To mitigate this risk, specific tax compliance policies are in place, a tax risk database is maintained and the Groups tax function receives regular reporting from Business Unit and Country tax departments. In significant locations, specialised tax managers monitor changes in tax regulations and rules to ensure full compliance. In other locations the Group relies upon external tax advisors for guidance.

Anti-corruption, competition and export control Failure to comply with applicable legislation relating to anti-corruption, competition and export control may have a substantial negative impact on the Groups financial performance and reputation. To mitigate this risk, mandatory compliance training, specific compliance policies and procedures, a whistleblower system, a "hospitality book" to report gifts and compliance audits and drills are in place.
Emerging risks The Group has decided to further investigate and assess the potential impact of the following emerging risks: ·Consequences of the emergence of shale oil/gas and its
impact on the Groups businesses, in particular Maersk Oil, Maersk Drilling and Maersk Tankers ·Consequences of emerging changes in trade patterns and consumer behaviour and their implications for Maersk Line.
Insurance The Groups insurance programmes cover assets and liabilities across the Groups business portfolio in accordance with legal requirements and industry practice. Limits and sums insured are based on maximum foreseeable losses considering also availability and price of capacity.
Since January 2012, the Group operates its own captive insurance company, Maersk Insurance A/S, which allows the Group to self-insure risks within parameters specified by the Groups Board of Directors and thus to optimise the Groups total cost of insurable risks.
Maersk Insurance A/S insures risks across the Groups business portfolio ranging from vessels, oil and gas installations, drilling rigs to ports and terminals.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Annual Report 2012 83

1 Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements for 2012 for the A.P. Moller ­ Maersk Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. In addition, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for 2011. An overview of the new and updated standards and interpretations is given in note 31.
A number of operational segments have an increasing significance to the Group, and consequently the presentation of segment information has been changed as of 1 January 2012. The business area Tankers, offshore and other shipping activities has been divided into Maersk Drilling, Maersk Supply Service, Maersk Tankers, SVITZER and Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG. Maersk Supply Service includes the ESVAGT business, which was transferred from SVITZER. The Ro/Ro and related activities have been moved to Other businesses, while Damco has been separated from Container activities. Furthermore, for simplification purposes, segment profit or loss no longer includes financial items. Comparative figures have been restated.
The Board of Directors and the Management Board have on 22 February 2013 considered and adopted the annual report for 2012, which will be presented for adoption by the shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 11 April 2013.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, subsidiaries and proportionate shares in jointly controlled entities.
Subsidiaries are entities in which A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S controls the financial and operational policies for the purpose of achieving a return or other benefits from the activities. Control is achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling more than 50% of the voting rights, by means of agreements on management control or some other way of controlling the entity concerned. Entities in which the Group exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered to be associated companies (associates). A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Jointly controlled entities are entities in which the Group according to contractual agreements makes strategic decisions about the financing and operation of the entity jointly with one or more other parties.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company, subsidiaries and the proportionate share of jointly controlled entities which have been prepared in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, after the elimination of intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, intra-group balances and dividends, and gains on intra-group transactions. Financial statement items related to part-owned vessels are included proportionately.
Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and jointly controlled entities are eliminated in proportion with the Groups ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.
Non-controlling interests share of profit for the year and of equity in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned is included as part of the Groups profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.
Business combinations On acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. Any subsequent changes to contingent acquisition costs are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.

84 Annual Report 2012
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group

1 Accounting policies ­ continued

In stepwise acquisitions, value adjustments of previously recognised investments are recognised in the income statement. When surrendering control, the value of any retained investment is adjusted at fair value and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as gain on sale of non-current assets, etc., net. The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.

Foreign currency translation The Group uses DKK as its presentation currency. In the translation to the presentation currency for entities with a functional currency different from DKK, the statement of comprehensive income is translated into DKK at average exchange rates and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from such translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For the Groups principal shipping activities and oil and gas activities, the functional currency is USD. This means that, among other things, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency in the country in which such activities are performed.

Transactions in other currencies than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.

Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.

The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge future transactions is recognised directly in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the cumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised.

The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities which can be attributed to the hedging relationship.

The ineffective portion of hedge transactions, including time value for oil price hedges, and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for financial instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.

Segment information The allocation of business activities into segments reflects the Groups character as a conglomerate and is in line with the internal management reporting. Some activities are related, but are managed as independent units. The segments are as follows:

Maersk Line Maersk Oil APM Terminals Maersk Drilling Maersk Supply Service Maersk Tankers Damco SVITZER Dansk Supermarked Group Maersk FPSOs and Maersk LNG

Global container services Oil and gas production and exploration activities Container terminal activities, inland transportation, container depots and repair of containers, etc. Offshore drilling activities as well as land-rig operations through 50% ownership of Egyptian Drilling Company Offshore support supply vessel activities with anchor handling, platform and subsea support vessels Tanker shipping of crude oil, oil products and gas Logistic and forwarding activities Towing and salvage activities, etc. Supermarkets (føtex and Bilka), department stores (Salling) and discount supermarkets (Netto), etc. Floating oil and gas production units

Revenue from Other businesses consists of income from container sales, shipbuilding, air freight, and services sold to the energy industry. Other businesses also include investments in the associated companies Danske Bank, Höegh Autoliners and DFDS.
Revenue between segments is limited except for Terminal activities and Damco, which deliver a large part of their services to the Groups container shipping activities. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities comprise items directly related to or which can be allocated to segments. Financial assets and liabilities and financial income and expenses are not attributed to business segments.
Reportable segments do not comprise costs in group functions. Furthermore, oil hedging activities in Maersk Oil Trading and the results of Maersk Oil Tradings trading activity in the form of purchasing bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of entities in the Group are not allocated to business segments.
Income statement Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of risk to the buyer.
Revenue from shipping activities is recognised as the service is rendered, by which incomplete voyages are recognised at the share related to the financial year. The earnings of vessels that are part of pool arrangements are recognised in revenue based on time charter equivalents.
Oil and gas sales are recognised as revenue upon discharge from the production site. Revenue from agreements in which the states share of production is settled in oil is recognised gross with the state share recognised as tax expense. Royalties settled in oil are deducted from revenue.
Revenue from terminal operations, logistics, forwarding activities and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is also included. For drilling activities, which are typically carried out under long-term agreements with fixed day rates, revenue is recognised for the production time related to the financial year. Revenue from retail activities is recognised by cash sales.
Lease income from operational leases is recognised over the lease term.
Exploration costs in the oil and gas activities are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
Share in profits of associated companies is recognised net of tax and corrected for share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for investments in associated companies, including goodwill, and their reversal.
Tax comprises the amount estimated to be paid for the year, as well as adjustments to previous years and deferred tax. The tax amount includes the special taxes relating to extraction and production of hydrocarbons, including the profit share to the Danish State and tax on income subject to Danish and foreign tonnage taxation, etc.
Government grants are deducted from the cost of the assets or costs to which the grant relates.
Statement of comprehensive income Other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not included in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation of consolidated and associated companies financial statements into presentation currency, adjustment of other equity investments and hedging instruments to fair value and actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit plans, etc. The Groups share of other comprehensive income in associated companies is also included.
In the event of disposal or discontinuation of an entity, the Groups share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of securities are transferred to the income statement in the event of sale or when an impairment loss is deemed to be unrecoverable.

Actual and deferred tax relating to other comprehensive income are included.

Balance sheet Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Intangible assets in connection with acquired oil resources (concession rights, etc.) are amortised from the commencement of production until the fields expected production periods ends ­ a period of up to 15 years. Acquired exploration rights are amortised from the date of acquisition for a period of up to five years.

IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.

For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. Cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but impairment tests are prepared at least annually, starting in the year of acquisition. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units.

Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:

Ships, rigs, etc. Containers, etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure
Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc. Oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields

20-25 years 12 years
10-50 years over lease or concession period
5-20 years 3-7 years
up to 15 years

For oil production facilities, including facilities under construction, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil.

The cost of an asset is divided into separate components which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs to sell.

The cost of assets constructed by the Group includes direct and indirect expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost.

Cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment, removal and restoration.

Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships, rigs, etc. when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next drydocking.

Assets held under finance leases are treated as property, plant and equipment.

Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is fully impaired before other assets in a cash-generating unit.
Investments in associated companies are recognised as the Groups share of the equity value measured according to the Groups accounting policies inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is regained.
Securities, including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for other securities. Securities that form part of the liquidity resources (Held for trading) are classified as current assets and value adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items. Other equity investments are classified as non-current assets (the category Available-for-sale) where unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. Write-down is made to net realisable value if lower. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Receivables are generally recognised at nominal value, which in all material respects corresponds to amortised cost. Non-current receivables are recognised at discounted value, including finance lease receivables. Write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit or loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proposed dividend for distribution is included as a separate component of equity until the declaration date. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity, including proceeds on the disposal of own shares in connection with the exercise of share options.
The translation reserve comprises the Groups share of accumulated differences arising on the foreign currency translation of Group entities and associated companies financial statements into presentation currency. The securities reserve comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of other equity investments (Available-for-sale). The reserve for hedges includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of hedging transactions qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting.
Share options allocated to the executives of the Group as part of the Groups long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at the grant date estimated fair value. The counter item is equity. The fair value is calculated on the basis of the Black & Scholes formula for valuation of options.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation and include provisions for abandonment of oil fields, restructuring costs, legal disputes, onerous contracts, etc. Provisions are recognised on the basis of best estimates and considering discounting when the time element is significant.
Pension obligations, etc. which are defined benefit plans are recognised based on actuarial calculations of the obligations and the fair value of the assets in the plans. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of current service costs less employee payments, computed interest cost, expected return on plan assets and settlement, gains or losses, etc. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Costs regarding defined contribution pension and insurance plans are recognised as incurred.
Pension plans where the Group as part of collective bargaining agreements participates together with other enterprises ­ so called multiemployer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans where sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.
Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not provided on goodwill which is not deductible or depreciable for tax purposes, or temporary differences which have no effect on the accounting results or

taxable income at the time of the transaction. In addition, deferred tax is not calculated for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent that taxable dividends are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised within a foreseeable future.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Transaction costs and any premium or discount are amortised over the term of the liabilities using the amortised cost method. Fixed interest loans which under hedge accounting are swapped to variable interest are measured at amortised cost adding or deducting the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet.
Cash flow statement Cash flow for the year is divided into cash flow from operating activities, cash flow used for investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances. Changes in marketable securities are included in cash flow used for investing activities.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and comparative figures are restated. Similarly, assets and related liabilities from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement.
Individual assets or groups of assets that are to be disposed of collectively are classified as assets held for sale, when the activities to carry out such a sale have been initiated and the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities that are directly related to assets held for sale are presented correspondingly.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets, etc. are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.
Key figures Return on equity is calculated as the profit or loss for the year divided by the average equity.
Return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is the profit or loss for the year before interest but after calculated tax, divided by the average invested capital (equity plus net interest-bearing debt).
Equity ratio is calculated as the equity divided by total assets.
The segments return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is profit or loss divided by the average invested capital, net (assets less liabilities).
Earnings per share and cash flow from operating activities per share comprise A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S share of the profit or loss for the year respectively the cash flow from operating activities divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding the Groups holding of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of issued share options.
Dividend per share is the proposed dividend for the year per share of DKK 1,200.
Total market capitalisation is the total number of shares ­ excluding the Groups holding of own shares ­ multiplied by the end-of-year price quoted by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen.

2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements
When preparing the consolidated financial statements for the Group, the management undertakes a number of accounting estimates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify the Groups assets and liabilities.
The most significant areas subject to estimates and judgements are mentioned below.
Valuation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment, if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are always carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less costs to sell and estimated value in use.
Fair value is sought to be obtained for active markets for corresponding assets or determined on the basis of other observable input. As far as possible, the estimated fair value of ships, rigs and properties is obtained using acknowledged brokers. However, it is not possible to determine reliable fair value for certain types of ships in the current market with continued low trading activity.
The estimated value in use is computed on the basis of the expected free cash flow from the relevant cash-generating unit based on updated business plans for the next five years or the remaining useful lives for assets operating under contracts. The calculated value in use is based on a number of assumptions and is by nature subject to uncertainty. For oil concession rights the value will primarily depend on conclusions regarding the commercial prospects. The values in use for the tanker activities are based on future expectations, which have been adjusted downwards and consequently impairment losses are recognised. Assumptions are described in notes 9 and 10.
The determination and delimitation of cash-generating units differ for the various business areas. For integrated network businesses such as Maersk Line and Safmarine, the container shipping activities are considered to be a single cash-generating unit. For the oil and gas activities, connected oil and gas fields are considered to be cash-generating units, and for offshore and other shipping activities, the cash-generating unit is often the individual asset. Maersk Tankers and Maersk Supply Service group vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing the managements ongoing follow-up.
Depreciation periods The total depreciation and amortisation is a considerable cost to the Group. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are depreciated and amortised over the expected useful lives for ships and rigs, etc., typically over a useful life of 20-25 years to a residual value of 10% of the original cost for ships and up to 30% for drilling rigs. For producing oil fields and production platforms, the useful lives are based on the expected production profile of the field.
Estimates of useful lives and residual values are reassessed regularly based on available information. In this connection, the long term view is prioritised, in order to disregard to the extent possible temporary market fluctuations, which may be significant. Changes to estimates of useful lives and residual values may affect the annual depreciation and amortisation and thereby the results for the year significantly.
Business combinations The allocation of the acquisition cost to the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and thus to goodwill, including the allocation to cash-generating units, may have a significant impact on future profits. Fair values are based on estimates using information available at the time control was achieved. When part of the acquisition cost for entities acquired is dependent on the development in future profits, estimates are made of the most probable value of the contingent acquisition cost based on current forecasts.
Leasing Lease contracts are classified as operating or finance leases at the inception of the lease. Once determined, the classification is not subsequently changed unless there are changes to the contract documents.
Contracts which transfer all significant risks and benefits associated with the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. This usually applies to long-term lease contracts or where ownership is transferred to the lessee at the expiry of the lease term. All conditions in a contract are assessed and the classification depends to a certain extent on judgement based on the actual circumstances of the agreement.

90 Annual Report 2012

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group

2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements ­ continued
The value of assets held under finance leases recognised in the balance sheet is based on the discounted value of the contractual lease payments. No contingent lease payments are included and the value can therefore be determined reliably. Uncertainty relating to the useful lives and residual values of assets and the impairment test principles is the same for assets held under finance leases as for own assets.
Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised and measured to the extent they are expected to be realisable within the foreseeable future. Tax assets which can only be utilised in the longer term are deemed to be uncertain and are not recognised.
Receivables Provisions for bad debt and write-downs of receivables are carried out on the basis of an assessment of their recoverability at the balance sheet date. Trade receivables are grouped on the basis of maturity analyses for the purpose of providing for bad debt. In special circumstances trade receivables are impaired individually. Other receivables, including loans, are written-down on the basis of an assessment of the individual debtors credit rating. An analysis of overdue trade receivables and movement in the provisions for bad debt can be found in note 23. The write-downs of non-current receivables performed in the period can be found in note 6.
Pension liabilities The gross liability for defined benefit plans, etc. is based on a number of actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, future inflation, the future rate of salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. External actuaries are used for measuring the gross liabilities. Even modest changes to the actuarial assumptions may result in significant changes in the pension liability.
Plan assets that are used only to meet the obligations are set off against the gross liability. Assets are measured at fair value by fund admini strators and comprise cash, securities, properties, etc. Where there is not an active market for the assets, the fair value is estimated. The less liquid the assets, the greater the uncertainty related to the measurement. The composition of the assets can be found in note 19.
Provisions for abandonment When establishing oil and gas production facilities, provisions are made for the cost of the disposal of the facilities and re-establishment of the sea bed according to the rules which apply to the individual concession areas. The assumptions for the provisions are reassessed annually. A significant part of the liability is not realised until after 20-30 years and consequently the calculation of the liability, including the assumptions applied, is associated with significant uncertainty.
The most significant assumptions are: · The useful economic life of the field and thereby the time of abandonment (which partly depends on the future oil price) · Cost level at the time of abandonment · Discount rate
Provisions for legal disputes, etc. The managements estimate of the provisions in connection with legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. Due to the nature of legal disputes, the outcome of these is subject to considerable uncertainty.
Other provisions The amount comprises inter alia estimated provisions for onerous contracts, guarantee obligations and provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the USA.
Judgement of accounting control To a certain extent, the classification of entities partly owned by other enterprises, and thereby how the entities are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements, is based on a judgement of the formal and actual conditions and clauses in shareholders agreements, etc.

Maersk Oil Al Shaheen Qatar

In November 2012, Qatar Petroleum (representing the State of Qatar) and Maersk Oil agreed on a new field development plan which included a further investment in the field of around USD 1.5bn and drilling of 51 new wells and some facility debottlenecking activities. Al Shaheen is Qatars largest offshore oil field and currently produces around 300,000 barrels of oil per day.

The impairment tests are based on the estimated value in use from five year business plans and a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected local economic growth.
Impairment losses for 2012 of DKK 623m primarily relate to Adsteam Marine Limited goodwill in the United Kingdom, which was fully impaired due to weak market conditions. Regarding goodwill in Australia, an increase in the discount rate of 1%-point is estimated to result in an additional impairment of DKK 570m. Likewise a decline of 1%-point in terminal value growth rate is estimated to result in an impairment of DKK 445m.
Impairment losses for 2011 of DKK 147m primarily related to oil concession rights on the Janice field in the United Kingdom and were based on estimated value in use. A discount rate of 8.5% p.a. after tax and the forward curve for oil prices at 31 December 2011 were used in the calculation.

Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment respectively.
Interest rate derivatives swap floating to fixed rates on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement concurrently with the hedged interest expenses. Interest rate derivatives are also used to swap fixed rates to floating rates.
Furthermore, the Group enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group

The Group has established a share option programme for partners in Firmaet A.P. Møller and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The fair value of share options granted to 123 (126) employees was DKK 39m (DKK 36m) at the time of such grant. Total value of granted share options recognised in the income statement is DKK 36m (DKK 32m). In addition to this, three (four) partners in Firmaet A.P. Møller bought share options corresponding to a fair value of DKK 7m (DKK 9m).
The share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S annual report. Exercise of the share options is contingent on the option holder still being permanently employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least two years and no more than five years have passed from the time of grant and can only be exercised within the trading periods as stated in the internal rules for trading of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S securities in force at any time. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Companys capital structure, etc.
The share options can only be settled in shares. A portion of the Groups holding of own shares is reserved for settlement of granted options.

19 Pensions and similar obligations

A.P. Moller - Maersk Group

As employer, the Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which the Group operates. As a main rule, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprises share of the obligation is not available.

Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, some entities in the Group participate together with other enterprises in defined benefit pension and health insurance schemes for current and retired employees (multi-employer plans). In 2012, the Groups contribution is estimated at DKK 707m (DKK 572m). The contributions to be paid in 2013 are expected to be DKK 760m.
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. The Groups share might be significant. Deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Based on the most recent available financial data from the plans trustees, the plan assets totalled DKK 38.8bn (DKK 41.5bn) and the actuarial value of obligations a pproximately DKK 52.8bn (DKK 53.7bn). Net obligations in the plans with deficits totalled DKK 15.5bn (DKK 13.8bn). In general, the con tributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities are primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Groups profit or equity significantly.
Gains/losses recognised in the income statement are included under financial income/expenses for financial assets and under other income/ costs for other payables. DKK 115m (DKK 6m) is related to other payables held at the balance sheet date.

23 Financial risks

Annual Report 2012 123

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups Business Units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2012.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2012. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.
Currency risk The Groups currency risk arises due to income from shipping and oil-related activities are denominated mainly in USD, while the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including APM Terminals and Dansk Supermarked, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Groups exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the Groups currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Groups net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Groups profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
·  Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; ·  Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·  Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed, is estimated to have a negative impact on the Groups profit before tax by DKK 0.8bn (positive DKK 0.1bn) and the Groups equity, excluding tax, negatively by DKK 1.8bn (DKK 0.9bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 15 and 22, and are thus not an expression of the Groups total currency risk.

Interest rate risk The Group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as DKK, EUR and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps. The duration of the Groups debt portfolio is 1.8 years (2.0 years). A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by DKK 0.4bn (DKK 0.4bn). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be positive by DKK 0.1bn (negative by DKK 0.2bn).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Credit risk The Group has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.

1 Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities, securities, cash and bank balances, including balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions, cf. page 78.

Based on the liquidity reserve, the size of the committed loan facilities, including loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Groups financial resources are deemed satisfactory. The Groups long term objective is to maintain a conservative funding profile, matching that of a strong investment grade company over the business cycle, with a strong liquidity position in order to withstand fluctuations in the economy, and have the strength to exploit new and attractive investment opportunities.

The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about five years).

It is of great importance for the Group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Groups obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Groups liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

If the acquisitions during the year had occurred 1 January 2012, the Groups revenue and profit would not have been materially different.
Fair value adjustments on contingent considerations in relation to prior year acquisitions of Poti Sea Port Corp. and NTS International Transport Services Co. Ltd. have during 2012 resulted in gains of DKK 87m and DKK 47m, respectively. The gains are recognised as other income.
Skandia Container Terminal AB On 4 January 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Skandia Container Terminal AB, which operates the port of Gothenburg, Sweden. The acquisition will strengthen APM Terminals position in Scandinavia.
The total purchase price was DKK 1,363m. The net assets acquired consist of terminal rights of DKK 1,627m, property, plant and equipment of DKK 182m and liabilities of DKK 557m.
From the acquisition date to 31 December 2012, Skandia Container Terminal AB contributed with a revenue of DKK 540m and a profit of DKK 63m.
Global Ports Investments PLC On 28 November 2012, the Group acquired 37.5% of the shares in Global Ports (30% voting rights), which is a leading operator of container terminals in Russia and the Baltics. The Group has through a shareholder agreement joint control over the entity. The acquisition enables APM Terminals to expand its network in Russia and neighbouring countries and create further opportunities to accommodate growth.
The total purchase price was DKK 4,752m. The net assets acquired consist of terminal rights of DKK 3,918m, property, plant and equipment of DKK 2,421m and liabilities of DKK 1,989m.
As the acquisition date is close to the year end, the revenue and the profit contributed to the Group is insignificant.
The accounting for the business combination is considered provisional at 31 December 2012 as some analyses are still ongoing.

31 New financial reporting requirements
Changes in accounting policies The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued a number of changes to financial reporting standards and interpretations which come into effect for the 2012 financial year. None of these are of significance to the accounting policies applied by the Group.
Changes in coming years The Group expects to implement the following new standards when they become mandatory in 2015 (IFRS 9) and 2013 (others):
·Financial instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will be issued in phases to gradually replace IAS 39. So far, the changes cover the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups current practice of classifying and recognising gains and losses in the income statement and other comprehensive income can be retained under IFRS 9.
·Consolidation IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is based on the principle in IAS 27 that control is a precondition for the consolidation of an entity. The concept of control is expanded upon including guidelines on how to determine control in cases where an assessment is required.
The Group expects IFRS 10 to have limited impact.
·Jointly controlled entities IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 and removes the choice of method for preparing the financial statements of jointly controlled entities. Going forward it must be assessed whether the contracting parties have rights to assets and liabilities in the jointly controlled entity (joint operations) or if they have rights to the net assets in the arrangement (joint ventures). Joint operations will continue to be recognised proportionately, whereas joint ventures will be recognised according to the equity method, equivalent to associates.
On the basis of an analysis of the existing contractual relationships, it can be concluded that the change will not have a significant impact on the Group.
·Other changes IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities contains new requirements for information about interests in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement contains a definition of fair value and comprehensive guidelines on its application; these replace the guidelines found in the individual financial reporting standards. The standard means new disclosure requirements but does not change the Groups accounting policies.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits has been revised in terms of the accounting of and disclosure on defined benefit pension plans. The revised rules change the calculation of the periods interest cost for the net obligation with no material impact on the Groups profit.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements means a change in the presentation of items in other comprehensive income.
Some of the above changes have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The standards endorsed by the EU with a later effective date than the corresponding effective date from the IASB are pre-implemented and thus comply with the IASBs effective date

To the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S

Report on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2012, which comprise income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the parent company. The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
The Board of Directors and the Managements responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements The Board of Directors and the Management are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the Management determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial

statements and the parent company financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors and the Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The audit has not resulted in any qualification.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Groups and the parent companys financial position at 31 December 2012 and of the results of the Groups and the parent companys operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2012 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Statement on the Directors report Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Directors report. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the Directors report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.

The Group has established a share option programme for partners in Firmaet A.P. Møller and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The fair value of share options granted to 123 (126) employees was DKK 39 million (DKK 36 million) at the time of such grant. Total value of granted share options is recognised in the income statement at DKK 17 million (DKK 15 million). In addition to this, three (four) partners in Firmaet A.P. Møller bought share options corresponding to a fair value of DKK 7 million (DKK 9 million).
The share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days follow ing the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' annual report. Exercise of the share options is contingent on the option holder still being permanently employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least two years and no more than five years have passed from the time of granting and can only be exercised within the trading periods as stated in the internal rules for trading of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' securities in force at any time. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc.

19 Financial risks
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company's Business Units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relates to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2012.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2012. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.

Annual Report 2012 181

Currency risk The Company's currency risk arises due to income from shipping and oil-related activities are denominated mainly in USD, while the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. Overall the Company has net income in USD and net expenses in most other currencies. As the net income is in USD ,this is also the primary financing currency.
The main purpose of hedging the Company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Company's profit. The Company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
·Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Company is exposed, is estimated to have a negative impact on the Company's profit before tax by DKK 0.3 billion (DKK 0.4 billion) and the Company's equity, excluding tax, negatively by DKK 1.1 billion (DKK 1.3 billion). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 13 and 18, and are thus not an expression of the Company's total currency risk.

Interest rate risk The Company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as DKK, EUR and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The Company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps.
A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by DKK 430 million (positively by DKK 29 million). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be negatively by DKK 39 million (positively by DKK 195 million).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Liquidity risk It is of great importance for the Company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.

The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

Capital commitments At the end of 2012, capital commitments relating to ships, rigs, terminals, etc. on order amount to DKK 30.2 billion (DKK 34.2 billion).

The commitments primarily relate to 20 container vessels (Triple-E) at a total contract price of DKK 21.5 billion (USD 3.8 billion) as well as contracts for four drillships at a total contract price of DKK 12.7 billion (USD 2.2 billion).
