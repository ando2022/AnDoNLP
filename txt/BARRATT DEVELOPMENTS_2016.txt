         Targeted land buying and effective planning
     We purchase land in targeted locations which at least meets our hurdle
rates of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE. We then work closely with local communities and authorities to deliver effective planning permissions.
Our capability to deliver developments of all levels of complexity from standard housing to large and highly complex London schemes, and our wide geographical portfolio means we can manage risk through our diversity.
We also have a proven track record in delivering successful JV partnerships.
We design outstanding homes and places for our customers, using standard house designs, developed using customer research.
This means our quality products are well designed to fit our customers’ lifestyles with developments that enhance the local community, with our aim that all new developments meet Building for Life 12 standards.
We build quality homes efficiently, with centralised procurement and sharing of best practice, while ensuring high standards of health and safety. Our experienced teams help ensure efficient delivery of complex developments.
We have long standing relationships with material suppliers which are centrally contracted, managing our cost base and ensuring continuity of supply and strong, long standing relationships with local sub-contractors.
We constantly innovate our sales and marketing methods to customers and invest in IT to deliver strong sales rates.
We have strong, well-recognised brands – Barratt Homes, David Wilson Homes and Barratt London that have carefully defined market positions.
We focus on maintaining the very highest levels of quality seeking to understand customer needs and provide a first class customer experience.
We are the only national housebuilder to achieve 5 Star HBF rating for customer satisfaction for seven consecutive years.

      This performance is particularly impressive, given it accompanies our industry-leading quality and customer service standards.
John Allan
Chairman
   A year of strong performance
This has been another year of excellent progress for the Group, with a strong financial and operational performance. We have grown completion volumes in a disciplined way, significantly grown profit and continued our delivery of industry leading build quality and customer service.
Whilst the outcome of the EU referendum has increased levels of economic and political uncertainty, the Group is in a strong position, with a substantial year end net cash balance, healthy forward sales position and an experienced management team. The Board will continue to monitor the market and economy and take appropriate action where necessary. The wider market for new homes remains healthy across Britain, with a long term undersupply of new homes, strong government support
to the sector and a liquid mortgage market.
Consequently, we remain confident in the strong fundamentals of the housing sector and our business.

Capital Return Plan
over three years ending November 2017 based on consensus earnings
Operationally, we have delivered our highest completion volumes for eight years, increasing completions by 5.3% to 17,319 homes,
a performance that highlights the reliability and delivery capability of our housebuilding operations. This performance is particularly impressive, given it accompanies our industry-leading quality and customer
service standards.
As a result of this excellent operating performance, we were able to increase profit before tax by 20.7% and we ended the year with a net cash balance of £592.0m.
The Group’s fast asset turn model, supported by a relatively short consented land bank, the use of deferred payment terms, high levels
of standard products and the ability to sell through both Barratt and David Wilson Homes on larger sites, ensures a focus on driving return on capital employed. We made further progress in the year, driving return on capital employed up to 27.1%, an increase of 3.2 percentage points.
Investing in land
The land market remained attractive throughout FY16 in terms of land availability at acceptable prices and we have secured excellent development opportunities that meet or exceed our minimum hurdle rates of 20% gross margin and 25% site ROCE. In the year we approved £1,095.6m of operational land
for purchase, which we expect to equate to 24,387 plots. Our long term targets for land are to hold 3.5 years of owned and consented land and a further 1.0 year of controlled land. This strong performance helped us to end the year with 3.4 years of owned and consented land and a further 1.1 year of controlled land: 4.5 years in total (2015: 4.5 years).
During the year we have also made good progress in securing a longer term pipeline of land through strategic options.

 Housing policy
The UK Government continues to recognise the need to see more homes built across
the country as evidenced by its policies to improve land availability, planning and support for buyers.
By increasing the number of homes that we are building, in a disciplined way, we are not only playing our part in reducing the housing shortage but are also generating significant economic activity, creating jobs and enhancing communities. During the year we estimate that we supported over 55,000 jobs either directly, indirectly or induced.
Delivering returns for our shareholders
Our dividend plan was announced in September 2014 and aimed to deliver attractive future cash returns through an ordinary dividend of one-third of earnings and
Paid to dateB
Proposed payment
November 2016
Year to November 2017
a special dividend, over three years, of £400m in aggregate.
As a result, the Board is pleased to propose
a final dividend of 12.3 pence per share
(2015: 10.3 pence per share). Under our Capital Return Plan, special dividends are proposed in addition to ordinary dividends with the second special dividend of £125.0m to be paid in November 2016, which equates to 12.4 pence per share.
The total proposed capital return for the year is therefore 30.7 pence per share (2015: 25.1 pence per share).
Our employees
The outstanding progress made during the year would not have been possible without the capability and dedication of our employees whom I would like to thank on behalf of the Board for their contribution.
We are delighted that our site managers were awarded 79 NHBC Pride in the Job Awards. This is the 12th year in succession that we have secured more Pride in the Job Awards than any other housebuilder.
We are also very pleased that we have maintained the Home Builders Federation maximum five star rating for the seventh consecutive year, indicating that 90% of our homeowners would recommend us to a friend. This is a fantastic achievement and reflects the strength of our sales and customer service teams.
The Board
During the year there have been a number of significant changes to the Board.
David Thomas, who joined us as Group Finance Director in 2009, succeeded Mark Clare as Chief Executive on 1 July 2015.
Neil Cooper joined the Board on 23 November 2015 as Chief Financial Officer. Neil was previously Group Finance Director of William Hill PLC and was Group Finance Director of Bovis Homes Group PLC from 2007 until 2010.
After eight years’ distinguished service to the Board, Mark Rolfe will step down from his position as a Non-Executive Director of the Company with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM to be held in November 2016. Mark will also stand down as the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee on the same date.
Richard Akers will replace Mark Rolfe
as the Senior Independent Director with effectfromtheconclusionoftheGroup’s AGM in November 2016. Richard has been a Non-Executive Director of the Group since2012andisalsoChairmanofthe Remuneration Committee.

 Key aspects of our market
 The market for new homes was generally strong in FY16, with the housing market as a whole being characterised by continued demand and undersupply.

The UK economy and housing market
The UK economy continued to grow in
the 12 months to 30 June 2016, with most economic indicators showing improvements on the prior year.
The UK housing market has continued to show strength with UK residential housing transactions for the year to 30 June 2016 increasing by 8% on the prior year to
1.3 million transactions (source: HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’)3).
The London market saw growth in transaction volumes based on an extrapolation of data from the Land Registry, although transactions at the higher end have seen a number of negative sentiment impacts, including stamp- duty hikes.
The market for new homes remains strong across Britain with the housing market as a whole being characterised by continued demand and undersupply.
Housing supply
The supply of new housing has increased slightly, with 144,290 new housing starts in the year to 30 June 2016 in England, an increase of 2% on the prior year (source: Department for Communities and Local Government (‘DCLG’)), although housing completions were up 6% on the previous year to 139,030 (2015: 131,510)1. Whilst this represents a positive move, new housing starts remain over 35,000 lower
than the pre-downturn peak and significantly lower than that required to meet demand. DCLG projects that 210,000 homes need to be built in England, per year, through the period 2014 – 2039.

 Other Information
 Obtaining planning permission continues to be a constraint for new build developments. A number of amendments have been made to the planning system in recent years, with an increase of 9% in planning approvals to 292,089 in the year to March 2016 across Great Britain (source: HBF4).
Help to Buy and mortgage availability
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) continues to be an important enabler for new housebuilding, supporting 81,014 purchases in England from the scheme’s inception in April 2013 until March 2016, with 81% of purchasers using
the scheme being first time buyers (source: DCLG). However, the scheme has had a limited impact on the wider housing market in the
UK as it represented only 2.6%5 of HMRC residential housing transactions in England for the same period.
Average quoted household interest rates remain at affordable levels and mortgage transaction volumes increased over the last year. The number of mortgage approvals
for house purchases rose by 11% to 836,082 approvals in the year to 30 June 2016 and
the value of mortgage approvals for house purchases rose by 17% to £146,126m (source: Bank of England6).
House prices
The shortfall in the supply of housing stock and a continued availability of mortgage finance
at low interest rates meant that house prices rose in the year. The ONS7 house price index rose by an average of 8.7% per annum across the UK in the year to June 2016. The increase was particularly marked in the East, London and the South East of England, where the ONS house price index rose by 14.3%, 12.6% and 12.3% respectively in the year to June 2016. The lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices increased by 1.5% over the year. According to the Halifax, the UK average house price in June 2016 was £216,823, which was £17,376 higher than at June 2015.
Housing outlook
The underlying demand for new housing is expected to remain strong as supply is unlikely to meet demand in the medium term. We are committed to do our part to help address the existing undersupply in the market.
The Government is committed to increasing the supply of new homes, we have greater clarity on housing policy, and in particular believe the extension of the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme through to 2021 in England will support an increase in new housing supply.
Following the EU referendum, we are mindful that the immediate outlook for the UK economy is less clear. Risks lie around the short term impact on buyer sentiment and any longer term negative impact on the wider economy. Offsetting this we have seen positive changes in mortgage interest rates following the vote. In the round, it is too early to say what the impact of the uncertainty facing our industry will be.

Our businesses
Our improved financial results have been driven by a strong and disciplined operational performance in both our housebuilding
and commercial developments businesses.
Housebuilding
Housebuilding results
We saw good consumer demand across
our regions throughout our financial year, with some slowdown in the higher value London market. Throughout the year, the mortgage market remained positive, with increased competition amongst lenders
and new market entrants resulting in good availability of attractive mortgage finance for our customers.
The sales rate in the year was 0.69 (2015: 0.64) net private reservations per active outlet per week, with a sales rate in the second half of 0.72 (2015: 0.70) net private reservations per active outlet per week. During the year, we operated from an average of 365 active outlets (2015: 380).
In London, we have seen strong demand at price points up to £600,000, reflecting the benefit of the increase in the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) qualifying value limit to 40% in London. Above this price point, sales rates have slowed.
We delivered our highest completion volumes for eight years, being 17,319 units including JV’s (2015: 16,447). Private completions increased by 3.5% to 13,198 (2015: 12,746), affordable completions were 2,707
(2015: 2,853), and JV completions in which the Group had an interest were 1,414 (2015: 848).
We continue to increase the proportion of completions that are on more recently acquired higher margin land and these accounted for 86% (2015: 76%) of the total in the year.

 Our total average selling price (‘ASP’) increased by 10.5% to £259,700
(2015: £235,000) in the financial year with our private average selling price increasing by 10.4% to £289,800 (2015: £262,500).
The year on year increase predominately reflects mix changes, with the average size
of total completions rising by 4.6% from
1,013 to 1,060 sq ft and with the selling price per square foot benefiting from locational improvement and underlying house price inflation. Affordable average selling price increased by 0.8% to £113,200 (2015: £112,300) reflecting changes in mix, with affordable completions representing 17% (2015: 18%)
of total completions.
Our JV’s have performed well and our
share of profits from JV’s in the year for the housebuilding business increased to £72.2m (2015: £45.6m). As at 30 June 2016 we were selling from 11 (2015: 16) JV outlets. We expect our share of profits from JV's to be around £45m in FY17.
Housing policy
The UK Government recognises the need for more new homes to be built, given ongoing levels of household formation and historical undersupply, as evidenced by its policies to improve land availability, planning and support for buyers. In this regard, we noted in July this year the publication of the most recent DCLG publication updating household formation
rate projections for England: now estimated at 210,000 per year through the period 2014-2039.
We were also pleased to see the extension
of the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) programme
in England through to 2021, as well as the increase in February 2016 of the Government’s equity loan to 40% in London. Help to Buy (Equity Loan) provides support on house purchases up to £600,000 in England with equivalent support at lower house values in Scotland and Wales. Our customers, especially
first time buyers, have found this a very attractive proposition with 32% (2015: 31%) of our total completions using the scheme during the year. In FY16, 95% of the private homes (including JV’s) that we completed had a selling price below £600,000. In FY17 we expect this to be around 93%, reflecting our forecast London mix.
Increasing our housing supply
With housing demand remaining strong, we have continued to invest, in a disciplined way, to increase housing production, with over £4.8bn approved for the purchase of over 93,400 plots of land over the last five years. There remains a long term housing shortage of all tenures that can only be addressed through additional supply; we are committed to playing a leading role in addressing this issue without compromising our operational or financial strength.
Over the last five years we have built more than 75,000 homes (including JV’s) of which over 13,600 were affordable homes (including JV’s) sold to registered providers and we have invested in our employees, including in FY16 268 new apprentices, trainees, graduates and undergraduates to further expand our skilled workforce, enabling further delivery of supply.
The key dimensions underpinning delivery of our strategy
In addition to the generally favourable market conditions during the year, the increase in our housebuilding profitability has benefited from our successful land investment strategy and from improvements in operating margin.

Approved land purchases (2015: £957m)
Land and planning
A key enabler of the growth of our housebuilding business in recent years has been our land investment strategy, which has boosted absolute profit and led to increased completion volumes.
The land market remained attractive throughout the financial year and we secured excellent opportunities that meet or exceed our minimum hurdle rates of 20% gross margin and 25% site ROCE1.
In the period, we approved the purchase of £1,095.6m (2015: £957.0m) of land, equating to 130 sites (2015: 114 sites) and 24,387 plots (2015: 16,956 plots).
We continue, under normal market conditions, to target a regionally balanced land portfolio with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years
and a further c. 1.0 year of controlled land. Our target for a shorter than sector average land bank reflects our focus on ROCE and a rapid asset turn. At 30 June 2016 we achieved this target with a 4.5 years land supply (excluding JV’s) comprising 3.4 years owned land and 1.1 years controlled land, with the owned land bank including land with both outline and detailed planning consents.
Following our success with planning over the past 12 months we are very well positioned, with 99.7% of expected FY17 completions (2015: 100% of FY16 completions) having outline or full planning consent.
1 SiteROCEonlandacquisitioniscalculatedassiteoperatingprofit (site trading profit less sales overheads less allocated administrative overheads) divided by average investment in site land, work in progress and equity share.
Improving efficiency and reducing costs
Improving the efficiency of our operations
and controlling costs continues to be
a high priority for the Group, as it will
further enhance margin. Efficiency can be improved through increasing throughput,
as we have done in the year, but we are also focused on improving efficiency through business simplification including further standardisation of our layouts and product range and through driving process efficiency across key aspects of our business, with wide- ranging reviews underway, for example in the areas of commercial, construction and sales and marketing.
We have a robust and carefully managed supply chain with 90% of the house build materials sourced by our centralised procurement function denominated in Sterling. We have effectively sourced the raw materials required to underpin our controlled volume growth and the cost of c. 75% of our centrally procured materials is now fixed until the end of FY17.
Whilst we have seen an increase in the supply of skilled sub-contractors over the past year, there remains an industry shortage in the UK, with increases in labour costs remaining the largest driver of overall build cost inflation. We are currently well placed with the necessary labour to meet our operational and quality requirements. We are also seeking
to increase efficiency through the use of timber frame on over 1,300 plots during FY17 and through the use of alternative offsite manufacturing options.
We expect that overall build cost inflation for FY17 will be c. 2-3%.
Commercial developments
Greater occupier confidence in the second half of calendar 2015, particularly from within the logistics sector, encouraged institutional funding back into the market enabling us
to enter into agreements to commit to over
1 million sq. ft. of speculative forward funded logistics buildings.
During the year we successfully secured
a planning permission for a Regional Distribution Centre on a parcel of strategic land that we subsequently sold to a supermarket group. We also completed the final phase of our retail and leisure scheme at Hinckley. This final phase is 80% let and further transactions are in legals.
As we move forward we will continue to carefully manage our risk profile by seeking to secure forward commitments; accordingly our activity levels are very much determined by securing occupiers up front, which in turn is governed to a large extent by sentiment and occupier confidence.
Commercial development revenue was £81.9m (2015: £57.2m) with an operating profit of £6.0m (2015: £6.1m).

 Chief Executive’s statement continued
     Aspect is a new development in Anlaby, East Yorkshire, with a fabulous selection of luxury 3, 4 and 5 bedroom homes in
a highly desirable village.
Going forward our commercial division will continue to work closely with our housebuilding business to develop mixed- use schemes, and will seek to develop independent commercial schemes where they can be forward funded by third parties prior to commencement.
Our strategic objectives
Our strategic objectives remain clear – maintain disciplined growth, improve our key financial metrics and continue to deliver attractive cash returns.
Our key financial metrics
Our gross margin was broadly flat at 18.9% (2015: 19.0%) with an improvement in margin arising from the reduction in the mix of legacy assets, offset by adverse business mix and other net impacts. Operating margin grew
by 0.5 ppts, from 15.3% to 15.8%, reflecting improved overhead leverage levels and an absolute fall in net administrative expenses.
We have made further good progress against our ROCE objective in the year with ROCE increasing by 3.2 ppts to 27.1% (2015: 23.9%). This is benefiting from the absolute reduction in legacy assets: the disposal of £85.4m of loans arising from equity share programmes early in our second half for £82.9m of cash has contributed. We have also been successful
in driving business growth levels ahead of growth in working capital levels, reflecting our effective balance sheet discipline. It remains
a core part of our strategy to drive ROCE performance further, in line with our fast asset turn model.
We remain committed to delivering our FY17 targets of at least 20% gross margin and at least 25% ROCE.
Maintaining an appropriate capital structure
As at 30 June 2016 the Group had a net cash balance of £592.0m (2015: £186.5m), reflecting a strong financial year. This was ahead of expectations, partly driven by our completion volumes and the timing of land payments.
We also benefited from timings of other working capital payments.
We seek to defer payment for new land where possible to drive a higher ROCE, and land creditors as at 30 June 2016 were 38% of the owned land bank (30 June 2015: 35%).
The Group continues to maintain a balanced capital structure with land and long term work in progress funded by shareholders’ funds and land creditors. Net tangible assets were £3,118m (£3.11 per share) of which land net of land creditors and work in progress totalled £3,180m (£3.17 per share).
We continue to secure attractive deferred payment terms on land and expect land creditors as a proportion of the owned land bank to be around one-third at 30 June 2017, in line with our operating framework.
Dividend
Our strong financial performance supports the Group’s Capital Return Plan and dividend policy. We are delighted to propose a final dividend of 12.3 pence per share (2015: 10.3 pence per share) resulting in a total ordinary dividend for the year up 21% to 18.3 pence per share (2015: 15.1 pence per share) and the second of our special dividends totalling £125m, equivalent to 12.4 pence per share, payable in November 2016. This reflects
our ordinary dividend policy of the dividend being covered three times by earnings, supplemented by the special dividends to November 2017 totalling £400m.
Health and safety
We were deeply saddened that two employees of our sub-contractors lost their lives in separate incidents on two of our sites during the year. Both of these incidents have been thoroughly investigated by our internal health and safety (SHE) team. We are fully co-operating with the Health and Safety Executive during their ongoing investigations into each of
the incidents.
Increased activity levels across the industry in terms of site openings and production volumes combined with shortages of skilled staff has contributed to an increased risk of accidents on sites. We remain fully committed to the highest standards of health and safety upon our sites. In the year, our reportable incident rate has increased slightly with 385 (2015: 381) reportable incidents per 100,000 employees.

 Our priorities
We believe that a strongly performing business benefits from a focus on its wider priorities which for us are: Customer First, Great Places, Leading Construction and Investing in our People. Each of these priorities has a work plan to drive improvements across the business and they are supported by a set of principles and financial discipline which underpins all of our operations.
         Customer first
We place customers at the heart of our
business by building outstanding homes and anticipating the changing needs of home buyers.
We are the only major national housebuilder to achieve the HBF 5 Star Customer Satisfaction rating for seven consecutive years, with over 90% of customers being prepared to recommend us to a friend.
We continue to improve the quality and efficiency of the way in which we deal with customers through the sales process.
During the period we invested in our customer service systems to speed up and improve the efficiency of our service.
We worked with suppliers, customers and industry experts to produce the ‘Future Home Report’ to inform design direction in terms
of customer trends and preferences. As well as carefully defining customer segments and their design preferences, our project with The Architects’ Journal to select new house design features to meet these requirements concluded in the year.
Great places
A key focus of our business continues to be
building relationships with landowners to ensure that we can acquire the right land
and then create outstanding places to live. Our objective is to be the partner of choice for landowners by demonstrating our ability to achieve planning permission and create value.
During the period we made significant progress in terms of securing the right operational land and increased investment in longer term strategic sites.
We continue to focus upon design and all of our developments are reviewed against our ‘Great Places’ design standard at the pre-application stage. ‘Great Places’ enables us to meet Building For Life 12, the industry standard for the design of new housing developments.
Leading construction We continue to be focused on a ‘right
first time’ approach as the most efficient way of operating across all aspects of our building processes with a continuous focus on improving build quality which will reduce remedial costs and improve customer satisfaction.
We are implementing a number of key initiatives in terms of increasing construction efficiency, for example we have built 988 timber frame homes in FY16.
Our site managers continue to lead the industry and in 2016 we won 79 NHBC Pride in the Job Awards. This was the 12th year in succession that our site managers have won more of these awards than any other housebuilder.
Investing in our people The building and construction industry
continues to face a shortage of skilled workers and attracting and retaining the best people is an important priority for the business. We aim to have a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate, delivering excellence for our customers and business
by drawing on a broad range of talents, skills and experience.
We have continued with our graduate and apprentice programmes, with 268 employees joining us on these programmes in this period.
We also continue to support the wider industry focus on addressing the skills shortage.

Regionally, trading conditions in the North and Midlands have been stronger than those seen in the South.
Our total forward sales (including JV’s) as at 4 September 2016 were up 4.1% on the strong prior year figures at a value of £2,416.5m (6 September 2015: £2,321.9m), equating to 11,364 plots

Outlook
We have started the new financial year in a good position, with £592.0m year end net cash, a healthy forward order position and an experienced management team in place. We have industry leading quality and customer service, and talented employees. There remains an undersupply of new homes, strong government support including Help to Buy (Equity Loan), and a mortgage market willing to lend. As a result, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of both the housing sector and our business.
Our sales trends since the start of the new financial year have been encouraging, and underpin an increasingly ‘business-as-usual’ stance whilst we continue to monitor consumer, economic and other lead indicators closely following the EU referendum vote.
I am proud to lead our first class team and we are all determined to build on this year’s outstanding operational and financial performance in the future, as well as delivering on our targets for key financial metrics and our capital return plans in FY17.

The challenge
Britain needs more homes to address its housing shortage, with continued demand in the market and continued undersupply of new homes. Home buyers are supported by a good mortgage market in terms of both availability and rates, as well as the Government’s Help to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme in England, Scotland and Wales.
The industry is seeking to increase volumes, maintain customer satisfaction and build quality and at the same time address the constraint created
by a shortage of skilled people.

   2,707
We delivered 2,707 (2015: 2,853) affordable homes built
for registered providers
Affordability of homes and accessibility to home ownership
We build a wide range of product, from homes for first time buyers to larger family homes. Our private average selling price for the year was £289,800 (2015: £262,500); £275,000 (2015: £246,800) outside of London.
During the year, the mortgage market remained positive. Our customers have access to mortgage finance that allows them to buy with a 5% deposit through the Help
to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme and there is also a range of higher loan to value products which do not use the Help to Buy scheme available. We continue to work with a broad set of lenders through our approved brokers to ensure that our customers have access to independent advice and a wide range of mortgage products.
We delivered 2,707 (2015: 2,853) affordable homes built for registered providers, equating to 17% (2015: 18%) of our total completions (excluding JV’s) in the year. We have a team which engages with housing association partners at local, regional and national levels.

 Customer satisfaction
We place customers at the heart of everything we do, with their satisfaction being a key performance indicator at all levels of management. All of our team are responsible for delivering customer satisfaction and
we operate a Customer Service Academy comprising both classroom and online training to ensure that our employees understand how to deliver right first time, every time.
We are pleased that we have increased our completions delivery, including JV’s, by 5.3% during the year whilst retaining our HBF 5 Star status for the seventh successive year, the only national housebuilder to do so. We regularly review the results from the NHBC customer survey with the insights gained being used to aid our decision making.
We continue to drive customer service, investing in technology from developments to our customer service systems and our onsite systems to aid our quality control inspections. Each home we build is repeatedly inspected at key stages and, as a minimum, is approved by the site manager, contracts manager and sales staff before handover to our customers. Management throughout the business are responsible for customer service and monitor customer satisfaction survey performance on a weekly basis.
Increasing customer insight
To ensure that we continuously reflect our customers’ needs we have worked with suppliers, customers and industry experts

Securing the best land
We continue to see high quality land opportunities that at least meet our required hurdle rates of a gross margin of 20% and
a site ROCE of 25%1.
Our success in buying land is based on the extensive local knowledge of our divisional land teams and strong local relationships with land owners, combined with detailed assessments of local market conditions. We target locations based on the availability of land, housing market conditions and the likelihood of obtaining planning consent.
We continue, under normal market conditions, to target a regionally balanced land portfolio with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years
and a further c. 1.0 year of controlled land. Our target is for a shorter than sector average land bank reflecting our focus on ROCE
and a rapid asset turn. At 30 June 2016 we achieved this target with a 4.5 year land supply (excluding JV’s) comprising 3.4 years owned land and 1.1 years controlled land, with the owned land bank including land with both outline and detailed planning consents.

 Our land bank
The transformation of our land bank from older, lower margin land to more recently acquired higher margin land is well progressed. As at 30 June 2016, 93% (30 June 2015: 90%) of our owned and controlled land is higher margin, newer land. On the 232 sites that we have acquired and completed since 2009 we have achieved an average site gross margin of 20.9%, and an average site ROCE
of 37.0%, demonstrating sustained delivery above our hurdle rates on this more recently acquired land.
Whilst maintaining a first class operational land bank, we remain focused on securing
a longer term land pipeline through the acquisition of strategic land options. In the year 4,558 plots (2015: 5,239 plots) were transferred from strategic land to our owned land bank and 22% of our completions (2015: 17%) during the year were on strategically sourced land. We remain on track to deliver our target of
c. 25% of completions to be delivered from strategic land.
We use land creditors to defer payments for land acquisition where possible to drive a higher ROCE and as at 30 June 2016, the land creditor position totalled £1,086.8m (30 June 2015: £999.0m) representing 38% (30 June 2015: 35%) of the owned land bank. We are targeting land creditors at around one-third of the owned land bank for FY17.
Effective planning permission
Bringing land through the planning system quickly and into production is important to support our business objectives. We support the work the Government is currently doing to speed up the planning process, in particular
in relation to quicker resolution of planning conditions which can hold up prompt progress. A faster planning process will enable housing supply to increase faster.
We have maintained good momentum in achieving planning consents, and during the year we secured planning on 20,249 plots (2015: 17,092 plots). We now have full or outline planning permission in place for 99.7% of our expected completions in FY17 and 94.2% of expected production in FY18.
Designing great places
Designing great places is fundamental to
our business: our customers want to live
in great places; the vendors of the land we purchase want to work with developers who leave behind a legacy of design quality; and local people want developments that enhance their communities.
We are focused upon ‘placemaking’ throughout our business and use our internal ‘Great Places’ design standards, assessing every development against these at the pre- application stage. Our ‘Great Places’ design standards are aligned to the requirements of Building for Life, and we run annual awards
to recognise our best developments. We also review our development layouts to ensure they achieve both design quality and efficient land use, and have an internal urban design team to provide specialist expertise.

Delivering high quality homes
We put customer satisfaction at the heart of our construction processes with a focus upon getting it right first time, which also drives operating efficiencies in the build process. Our site managers continue to lead the industry, winning 79 NHBC Pride in the Job Awards. This is the 12th consecutive year that we have won more of these awards than any other housebuilder.
Partnering with our supply chain
We have a centralised procurement team which has built long term relationships with our suppliers. This ensures the consistency
of specification and technical performance of the materials used in our homes. Long term relationships have enabled us to ensure the continuous availability of materials as demand increased. We also use many local sub- contractors in the construction of our homes, who our divisions partner with at a local level to ensure the availability of the skilled trades that we require.
We engage in continuous communication with our suppliers and hold regular performance and business reviews, training days and an annual supplier conference. We are a signatory of the Prompt Payment Code.
We purchase substantial amounts of timber and have implemented a sustainable procurement and timber sourcing policy. Since December 2013, all timber and
timber products that we purchase via group agreements are FSC/PEFC certified and originate from well managed forestry sources. Further information is available in the Sustainability Report for 2016.

 Innovating to improve efficiency
The majority of our homes are built with traditional brick and block construction, although we are increasing the use of timber frame on some of our sites and have built 988 homes using this method during FY16. We have also completed a successful small scale trial of Light Gauge Steel Frames which are lighter, safer and quicker to put together than traditional construction methods.
In addition, as the parts are manufactured offsite, the level of waste generation is reduced. We will be undertaking a larger scale trial of this technology in FY17.
Another offsite technology that we have successfully trialled, in FY16, is the use of prefabricated utility cupboards, with pre- installed features such as boilers, storage tanks and heating controls. These take 1-2 hours to install rather than a whole day, enabling us to make better use of skilled tradespeople and increase build speed.
We have engaged with our suppliers to find, understand and consider innovative products and services including foundation systems, roofing and mechanical and electrical solutions.
We are also researching smart technologies and their use in future homes to improve
the ability of customers to save energy and have undertaken divisional pilots of smart thermostats, which give customers the ability to remotely control their heating systems.
We will be extending their availability to customers in FY17.

Together with other housebuilders we are working with the HBF, the Construction Industry Training Board and schools, universities and the West Midlands University Technical College ('UTC') upon targeted projects to help address the industry-wide skills shortage.
Employee retention
During the year employee turnover reduced by 2% to 17% (2015: 19%) reflecting our focus in this area. However, there is significant demand and many opportunities for skilled employees elsewhere in the industry. We therefore continue to focus upon developing talent within our business, including succession planning, to ensure that we have the necessary skills within our business for continued operational delivery as well as focusing on remuneration and benefits to ensure retention measures are in place and effective.

Keeping people safe
The challenge and our response
Increased activity levels across the industry in terms of site openings and production volumes combined with shortages of skilled staff has contributed to an increased risk of accidents on sites. We seek to maintain stringent safety standards and have a continuous focus on health and safety. Getting the basics right, good leadership, and commitment to health and safety from all levels of management
is what delivers good health and safety performance in our business.
Our Safety, Health and Environmental management system (‘SHE’) is subject to continuous review and improvement. All of our trading divisions are certified to OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems) and adhere to our SHE guidelines with their ongoing compliance being verified by a programme of internal and external audits. During the year, we carried out 6,184 (2015: 6,269) monitoring visits and achieved an average compliance rate of 96% (2015: 96%). We also maintained our 5 Star rating from
the British Safety Council for the second year in succession.
Our overall aim is to have an injury free working environment, and whilst we believe that all injuries are avoidable, our objective
for the year was to have an improvement in
our reportable Injury Incidence Rate (‘IIR’). During the year, our IIR increased slightly to 385 (2015: 381) per 100,000 persons employed (including sub-contractors). We have continued to operate our 5 Steps to Safety Campaign and during the year have reviewed and restructured our health and safety training strategy for employees at all levels within
our business, in order to continue to seek to improve our performance.
Our site managers have again been successful at the NHBC Health and Safety Awards, achieving more awards than any other housebuilder, with nine commendations
and five going on to receive the highly commended status.
We were deeply saddened that two employees of our sub-contractors lost their lives in separate incidents on two of our sites during the year. Both of these incidents have been thoroughly investigated by our internal
health and safety (SHE) team. We are fully co-operating with the Health and Safety Executive during their ongoing investigations into each of the incidents.

We continue to work with private landowners, operators and agents to identify and bring forward land for development. Divisional land teams continue to work hard to try and ensure we are regarded as the housebuilder of choice by the local landowners and
agency community.
Our suppliers and sub-contractors are critical to the delivery of our strategic objectives and we invest in our relationships with them. We hold a national supply chain conference and regular review meetings with our suppliers and seek to develop long term business relationships.

  Building strong community relationships
 The challenge and our response
Housebuilding has a direct impact upon local communities. It is therefore important that they are engaged in the creation process and that our development creates a positive legacy.
As a Group we contribute social and economic benefits to the communities in which we are working, which are far-reaching and long- lasting. By building more homes we are generating substantial amounts of economic activity and we estimate that during the
year we supported over 55,000 jobs either directly, indirectly or induced. The homes we build for new communities are high quality: for example, the average size of new private homes sold in the year by Barratt was 1,114 sq ft, 12% larger than the average UK home1.

Children from Allington Primary School visit The Orchards development to find out just what it takes to design and plan a community of new homes.
We work closely with local planning authorities to negotiate and deliver or fund social infrastructure such as highways and public transport improvements, new schools and school places, sports facilities and medical centres.
Engagement with local communities to seek to address any impact that our developments may have on the environment is also important. By holding public consultations, we invite stakeholders to talk to our specialist planners and architects about their concerns and aspirations for our developments.
We believe that a genuinely collaborative approach will deliver more land and housing and in this regard 62% (2015: 54%) of our active developments have held a public consultation.
We continue to support and promote a wide range of charitable giving and community volunteering initiatives with each division focusing on the charitable activities that best reflect the needs of their local community and the issues that impact upon their employees. We have launched a Charity of the Year Scheme, where we match every pound raised for each division’s charity of the year up to a set maximum. Our employees have raised £603,776 for charity this year, including £46,402 donated by Barratt through the Charity of the Year Scheme. In addition we have launched a volunteering policy whereby every employee can take one day’s paid leave to volunteer for a charity of their choice.

  Safeguarding the environment
 The challenge and our response
As the demand for new housing increases, we recognise the need for our business to become more resource and energy efficient and to produce less waste and generate fewer carbon emissions. All of our divisions are certified to ISO 14001, the environmental management standard.
Designing out construction waste
During the year, we have been focusing upon waste elimination and seeking to significantly reduce both waste tonnage and costs, rather than increasing recycling rates.
A key to waste reduction is designing waste out and one area where we have been successful is plasterboard. We engaged with other members of our industry and worked with our supplier to re-size plasterboard to meet the requirements of modern builds. This means that 100mm no longer needs to be cut off every plasterboard section, which reduces
our costs, and is expected to cut our waste by 1,300 tonnes each year.
We segregate waste for recycling as standard across our sites and have achieved a recycling rate of 95% (2015: 95%) for the year.
Being energy efficient and reducing emissions
Our direct and indirect operational greenhouse gas emissions are shown in the table below. This is based on the energy used in our
offices, on our live developments and for business travel.
 Our principle
We strive to minimise the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain, which increases the energy and resource efficiency of our homes. We seek to enhance habitats, biodiversity and local environments across all

  Ensuring the financial health of our business
 Our performance
Our strategic objectives remain to maintain disciplined growth, deliver on our targets for key financial metrics and continue to deliver attractive cash returns.
We have made significant progress on these objectives during the year, achieving a 5.3% growth in completion volumes, a 20.7% increase in profit before tax, a 3.2 ppt improvement
in ROCE to 27.1% and are proposing a 22.3% increase in total dividend per share, including special dividend, to 30.7 pence per share for the financial year.
Profit for the year
The improved performance in our housebuilding business resulted in an operating profit of £668.4m (2015: £576.8m) at an operating margin of 15.8% (2015: 15.3%).
The finance charge for the year was £58.2m (2015: £57.0m), consisting of a cash finance charge of £24.1m (2015: £27.4m) and £34.1m (2015: £29.6m) of non-cash charges: the main component of the non-cash charge relates
to the unwind of the discount factor from deferred term land creditors.
Profit before tax for the year was £682.3m (2015: £565.5m), the highest profit the Group has ever achieved. The increase of £116.8m was driven by increased completion volumes, growth in average selling prices, an increased contribution from joint ventures and from an increase in sundry income.
The tax charge for the year was £132.0m (2015: £115.2m) at an effective tax rate of 19.3% (2015: 20.4%). The rate of tax assessed for the year is slightly below the standard effective rate of corporation tax of 20.0% (2015: 20.75%) mainly due to land remediation relief and the tax rate reduction on deferred tax.
Profit after tax for the year was £550.3m (2015: £450.3m), resulting in a basic earnings per share of 55.1p (2015: 45.5p).
Return on capital employed
The Group’s fast asset turn model, supported by a relatively short consented land bank, deferred payment terms, high levels of standard product, and the ability to sell through our David Wilson Homes and Barratt brands on larger sites, is focused on driving ROCE.
For FY16 ROCE increased by 3.2 ppts to 27.1% (2015: 23.9%). This growth benefited from reductions in legacy assets following the disposal of £85.4m of our available for sale assets in the second half of 2016 together with rates of profit growth running ahead of working capital growth rates.
Net cash and capital structure
We maintain an appropriate capital structure, with land and long term work in progress funded by shareholders’ funds and land creditors, and with net cash at our year
end. During the year we generated £652.9m (2015: £184.0m) of cash inflow from operating activities and £12.7m of cash inflow from investing activities. This was in part applied to £268.0m of financing activities: of which £263.2m related to dividends paid during the year. Together with opening cash of £360.4m, the Group’s net cash increase in the year
of £397.6m led to closing cash of £758.0m
and net cash at 30 June 2016 of £592.0m (2015: £186.5m). At 30 June 2016 land creditors were 38% (2015: 35%) of the owned land bank.
The factors behind the strong growth in cash inflow from operating activities include increased profit from operations, £82.9m of cash inflow from the disposal of the bulk of our available for sale assets and favourable movements in trade and other payables.
As we make scheduled payments on agreed new land and build work in progress to deliver spring 2017 completions, we expect net cash at 31 December 2016 to be in line with normal seasonal trends (31 December 2015: £24.2m). It remains our objective for FY17 to maintain an appropriate capital structure with year end net cash and land creditors at around one-third
of the owned land bank.
Capital Return Plan
The Board proposes to pay a final ordinary dividend of 12.3 pence (2015: 10.3 pence)
per share for the financial year ended
30 June 2016, which subject to shareholder approval, will be paid on 21 November 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 28 October 2016. Together with the interim ordinary dividend of 6.0 pence per share, which was paid in the year, this gives
a total ordinary dividend for the year of 18.3 pence per share (2015: 15.1 pence per share). The ordinary dividend was covered around three times by basic earnings per share.
Under the special cash payment programme the Board is proposing a payment of £125.0m (12.4 pence per share), which subject to shareholder approval, will be paid by way
of a special dividend on 21 November 2016
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 28 October 2016. The Board anticipates a further payment of £175.0m to be proposed with our FY17 results payable in November 2017.
In total, the Capital Return Plan is expected to return around £963m of cash through ordinary dividends (based on consensus earnings)
and special dividends to the Company’s shareholders over the three years ending November 2017.
 Our principle
Our people take individual responsibility appropriate to their level of seniority for driving the financial management and performance of the business. We maintain financial discipline across all aspects of our operations.

  Why and how our principal risks change
Principal risks probability
Whilst the Principal Risks for the Group related to the execution of its business strategy have not changed since 2015,
the likelihood of the risk factors occurring may have changed. The diagram on
this page shows the estimated residual likelihood of each risk following our risk mitigation strategies in both 2016 and 2015. The diagram does not consider the relative size of the associated financial
or reputational impacts for each Principal Risk item.
Risk management continued 2015
2016
   Managing risk – health and safety
 Maintaining high standards of health and safety
is an integral element of the Group’s principles and is the number one priority for all our business activities. We have implemented a detailed strategy for continuous improvement in this area which is supported by our well established policy and procedures.
The Group Board Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) Committee which is chaired by one of our Non-Executive Directors and attended by our Deputy Chief Executive, provides oversight and stewardship of our operational performance. (Refer to the SHE Committee report on page 74 for further information.)
The SHE Operations Committee reports directly to the SHE Board Committee and is responsible for implementing the overall SHE improvement strategy for the Group.
The Group employs an internal team of 23 SHE Managers who assist with operational compliance and monitor our sites at least once per month. They work independently of our operational Divisions and carry out over 6000 monitoring visits to our sites every year. They report on levels of compliance to operational management and an overview of the performance of each operational Division including reportable injuries and near misses, is provided on a monthly basis to our Group Board.
All our operational units are accredited to the international standard OHSAS 18001 and as part of the compliance process are audited internally each year by our in-house team and externally audited by our accreditation body Ocean Certification.
The Group has for the second year arranged
for the British Safety Council to carry out a comprehensive review of our management systems and associated arrangements. The audit model evaluates leadership at all levels of the business and continuous improvement which
are continually assessed throughout the audit process. The Group achieved a compliance score of 96% and was again awarded the highest five star status. This is an excellent achievement and reflects on our approach to health and safety management throughout the business.

    Viability Statement
 In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the prospects and financial viability of the Group, taking into account both its current position and circumstances, and the potential impact of its principal risks. The Directors consider that a three-year period is appropriate for this assessment.
The Group’s objective is for a shorter than sector average land bank reflecting its focus on return on capital and a rapid asset turn. Our target is a regionally balanced land portfolio with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years and a further 1.0 years of controlled land. Accordingly, we consider it appropriate that our viability review period is broadly aligned with the expected longevity of our owned land supply.
By using a three-year timeframe, the Viability Statement review period is also aligned with
the Group’s bottom up three-year planning and forecasting cycle, during which a wide range
of information relating to present and future business conditions is considered, including those impacting on expected profitability, cash flows, and funding requirements.
The Group is subject to a number of Principal Risks (as set out in more detail in pages 44 to 45), and its Viability Statement review considers the impact that these risks (particularly those related to the economy and to mortgage availability) might have on its ability to meet its targets. This is undertaken through the performance of sensitivity testing, using appropriately challenging scenarios which reflect severe but plausible impacts based on current market conditions and applying estimates for the impact of these risks to ensure that the quantified mitigation actions available to it are sufficient. This process involves consideration of the impact of our chosen scenarios on key business drivers, including the volume of legal completions achieved, average selling prices and build costs. Several scenarios are modelled to ensure that the Board can carefully evaluate the range of plausible outcomes being assessed and mitigation factors are based on those identified and successfully deployed during the previous downturn in 2007- 2008 following the ‘credit crisis’.
Based on this review, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities over this three-year period.
 No new principal risks have emerged during the financial year
  Increased risk profile
Why?
  A Economic environment, including housing demand and mortgage availability
D Attracting and retaining high-calibre employees
E Availability of raw materials, sub-contractors and suppliers
Following the vote to leave the European Union (‘EU’) in the recent referendum there is increased uncertainty within the UK economy and it is too early to say what the impact of this will be.
There is high competition for skilled employees within the housebuilding industry which has been driven by both the growth in industry volumes and the skills shortage within the industry.
A significant proportion of the skilled sub-contractors upon our sites are nationals of other EU countries. Following the vote to leave the EU in the recent referendum, it is too early to say what impact this will have upon the availability of sub-contractors.
Whilst the majority of our raw materials are sourced from UK suppliers, some such as timber, are sourced from outside the UK. In addition, some components contain materials sourced from outside the UK. The decrease in the value of the pound following the EU referendum may, subject to other factors such as demand, lead to an increase in the cost of these materials and components.
There has been an increased level of attempted cyber-attacks against the Group’s IT systems during the year.
The Group’s average debt decreased to £60.0m (2015: £271.3m) for the year, resulting in more headroom against the Group’s committed facilities.

C Liquidity
 J
  Decreased risk profile
  Why?
     Managing risk – Addressing the skills shortage
 We continue to invest in our people to ensure that they can maximise their potential, but we are equally focused on the need to attract new talent into our business to address the skills shortages in our industry.
For the medium to long term, we have our Future Talent strategy. Our annual intake of apprentices (trade and professions) and graduates continues. We have made good progress against our 2020 aspiration and have recruited over 900 graduates, trainees and apprentices including those that will join us in 2017. Numbers on our foundation degree in residential development and construction introduced three years ago continue to grow and last year we became patrons of the West Midlands Construction UTC. Providing mentors from
our West Midlands division and Group Support Centre. This is the first UTC to offer a construction curriculum and provide students with a work based mentor.
We have launched a schools career toolkit which includes six housebuilding activities linked to the school curriculum, a teachers’ and parents’ guide and a student guide to promote our professions. Many of our regionally based employees, including our Apprentice Champions, have visited schools and use the toolkit as a way of demonstrating the many careers within housebuilding. The toolkit educates young people on roles and careers advice and provides teachers with material to embed
and reference the industry within the curriculum. This is a completely new initiative for the industry and is intended as a resource for influencers (teachers, careers advisers, governors and parents) and students. The toolkit is intended to: challenge industry perceptions, misconceptions and stereotyping, promote the industry as a diverse organisation, challenge the underrepresentation
of females in the industry, address the lack of diversity in the workforce, challenge teacher / parent attitudes towards careers in construction.
This supports our diversity and inclusion programme which aims to attract talent from more diverse backgrounds.
In the short term we are actively seeking to
recruit talent from other industry backgrounds, and providing transitional training for a career in housebuilding. We have signed up to the Armed Forces Covenant and have launched a site manager transitional training programme for armed forces personnel which allows them to undertake a year’s transition programme whilst working as an Assistant Site Manager. We currently employ 28 armed forces personnel and plan to significantly grow this over the period ahead.
We advertise our vacancies on diversityjobs.co.uk and launched a profile page on thebigidea.co.uk which promotes us as an organisation from a diversity perspective. We have launched numerous programmes to help appeal to a wider audience
of potential recruits. For example, teaming up with RICS, CBRE and others on our ‘Built by Both’
campaign to attract young women professionals into careers in housebuilding; developing a housebuilding app game; and relaunching an enhanced recruitment website.
We are working closely with Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) through the Go Construct project, providing many case studies for them and the HBF which helps to improve the image of our sector as a career choice. This work also includes support to the House Building Skills Partnership which aims to provide new training and qualifications to more than 45,000 new entrants
to our sector.

            Changes in the UK and European macroeconomic environments, including but not limited to unemployment, flat
or negative economic growth, buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance particularly for higher loan to values including government backed schemes, interest rates, competitor pricing, falls in house prices or land values, may lead to a fall in the demand or price achieved for houses, which
in turn could result in impairments of
the Group’s inventories, goodwill and intangible assets.
The ability to secure sufficient consented land and strategic land options at appropriate cost and quality to provide profitable growth.
Unavailability of sufficient borrowing facilities to enable the servicing of liabilities (including pension funding) and the inability to refinance facilities as they fall due, obtain surety bonds, or comply with borrowing covenants. Furthermore, there are risks from management of working capital such as conditional contracts, build costs, joint ventures and the cash flows related to them.
Inability to recruit and/or retain employees with appropriate skill sets or sufficient numbers of such employees.
Shortages or increased costs of materials and skilled labour, the failure of a key supplier or the inability to secure supplies upon appropriate credit terms could increase costs and delay construction.

           The majority of our customers
require mortgages to purchase their new home. Buyer confidence, the availability of mortgages and mortgage interest rates are affected by the economic environment.
Securing more sites that at least meet our hurdle rates of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE will enable disciplined volume growth.
Availability of sufficient committed and surety facilities ensures that the Group can manage changes in the economic environment and take advantage of appropriate land buying and operational opportunities and deliver sustainable shareholder value.
Skilled employees are critical to deliver the Group’s strategy of disciplined growth, improving key financial metrics through a focus on efficiency and
the continued delivery of attractive cash returns.
Sufficient material and skilled sub- contractor availability will enable disciplined volume growth.

Failure to identify and achieve key construction milestones, due to factors including the impact of adverse weather conditions, the failure to identify
cost overruns promptly, design and construction defects, and exposure to environmental liabilities, which could delay construction, increase costs, reduce selling prices and result in litigation and uninsured losses. There are also risks associated with climate change and the use of new technology in the build process e.g. materials related to carbon reduction.
Large development projects, some of which involve joint ventures or consortia arrangements and/or commercial developments, are complex and capital intensive and changes may negatively impact upon cash flows or returns.
Health and safety or environmental breaches can result in injuries to employees, sub-contractors and site visitors, delays in construction or increased costs, reputational damage, criminal prosecution and civil litigation.
Failure of the Group’s IT systems (whether due to cyber-attacks or other causes) in particular those relating to surveying and valuation, could adversely impact the performance of the Group.

  Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present my second corporate governance report to you and to explain
how your Board has used the authority and trust you place in it to drive your Company forward as it strives to deliver sustainable shareholder value.
Now more than ever good corporate governance will play a key part in the long term success of any business. The UK’s decision to leave the EU has created great uncertainty, not only in the UK but more widely. Whilst I cannot predict what may happen in the future, I can assure you that we have a strong business led by an equally strong and talented Board. The Board is continually monitoring events and will make decisions based on firm facts to ensure that it exploits opportunities as they arise.
Good corporate governance is more than simply adhering to the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code: it is the basis
of good management practice. We are
focused on ensuring that good governance is embedded in our culture across disciplines and all areas of the business, in order to create a stable foundation upon which our business and long term success is built. The Board takes time to receive regular updates on changes in corporate governance and best practice and strives to adopt the spirit, in addition to the letter of the regulations or best practice provisions.
Together with overseeing a strong financial performance, the following key changes have been addressed by the Board during the year:
Board Changes
David Thomas took over as Chief Executive from Mark Clare on 1 July 2015 and retained the position of Group Finance Director
until Neil Cooper joined as Chief Financial Officer on 23 November 2015. David received support from the Board and from Mark Clare throughout his transition to Chief Executive. Information on the induction process for David and Neil can be found on page 58.
Mark Rolfe, after eight years of service, has decided to stand down after the 2016 AGM. Mark is a highly valued member of the Board and during his tenure has contributed greatly to the Company’s success.
We undertook a full and formal process to find a new Non-Executive Director (more information is available on page 64) and we are pleased to have secured the services of Jock Lennox. Jock joined the Board on
1 July 2016 and will take over as Chair of the Audit Committee following the 2016 AGM. His biography can be found on page 47 and details of his induction can be found on page 59.
      Good corporate governance is the foundation of effective management. We place governance at the heart of everything we do. It is embedded in our procedures and processes throughout our business from Board level to our divisional operations.

  Changes to Regulation
Numerous changes have taken place to the regulatory framework within which we operate. The Board took time to discuss and consider each of these in detail. Particular areas of focus were:
Long term viability statement
The Audit Committee robustly assessed
the internal control and principal risks of
the business on behalf of the Board. It also considered the period over which the viability of the Company should be assessed and analysed the outcome of the assessment
of long term viability over that timescale.
The results of this assessment can be seen on page 43 of the Strategic Report.
Modern Slavery Act
During the year, the Company assessed the effect of the Modern Slavery Act (‘MSA 2015’) on its processes, procedures and contracts
in addition to our relationships with suppliers and contractors. The Modern Slavery Act Statement as required by MSA 2015 is currently being prepared and will be published on our website, following approval by the Board, no later than 31 December 2016.
Market Abuse Regulation
The Board reviewed the impact of the Market Abuse Regulation including its treatment
of inside information; the relationship with our brokers and analysts; the obligations
of Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities; and the Company’s Share Dealing Code. Following its review and in accordance with best practice, the Board approved the establishment of a Disclosure Committee, adopted a revised Share Dealing Code and updated its procedures and processes to ensure the Company's compliance with the new regulations.
Auditor independence and non-audit fees policy
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed the policy on auditor independence and non- audit fees to take into account the prescribed prohibited non-audit services with effect
from June 2016. A cap on fees for permissible non-audit services of 70% (based on the average of the previous three years of audit fees) has been imposed and will be effective from the year commencing 1 July 2019. Further information is contained on page 72.
FY17
Our areas of focus during FY17, amongst other matters, will be:
> to continually assess the impact on the business of the decision to leave the EU and flex our strategy accordingly;
> to assess and fully comply with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2016;
> to implement the recommendations arising from the 2016 externally facilitated Board effectiveness review (see page 56); and
> to conduct a formal process to tender our external audit and taxation services.
You have a strong and experienced Board managing your Company through these uncertain times. The actions that they take over the coming months will be in line with good governance and, in the opinion of the Board, in your best interests.
The following pages set out our governance structures, processes and the work undertaken by the Board and its Committees during FY16.

 Leadership
Effectiveness
Accountability
Relations with shareholders
    Your Board is collectively responsible for the long term success of your Company. The roles are clearly defined with Executive Directors managing the business on a day to day basis and the Non-Executive Directors providing
an appropriate level of scrutiny, challenge and support. In this way proposals relating to strategy, performance, responsibility and accountability are constructively challenged and the Board ensures that all decisions are well considered, justified and of the highest quality. In addition, Board processes are
set up to ensure adequate oversight of the implementation of those decisions.
This section details the structure and composition of the Board and its Committees, how responsibilities are divided amongst
the Board, its Committees and individual Directors, the main activities of the Board
in FY16 and its main focus areas for FY17.
See pages 51–55
   Your Board continuously reviews its balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to ensure that they remain appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its Committees and of individual Directors.
This section outlines the independent Board evaluation process undertaken in FY16 and the outcomes. It also sets out the progress made with the actions arising from the FY15 evaluation as well as the induction process for new Directors.
See pages 56–59
   Your Board is mindful of the risk environment in which it operates when making
any decisions. It maintains sound risk management and internal control systems and regularly reviews the principal risks
and assesses the appropriate appetite for risk in striving to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives.
This section details the Board’s approach to risk management, its internal controls and risk management systems and its processes for evaluating that the Annual Report and Accounts of the Company are fair, balanced and understandable.
See page 59
   Your Board recognises the importance
of maintaining open dialogue with its shareholders, both private and institutional. A number of events and communications take place on an annual basis to regularly communicate with shareholders and to encourage their participation.
This section summarises how the Board and individual Directors engaged with shareholders throughout FY16 and how shareholders can communicate with the Company.
   See pages 60–61
Remuneration
  The Board, through its Remuneration Committee, has established a formal and transparent procedure for developing its policy on executive remuneration. The Group’s Remuneration Policy was presented to, and approved by, shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is designed to promote the long term success of the Group. No changes are proposed to the policy for FY17.
This section summarises the Group’s Remuneration Policy, how the policy operated during FY16 and how it will be applied in FY17.

  Corporate governance report – Leadership continued
 Corporate Governance Statement
The Board confirms that during the year ended 30 June 2016, and as at the date of this report, the Company has fully complied with the main and supporting principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued in September 2014 (a copy of which is available from www.frc.org.uk).
This report, together with the Other Statutory Disclosures, reports from the Audit, Nomination, Safety, Health and Environment and Remuneration Committees, provide details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during the year under review.
We describe how we have applied the main principles throughout pages 50 to 97.
We are aiming to be fully compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in 2016 which is applicable to the Company for FY17. The Company has also complied with the requirements under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Listing Rules and the BIS Directors’ Remuneration Reporting regulations and narrative reporting requirements.
Board balance
The names, responsibilities and other details of each of the Directors of the Board are set out on pages 46 and 47 with the composition of the Board on page 51. The Board believes it has an appropriate balance of Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors having regard to the size and nature of the business. In addition, the combination of the experience and calibre of the Non-Executive Directors collectively, having regard to their diverse backgrounds, experience and their varying lengths of service, further enhances this balance and mitigates the risk of ‘group think’.
Board independence
The Company recognises the importance of its Non-Executive Directors remaining independent throughout their appointment, it enables them to provide objective advice and guidance to the Executive Directors (and Senior Management) through the application of their wide business and commercial experience and diverse backgrounds. This independence allows the Non-Executive Directors to constructively challenge and scrutinise the performance of the Executive Directors and provide an independent perspective on business strategy, performance and the integrity of
the financial information considered by the Board and disclosed to the Company’s shareholders.
In addition, their independence is of the utmost importance when considering the appointment or removal of Executive Directors and in the determination of succession planning for Board positions and other Senior Management roles within the Group. All Non-Executive Directors remained independent in character and judgement during the financial year. It was confirmed as part of the annual conflict of interests review that none of the Non-Executive Directors have business or other relationships with the Group (or other outside interests) that might influence their independence
or judgement (see page 65). Details of their interests in shares of the Company are contained in Table 15 on page 89 of the Remuneration report.
John Allan was considered to be independent on appointment to the Board and on taking up the role ofChairman.AspartoftheFY16annualreviewoftheChairman’seffectiveness,theNon-Executive Directors led by Mark Rolfe, as Senior Independent Director, considered John’s significant commitments (page 46) and confirmed that they do not impinge upon his availability to fulfil his duties to the Company. John Allan has demonstrated this throughout the year by ensuring full attendance at each of the
Board and majority of the committee meetings, being available to Board members whenever required, spending time out in the business and within the Group’s corporate offices in London. John Allan continues to show dedication to his role and commits the time necessary to discharge his duties.

 Board and Committee Evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the Board is responsible for undertaking a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors. In 2015 this process was conducted internally and in FY16 we appointed an external company to facilitate the evaluation. Details of progress made on the outcomes of the 2015 review and the results of the 2016 review are set out below.

 Board performance evaluation 2016
We last conducted an externally facilitated Board evaluation in respect of FY13. In accordance with the Code, we therefore engaged the services of Independent Board Evaluation ('IBE') to undertake the evaluation review for FY16. IBE also undertook the external evaluation for FY13 giving them a greater insight into how the Board and its procedures have developed over the years. IBE has no other connection with the Company.
Board evaluation process
IBE attended meetings of the Board and its committees and interviewed all Board members and key members of Senior Management. Their review covered the following:
> The performance of the Board and its principal committees generally and individually;
> board contribution to strategy and shareholder accountability;
> risk management;
> financial and operating reporting;
> succession planning (including diversity);
> inter-relationships between the Board and its Committees and between the Executive
and Non-Executive Directors;
> board Committees and decision making; and
> effectiveness of each Director.
56
Evaluation of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As part of the 2016 Board Evaluation, IBE evaluated the effectiveness of the Chairman. Interviews were held with each member of the Board and the result was unanimous support.
Of particular note was the Chairman's ability to steer the Board in a way that encourages openness and transparency. In addition, his knowledge of the important issues requiring Board debate and his focus on them during Board meetings was seen as a key strength. These findings were presented to the Senior Independent Director who shared them with the Board (without the Chairman being present) before providing feedback to the Chairman.
IBE also assessed the effectiveness of each Board Director, including the Non-Executive Directors and provided feedback to the Chairman. The Chairman subsequently held one to one meetings with each Director to discuss the findings and agree any areas of improvement or training / development identified. There were no issues of any substance arising from this review.
In addition, in accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Chairman met at least once with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors being present usually prior to or immediately following Committee meetings.

  Information and support
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, ensures that the Board receives accurate, timely and clear information. Each Director is issued with an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive operating and financial management reports for the period under review, generally five working days before any Board meeting. The Company Secretary attends all Board and Committee meetings and all Directors have access to her advice and, if necessary, to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense to assist with the discharge
of their responsibilities as Directors.
All Directors are provided with a rolling three-year schedule of proposed meeting dates.
Any Director who is unable to attend a meeting is invited to provide their views to the Chairman ahead of that meeting, having reviewed the agenda, briefing papers and management information. Reasons for non-attendance are recorded by the Company Secretary and either she or the Chairman will meet with any absent Director to go through any action points which are of relevance. Formal minutes of each Board meeting are prepared, circulated and submitted for approval at the next meeting.
Training
The Chairman regularly reviews training requirements of, and annually agrees development needs with, individual Directors. A number of internal presentations and updates are provided to Directors as part of the Board and strategy agenda. This forms part of the training the Directors receive for their role. Subjects are chosen based on their impact on the business and include (but are not limited to) general economic and market updates, government and regulatory environment, our customers, financial updates and planning, sales and product development.

 Induction
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in a full and formal induction process. The aim of the induction is to assist the Director to familiarise himself with the business and its culture in addition to the roles and responsibilities of the Board and each member of Senior Management. Site and divisional / functional visits are arranged so the Group’s business is seen in operation. Each new Director is provided with an induction pack containing general and specific information relating to their role such as a schedule of meetings, copies of Board minutes, various policies and procedures, details of their duties as a Director of a listed plc and other obligations under the various regulations governing the Company.
  Neil Cooper's induction
Neil Cooper was provided with a tailored induction process which included, amongst other matters, health and safety training, site visits, meetings with all Board members and the Company Secretary, key external advisers and senior and operational management teams across the business. This enabled him to gain a greater understanding of our products, processes and policies. Neil met with the Group's brokers and analysts to gain an external perspective of items of importance to the Group. He also met major shareholders of the Company during investor meetings.

 David Thomas' induction
David Thomas' induction was focused on his new role as Chief Executive given that he was already familiar with the Group's operations having previously held the position of Group Finance Director. He worked closely with Mark Clare to gain a more in-depth view of the role and the associated responsibilities to ensure a smooth transition. During this period David met with external analysts and stakeholders and internal management allowing him to gauge for himself the priorities of the business.

  Accountability Internal controls and risk management
In accordance with provision C.2.3. of the Code, the Board monitors and regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including those related to material financial, operational and compliance performance and the risk management systems (see the Audit Committee report on pages 66 to 73). A risk framework has been developed for
all business processes by the Internal Audit function and approved by the Audit Committee. This framework forms the basis of the internal control audit plan for the year ahead, which tests if key controls are being applied effectively in each operating division. Material issues identified during internal audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and by the Board on a quarterly basis. Any necessary actions are immediately taken to remedy any significant failings in the internal control system.
The Group’s system of internal controls is designed to manage risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks entirely.
The system of internal controls therefore provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal controls does, however, provide reasonable assurance that potential issues can be identified promptly and appropriate remedial action taken. Further details can be found in the risk management section of the Strategic Report (pages 41 to 45).
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s Financial Statements are reconciled to the underlying financial ledgers. A review of the consolidated accounts and Financial Statements is completed by management to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately reflected.
The Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. Therefore, a confirmation of necessary actions has not been considered appropriate.
Fair, balanced and understandable
As part of its considerations, the Board reflected upon the feedback shareholders provided in respect of our 2014/15 Annual Report and Accounts. It also set aside adequate time to review and discuss significant areas of the 2015/16 Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board assessed the tone, balance and language of the document being mindful of the requirements of the Code and the need for consistency between the narrative section of the Report and the Financial Statements in arriving at its conclusion. The Board's formal statement on the Annual Report and Accounts being fair, balanced and understandable is contained
within the Director's Responsibility Statement on page 104. The process undertaken by the Audit Committee to assist the Board in assessing if the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable can be found on page 69.
  Jock Lennox's induction
Jock Lennox’s induction began as soon as he accepted his appointment. He was sent various documents for him to begin to understand the Company and its culture. As an experienced Non-Executive Director, Jock was already familiar with his obligations as a plc Director of a listed company. Meetings were arranged with all Board members and members of Senior Management. Jock also visited various regional offices and sites across the country including the Group Support Centre in Leicestershire.

 Relations with shareholders
      The Board recognises the importance of having an effective relationship with its shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group has arrangements in place which enable it to communicate effectively with shareholders in respect of business strategy, governance, remuneration and any Senior Management or Board changes. It also conducts regular institutional investor meetings after the release of the annual and half year results and following the publication of each of our trading updates.
Trading Updates
We are fully aware that the Disclosure and Transparency Rules have removed the requirement for companies to publish interim management statements to the market in between the full and half year results. We therefore undertook a review of our reporting frequency and, given the cyclical nature of our business, we believe that it is imperative that we keep our shareholders fully informed of the performance of the business on a regular basis. In addition, given that we only publish short trading updates four times a year, two of which are in preparation for the half and full year results, the burden on management time is not deemed to be excessive. We will therefore continue to publish trading updates in FY17 four times a year and will keep the position under review.
Any announcement published via the Regulatory Information Service including the half year and annual results, trading updates and other Company announcements can be found on the Company’s website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors.
Board Updates
In order to ensure that all Directors are aware of, and have a clear understanding of, the views of major shareholders, the Chief Financial Officer reports regularly to the Board on the Company’s
investor relations activities, including updates from the Company’s brokers. Additionally, the Company’s brokers presented an analysis of investor feedback during the year under review.
Investor Meetings
The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with investors and analysts
in order to convey an understanding of the market and the Group’s operations and objectives. These meetings take place throughout the year but particularly after the annual and half year results announcements. In FY16, the Directors attended a total of 161 investor meetings (133 one to one meetings and 28 group meetings). In addition, they attended a number of conferences and investor roadshows in the UK and the US. The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors also have the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders at the request of either party. The Senior Independent Director is available to meet with major shareholders, as and when required, to gain an understanding of any issues and concerns.
Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee consulted with major investors and the principal investor advisory groups on the proposed remuneration outcomes for FY15 and the Group’s approach to remuneration for FY16, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 AGM. This process was also repeated in August 2016 in respect of the FY16 outcomes and proposals for FY17.
Annual General Meeting
All Directors, including the Chairmen of the Committees, attend the AGM and are available to answer shareholder questions. The notice of each AGM and related papers are circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.

  Nomination Committee report
Statement from the Chairman of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee plays a vital role within the business. It ensures that the Company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible for the long term success of the Company. Through the strategic focus of the Nomination Committee, we can ensure that the Board has the optimum skills and experience for achieving its long term strategy and goals. We aim to build a responsive, open and transparent culture, where contributions are valued,
so it is imperative to get the appointment process right.
A key focus of the Nomination Committee during the year under review was the appointment and re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors and the external Board evaluation.
One of our key areas of focus for the next financial year will be to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the performance evaluation of the Nomination Committee.
John Allan
Chairman of the Nomination Committee 6 September 2016

 Role
The role of the Nomination Committee includes:
> monitoring the structure, size and composition of the Board;
> evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of each of the members;
> making recommendations to the Board in respect of any changes required;
> leading the process for Board appointments;
> giving full consideration to succession planning for Directors and Senior Management in the course of its duties;
> regularly reviewing the time commitment required from the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors to satisfactorily fulfil their roles; and
> considering and, if deemed appropriate, authorising potential conflict of interests. Membership and attendance at meetings
The membership of the Nomination Committee and the attendance at each of its scheduled meetings is set out in Table 5. In accordance with Code provision B.2.1. the majority of Committee members are considered independent by the Company and their biographies and qualifications are shown on pages 46 and 47.
Appointment and re-appointment of Directors
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments to the Board and makes recommendations to the Board when suitable candidates have been identified. When a vacancy arises the Nomination Committee evaluates the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board and considers this against current and future needs to deliver
its strategy. It then prepares a description of the roles and capabilities required for that appointment. The search for Board candidates is carried out, and appointments made, on merit with due regard for Board diversity and the need to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience. External recruitment consultants are used where appropriate.
Appointment of Jock Lennox
During the year, the Nomination Committee began a formal process to identify a suitable candidate to replace Mark Rolfe who indicated his intention to step down from his position through an orderly transition following eight years of service. Consideration was given to the skills and experience required of the new Director and a job description was produced. The Zygos Partnership, an independent recruitment agency, with no other connection to the Company, were then briefed in order that they could assist with the search. A list of candidates of both genders was prepared and reviewed by the Nomination Committee. Four candidates were shortlisted and met with the Chairman and Senior Independent Director. The two preferred candidates then met the remaining members of the Board. Jock Lennox, who is the Chair of a number of other Audit Committees and who demonstrated that he had the relevant financial experience, was selected to take on the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee felt that his considerable and wide ranging experience would be an asset to the Group and recommended his appointment to the Board for approval. John Allan absented himself from the final decision to appoint Jock Lennox due to his previous working relationship with Jock at Dixons Carphone plc.
Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board for an initial three-year term and normally serve a second three-year term, subject to re-election by shareholders and statutory provisions relating to the removal of Directors. Beyond this a third term of up to three years may be
served subject to particularly rigorous review and taking into account the need for progressive refreshment of the Board. The Articles, in accordance with the Code, require any Non-Executive Director who has served nine years or more on the Board continuously to be subject to annual re-appointment.
The letters of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors (alongside the service contracts for the Executive Directors) are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office during normal office hours or via the Company’s website (www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk). Copies will also be available at the 2016 AGM for 15 minutes before and throughout the
meeting. The letters of appointment clearly set out the time commitment expected from each Non-Executive Director to ensure they satisfactorily perform their duties. The required time commitment is reviewed annually by the Board. Each Non-Executive Director confirms that they are able to allocate the time commitment required at the time of their appointment and thereafter as part of their individual annual effectiveness review undertaken by the Chairman.

  Governance

 Strategic Report
Other Information
  During the year, the Nomination Committee considered the re-appointment of Nina Bibby.
The Nomination Committee was satisfied that Nina remains independent in character and judgement and has no other relationship or circumstance that would affect this. Nina confirmed that she would be able to continue to dedicate sufficient time to fulfil her role as a Non-Executive Director of the Company. Accordingly, the re-appointment of Nina for a second three-year term was recommended to the Board, which it fully endorsed.
Retirement and re-election of Directors
The Articles currently require Directors to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders
at the first AGM following their initial appointment to the Board and thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. All Board members will, however, in accordance with the Code, stand for re-election by shareholders at the 2016 AGM irrespective of their date of appointment and length of service on the Board.
Biographical details of each of the Directors and supporting statements for their re-election are set out on pages 46 and 47 of this report and in the Notice of the 2016 AGM. Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts can be found in the Remuneration report on page 83.
Each of the Directors has been subject to a formal performance evaluation process and the Nomination Committee, and the Board, are satisfied that they each continue to be effective in, and demonstrate commitment to, their respective roles. The Board, therefore, recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions to be put forward at the 2016 AGM relating to the re-election of all Directors.
Succession Planning – Executive Directors
During the year, the Board undertook its annual review of the Group's succession plans.
This involves a review of succession plans for Executive Directors and other Senior Management roles below Board level. The aim of this review is to identify suitable individuals who are capable of filling senior managerial positions and ensure that their development needs are identified
and addressed. It also seeks to ensure that the Board's future needs are met. As part of their development, senior managers who are not of Board level will be invited to attend part of a Board meeting to present on their specialist area. This also enables the Board to assess the quality of internal talent and for the individual to get a greater understanding of the workings of the Board.
Directors’ conflict of interests
The Board has, in accordance with the Articles and best practice guidelines, authorised the Nomination Committee to oversee the process for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board concerning any actual or potential conflict of interests which may arise for any Board member, including details of any terms and conditions which it deems necessary to impose on any authorisation given. This process was carried out satisfactorily during the year in respect of all Directors.
The Company Secretary maintains a register of Directors’ conflict of interests which is reviewed annually with recommendations made to the Board in respect of any changes to the authorisations that may be required. Following the annual review for 2015, it was agreed that the register of conflicts would be reviewed at each Board meeting. This enables each Director to review their entries and notify the Chairman and/or the Board of any new conflict or possible conflict and of any change in circumstances relating to authorisations already given. The Board, when authorising any conflict or possible conflict of interests, does not count in the quorum the Director whose conflict or possible conflict is being discussed and reserves the right to exclude a Director from
a meeting whilst a conflict or possible conflict is being considered. The Board may revoke or vary any authorisation at any time.
Board diversity policy
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the Group’s policy on diversity, including professional, international and gender diversity. This policy was in turn also considered by the Board. The Nomination Committee’s primary goal remains to identify the most suitable candidate to join the Board and for other senior positions within the Group. However, it also seeks to ensure that, in managing an appointment and in succession planning, it has regard to the benefits of diversity, including but not restricted to gender diversity and its impact on effective decision making.
In terms of gender diversity the Board will continue to work only with recruitment search consultants who have adopted a voluntary code of conduct addressing gender diversity. The Board has agreed not to impose a quota regarding gender balance preferring instead to appoint strictly on merit.
The Nomination Committee and the Board do recognise the need to ensure that the business reflects a diverse workforce, at all levels of seniority, whilst always seeking to ensure that each post is offered to the best available candidate. Promoting diversity at a Senior Management level and more generally within the workforce is an objective for the Chief Executive and HR Director. Progress has been made with promoting diversity within the business (see page 35, Diversity and inclusion).
This report forms part of the Corporate governance report and is signed on behalf of the Nomination Committee by:
John Allan
Chairman of the Nomination Committee 6 September 2016
In order to assist with the development of senior managers, they are able to take on non- executive roles with other organisations in order that they can widen their experience.
The Nomination Committee plays an active part in this process. It intends to place a greater focus on succession planning during the next year in response to the outcomes of the recent external effectiveness review.
Succession Planning – Non-Executive Directors
The Nomination Committee reviews annually the length of service of the Non-Executive Directors and holds conversations with the longer serving members to create a plan for the progressive refreshment of the Board.

Statement from the Chairman of the Audit Committee
I am very pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the financial year ended 30 June 2016. During the year, as required by the Code, we have addressed the requirements of the new long term viability statement and the Board has accepted our recommendations on the form
of that statement and the related review period (see page 43 of the Strategic Report).
In this year's Committee meetings, we have had frequent discussions on key accounting judgements and the impact of the pipeline of new accounting standards. We have also held in-depth sessions with Senior Management on a variety of topics important to the business including: revenue recognition, tender processes, IT resilience, cyber security and pension provision and funding. This enables the Committee to truly understand the practical aspects of the important issues facing the Group and their related accounting judgements and policies.
In performing our role we work closely with both internal and external audit teams in order
to ensure our internal control processes remain robust, our financial reporting remains clear and concise and our accounting judgements are appropriate.
Areas of focus for FY17
FY17 is shaping up to be another busy year. After eight years as Chairman of this Committee,
I will be stepping down at the 2016 AGM and I am delighted to be handing over to Jock Lennox,
a very experienced Audit Committee Chairman. Jock joined the Board on 1 July 2016 and we have been working together since then to ensure a smooth transition of ongoing matters relating to the Audit Committee.
We will be tendering the Group's external audit during FY17. The Group's tax compliance and advisory services will also be put out to tender. Further information is available on page 71.
The Audit Committee has been given its authority by the Board and acts in accordance with its written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website. In undertaking its role, the Committee has complied with its duties under the Code and will take all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the 2016 Code during FY17. Set out in the following pages is more detail of how we have discharged those duties in respect of the financial year under review.
It has been a pleasure to serve you and the Company during my period in office.
Mark Rolfe
Chairman of the Audit Committee 6 September 2016
      The Audit Committee has continued to implement the changes to Corporate Governance best practice and monitor developments in accounting standards. We have reviewed the risk landscape of the business and considered in detail our principal risk areas. We are comfortable that the risk management and internal control framework in operation throughout the year was appropriate and effective.

 Role of the Audit Committee
The role of the Audit Committee is to:
> monitor the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any proposed formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance, including any significant financial reporting judgements and whether the Annual Report and Accounts are ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ and review and assess whether it provides sufficient information to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;
> assess the prospects of the Company over a period of time agreed by the Board and consider and confirm whether there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation;
> monitor and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function;
> review the Company’s principal risks, systems of internal control and risk management; and
> keep under review the relationship between the Group and the external auditor, including their re-appointment, independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit process, whilst continually monitoring and, where required, challenging the ratio between audit and non-audit fees.
Membership and attendance at Audit Committee meetings
In compliance with the Code, the Committee comprises exclusively of Non-Executive Directors and each of the members is considered to be independent by the Company. John Allan is not a member of the Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that, Mark Rolfe has recent and relevant financial experience to Chair the Audit Committee. Jock Lennox, who joined the Board on 1 July 2016, will succeed Mark Rolfe as Chair of the Audit Committee in November 2016. Jock is a chartered accountant and Chairman of a number of other Audit Committees and is therefore well qualified to undertake this role effectively. There were four scheduled meetings during the year. Details of the members and attendance at each of the meetings is shown in Table 6 and the biographies and qualifications of the members are shown on pages 46-47.
Note:

In addition to the Company Secretary, the Chief Internal Auditor and representatives from Deloitte LLP attended each of the Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee met (independently of management and the Chairman of the Board) the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Internal Auditor and Deloitte LLP. The Chief Executive and other members of Senior Management also attended meetings (or parts thereof), by invitation. After each meeting,
the Chairman reports to the Board upon the business undertaken by the Audit Committee.
Significant issues considered during the financial year
The significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the financial year and how each of them was addressed were as follows:
Going concern
The Audit Committee:
> assessed the Group’s available facilities, headroom and banking covenants;
> reviewed management’s detailed analysis, which included forecasts and scenarios considering potential downturns in the housing market;
> satisfied itself, and subsequently the Board, that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate in the context of the Group’s funding and liquidity position;
> considered the revised disclosure requirements on going concern under the Code; and > performed a detailed sensitivity analysis following the UK's decision to leave the EU. Further details on the Group’s going concern assessment can be found on page 115.
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee reviewed the integrity of the Financial Statements of the Group and the Company and all formal announcements relating to the Group’s and Company’s financial performance. This process included the assessment of the following primary areas of judgement and took into account the views of Deloitte LLP.

 Land and work in progress (‘WIP’) are the most significant assets of the Group and as at 30 June 2016 were carried at £4,226.5m (see note 3.1 to the Financial Statements). We undertake housebuilding and commercial development and the majority of activity we carry out is not forward sold before we commence development. Accordingly, there is a risk that land and WIP may be held at a value in excess of the lower of cost and net realisable (sale) value. The Group conducts half yearly reviews of land and WIP carrying value and if the estimated net realisable value is lower than the carrying value, it impairs the land and WIP value.
The Group has £792.2m of goodwill and £100.0m of intangible assets which arose upon the acquisition of Wilson Bowden (see note 4.2 to the Financial Statements). The Group reviews the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis to ensure that the present value of the future cash flows that the housebuilding business
is expected to generate is greater than the carrying value of these assets. This review includes a number of judgements around the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of an appropriate rate with which to discount these cash flows.
  How the Audit Committee addressed those judgements
 Carrying value of land and work in progress valuation
  Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
 The Audit Committee considered land and WIP accounting judgements review papers at its February, June
and August meetings. These outlined the review process undertaken and the judgements made with regards
to the estimation of further sales proceeds and further build costs. Deloitte LLP reported upon land and WIP carrying value at the February and August meetings in the context of the half year review and year end audit. Following detailed consideration of the accounting judgements papers and the findings of Deloitte LLP, the Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by management and concluded that the carrying value of our land and WIP remains appropriate.
The Audit Committee considered a goodwill and intangible assets accounting judgements paper at its August meeting. This outlined the assumptions made, the sources for these assumptions, and the resulting valuation. Deloitte LLP reported upon goodwill and intangible assets valuation at the August meeting in the context of the year end audit. Following detailed consideration of the accounting judgements paper and the findings of Deloitte LLP, the Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by management and concluded that the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets remains appropriate.
  Available for sale financial assets was included as a significant financial judgement for 2015 but due to the sale of the majority of the assets, as described in note 3.5 of the financial statements, this is no longer considered a material item.
  Fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee also undertook a detailed process to consider whether the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable. It considered the feedback provided by shareholders in respect of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, the Group’s trading updates and the information that the Board had received throughout the year. The Audit Committee received an early draft of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts (including the risk management statement and principal risks disclosure) to allow itself sufficient time to review the disclosures therein. It also received a report from the Company Secretary which confirmed that: (i) the Annual Report and Accounts had been reviewed by the Executive Directors; and
(ii) the Company had received confirmation from its external advisers, that the Annual Report and Accounts adhered to the requirements of the Code and relevant rules and regulations.
The Audit Committee then assessed, at its August 2016 meeting, whether the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable. It reviewed the processes underpinning the compilation and assurance of the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to the financial and non-financial management information. It also reviewed the internal processes underpinning the Group’s reporting governance framework and the reviews and findings of the Group’s external legal advisers and the auditor. The Audit Committee concluded that the 2016 Annual Report
and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable and contained sufficient information for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy and recommended as such to the Board.
Long Term Viability Statement
In accordance with section C.2.2. of the Code and the FRC guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, the Audit Committee considered the timescale over which it could sensibly assess the Company’s ability to continue to trade, taking into account the Company’s business model and prospects. It concluded that this analysis should be performed over a three-year timespan as explained on page 43 of the Strategic Report. Presentations were received from management and it was concluded that there was
a reasonable expectation that the Group would be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities over this three-year period. This was then communicated and recommended to the Board for approval.
The long term viability statement with a full explanation is shown on page 43 of the Strategic Report.

 The effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management process
The Audit Committee plays a vital role in managing the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management process on behalf of the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management framework are as follows:
i) a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority and responsibility for each operating division;
ii) financial and management reporting systems under which financial and operating performance is consistently reviewed against budget and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group levels on a monthly basis;
iii) identification and review of principal operational risk areas to ensure they are embedded in the Group’s monthly management reporting system. This embeds the identification and control of risk as routine aspects of managerial responsibility. Details of the management of risk system utilised and the principal risks and uncertainties and their relevance to the operations and financial performance of the Group are set out in the Risk management section on pages 41 to 45 of the Strategic Report; and
iv) assessment of compliance with the internal control and risk management systems.
This assessment is supported by the Group’s Internal Audit team which is responsible for undertaking an annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and reporting to the Audit Committee, and if necessary, the Board, on the operation and effectiveness of those systems and any material failings. The planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations is approved
by the Audit Committee. It includes full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas such as land acquisition and sale, cost controls and monitoring WIP, Treasury, payroll and HR. Where the Internal Audit team does not have the expertise or resources required to conduct complex audits they use external expertise.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks
that include the effects of changes in borrowing and debt profiles, Government policy, market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk. Accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken. These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Activities are delegated, by the Board, to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn reports to the Board. The Treasury department implements guidelines in accordance with approved treasury policies that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
During the year the Audit Committee:
> monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls in relation to material financial risks;
> reviewed a number of process improvements and confirmed that the risk management and internal control systems had been in place and had operated effectively throughout the year ended 30 June 2016;
> provided regular reports to the Board in respect of the findings of its monitoring of the effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management process, in order to assist the Board with its assessment that sound risk management and internal control systems had been maintained throughout the year to safeguard shareholders’ investments as well as the Group’s assets (in accordance with principle C.2 of the Code);
> assisted the Board to determine the nature and extent of the principal risks that are appropriate for the Group to take in order to achieve its strategic objectives and to be assured that Executive Directors and Senior Management continue to implement and maintain the Group’s internal control and risk management systems within the governance and policy framework approved by the Board;
> carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks including those that would threaten the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity and confirmed that they are being appropriately managed;
> received presentations from management below Board level to understand risks and controls in a number of areas of the business including; revenue recognition, tender processes,
IT resilience, cyber security, pension provision and funding;
> reviewed in detail the output of the six monthly control self-certification process from each of the divisions;
> considered all whistleblowing and suspected fraud reports and actions;
> reviewed all internal audit results and action plans and the effectiveness of the Group Internal
Audit function;
> received regular reports from the Risk Committee in respect of the work it had undertaken to review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control policies and procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of risks and for assessing individual key risks on a rolling basis;
> reviewed the concurrency of the principal risks and the risk management framework to determine if the descriptions of their operation were up to date, the system of internal control remains effective and reported their findings to the Board when considering the draft half year and full year Financial Statements; assisted the Executive Committee to prioritise the risk framework by identifying the risks considered most significant to the Group and assessed their potential impact on the business of any risks identified; and
> robustly assessed the structure deployed by the Group when assessing risks. This is set out in the Risk management section on pages 41 to 45 of the Strategic Report.
The Audit Committee is pleased with the progress with its short and medium term work programmes to date, and recognises that work will need to be continued in these areas during the next financial year. It will also review whether the internal control and risk management framework needs adjustment following the EU referendum vote.

  Review of accounting policies
The Audit Committee considered the impact of the accounting standards adopted in the year and reviewed the Group’s progress on projects to consider the impact of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and IFRS 16 'Leases' upon the Group’s accounting policies and financial statements. Further information on the impact of accounting standards is on page 116.
External Auditor
i) External audit tender
The Audit Committee considered the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor to the Company and whether to tender the external audit in respect of the 2017 financial year. In arriving at its conclusion, the Audit Committee took into account:
> feedback on the effectiveness of the external audit from divisional, regional and Group management who were closely involved in both the half year and year end reporting process;
> Deloitte LLP was appointed as the auditor of the Company through an external tender process in 2007;
> the appointment of Mark Goodey as the lead audit partner during FY13 and FRC guidance which suggests that the tendering could align with the five-yearly cycle of partner rotation;
> Deloitte LLP’s objectivity and independence;
> Deloitte LLP’s performance against the audit plan for FY16; and
> the quality of advice and assistance brought to bear and received throughout the year.
Deloitte LLP’s performance as auditor to the Company continues to be satisfactory. It was therefore, not considered absolutely necessary to perform a tender process for the FY17 audit. Mark Goodey will continue to act as lead audit partner for Deloitte LLP until the conclusion of the FY17 audit subject to satisfactory performance. Accordingly, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that a resolution re-appointing Deloitte LLP as the auditor to the Company be proposed at the 2016 AGM. That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the Board.
The Audit Committee did however recognise that it was the appropriate time for the Group external audit to be tendered by following a formal process during the first half of the year ended 30 June 2017. Should the tender exercise lead to a change in auditor, the Audit Committee will look to execute the change for the audit of the financial year ended 30 June 2018. This exercise
is in line with the Code provision to consider tendering external audit every ten years and the FRC guidance that it be linked with the five-yearly lead audit partner rotation. The results of the tender exercise will be announced at the appropriate time. The Committee confirms compliance with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Company Market Investigations (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities)
Order 2014.
There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor.
ii) Audit effectiveness
The Audit Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit and concluded that the audit process as a whole had been conducted robustly and that the team selected to undertake the audit had done so thoroughly and professionally. In coming to this conclusion the Audit Committee reviewed amongst other matters:
> Deloitte LLP’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and the absence of any variations from it;
> reports highlighting the material issues and accounting judgements that arose during the
conduct of the audit;
> feedback from Group and regional management finance functions and the Chief Internal Auditor on the performance of the audit; and
> the report from the FRC’s Audit Quality Review Team. iii) Non-audit services
The Committee has approved a policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit purposes and continually monitors the ratio of audit to non-audit fees to ensure that it does not exceed
the 1:1 ratio prescribed by that policy. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, non-audit fees relating to the interim review are classified as incurred for audit purposes. At the end of FY16, non-audit fees represented 91% of audit fees. Further details of the audit (including audit-related) and non-audit fees incurred by the Group can be found on page 119.
The majority of the non-audit fees related to audit-related assurance services comprising:
the review of the Group’s half year report, taxation compliance (for which Deloitte LLP were appointed on 1 December 2010 following a competitive tender process in which four of the leading audit firms took part); and also taxation advice on various land acquisitions and disposals during the year. Accordingly, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the work performed
by Deloitte LLP was appropriate in the context of ensuring their independence as auditor, particularly given that the audit-related assurance services, relating to the review of the Group’s half year report, is usually conducted by the Group’s auditor and that the tax compliance and advisory services had been managed by a partner who has no involvement with the audit of
the Group. Consequently, the Audit Committee concluded that the level of non-audit fees was justified and did not raise any concerns in terms of Deloitte LLP’s independence as auditor to the Group.
The Audit Committee has agreed with Senior Management's recommendation to tender its taxation services during the first half of FY17, having last been tendered in FY11. The provider of external audit following the audit tender will not be appointed as tax adviser.

  Audit Committee report continued
 iv) Auditor independence and non-audit fees policy
The Audit Committee formally reviewed the policy which the Company has implemented on Auditor independence and non-audit fees (the ‘Policy’) during the year. For FY16, the Policy sets out the duties of the Audit Committee in this respect and the limited range of services which the auditor may provide without requiring prior approval of the Audit Committee. This helps
to maintain auditor independence and to monitor non-audit fees incurred by the Group.
The review of the Policy this year had particular regard to the legislation arising from the European Commission reforms of the EU audit market which became effective from 17 June 2016 and is in accordance with the Ethical Standard. The Policy has been updated as follows:
> the services that the external auditor is prohibited from providing have been amended in line with the legislation; and
> the inclusion of a 70% cap on non-audit fees (based on the average of audit fees over the previous three years) in preparation for when the EU regulations become applicable to the Company in FY20.
Prohibited Services
Under the new policy, the services which the external auditor is excluded from providing to the Group are:
> tax services and compliance (see exceptions opposite);
> services that involve playing any part in the management or decision making process
of the Company;
> bookkeeping and preparing accounting records and financial statements/payroll services;
> designing and implementing internal controls related to financial information or designing and implementing financial information technology systems;
> valuation services (see exceptions opposite);
> legal services/internal audit/human resource services;
> services linked to financing, capital structure and allocation, and investment strategy of the Company;
> promoting, dealing in or underwriting shares in the Company; and
> any other service that the Audit Committee determines is not permissible.
Exceptions
Certain tax and valuation services, including tax advice will be allowed provided:
> they have no direct or clearly inconsequential effect on the audited financial statements;
> the auditor has documented and explained the estimated effect on the financial statements in their report to the Audit Committee;
> the ethical principles of the ethical standards are upheld; and
> significant reliance is not placed on the results of the non-audit service for the purpose
of the Audit.
As per the previous year, the Policy continues to include restrictions on the recruitment of employees from Deloitte LLP, so that no employee (at whatever level of seniority) involved in the Company's audit for a two-year preceding period can be hired without the pre-approval of each the Chairman of the Company; the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Chief Financial Officer.
With effect from 1 July 2016, Deloitte LLP no longer provide services to the Group that are prohibited under the new Policy. Tax compliance services provided by Deloitte LLP concluded during FY16.
Under the Policy the Company is required to obtain written confirmation from Deloitte LLP that they remain independent. This is requested on an annual basis. For FY16 Deloitte LLP provided a comprehensive report to the Audit Committee verifying that they have performed their audit and audit-related services in line with independence requirements and explaining why they believe that they remain independent within the requirements of the applicable regulations and their own professional standards. The report also explains why the ratio of audit to non-audit fees and the extent and type of non-audit services provided by them is appropriate.
Following receipt of such confirmations and the completion of their own review, the Audit Committee endorsed Deloitte's conclusions that the Policy had been appropriately complied with throughout the year under review; there were no items that may affect the independence of the auditor; and non-audit fees were of an appropriate level.

  Internal Audit function
During the year, the Audit Committee received reports from the Chief Internal Auditor on the findings of internal audits conducted throughout the business, together with details of the proposed actions to rectify any issues identified. The Internal Audit function is fully independent of business operations and has a Group-wide mandate. The Chief Internal Auditor attends all Audit Committee meetings. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors and reviews the systems and processes adopted by the Internal Audit function to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. During the year the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and confirmed that, in its opinion, the Internal Audit function had operated effectively and provided a level of independent scrutiny of the operations of the Group.
Audit Committee effectiveness
The Audit Committee successfully implemented the recommendations arising from its 2015 performance evaluation. This year the Audit Committee's evaluation was performed by an external facilitator along with the Board effectiveness review. The outcome of the review was positive, particularly in respect of each member having a clear understanding of what is expected of them to undertake and discharge their responsibilities. The outcomes are described on page 57.
Whistleblowing
The Chief Internal Auditor updated the Audit Committee at each meeting on new whistleblowing incidents, ongoing investigations and the outcome of any completed investigations. On the back of these updates, the Audit Committee assessed the adequacy of the Group’s whistleblowing policy in accordance with the requirements of the Code. It reviewed the whistleblowing procedure adopted by the Group, including steps that can be taken to enhance awareness of
the process, to ensure it remains appropriate and available to those who need to raise concerns. The procedure allows individuals who become aware of possible improper, unethical or even illegal behaviour to raise the matter with their manager or alternatively refer the matter to a confidential and independent telephone number (the ‘Whistleblowing Number’).
The Whistleblowing Number is available to all employees (together with sub-contractors and suppliers) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Any issues reported to the Whistleblowing Number are immediately brought to the attention of the Chief Internal Auditor. The Chief Internal Auditor reviews and investigates the issues and, at his sole discretion, can seek guidance from appropriate individuals within the Group, such as the Company Secretary,
as and when necessary.

  Safety, Health and Environment Committee report
Statement from the Chairman of the Safety, Health and Environment Committee
Safety, health and the environment (‘SHE’) remains a key principle of the Group which is embedded within the day-to-day operations of the business. In 2014, the Group Board established this Committee primarily to oversee and provide stewardship of the Group’s SHE operational performance.
The key aspects of this Committee’s role are to:
> oversee the Group’s compliance with the SHE management system;
> identify and monitor SHE risks or exposures for the business and determine how best to mitigate against them;
> establish and maintain policies in respect of all areas relating to safety, health and the environment;
> assess the outcome of annual SHE internal and external audits and agree necessary actions with the Group SHE Director;
> receive assessments from the Group SHE Director on specific incidents to gain an understanding of what caused it, details of the internal and external (if any) investigations that are being/have been undertaken and details of what steps have been taken or controls put in place to mitigate against the incident recurring; and
> agree and recommend to the Remuneration Committee targets for any SHE performance measure which is to be applied to the annual bonus scheme and monitor performance against such measures.
The Committee continues to work closely with the SHE Operating Committee. To further enhance this relationship, the SHE Committee now holds at least one joint meeting with the SHE Operating Committee. This allows this Committee to gain a more in-depth understanding of the issues from an operational perspective and for the Committee to discuss such issues directly with those responsible for day-to-day management.
Key achievements in FY16
We continue to strive to ensure that our people, whether employees, sub-contractors or members of the public, remain safe throughout the whole construction and sales process of our developments and in the wider business.
Consequently, we continually monitor, review and amend (as necessary) our SHE policies, processes and procedures to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant to the business. All employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with these policies, processes and procedures during their induction and are invited to attend various health and safety courses throughout their time with the Group.
      Health and safety is of paramount importance to the Group. We strive to continually improve our processes and are pleased to announce that this was recognised by the British Safety Council who have again granted our health and safety management 5 star status.

  In addition, we have undertaken various campaigns during the year including a ‘Five Steps to Safety’ initiative which encourage positive behaviours and a culture of assessing risks prior to undertaking work activities. This initiative was commended by the NHBC as the leading health and safety initiative in the industry.
Such initiatives have helped us to once again achieve 5-star status with the British Safety Council following their recent health and safety audit. The audit evaluates leadership at all levels of
the business and dedication to continuous improvement, in addition to other factors such as occupational health, employee well-being, safety culture and the appropriate dedication of sufficient resources to health and safety. This achievement is truly important for our business and independently illustrates that our health and safety approach, policies and procedures are of the highest quality.
In addition to preparing and undertaking this audit we have been closely monitoring our overall injury incidence rates and the underlying causes of any recurring accidents.
We have continued to monitor our SHE performance targets and our key performance indicators, which are available in the Strategic Report and our Sustainability Report.
Despite our best efforts, it is with deep regret that I have to inform you that two employees of our sub-contractors tragically lost their lives on site during the year. I can assure you that both incidents have been thoroughly investigated by our internal health and safety team and we are fully co-operating with the Health and Safety Executive during their ongoing investigations into each of the incidents. At this stage there are no defined management failures which could be directly attributed to the cause of either of the incidents and no enforcement or improvement notices have been issued by the Health and Safety Executive. Our thoughts are with the families of each of the individuals concerned during this distressing time.
Areas of focus for FY17
During FY17, we will:
> continue to review and monitor our SHE systems and processes throughout the business to ensure that they remain fit for purpose;
> ensure that our SHE performance targets and objectives remain challenging and do not encourage inappropriate behaviours or unnecessary risk taking;
> continue to try and identify better and safer ways to work; and
> continue to monitor incident rates and perform causal analysis on incidents to ensure
appropriate action is taken to reduce these through targeted campaigns.
Without our people, we do not have a business and therefore their safety and well-being will, as always, remain a top priority for this Committee and the Group Board.

  Remuneration report
Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 which summarises our Remuneration Policy, how it was implemented throughout FY16 and how it will be implemented for FY17.
Remuneration Policy
Our Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and in accordance with the regulations on Directors’ remuneration, it will remain valid for a period of three years (subject to there being no changes required). We reviewed the Remuneration Policy during FY16, taking into account the current strategy of the Company, and agreed that it remains fit for purpose. A further review will be undertaken in FY17. Any proposed changes will be discussed with shareholders prior to the revised policy being presented for approval at the 2017 AGM.
As part of the review, we will take into account the report of the Investment Association's Working Group on simplification of remuneration structures and assess which, if any, of the structures would be feasible for us. We are also conscious of the Government’s new intentions to make changes to executive remuneration. We will monitor these closely and will seek guidance on the implementation of any changes from our remuneration consultants as well as consult with you as necessary when the details are published.
Management changes
In FY16 we saw major changes to the Executive Director team. David Thomas became Chief Executive replacing Mark Clare, Neil Cooper joined as Chief Financial Officer and Steven Boyes assumed more responsibilities. Details of the remuneration received by Mark until 31 July 2015, when he stepped down from the Board, are set out on pages 86 and 92. The remuneration package awarded to Neil Cooper comprised salary, pension, bonus and share awards which were all in line with our Remuneration Policy. Full details of the remuneration for the Executive Directors can be found on page 86 to 97.
In addition, Jock Lennox joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2016 on the same basic fee as the existing Non-Executive Directors (page 97).
      This has been another good year for the Group. Through the effective implementation of the Group’s strategy we believe we are delivering long term sustainable shareholder value. The remuneration received by the Executive Directors during FY16 reflects the achievements made against stretching targets for both short and long term incentive schemes.

  FY16 Performance and outcomes
Once again, your Company met or exceeded performance against all financial metrics which were established at the beginning of the year (see Table 12 on page 87). This is a result of the strong and focused leadership from the Executive Directors and the Senior Management team as well as the hard work and commitment of all employees across the Group. The Committee agreed that the financial performance of the Company fully supports an annual bonus payment of 146.1% of salary for Executive Directors.
In addition, the performance of the LTPP award granted in October 2013 was tested after the year end and 100% of the award vested. The net shares (after the payment of any tax and NI due on release) will be transferred to participants in October 2016. Full details of the achievements against each of the bonus and LTPP targets can be found on pages 87 and 88 respectively.
FY17 Executive Director Remuneration
As you are aware, on 23 June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU, creating great uncertainty within the UK and global economies. Consequently, whilst it is envisaged that the metrics for the FY17 annual bonus and any LTPP award will be similar to those of FY16 (and will remain in line with our Remuneration Policy), the Committee has, following advice from its remuneration consultants, decided to defer setting the actual targets until October 2016 when it is hoped that there will be more clarity over the impact of the EU Referendum. The Committee will, as always, ensure that these targets, are stretching and challenging, promote the long term success of the Company and seek to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Management required to continue to drive the business strategy.
Conclusion
We believe that our remuneration policies and practices remain sufficiently challenging and drive appropriate behaviours by management that are in the long term interest of the Company and its shareholders. FY17 will be an interesting and challenging year for the Company as we see the impact of the EU Referendum unfold. Your support to date has been invaluable and I, together with the Committee, hope that we will continue to receive your support through these uncertain times.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 6 September 2016
  Our remuneration strategy
Our most important asset is our people. Our remuneration strategy seeks to ensure that Executive Directors’ remuneration (and that of Senior Management) is clearly linked to the delivery of sustainable shareholder value and that they are appropriately rewarded for performance against the Group’s key objectives.
Aims of our Remuneration Policy:
> promote the long term success of the Company and be fully aligned with the performance and strategic objectives of the Group in order to enhance shareholder value;
> reward the delivery of profit, the maintenance of an appropriate capital structure and the continued improvement of return on capital employed by the business whilst ensuring that Executive Directors and Senior Management adopt a level of risk which is in line with the risk profile of the business as approved by the Board;
> reflect the interests and expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders;
> attract, retain, motivate and competitively reward Executive Directors and Senior Management with the requisite experience, skills and ability to support the achievement of the Group’s key strategic objectives in any financial year;
> take account of pay and employment conditions of employees across the Group; and
> ensure that there is no reward for failure; termination payments (if any) are limited to those that the Executive Director (or member of Senior Management) is legally entitled to; and in exercising its discretion, the Committee robustly applies the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ leaver provisions as defined in the rules of each of the share schemes operated by the Group.
In developing its policy the Committee has regard to:
> the Company’s business strategy, ensuring that targets support the achievement of business strategy and key KPIs;
> the performance, roles and responsibilities of each Executive Director or member of Senior Management;
> arrangements which apply below Senior Management level, including average base salary increases;
> information and surveys from internal and independent sources; and
> the economic environment and financial performance of the Group.

 Dear Reader
Barratt Developments PLC – 2016 Annual Report and Accounts
Errata Statement
Following the publication of our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts on 5 October 2016, the following typographical errors have been identified in the Remuneration Report:
1. Table 12 page 87: The capital employed threshold figure reads £2,691.9m but should read £2,961.9m.
2. Table 13 page 87: The bonus deferred for FY16 has been included to the pound despite the column heading indicating that the number should be in thousands. The figures in that column should therefore read 312 and not 311,711 for David Thomas, 247 and not 246,694 for Steven Boyes and 122 and not 122,118 for Neil Cooper.
3. Footnote 3 page 88: the number of shares that lapsed in respect of Mark Clare’s award reads 91,200 but should be 91,283. The number of shares that vested for Mark Clare is shown correctly.
4. Table 16 page 91: 2,013 shares are shown as granted to Steven Boyes under the 3 year Sharesave scheme during FY16. These shares were actually granted in FY15. The 2,013 shares should therefore have been shown in the ‘unvested shares as at 1 July 2015’ column.
We apologise for these typographical errors. Further, we have reviewed and amended our proofing procedures to mitigate against such errors occurring again. Should you have any queries on the above please do not hesitate to contact me on 01530 278278 in the first instance.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – summary
The Policy is summarised in the tables below and on pages 83 to 85. The Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting held on 12 November 2014. No changes are proposed to the Policy for FY17. It is our intention to put the Remuneration Policy to a binding vote at the AGM in 2017 in line with the Regulations.
The full version of the Policy can be found on pages 64 to 74 of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts which is available on our website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/results- reports-and-presentations/rp-2014.
A description of how the Company implemented the Policy in FY16 can be found on pages 86 to 95 and details of how the Policy is intended to be applied in FY17 are set out on pages 95 to 97.

Executive Directors.
See page 95 for Executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 1 July 2016.
   Benefits (taxable)
   To support the health and well-being of Executive Directors whilst they undertake their roles.
Benefits include:
> company car;
> annual medical screening;
> private medical insurance;
> some telephone costs; and
> contributions towards obtaining independent tax advice.
The Committee does have the discretion to offer other benefits, if it deems appropriate, to secure the appointment of a new Executive Director and to ensure that the benefits package for existing Executive Directors remains competitive
in the market.
   Pension
   To assist Executive Directors plan for retirement.
In accordance with legislation, Executive Directors are enrolled into a workplace pension. If Executive Directors choose to opt-out of the workplace pension they can elect to either:
> participate in the Company’s money purchase pension plan; or > receive a salary supplement.
Executive Directors are also eligible for an insured lump sum of up to five times pensionable salary on death in service.
The defined benefit section of the Group’s pension scheme closed to new entrants in 2001 and future accrual of defined benefits for current members ceased to
be offered on 30 June 2009. Steven Boyes remains a member of this part of the scheme.
Details of the pension salary supplements for each of the Executive Directors are set out on page 93.
   Annual bonus
   To motivate and reward Executive Directors and Senior Management for the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures over the financial year.
Executive Directors are eligible to earn a discretionary annual bonus. The bonus is not pensionable.
The level of bonus awarded to each Executive Director is dependent on the achievement of a number of Group and individual performance targets.
Bonuses up to 100% of base salary are paid in cash. Any bonus earned in excess of this (up to a maximum of 50% of base salary) is compulsorily deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’), see below.
When setting bonus targets, the Committee considers the effect of corporate performance on environmental, social and governance risks and sustainability issues generally to ensure that remuneration structures do not inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour.
The performance targets set are stretching whilst having regard to the nature and risk profile of the Company and the interests of its shareholders. Performance conditions are based on a mixture of financial and non-financial targets.
Performance against FY16 targets can be found on page 87.

 Long Term Performance Plan (‘LTPP’)
   To motivate and reward Executive Directors and Senior Management for the delivery of the long term performance of the Group.
To facilitate share ownership by Executive Directors and Senior Management.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s LTPP.
Annual LTPP awards can be equal to a maximum of 200% of base salary and are for a period of three years with a two-year continued holding period attached to the end of the performance period.
LTPP awards are usually granted following the final results announcement in September of each year.
The Committee sets performance targets for each award and ensures that targets, whilst stretching, are: realistic and attainable; for the long term benefit of the Group; and do not encourage inappropriate business risks.
Performance so far against the targets for the awards made in FY15 and FY16 can be found on page 89.
Details of the awards due to be granted in FY17 are set out on page 96.
   Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
   To encourage long term focus and to further align interests of the Executive Directors and Senior Management with those of shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking.
Any annual bonus which is deferred into shares is held in this plan for a period of three years and is subject to a continued employment condition.
Deferred shares may be forfeitable if an individual leaves prior to the release date. Deferred shares do not accrue dividends.
For any bonus deferred prior to November 2015, the Committee utilises the rules of the Group’s Co-Investment Plan (the ‘CIP’) for the purposes of the DBP. From FY16, deferred shares will be held in accordance with the DBP as approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. Under these rules the Committee has discretion
to award matching shares (the ‘Matching Award’) should it deem appropriate.
The Committee has not and does not intend to award such shares for FY16 or FY17.
Details of any bonus deferred into shares for FY16 can be found on page 87.
   Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
   To encourage or facilitate the holding of shares in the Company by or for the benefit of bona fide employees and former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
No awards can be granted under the ESOS in the same financial year as an award is granted under the LTPP.
The Committee retains the discretion to make future awards under the ESOS should market conditions dictate that it is more appropriate to grant under the ESOS than the LTPP.
The last award, made under the ESOS in December 2009, vested in December 2012. Executive Directors have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their vested option, after which time it will lapse. No Executive Directors exercised their ESOS options during the year.
Details of the Executive Directors’ remaining option holdings can be found on pages 90 to 92.
   Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘Sharesave’)
   To promote long term share ownership amongst all employees of the Group in a tax-efficient way, linking employee benefits to the performance of the Group and to aid retention of staff.
Under the standard terms of the Sharesave, all employees who have completed the minimum level of employment as at the invitation date as agreed by the Board, are eligible to participate in the Sharesave.
Employees can elect to save between a minimum of £5 and the maximum monthly savings limit as approved by the Committee and the Board, for a period of three
or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their option.
The three-year Sharesave granted in March 2013 matured on 1 June 2016.
David Thomas exercised his options following the vesting of the 2013 three-year Sharesave Scheme in accordance with the rules and elected to retain his shares.
Options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme can be found in table 15 (page 89).

Guidelines of Responsible Investment Disclosure
In line with the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure the Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure and targets for Executive Directors do not raise any environmental, social, or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible or reckless behaviour. The Committee considers that no element of the remuneration package will encourage inappropriate risk taking within the Company.

The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors’ (including new appointments) service contracts to be for a rolling 12 month period which can be terminated by 12 months’ notice given by either the Company or by the Executive Director at any time. The service contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car, annual medical screening, private medical insurance, some telephone costs and contributions to the cost of obtaining independent tax advice. The Committee regularly reviews the contractual terms for Executive Directors to ensure that they continue to reflect best practice.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

  Remuneration report – Directors’ Remuneration Policy – summary continued
 In accordance with Code provision D.2.1, each of the members of the Committee (including John Allan at the date of his Board appointment) is considered to be independent with no financial interest in the Committee’s decisions, other than as shareholders and the fees paid to them. Details of their shareholdings and fees can be found on pages 89 and 97 respectively.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
The Committee will determine the remuneration for any new Executive Director in accordance with the Policy as set out in the Future Policy Table on pages 64 to 69 of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts and will take into consideration each of the following elements:
Salary and benefits – the Committee will take into account: market data for the scope of the job; remuneration for the relevant role; salaries of and benefits provided to existing Executive Directors; and the new Executive Director’s experience, location and current base salary
and benefits package. In the event an Executive Director is recruited at below market levels, their base salary may be re-aligned over a period of time (e.g. two to three years) subject
to their performance in the role. The Committee may also agree to cover relocation costs, if it is deemed appropriate.
Pension – Executive Directors will be auto-enrolled from the date of recruitment unless they opt- out. If an Executive Director chooses to opt-out they may elect to receive a pension supplement in cash. The Committee has discretion to determine the level of pension supplement to be awarded to each Executive Director, up to a maximum of 30% of base salary, having regard to the pension supplement given to existing Executive Directors. Alternatively, the Executive Director may choose to join the defined contribution money purchase pension plan provided they meet all of the eligibility criteria. The Executive Director also has the option to receive some of their pension entitlement in cash and have the remainder contributed to the defined contribution money purchase pension plan, provided this does not, in aggregate, exceed 30% of base salary.
LTPP – new Executive Directors may be able to participate in the LTPP on terms to be considered by the Committee on a case by case basis. Any award made to the new Executive Director will usually be on the same terms as set out in the Policy. The level of the award will be no greater than that made to existing Executive Directors and will be pro-rated based on the remaining time span of the relevant performance period.
The Committee may also consider buying out incentive awards which an individual would forfeit upon leaving their current employer, again this would be reviewed on a case by case basis.
The Committee would however in all cases seek validation of the value of any potential incentive the individual is likely to forfeit and take into account the proportion of the performance period remaining of the award, the type of award (i.e. cash/shares) and the performance achieved (or likely to be achieved). Replacement share awards, if any, will be capped at the amount which the individual will forfeit and will be subject to the performance conditions applicable under the terms of the Executive Director share scheme in operation at the time.
Where an individual is recruited internally to the position of Executive Director, the Company will honour any pre-existing contractual commitments.
Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
Historically, there have been no specific provisions for compensation on early termination (except for payment in lieu of holidays accrued but untaken) or loss of office due to a change of ownership of the Company. The Committee also reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith: (a) in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way
of damages for breach of such an obligation); or (b) by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment. The Committee will apply mitigation against any contractual obligations as it deems fair and reasonable and will seek legal advice on the Company’s liability to pay compensation. It also seeks to reduce the level of any compensation payable and takes into account, amongst other factors, the individual’s and the Group’s performance; the Director’s obligation to mitigate
their own loss; and the Director’s length of service when calculating termination payments.
The Committee reserves the right to phase any such payments if it deems that it is appropriate to do so. Any amount that the Committee decides to pay an Executive Director will be based on the main elements of Executive Remuneration namely, base salary, annual bonus (subject to the Committee’s discretion), benefits and pension. For new appointments to the Board, the Company can, at its discretion, terminate a Director’s appointment and pay them only a monthly salary
for the 12 month notice period or until such time as the Director secures another job, whichever is the earlier.
The Committee also takes into account the rules of the annual bonus and long term incentive schemes when determining any payments for loss of office as follows:
Annual bonus – in terms of the annual bonus, in accordance with the provisions contained within the service contracts, Executive Directors are not usually entitled to any bonus payment (other than in circumstances where they are deemed by the Committee as a ‘good leaver’, which includes but is not limited to redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability or any other circumstance which the Committee may decide), unless they remain employed and are not under notice as at the payment date. Any bonus payment for a ‘good leaver’ will be based on the individual performance of the Executive Director concerned, as well as the Company’s performance during the relevant period. Such payment will be pro-rated depending on the proportion of the bonus period worked by the relevant individual.
Deferred bonus – for any bonus deferred into shares, if the Executive Director is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’ (as defined above), he will be entitled to retain the shares subject to settling any tax and national insurance liability that may become due on release of the shares. In all other cases, the shares will lapse immediately on the date that the Executive Director’s employment with the Company ends and there is no entitlement to any compensation for the loss of the shares.
In the event any matching awards have been granted to the Executive Director, these will lapse immediately unless the individual is leaving for a ‘permitted reason’ (this includes, but is not limited to, redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability). If the Executive Director is leaving for a permitted reason, the unvested award will vest after the deferral period in line with the other awards. However, the number of matching shares to be released to a good leaver will
be pro-rated based on the proportion of the performance period that has been completed and the level of the performance conditions that have been met up to that date.

 Strategic Report
Other Information
  LTPP – under the rules of the LTPP, unless the Executive Director is deemed by the Committee to be a ‘good leaver’ (as previously defined) any LTPP awards held by him will lapse on cessation of his employment. If he is a ‘good leaver’, the number of shares subject to the award will be pro-rated based on the proportion of the performance period that has been completed by him. No shares will, however, be released to the Executive Director, until the normal vesting date, being three years from the date of grant. During this time the shares will continue to be subject to the relevant performance conditions until the end of the performance period, at which point the Committee will test the performance conditions and determine how much, if any, of the remaining shares will vest.
Change of control – the rules of each share scheme operated by the Company contain provisions relating to a change of control. In the event that a change of control does occur any unvested options/awards will become vested on the date of the relevant event. However, the number of options/awards that vest will be pro-rated depending on the remaining time span of the relevant performance period and the level of performance conditions achieved during that period. Options/awards which have already vested as at the date of the relevant event may still be exercised within the prescribed timescales set out in the rules.
Non-Executive directorships
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to accept one Non-Executive directorship outside the Company and retain any fees received from such a position.
Executive Directors are not allowed to take on the Chairmanship of any FTSE 100 company. Board approval will not be given for any Non-Executive position where such appointment would lead to a material conflict of interest or would have an adverse effect on the Director’s ability
to perform their duties to the Company.
Gifts to Directors on leaving employment
The Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to long serving Directors who are retiring or who are considered by the Board to be leaving in good faith e.g. those leaving office for any reason other than dismissal or misconduct. The value of the gift for any one Director shall be limited to a maximum of £5,000 and where a tax liability is incurred on such a gift the Committee has the discretion to approve the payment of such liability on behalf of the Director in addition
to this maximum limit.
Legacy arrangements
In approving the Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any previously disclosed commitments entered into with current or former Directors including, but not limited to, payment of pensions or the vesting/exercise of past share awards.
Clawback and Malus
Both the annual bonus (including any deferred bonus and any matching element) and the LTPP are subject to the Company’s power of clawback and malus (‘Clawback’) for a period of two years following vesting. 'Clawback' is applicable in respect of any annual bonus paid/deferred and to any share awards granted under the LTPP or the ESOS from 30 June 2010 onwards, subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to such approval. In addition, 'Clawback' will also apply to any awards granted under any Senior Management share schemes.
Clawback can be invoked if:
a) it is necessary to restate the Group’s accounts used to calculate a participant’s entitlement to bonus or share awards in circumstances where the original over-statement has led to a bonus being paid/deferred or share awards being granted which would not otherwise have been paid or granted; or
b) the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in connection with his or her employment and this related to an act which led to a bonus being paid/deferred or share awards being granted to him or her.
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the bonus and/or share award will be retrospectively recalculated. If bonus monies have been paid, the participant will be required to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid, less
any bonus that the Committee determines would have been paid regardless of the event in question. If share awards have been granted, the number of awards or options granted will
be reduced accordingly. If the award has vested and shares have been issued to the participant, the participant will be required to repay the value of the relevant number of shares based
on the Company’s closing share price as at the date the shares were issued.

  Annual bonus
For the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to earn an annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary, 135% of which is based on the attainment of Group performance targets and 15% on personal objectives, both of which are linked directly to the Group’s strategy. Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary is deferred into shares for a period of three years. All targets, Group and personal, were agreed towards the beginning of the financial year. The Group performance targets which applied to the bonus for FY16 and the level of bonus achieved were as follows:

 1 Theactualearningspershareof55.1pencehasbeenrebasedusingthecorporationtaxrateapplicableatthedateonwhichthe2013/14LTPP targets were set, as the subsequent reduction to the rate of corporation tax was not performance related. The actual earnings per share has also been rebased using the same number of shares in issue as used in the 2013/14 LTPP targets. The rebased earnings per share used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly comparable to the 2013/14 LTPP targets, was 55.8 pence.
The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied that given the continued improvement in the Group’s financial results, the above level of vesting of the 2013/14 LTPP was justified. Accordingly, the gross number of shares to be released to each of the Executive Directors are as follows:

The 2015/16 LTPP is subject to three performance conditions, one-third TSR, one-third EPS and one-third ROCE. The levels of vesting against TSR are measured over a three-year period commencing 1 July 2015, and against EPS and ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2018. Once the performance test has been completed, assuming shares vest, they will be subject
to a further two-year holding period. The performance against targets for these awards
in addition to previous awards are set out on page 89.
CFO Scheme
In December 2015, the Company granted the following awards to Neil Cooper. These awards were designed in quantum to compensate for awards which were forfeited by Neil on leaving his previous employment. They were structured to mirror the vesting timescales and performance conditions of the Company’s awards made in 2013 and 2014, so his incentives are aligned with those of the other Executive Directors. Shares that vest on 20 October 2017 are subject to a two-year holding period commencing 1 July 2017. These performance based share awards were structured as share options with a nominal exercise price of the par value of the Company’s shares of 10 pence per share.

Other Information
  At 30 June 2016, both David Thomas and Steven Boyes have met the shareholding requirement. In accordance with the Policy, Neil Cooper has until 23 November 2020 to meet the
relevant requirement.
The interests of the Directors serving during the financial year and their connected persons
in the ordinary share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year are shown in Table 15 below. No notification has been received of any change in the interests shown during the period 30 June 2016 to 7 September 2016 inclusive, with the exception of the shares to be deferred in respect of the bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary by Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 the details of which can be found on page 87.
To be classified as a ‘good leaver’ from the Company, the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors, will be required to commit to continue retaining a Total Shareholding of 100% and 75% respectively of the value of their final salary in the Company’s shares for two years post their leaving date.
 Table 14 – Performance of current LTPP plans against targets
Given the commercial sensitivity of the EPS and ROCE targets set for the 2014/15 and 2015/16 LTPPs to the Group’s future strategy, the Committee agreed that it would not publish these targets prospectively but would set out performance against the targets on an annual basis. The metrics and performance to date against the targets set at the outset of the awards are shown below:

     Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited)
For the financial year ended 30 June 2016 Executive Directors were required to hold shares in the Company equivalent in value to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the other Directors. In addition the Executive Directors were also required to have a minimum owned shareholding in the Group (see page 82 for definition) of 67% salary for the Chief Executive and 50% for other Executive Directors. The Chief Executive and other Executive Directors are expected to meet this requirement no later than the fifth anniversary of joining the Board, with progress being made throughout the period. Participants who have not built up the required level of ‘Owned and Total Shareholdings’ by the end of the defined period, will not be eligible for inclusion in future share-based incentive schemes nor will they be allowed to sell shares until they reach the levels specified, unless exceptional circumstances exist in the opinion of the Committee.

  Dilution
On maturity or vesting of any of its share incentive schemes the Company satisfies the awards through: a new issue of shares; market purchases; or the Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’). During the financial year ended 30 June 2016, the Company continued to satisfy all outstanding Executive options and awards under the LTPP, 2009/10 ESOS, the DBP and the Sharesave through a new issue of shares, subject to the dilution limits described below. Awards made to individuals below Senior Management level continued to be satisfied through shares currently held, or to be purchased in the market, by the EBT.
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued under its schemes and the impact on dilution limits. The Company is satisfied that as at 30 June 2016 its usage of shares is compliant with the relevant dilution limits set by the Investment Association in respect of all share plans (10% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period) and discretionary share plans (5% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period). In the event that the outstanding options under each of the schemes to be satisfied through a new issue of shares were to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2016, the resulting issue of new shares would represent 1.9% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date.
Executive Directors’ pension arrangements
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that on joining the Group they will be auto-enrolled unless they choose to opt-out. Upon opting-out, the Executive Director may choose to receive a cash supplement (which does not count for incentive purposes) and/or participate
in the Company’s defined contribution money purchase pension plan. Each of the Executive Directors has opted to receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension, which for FY16 was equal to 25% of base salary and is in line with market practice. The Remuneration Committee felt it was appropriate to reduce the Executive Directors' pension entitlements to 25% base salary in order to better align with market practice. Only the base salary element of a Director’s remuneration
is pensionable.
Defined benefit section
Steven Boyes was a deferred member of the defined benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) during the year ended 30 June 2016.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001 and on 30 June 2009, the Company exercised its consent under the rules of the Scheme and agreed to cease offering future accrual of defined benefits for current members. Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the defined contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
Until 30 June 2009, Steven Boyes was an active member of the defined benefit section of the Scheme. This entitlement was based on a 1/60 accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65. Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes has been entitled to receive a cash supplement equal to 25% (30% prior to 1 July 2015) of his base salary per annum.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2013 showed a deficit of £34.8m calculated on the basis of the Scheme’s technical provisions. The Company and the Trustees of the Scheme have agreed a plan to address the shortfall which requires the Company to continue to make deficit reduction payments of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015, followed by payments of £9.5m per annum from 1 December 2015 until 31 December 2016.
It is expected that the Company will continue to make deficit reduction payments at this level until 28 February 2018 (or until the Scheme reaches full funding on its long term funding
basis, if earlier). The Company will discuss the funding requirements of the Scheme with the Trustees alongside the next actuarial valuation of the Scheme which is due on 30 November 2016. The valuation for the Financial Statements was updated to 30 June 2016 by a qualified independent actuary and a surplus of £8.1m (2015: surplus of £5.3m) is included in the Group Balance Sheet as shown in note 6.2.2 of the Financial Statements.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for an insured lump sum of up to five times pensionable salary on death in service. Current employees who were members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme at closure also retain their dependants’ pension entitlements.
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to or are receivable by current and/or past Directors in respect of their qualifying services during the financial year and there are no arrangements in place that guarantee pensions with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
Payments to former Directors and those leaving the Group (Audited)
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: £nil) except otherwise disclosed in this Remuneration Report. Also, no payments were made to any former Directors during the year ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: £nil) except otherwise disclosed in this Remuneration report.
Upon his retirement, Mark Clare received leaving gifts totalling £4,990, with any tax due on this payment being settled by the Company.

  Non-Executive directorships
Since joining the Board, Neil Cooper received a total fee of £39,016 in respect of his position as a Non-Executive Director of Pennon Group PLC. He has retained this fee in full. Neither David Thomas nor Steven Boyes held any Non-Executive directorships with other companies during the year.
Advice/advisers
In carrying out its principal responsibilities, the Committee has the authority to obtain the advice of external independent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible for their appointment, retention and termination. During the year, the Committee has taken advice from independent advisers, New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a part of Aon plc. NBS was initially appointed by the Committee as its remuneration consultant in 2008 and is a founder signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct. In addition to advising the Committee, NBS also provided the Company with advice on implementing decisions made by the Committee and remuneration benchmarking. NBS’s fees for providing such advice amounted to £40,489 (2015: £54,344) for the year ended 30 June 2016. In line with best practice, the Committee assesses, from time to time, whether the appointment remains appropriate or if it should be
put out to tender as part of its effectiveness review. NBS’s appointment was reconfirmed by the Committee in June 2016 after an annual review of the quality of the advice received and fees charged. The Committee is comfortable that the NBS engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have any connections with the Company that may impair their independence or objectivity. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflict of interests and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Aon plc also provided broking services to the Company in respect of private medical insurance, Death in Service benefits and Group Income Protection.
The Committee also receives input into its decision making from the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director, none of whom were present at any time when their own remuneration was being considered.
Membership and attendance at Committee meetings
The Committee operates within terms of reference (the ‘Terms of Reference’) and governance policies approved annually by the Board and in accordance with the Code.
Membership of the Committee and attendance at each of its scheduled meetings during the year is set out in Table 20.

Statement of implementation of the Policy for FY17
Executive Directors’ remuneration for FY17 will be based on the Group’s remuneration strategy as summarised on pages 80 to 85 and will be implemented in accordance with the Policy
as follows:
Base salary
The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries in June 2016. In reviewing these salaries the Committee had regard to: the performance of the Executive Directors during the year; the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the business, the increases awarded to other members of staff and the multiplier effect of an increase in base salary on the package as a whole. The salaries of the Executive Directors at the beginning of the financial year were as follows:

Following these increases Executive Directors’ salaries remain within the range for the housebuilding sector and the wider population of similar sized companies.

 Pension
Each of the Executive Directors has opted to receive a cash salary supplement in lieu of a pension of 25% annual salary.
Annual bonus
Executive Directors and Senior Management will participate in the Group’s annual bonus scheme in accordance with the Policy. The performance measures, the reasons for selecting these measures and the maximum bonus payment against each of them expressed as a percentage
of salary for FY17 will be:
The Committee will continue to have an overriding discretion in respect of any bonus payment in accordance with its Remuneration Policy. In addition, any bonus awarded for FY17 will be subject to Malus and Clawback (see page 85).
LTPP
The level of the LTPP award to be granted to Executive Directors and Senior Management during FY17 will be in line with that set out in the Policy. The Committee is cognisant that such an award should be subject to performance targets which are stretching and challenging whilst aligned with the short and long term performance of the Group and total shareholder return. Accordingly, the Committee has agreed that the extent to which the LTPP award to be granted in FY17 (the ‘2016/17 LTPP’) will vest, will be dependent on three independent performance conditions as follows:

  * Any bonus earned in aggregate in excess of 100% will continue to be deferred into shares and held in the DBP. The Committee has agreed that no matching shares will be awarded against any deferred shares in respect of FY17.
The Group’s profitability remains a key measure, however, in order to drive sustainable value this must be achieved through an appropriate capital structure and in line with the risk profile of the business. The annual bonus performance measures have been reviewed against last year’s and the following changes have been made to align them with the Company’s strategy:
> moved the health and safety measure to an underpin of the customer service metric to create a single quality service metric to encourage the maintenance of a high quality product whilst preserving the safety of all employees and individuals on site.
> personal objectives have been given an increased weighting to enhance focus on the achievement of outcomes that support the strategy of the Group. Consequently, the other metrics have been reweighted to maintain an appropriate balance between each of them.
Annual Bonus, EPS and ROCE performance targets
The Company is of the view that the individual annual bonus performance metrics together
with the EPS and ROCE targets for the 2016/17 LTPP are commercially sensitive in terms of the Group’s future strategy and therefore these targets will not be disclosed in this report. We will, as always disclose the annual bonus metrics and performance against them in next year's report. We will also provide an update on EPS and ROCE performance against targets on an annual basis in line with feedback that we receive from shareholders on the disclosure in respect of the 2014/15 LTPP and 2015/16 LTPP. The annual bonus metrics and the specific target range for the 2016/17 LTPP will remain designed to incentivise significant performance improvement across the business, deliver a strong return to shareholders and represent a stretching target for Executive Directors and Senior Management. When setting the annual bonus metrics and the target range for the 2016/17 LTPP, the Committee will take into account the Board’s assessment of the optimal scale of business, the Group’s ROCE target and current market consensus.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Board reviewed the fees for the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and concluded that in order to ensure that the base fee level remains competitive in the market,
they should be increased to £305,000 per annum for the Chairman and £58,000 per annum for Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 July 2016. The additional fees for the Chairmen of the Committees and to the Senior Independent Director remain the same.

Related party transactions
The Board and certain members of Senior Management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules (‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference between transactions with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key personnel of the Group.
During the year, the Company entered into the following transaction(s) which, for the purposes of IAS 24, is considered to be a ‘related party transaction’:
Transaction 1
As outlined in the Annual Report and Accounts for FY15, in August 2014, Mark Clare (at the time, Group Chief Executive) reserved a flat (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf LLP, a joint venture partnership between BDW Trading Limited (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London and Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a purchase price of £1,692,350. This purchase was conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on four independent market valuations and similar comparable transactions at that time. An amount of £2,500 was paid on reservation and a deposit of £166,735 was paid on 13 October 2014. The remaining balance was paid on completion on 17 June 2016 in accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trading. Fulham Wharf LLP is not controlled by and is not a ‘subsidiary undertaking’ of the Company.
Transaction 2
In June 2016, David Thomas notified the Board that he and one of his connected persons intended to buy one property each at the BDW Trading Limited site at Cane Hill, Coulsdon, Surrey (the ‘Transactions’).
Property 1
David Thomas intends to purchase a Barratt showhome on a sale and licence back basis.
Sale and licence back transactions are carried out on showhomes in the ordinary course of business and are normally for a period of two years. The purchase price of the property is £579,995 (which includes an upgraded kitchen, flooring, lighting, built-in wardrobe and soft furnishings). The sale and licence back is for a minimum of two years with an annual rental of 6%. David Thomas will also be purchasing all of the furniture and fittings displayed in the showhome for an agreed price of £4,000. The anticipated completion date is end of November 2016.
Property 2
David Thomas’ connected person is proposing to purchase, in the ordinary course of business, a David Wilson home from BDW Trading Limited at a purchase price of £545,000 together with a number of customer extras with a value not exceeding £18,000. The anticipated completion date is the end of January 2017.
Both of the Transactions are being conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on an independent market valuation and similar comparable transactions at the time. Neither of the properties have been exchanged. A 10% deposit will be payable on exchange, with the remaining balance being payable on legal completion in November 2016 and January 2017 respectively,
in accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trading.
 Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Act and any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company is ultimately managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to the management of the business of the Company or otherwise. In particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, property, assets and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities and to give security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company to any third party.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
At the date of this Annual Report and Accounts, there are qualifying third party indemnity provisions governed by the Act in place under which the Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary, together with those who have held or hold these positions as officers of other Group companies or of associate or affiliated companies and members of the Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and the Articles, against all liability arising in respect of any act or omission in the course of performing their duties. In addition, the Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for each Director of the Group and its associated companies.
No Director of the Company or of any associated company shall be accountable to the Company or the members for any benefit provided pursuant to the Articles and receipt of any such benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a Director of the Company.

Other Information
  So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (that is, information needed by the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing its report) of which the Company’s auditor is not aware.
Each Director has taken all reasonable steps that they ought to have taken in accordance with their duty as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Act.
Political donations and expenditure
No political donations or expenditure were made or incurred during the year (2015: £nil).
Offices
The Group had 29 offices (excluding those offices undertaking an administrative function only) located throughout Britain at the end of the financial year. The Group also has a representative office in Beijing and Shanghai, China. A full list of the Group’s offices and their locations can be obtained from the Company Secretary at the Company's registered office or from its website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of 10 pence each. All issued shares are in registered form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s issued share capital and of the movements in the share capital during the year can be found in note 5.6 to the Financial Statements on page 145. Subject to the Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ rights, shares are at the disposal of the Board. At each AGM the Board seeks authorisation
from its shareholders to allot shares. At the AGM held on 11 November 2015, the Directors were given authority to allot shares up to a nominal value of £33,199,348 (representing one-third of the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital as at 30 September 2015), such authority to remain valid until the end of the 2016 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 10 February 2017. A resolution to renew this authority will be proposed at the 2016 AGM.

Other statutory disclosures continued
 On notification by David Thomas of the Transactions, the Board sought advice from its legal advisers and Corporate brokers/sponsors in respect of the application of Chapter 11 and section 190 of the Act (Substantial Property Transaction) (‘Section 190’) to the Transactions. The advice received concluded that the Transactions, both individually and combined, were exempt from the provisions of Chapter 11, due to being classified as a ‘Small Transaction’. However, the Transactions are above the threshold prescribed by Section 190. As David Thomas is a Director of the Company, which is not a wholly owned subsidiary, shareholder approval is required before the Transactions can be completed. Accordingly, in June 2016, the Board approved the Transactions subject to shareholder approval being obtained. The relevant resolution will be included in the Notice of AGM for consideration and, if deemed fit, approval by shareholders in November 2016. David Thomas will enter into the contracts subject to such approval being obtained.
No other related party transactions that require disclosure, have been entered into during the year under review.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the Board may decide.
Subject to the Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to any existing class of shares may be varied either with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Voting
Subject to any special terms as to voting upon any shares which may be issued or may at the relevant time be held, every member present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or class meeting has one vote upon a show of hands or, upon a poll vote, one vote for every share of which such member is a holder. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the other joint holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding.
In accordance with the Act, each member is entitled to appoint one or more proxies, and in the case of corporations, more than one corporate representative to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. The timescales for appointing proxies are set out in the Notice of the 2016 AGM.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of
any shares held by them if any call or other sum then payable by them in respect of that share remains unpaid or if they have been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act.
Transfer of shares
Shares in the Company may be in uncertificated or certificated form. Title to uncertificated shares may be transferred by means of a relevant system and certificated shares may be transferred by an instrument of transfer as approved by the Board. The transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into the Company’s register of members.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares except as follows. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules (as defined in the Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four.

 Strategic Report
Other Information
  The Board may decline to register a transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one class of share; (iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees; or (iv) where the transfer is requested by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been served with a restriction notice after failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act, unless the transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale (as defined in the Articles).
There are no special control rights in relation to the Company’s shares and the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.
Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares
At the Company’s AGM held on 11 November 2015, shareholders gave authority to the Company to buy back up to an aggregate of 99,598,040 ordinary shares (representing 10% of the Company’s issued share capital). This authority is valid until the end of the 2016 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 10 February 2017. Under the authority there is a minimum and maximum price to be paid for such shares. Any shares which are bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, will be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the Company’s issued share capital.
No purchases had been made under this authority as at the date of this Annual Report and Accounts. A resolution renewing the authority will be proposed at the 2016 AGM.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends for payment to the holders of the ordinary shares of 10 pence each,
of an amount which does not exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividends, whenever the financial position of the Company justify their payment in the opinion of the Board. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25% interest if such person has been served with a restriction notice after failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act.
Shareholder arrangements to waive dividends
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds ordinary shares in the Company for the purpose of satisfying options and awards that have been granted under the various employee share schemes operated by the Company. Details of the shares so held are set out in note 5.6 to the Financial Statements.
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend payments on shares held within the EBT and these shares do not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares used to calculate EPS until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee.
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may take into account both financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants.
Employee share schemes
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 6.3 to the Financial Statements. Details of long term incentive schemes for the Directors are shown in the Remuneration report
on pages 76 to 97.
Employment policy and involvement
(i) Employment and diversity
The Group is committed to seeking to develop the talents of its employees so that they can maximise their career potential and providing rewarding careers in an atmosphere that engenders equal opportunities for all. Selection for employment and promotion is based on merit, following an objective assessment of ability and experience of candidates, after giving full and fair consideration to all applications (including individuals with disabilities). The Group is also committed to ensuring that its workplaces are free from discrimination. The Group strives to ensure that its policies and practices provide equal opportunities in respect of issues such
as training, career development and promotion for all existing or potential staff irrespective of gender, race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. Every effort is made to retain and support employees who become disabled whilst working within the Group. Further details on Group's diversity initiatives are available in the Sustainability Report which is available from www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/sustainability/ our-reports.
(ii) Employee engagement
The Board recognises that appropriate employee engagement is a key factor in the long term success of the Group. It utilises a comprehensive employee engagement programme with the aim of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are invited to take part in an online engagement survey each year. The results of this survey are fed back to each operating division who use the results to formulate plans for maintaining or improving engagement in the following year. We continue to report high levels of engagement, with scores remaining within the top quartile of IBM’s database this year at 77%.

 (iii) Employee communications
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. The Company seeks to ensure that all significant events, economic factors and financial updates and the impact of these on the performance of the Group are communicated to employees. This is mainly channelled through the Group’s intranet and the use of email alerts, core briefings and regular newsletters. Additionally, the Chief Executive regularly briefs senior and middle management via conference calls and bulletins which gives them the opportunity to ask questions and enter into dialogue. Individually and collectively, the Board and the Executive Committee members visit operating divisions and sites frequently in order to assess operational performance, engage with employees on a one-to-one basis and gain first-hand experience of employees’ aspirations
and concerns.
(iv) Future talent
The Group runs a number of programmes for new entrants through our ‘Future Talent strategy’. The Group currently has 73 graduates across our two-year and one-year schemes, 46 of which commenced their training in September 2015. In addition, 74 delegates are currently on our bespoke Foundation Degree in Residential Development and Construction in partnership
with Sheffield Hallam University. We are currently training 451 Trade, Technical, Commercial and other apprentices/trainees and 13 undergraduate students on a paid 12-month industrial placement programme.
(v) Employee training and development
The Group has a suite of leadership and management development programmes aimed at all levels within the organisation. The programmes are designed and delivered internally and are tailored to the needs of the business.
The Group also offers the Barratt Academy, a staged programme to enable employee development from apprentice to site manager as well as within the areas of customer service (new in FY16), our technical and commercial academies have been enhanced and we are making a significant investment into our IT training provision. Succession planning is in place across the Group and the leadership programmes assist with the development of individuals as part of this process. In addition, we have continued to provide development centres for those employees with high potential.
(vi) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In April 2016, the Company invited all eligible employees of the Group to participate in the seventh grant under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘2016 Sharesave’) which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held in November 2008. The invitations for the 2016 Sharesave allowed eligible employees to contribute a maximum of £500 per month in one or a combination of Sharesave schemes. This enabled those individuals who had participated in previous grants under the Sharesave the opportunity to increase their savings and gave other employees (new and existing) the chance to participate and further
align their interests with the performance of the Group. At 30 June 2016, approximately 60%
of employees participate in one or more of the active Sharesave schemes.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) contain regulations which deal with matters such as the appointment and removal of Directors, Directors’ interests and proceedings at general and Board meetings. Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of a special resolution at a general meeting.
Approach to tax and tax governance
For all taxes, it is the Group’s aim to ensure it accurately calculates and pays the tax that is due at the correct time. Whilst the Group does seek to minimise its tax liabilities through the use of legitimate routine tax planning, it does not participate in aggressive tax planning schemes. The Group also seeks to be transparent in its dealings with HM Revenue & Customs and has regular dialogue with its representatives to discuss both developments in the business and the ongoing tax position.
The Chief Financial Officer retains overall responsibility for oversight of the tax affairs of the Group. David Thomas, in his capacity of Chief Executive and Interim Finance Director, was the named Senior Accounting Officer until 31 December 2015 at which time, Neil Cooper assumed the responsibility. The Senior Accounting Officer receives regular updates on the tax position. In addition, taxation is discussed by the Audit Committee at least annually.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a change of control of the Company:
> The revolving credit facility agreement dated 14 May 2013 (as amended on 17 December
2014 and 30 June 2016) made between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds Bank Plc (as the facility agent) and the banks and financial institutions named therein as lenders (the ‘Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’) contains a prepayment provision at the election of
each lender on change of control. The Company must notify the facility agent promptly upon becoming aware of the change of control. After the occurrence of a change of control, the facility agent shall (if a lender so requests within 20 days of being notified of the change of control) by notice to the Company, on the date falling 30 days after the change of control, cancel the commitment of such lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and declare all amounts outstanding in respect of such lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement immediately due and payable. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a provision such that, following a change of control, a lender is not obliged to fund any further drawdown of the facility (other than rollover loans). For these purposes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if any person or group of persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) gains control (as defined in the Corporation Tax Act 2010)
of the Company.

  > Each of the note purchase agreements entered into in respect of the Group’s privately placed notes (being the US$80m of notes issued pursuant to the following note purchase agreements: (i) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$15m notes dated 10 May 2011
(as amended and restated on 14 May 2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014); and
(ii) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$65m notes also dated 10 May 2011 (as amended and restated on 14 May 2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014)) contains a change of control prepayment provision. Each such control provision provides that promptly after the Company becomes aware that a change of control has occurred, the Company shall notify all the holders of the notes of the same and give the noteholders the option to require
the Company to prepay at par all outstanding amounts (principal and interest) under the notes. If a noteholder accepts such offer of prepayment, such prepayment shall take place on a business day that is not more than 90 days after the Company notified the noteholders of the change of control. For these purposes a ‘change of control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group of persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) such that they gain beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of the Company carrying voting rights.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving
the Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least
12 months from the date of these Financial Statements (more information on the Going Concern judgement can be found on page 115). For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these Financial Statements.

> The £100m term facility agreement between, amongst others, the Company and Prudential/ M&G UK Companies Financing Fund LP dated 10 May 2011 (as amended and restated on
14 May 2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014) also contains a prepayment provision on a change of control at the election of each lender; such prepayment provision is the same as that described for the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (save for the fact that the term loan is fully drawn and so the restrictions on drawing described for the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not apply).
> Each of the debt facility agreements (based on a proforma agreement agreed in October 2012) between the Company (as guarantor), BDW (as borrower and developer) and the Homes and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) (as lender), whereby the HCA has made up to £33m (in aggregate) of project financing available to fund up to 20 development sites, contains a provision requiring BDW to obtain the consent of the HCA on a change in control of the Company, BDW or any
of their holding companies (if relevant). The HCA is entitled to withhold its consent to such a change in control if the new controller does not have sufficient reputation, financial standing or organisational standing and capacity. A failure to: (i) obtain the HCA’s consent to a change
in control; and (ii) provide the HCA with notice of the change in control within a specified time period, is an event of default under each of these agreements. On such an event of default the HCA may, by notice in writing to BDW, terminate each debt facility agreement and require BDW to prepay the project financing. For these purposes a ‘change in control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group of persons acting together such that they gain beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital or voting rights of the relevant company, have the right to appoint the majority of the Directors of the relevant company or otherwise control the votes at Board meetings of the relevant company.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes, such as the transfer being subject to a de minimis amount.

  Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Fair, balanced and understandable
 Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts including the Directors’ remuneration report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
The Directors are required by the International Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS Regulation’) to prepare the Group Financial Statements under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. The Financial Statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Directors must not approve the Accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Financial Statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances,
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
> properly select and apply accounting policies;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,
comparable and understandable information;
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
> make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Board considers, on the advice of the Audit Committee, that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ responsibility statement

 Opinion on financial statements of Barratt Developments PLC
In our opinion:
> the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
> the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
> the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
> the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Accounting Policies, the Impact of Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet Effective, the Critical Accounting Judgements and
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty and the related notes 1 to 7.4. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis contained within note 1.3 on page 115 and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained on page 43. We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
> the directors’ confirmation on page 43 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
> the disclosures on pages 42–45 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
> the directors’ statement on page 103 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
> the directors’ explanation on page 43 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as
a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
At 30 June 2016, the balance of directly held available for sale financial assets is no longer material to the Group. We have therefore removed this as a focus area of our audit.

     Risk
  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
 Carrying value of land and work in progress – land £2,880.2m (2015: £2,826.1m), work in progress £1,386.3m (2015: £1,287.4m)
Refer to page 69 (Audit Committee Statement) , page 123 (Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty) and note 3.1 (financial statement disclosures)
  The Group’s assessment of the carrying value of land and work in progress, being the lower of cost and net realisable value, is a judgemental process. This requires the estimation of selling prices, sales rates and costs to complete, determined on a site by site basis. These factors drive the gross margin for each site and hence the profit recognised at the point of sale.
The outcome of the EU referendum has resulted in greater political and economic uncertainty which may impact selling prices, sales rates and build costs, especially in the longer term. Such assumptions impact the Group’s assessments on the carrying value of land and work in progress.
The net impairment charge for the year was £8.6m (2015: £11.7m).
In addition, revenue recognition on social housing developments accounted for under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ requires additional judgement in calculating the revenue and profit to be recognised, estimating the total expected costs to complete each site and the percentage of completion at the balance sheet date.
Our work involved the following:
> Wehavetestedthedesign,implementationandoperatingeffectivenessoftheGroup’scontrolsrelatingtothedeterminationofcoststocompleteasthisisthemostsignificantjudgementappliedto
each site valuation. We attended a number of valuation meetings across all regions that review the carrying value of land and work in progress of individual sites. A sample of sites were also visited to enable us to verify how surveyors measure the degree of build completion of the developments against the costs incurred to date and to measure the subcontractor accruals at the year end.
> Formulti-phasedsiteswehaveperformedprocedurestovalidatetheappropriatenessofactualandforecastmarginmaintainedacrosstheindividualphasesoftheentiresite.
> We have reviewed the land acquisition appraisal process and viability assessment at acquisition and tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls.
> We have sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred to date included within land and work in progress as well as reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year in respect of units sold.
> WehaveusedITinterrogationtoolstotestthemodelpreparedbyManagementtocalculatethenetrealisablevalueofsitestoascertainthemechanicalaccuracyoftheformulaebeingapplied to the inputs to specific sites.
> WehavetestedeachofthekeyassumptionswithinManagement’smodelonforecastsalesvalues,salesratesandcoststocompletewhichsupportthebasisofthecarryingvalueofland and work in progress. We have compared the Group’s assumptions to external market forecasts for sales price inflation and build cost inflation and have tested a sample of sites to current market data on sales rates, sales prices and cost assumptions. We have also tested the accuracy of costs to complete assumptions on a sample basis.
> Wehaveperformedindependentsensitivityanalysis,informedbyexternalforecasts,tomeasuretheimpactonthecarryingvalueoflandandworkinprogressthroughpossibledeviations around the assumptions applied by management. This included consideration of the outcome of the EU referendum.
> A sample of construction contracts for social housing developments have been tested by verifying the costs incurred to date and recalculating the percentage of completion at the balance sheet date. A selection of these schemes have been reviewed with a sample of costs agreed to third party surveyors’ certificates, total sales values agreed to contracts, and the recognition formula verified to support revenue recognised.
> WehavereviewedtheappropriatenessoftheGroup’sdisclosureswithintheAnnualReportandFinancialStatementsrelatingtotheestimationuncertainty.
  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – goodwill £792.2m (2015: £792.2m), intangible assets £100m (2015: £100m)
Refer to page 69 (Audit Committee Statement) , page 129 (Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty) and note 4.2 (financial statement disclosures)
  The goodwill and David Wilson Homes brand intangible asset arose upon the acquisition of Wilson Bowden (see note 4.2).
The Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is a judgemental process which requires estimates concerning the forecast future cash flows associated with the goodwill and brand assets held, the discount rates and the growth rate of revenue and costs to be applied in determining the value in use.
As described in the previous significant risk, the outcome of the EU referendum has resulted in greater political and economic uncertainty which may impact selling prices, sales rates and build costs, especially in the longer term.
There were no impairments in the current year (2015: £nil).
Our work involved the following:
> WehaveassessedthedesignandimplementationoftheGroup’scontrolsrelatingtoManagement’simpairmentreviewofgoodwillandintangibleassets.
> We have tested the accuracy of the underlying model to assess whether the processes are applied to the correct input data and the outputs are mapped accurately.
> Wechallengedeachofthekeyassumptionsemployedintheannualgoodwillimpairmenttest.Thisincludedreferencetoourinternalvaluationspecialists’benchmarkingofthe weighted average cost of capital rate (‘WACC’) employed as the discount rate employed, including its methodology and constituent inputs, comparison to independent market forecasts of revenue and cost growth in the housebuilding sector and an assessment of the Group’s historic forecasting accuracy.
> We have tested Management’s sensitivity analysis in relation to the key inputs to the goodwill impairment test model, as well as performing our own sensitivity analysis which included changes to volume, margin, incentives and the discount rate applied. This included consideration of the outcome of the EU referendum.
> We have reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
 These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

   Our application of materiality
Independent Auditors Report continued
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £33.5 million (2015: £27.6 million), which is determined based on 5.0% (2015: 5.0%) of statutory pre-tax profit. Profit before tax was used as the benchmark because this it is a key performance indicator for the group’s stakeholders and is consistent with the benchmark used for comparable companies.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.7 million (2015: £0.55 million), as well as differences below that threshold that,
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the
Group level. The entire Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor. The audit is performed centrally and comprises all of the divisions which comprise the Group’s housebuilding segment, the Group’s commercial developments segment and the head
office consolidation. Consistent with prior years, we choose to visit the Group’s three London housebuilding divisions each year, as well as five further non-London housebuilding divisions across each of the Group’s regions, selected on a rotational basis and with reference to size and complexity among other factors. We also visit Wilson Bowden Developments Limited on an annual basis, which constitutes the Group’s commercial developments segment.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
> the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
> the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
> we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
> adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
> the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
> materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
> apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge
of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

   Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

  Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 30 June 2016 1.2 Basis of consolidation
  Section
1
Basis of preparation
  1.1 Introduction
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations as adopted and endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore the Group Financial Statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards Regulation. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, derivative financial instruments and share-based payments.
The Group Financial Statements include the results of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Company’), incorporated in the UK, and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June. The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when control passes to the Group using the purchase method of accounting and up to the date control ceases. All transactions with subsidiaries and intercompany profits or losses are eliminated
on consolidation.
1.3 Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors consider are likely
to affect its future development, financial performance and financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 45. The material financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may have an impact upon the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 42 to 45 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital
risk are outlined in note 5.5 to the Financial Statements.
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained in the Risk Management section on pages 41
to 45, factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group include changes in the macroeconomic environment including buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the Group’s customers and interest rates.
The Group has total committed bank facilities and private placement notes of £848.3m. The final maturity dates of these facilities range from August 2017 to July 2021, with £150.0m of the revolving credit facility maturing in December 2017 and £550.0m of the revolving credit facility maturing in December 2019. The committed facilities and private placement notes provide appropriate headroom above our current forecast debt requirements.
In addition to these committed borrowing facilities the Group has £22.5m of financing from
the Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ and ‘Growing Places Fund’ schemes. The outstanding funds are repayable between December 2016 and March 2018. Further committed loan facilities of £4.6m are available under agreements with local government which are due to be repaid between March 2018 and March 2020.
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these Financial Statements.
   Group accounting policies
The significant Group accounting policies are included within the relevant notes to the Financial Statements on pages 115 to 164.
   Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The Directors have made no individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the Financial Statements, apart from those involving estimations.
The most significant estimates made by the Directors in these Financial Statements are set out within the relevant notes on pages 115 to 164.

  1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations, none of which have had a material impact on the Group:
> Annual Improvements Cycle 2012 – 2014
> Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment
> Amendments to IAS 38: Intangible Assets – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
> Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for the Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
> Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1)
> Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
>
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued on 28 May 2014 and amended in September 2015. This standard sets out revenue recognition conditions for the Group and will be applicable from 1 July 2018. The standard remains subject to industry interpretations and consensus. The Group has continued, but not yet completed, its assessment of the impact of the standard, on the Group. To date, we expect the standard may delay the recognition
of revenue from construction contracts and may impact upon historical five-year warranty obligations, although these will not affect the Group’s cash flows. In addition, the standard will require presentational changes to our Income Statement to show part-exchange income and expenses separately, which are currently recognised on a net basis within cost of sales, as detailed in note 2.1. It is not practical to provide an estimate of the full impact of IFRS 15 until our assessment has been completed, which we expect to be during the year ended
30 June 2017.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016 with an effective date of 1 January 2019.
The standard specifies how leases are recognised, presented, measured and disclosed.
The Group has continued, but not yet completed, its assessment of the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position. To date, we expect that the majority of the Group’s lease commitments will be brought onto the Balance Sheet together with corresponding right of use assets. This is likely to impact on the timing of the recognition of lease costs within the Income Statement although it will not affect the Group’s cash flows. It is not practical to provide an estimate of the full effect of IFRS 16 until our assessment has been completed, which we expect to be during the year ending 30 June 2017.
Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ was issued in January 2016 and will be applicable to the Group from 1 July 2017. The Amendment requires enhanced disclosures of changes in financing liabilities.
1.5 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue
>
>
but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, there were a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been published and are therefore mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016 and later periods. The Group has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The following new standards in particular are expected to have an impact upon the Group:
> IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in final form incorporating the impairment, classification and measurement requirements in July 2014 and is scheduled to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ from 1 July 2018. IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the revisions on the Group’s results and financial position, a process we expect to be finalised during the year ending 30 June 2017. Until such assessment is completed it is not practical to provide an estimate of the full effect of IFRS 9.

Results for the year and utilisation of profits
     Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ – The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured
by surveys of work performed to date. When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement immediately. The application of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total expected costs to complete for each site. The Group has in place established internal control processes to ensure that the evaluation of costs and revenues
is based upon appropriate estimates.
2.1 Revenue
The Group’s revenue derives principally from the sale of the homes we build and from the sale of commercial property.
An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:
Sale of goods
Contract accounting revenue
Revenue as stated in the Consolidated Income Statement
    Sale of goods – Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total proceeds of building and development. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The sale proceeds of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue and are recognised on a net basis within cost of sales on the basis that they are incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the Group.

Total revenue
         Contract accounting revenue – Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the outcome can be estimated reliably. Contracts are only treated as construction contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a development or property. Variations to, and claims arising in respect of, construction contracts, are included in revenue to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
    Sale of goods includes £369.9m (2015: £333.6m) of revenue generated where the sale has been achieved using part-exchange incentives.
Proceeds received on the disposal of part-exchange properties, which are not included in revenue, were £220.1m (2015: £179.7m).
Other income principally comprises the sale of freehold reversions, ground rents, property management income and management fees receivable from joint ventures.
   Lease income – The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following the completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale of the development to third parties. Rental income from these operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

  2.2 Segmental analysis
The Group consists of two separate segments for management reporting and control purposes, being housebuilding and commercial developments. The segments are considered appropriate for reporting under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ since these segments are regularly reviewed internally by the Board without further significant categorisation. The Group presents its primary segment information on the basis of these operating segments. As the Group operates in a single geographic market, Great Britain, no secondary segmentation is provided.

          Estimation of costs to complete – In order to determine the profit that the Group is able
to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units built in the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.

 2.4 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £550.3m (2015: £449.4m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, which was 998.7m (2015: 987.2m) shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £550.3m (2015: £449.4m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the year, giving a figure of 1,013.0m (2015: 1,008.4m) shares.
The earnings per share from continuing operations were as follows:

2.6Tax
All profits of the Group are subject to UK corporation tax.
The current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 20.0% (2015: 20.75%) and the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been provided in these Financial Statements at a rate of between 18.0% and 20.0% (2015: 20.0%) of the temporary differences giving rise to these assets and liabilities, dependent upon when they are expected to reverse.
2.6.1 Tax recognised in the Income Statement
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
   Tax – The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

    Deferred tax – Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity.

2.6.3 Deferred tax
All deferred tax relates to the United Kingdom and is stated on a net basis as the Group has
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.
   Deferred tax – Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

             It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands will reverse in the
12 months following the balance sheet date. Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.
In the March 2016 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the intention to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the impact of this is not included in these Financial Statements. Had the change been enacted prior to the balance sheet date, there would be no significant impact on the deferred tax liability disclosed within these Financial Statements.
In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of £2.1m (2015: £2.3m) in respect of capital and other losses because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

    Carrying value of land and work in progress continued – During the year, due to performance variations, changes in assumptions and changes to viability on individual sites, there were gross impairment charges of £11.0m (2015: £17.9m) and gross impairment reversals of £2.4m (2015: £6.2m), resulting in a net impairment charge of £8.6m (2015: £11.7m) included within profit from operations.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete. The estimation of future sales prices and costs to complete included zero net inflation for the next three years and then low single digit net inflation thereafter. During the year the Group benefited from favourable market conditions, but increased uncertainty due to Brexit. If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and estimated costs to complete, further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
The land held at the balance sheet date that has already been impaired is most sensitive to the judgements being applied and the potential for further impairment or reversal. Forecasting risk also increases in relation to those sites that are not expected to be realised in the short
to medium term.

Working capital
  3.1 Inventories
   Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of work in progress comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at discounted cost. Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs from the amount that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the Income Statement over the period of settlement.
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units built in the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs
to complete on such developments. In making these assessments, there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.

           Carrying value of land and work in progress – The Group’s principal activities are housebuilding and commercial development. The majority of the development activity is not contracted prior to the development commencing. Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance Sheet at 30 June 2016 current assets that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the balance sheet value
of land and work in progress is more than the projected lower of cost or net realisable value. During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of impairment, based upon a number of criteria including low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions. Where the estimated net realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet,
the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value.
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
3.1.2 Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2016 and included in cost of sales was £3,233.7m (2015: £2,903.5m).

The carrying values of trade and other receivables are stated after the following allowance for doubtful receivables:

2016 2015
   Trade and other receivables – Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets and are measured at amortised cost less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the Balance Sheet.
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt.
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other receivable is considered uncollectable, it is provided against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement.

The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables that are in default. The impairment recognised in cost of sales represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 5.3.

   Trade and other payables – Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded
at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
   Contract accounting – Contracts are only treated as construction contracts when they
have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a development or property. Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses. Payments received on account for construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on construction contracts. Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade payables.

          Available for sale financial assets – Available for sale financial assets are held at fair value calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the ‘effective interest rate’ method are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in
the value of the property underpinning the value of the loan or increased risk of default are considered to be objective evidence of impairment. Increases in the fair value of available
for sale assets previously subject to impairment, which can be objectively related to an event occurring after recognition of the impairment loss, are recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that they reverse the impairment loss.
                On 5 February 2016, the Group disposed of the majority of its available for sale assets to funds managed by PMM Advisers for cash of £82.9m. The fair value of these assets on disposal was £85.4m generating a loss on disposal of £2.5m. The gross value of the loans disposed of is included within the ‘Disposals (at cost)’ line and the provision against this is included in the ‘Other provision movements’ line. The valuation of these assets was based on the price expected to be achieved at disposal.
The fair value of the remaining portfolio has been calculated on a loan by loan basis using the present value of expected future cash flows of each loan.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 5.3.

Strategic Report
Other Information
      Goodwill – Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses is capitalised as an asset but reviewed for impairment at least annually (see note 4.2.3).
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash- generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination at acquisition being housebuilding and commercial developments. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then
to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
   Company investments – The Company’s interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the Company, they are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.

 4.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 4.2.2 Other intangible assets – Brands
4.2.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for the housebuilding segment.
   Brands – The Group has capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash flows. Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life on a straight-line basis.
Where a brand is capitalised with an indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that contribute to the durability of brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangible assets. Internally generated brands are not capitalised.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life brands as part of the review of the carrying value of goodwill, by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (note 4.2.3).
   Impairment of goodwill and brands – The impairment review for the goodwill of the housebuilding business and the Group’s indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires
an estimation of the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment. The value-in-use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the housebuilding business, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination of
a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The discount rate used is based on the average capital structure of the Group, current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Changes in these may impact upon the Group’s discount rate in future periods.
  Group
Brands £m
An impairment review was performed at 30 June 2016 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment. The first three years of cash flows were determined using the Group’s approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the fourth and fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the historical long term growth rate of the
UK economy.

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for an indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.
      The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7.0m prior to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets. Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

Other Information
   4.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 4.2.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles continued
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
> Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Accordingly, the rate of 14.2% (2015: 14.0%) is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate, being the Group’s estimated long term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The rate used in the 30 June 2016 impairment review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality of the Group’s borrowing requirements.
> Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
> Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
> Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future performance based upon
current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs
to complete, the housebuilding segment’s goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired.
The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by £1,424.6m (2015: £1,547.4m).
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reduced each year by 4.2% versus management expectations (2015: 4.5%
per annum) or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 4.5% (2015: 4.3%) and all other variables were held constant, then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value.
4.3 Investments in jointly controlled entities and associated entities
A jointly controlled entity (joint venture) is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such
as a partnership, in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other parties where
a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. An associated entity
is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, in which the Group holds a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
   Jointly controlled entities – Joint ventures and associated entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

1 The Group holds one joint venture investment (Barratt Wates (Horley) Limited) not in equal share, and one (Ravenscraig Limited) with more than one other party. However, in both cases, the Group has equal voting rights and control over the activities of the companies with the other parties. In addition, the Group and the other parties to the agreements only have rights to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements. These entities are therefore classified as joint ventures.
2 The Group’s interests in a number of the entities classified as joint ventures are held indirectly.
> Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) No. 2 Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group’s joint venture, Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) Limited, and is therefore classified as a joint venture of the Group.
> Aldgate Land One Limited and Aldgate Land Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group’s joint venture, Aldgate Place (GP) Limited, and are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.
> BDWZest Developments LLP, Alie Street LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP and Nine Elms LLP form a group of limited liability partnerships jointly owned (directly or indirectly) by BDWZest LLP and ZestBDW LLP, both of which are joint ventures of the Group. All of these entities are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.

Included within the Group’s share of net assets of joint ventures is a proportion of loans to the joint ventures calculated using the Group’s ownership share of £80.7m (2015: £85.7m).
The transfer of funds from the Group’s joint ventures to the Group is determined by the terms of the joint venture agreements, which specify how available funds should be applied in repaying loans and capital, and distributing profits to the partners. The joint venture agreement entered into in respect of Rose Shared Equity LLP provides for the return of the capital invested by our joint venture partner (the ‘preferred capital’) before any funds can be transferred to the Group.

As at 30 June 2016 all of the preferred capital has been repaid. BDWZest Developments LLP has an external loan arrangement, the covenants and terms of which restrict the transfer of funds from it and its subsidiaries (Alie Street LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP and Nine Elms LLP) which are guarantors, to the Group. The terms of these agreements are such that the members’ capital invested must at least match the external loan balance, limiting repayments of capital to the Group.
A number of the Group’s joint ventures prepare financial statements which are non-coterminous with the Group in order to comply with the terms of their joint venture agreements and to align with the year ends of our joint venture partners. Alie Street LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Nine Elms LLP, BDWZest Developments LLP, BDWZest LLP, ZestBDW LLP and

4.3.1 Joint ventures continued
The Company has an investment in one joint venture, Rose Shared Equity LLP.
Principal activity
Housebuilding
     Investment in joint venture containing non-current available for sale assets – Rose Shared Equity LLP holds non-current available for sale financial assets comprising interest free loans that are secured by way of a second charge on the respective property. The Group’s investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In line with the Group’s other joint venture investments, the carrying value is reviewed at each balance sheet date. This review requires estimation of the cash flows expected to be received by the Group which is based upon calculation of the fair values of the loans held by the entity including an estimate of future cash flows expected from the redemption of interest free loans, including an estimate of the market value of the property at the estimated time of redemption, and requires the determination of
a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The estimated market value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation. The estimated repayment profile is based on historic data for first time buyers selling their property. The discount rate used is consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount and duration.
    Jointly controlled operations – The Group’s share of profits and losses from its investments in jointly controlled operations is accounted for on a direct basis and is included in the Income Statement. The Group’s share of its investments, assets and liabilities is accounted for on

   Recognition – Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

   Classification and measurement – Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for sale financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of available for sale assets is determined as described in note 3.5. The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

5.3.3 Financial assets and liabilities measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value
The following tables provide an analysis of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
> Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities;
> Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
> Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
There have been no transfers of liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy and no non-recurring fair value measurements.

The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising from the Group’s operations and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors as detailed in note 5.5 to the Financial Statements. Neither the Group nor the Company enters into any derivatives for speculative purposes.

      Derivative financial instruments – Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are designated as hedging instruments, being either hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of interest rate movements or hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedged transactions.
In addition, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items.

   5.4 Derivative financial instruments – swaps continued
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had outstanding floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £122.0m (2015: £126.9m) and the Company had outstanding net floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £143.3m (2015: £158.5m). In obtaining this funding, the Group and the Company sought to achieve certainty as to the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £137.0m (2015: £137.0m) of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 5.5. After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows:
 Derivative financial instruments continued – The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months.
   Hedge accounting – The Group has adopted hedge accounting for its swaps. If it ceases to be highly probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match with the period of the interest rate swaps or if the cross currency hedges cease to be highly effective, any changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, rather than equity.

       The Group includes foreign exchange swaps within net debt. These swaps were entered into
to hedge the foreign exchange exposure upon the Group’s US Dollar denominated private placement notes. The Group’s foreign exchange swaps have both an interest rate and an exchange rate element and only the exchange rate element on the notional amount of the swap is included within the net cash note.
During the year ended 30 June 2016 hedging ineffectiveness of £0.7m (2015: £nil) was charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 5.3.

5.5 Financial risk management
The Group’s approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 41 to 45. The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 5.3 and 5.4.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations
to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the Treasury department. These forecasts are further stress-tested at a
Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
See principal risks on page 42 for more details.
The Board approves Treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The Treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
5.5.1 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May; and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income. Accordingly, the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal operating basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining a minimum headroom of £150.0m. The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. The Group’s drawn debt, excluding fees, represented 20.0% (2015: 21.0%) of available committed facilities at 30 June 2016. In addition, the Group had £758.0m (2015: £360.4m) of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2016. At the date of approval of the Financial Statements, the Group’s internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of signing these Financial Statements.
One of the Group’s objectives is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2016, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.0 years (2015: 4.0 years).
Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 30 June 2016 continued
    5.4.3 Hedge accounting and hedging reserve
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until realised. On realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within finance charges in the Income Statement.
To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair value of these swap arrangements are recognised immediately in finance charges in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of deferred fair value gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that have been designated as cash flow hedges by the Company, where the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur.

  5.5 Financial risk management continued 5.5.2 Market risk (price risk)
5.5.2.1 Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Group’s interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments. The Group’s policy target is for 0-40% of average borrowings over the three-year plan period to be at fixed rates of interest. Due to the seasonality of the Group’s funding requirements, 108.6% (2015: 105.4%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were fixed as at 30 June 2016 and the average over the three-year plan period is 42.4% (2015: 43.2%). Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.
Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to the UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one
to six months. Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings
in 2016 was 3.6% (2015: 3.1%).
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £59.6m (2015: £50.4m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2016 was 8.2% (2015: 8.1%) with, at 30 June 2016, a weighted average period of 1.2 years (2015: 2.2 years) for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis:
In the year ended 30 June 2016, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower, as this is a reasonably possible change, and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £0.1m (2015: £0.9m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £nil (2015: £0.6m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £nil (2015: £0.6m).
5.5.2.2 Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes
of $80.0m (2015: $80.0m). In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate the Group has entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements all of which
are designated as cash flow hedges, which fully hedge the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and the US Dollar interest payments.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 5.4.2.
5.5.3 Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from registered providers for affordable housing. The Group and Company have an investment of £23.1m (2015: £25.6m) in a joint venture that holds available for sale financial assets, which exposes the joint venture to credit risk, although this is spread over a large number of properties. Included within trade and other receivables £48.8m
(2015: £45.9m) is due from the Homes and Communities Agency in respect of the Help to Buy scheme. Since this receivable is due from a UK Government agency, the Group considers that this receivable has an insignificant risk of default. Other than this, neither the Group nor the Company have a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The exposure of the Group’s financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows:

   5.5 Financial risk management continued 5.5.3 Credit risk continued
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
> The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
> The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place. These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2016 was £144.4m (2015: £64.4m) of cash on deposit with a financial institution. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2016, the Company was exposed to £75.9m (2015: £695.6m) of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. The Company was also exposed to credit risk through its joint venture as explained on page 144. Further details are provided in notes 7.2 and 7.3.
5.5.4 Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages its share capital as equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity; and its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans) and its private placement notes as other financial liabilities, as set out in note 5.3.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the quantum of the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing. The management
of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 42 to 45.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term capital structure include: adjusting the level of dividends and special cash payments paid to shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend or a special cash payment); issuing new share capital; arranging debt to meet liability payments; and selling assets to reduce debt.

     Defined benefit scheme – The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Past service cost, until the scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, was recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits were already vested, and otherwise was amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

   Defined benefit pension scheme – The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate the Group’s asset in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. In calculating this asset, it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, price inflation, the long term rate of return upon scheme assets and mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from those assumed, the pension asset may differ from that included in these Financial Statements.

6.2.1 Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees, under which it pays contributions to an independently administered fund. Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employee’s pay and once these have been paid, the Group has no further obligations under these schemes.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2013. The results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 2016 by a qualified independent actuary. The Group agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make contributions to the Scheme of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 and then £9.5m per annum until 31 December 2016 to address the Scheme’s actuarial deficit. The Group also continues to meet the Scheme’s administration expenses and Pension Protection Fund levy.
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £0.8m (2015: £1.1m). The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being:

Volatile asset returns
Changes in bond yields

Description
The defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit. The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equities and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term. However, returns are likely to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit obligation recorded on the Balance Sheet. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long term objectives.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s investments in corporate and government bonds.
A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
    Group defined contribution schemes Consolidated Income Statement charge 8.1
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £0.6m (2015: £0.9m), which were paid on or before the due date.
6.2.2 Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which, with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions. Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
The Scheme provides benefits to members based on their length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier. The Group operates the Scheme under the UK regulatory framework, with a legally separate fund that is Trustee administered. The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and for the investment policy with regard to scheme assets.
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment performance. In order to assess the level of contributions, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.

The amount included in the Group and Company Balance Sheets arising from obligations in respect of the Scheme is as follows:

       The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables with an adjustment to allow for the Scheme members being 1.5 years younger than the population of the S1NA mortality tables. Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the CMI 2014 projections with a long term trend of 1.25% per annum (2015: 1.25% per annum).

    Share-based payments – In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. Fair value is measured either using Black-Scholes, Present-Economic Value or Monte Carlo models depending on the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value is expensed in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions apply. Non-vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the fair value of the equity instruments.

6.3.3 Further information relating to the share-based payment schemes
Long Term Performance Plan (‘LTPP’) and the Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
The grant of awards under the LTPP and options under the ESOS are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account individual performance and overall performance of the Group. Vesting under these schemes is dependent upon performance conditions based on total shareholder return, earnings per share and, for recent LTPP awards, return on capital employed. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 76 to 97.
Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
For any bonus deferred prior to November 2015, the Remuneration Committee utilised the
rules of the Group’s Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) for the purposes of the DBP. From FY16, deferred shares will be held in accordance with the DBP as approved by the shareholders at
the 2015 AGM. The Deferred Bonus Plan is currently utilised to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary. The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to award matching shares against the deferred shares; however, no matching shares have been awarded to date. Further details are on page 81.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘Sharesave’)
Under the Sharesave, participants are required to make monthly contributions to a HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three or five years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under the rules of the Sharesave. The Sharesave is open to all eligible employees as determined by the Board and is not subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions.
Senior Management Share Option Plan (‘SMSOP’)
The Board approved the grant of share options to employees under the SMSOP, which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided the employee remains employed by the Group. The 2009/10 SMSOP vested on 10 December 2012. Individuals who participate in the SMSOP are not eligible to participate in the LTPP or ESOS; therefore Executive Directors do not participate in the SMSOP. There is currently no intention to make any further grants under the SMSOP.
Senior Management Incentive Scheme (‘SMIS’)
Awards under the SMIS are at the discretion of the Chief Executive (or in his absence, the Chairman of the Board). Any awards under the SMIS must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant. Executive Directors and those individuals directly below this level are not eligible to participate in the SMIS. Any award granted under the SMIS is subject to performance conditions as set for the LTPP, excluding the total shareholder return condition, granted in the same financial year.
The Company granted to Neil Cooper awards on joining the Company which were designed
in quantum to compensate for awards which were forfeited by him on leaving his previous employment. They were structured to approximately mirror the vesting timescales and performance conditions of the Company’s LTPP awards made in 2013 and 2014, so his incentives are aligned with those of other Executives. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 88 to 89.

              Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options. The expected life used
in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain office properties and motor vehicles. Motor vehicle leases have an average term of 1.8 years (2015: 2.2 years)
to expiry. Property leases have an average term of 3.2 years (2015: 1.6 years) to expiry.

   7.1 Operating lease obligations continued
7.1.2 The Group as lessor
The Group has lease agreements with third parties for certain commercial properties, either in the process of development or which have been developed by the Group, and units on land to be subsequently developed for residential use. It is intended that the commercial properties, with their future rental income, will be sold to third parties in the normal course of business and therefore they are classified as work in progress until the date of sale.
7.2 Contingent liabilities
7.2.1 Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries
The Company has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings.
Certain subsidiary undertakings have commitments for the purchase of trading stock entered into in the normal course of business.
In the normal course of business, the Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees. Management estimate that the bonds and guarantees amount to £482.0m (2015: £588.6m), and confirm that at the date of these Financial Statements the possibility of cash outflow is considered minimal and no provision is required.
Following correspondence with an industry-wide final salary pension scheme, there is a risk of an obligation arising in respect of section 75 pension scheme funding for employees of a subsidiary who left the Group on disposal of their business and assets. No provision has been recognised in relation to this matter as it is not considered probable that this will result in an outflow of economic resources at present and the amount of any potential outflow cannot be reliably estimated.
7.2.2 Contingent liabilities related to joint ventures and associates
The Group has given counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees to its joint ventures totalling £56.5m at 30 June 2016 (2015: £39.8m). The Group has also provided principal guarantees of £9.0m (2015: £12.0m) and cost and interest overrun guarantees in relation to the borrowings of a number of the Group’s London joint ventures. At 30 June 2016, no cost or interest overruns had been incurred (2015: £nil). The Group’s maximum exposure under these cost and interest overrun guarantees is estimated at £17.7m as at 30 June 2016 (2015: £15.7m).
At 30 June 2016, the Group has an obligation to repay £0.9m (2015: £0.9m) of grant monies received by a joint venture upon certain future disposals of land.
The Group has also given a number of performance guarantees in respect of the obligations of its joint ventures, requiring the Group to complete development agreement contractual obligations in the event that the joint ventures do not perform as required under the terms of the related contracts.
There are no contingent liabilities in relation to associates at 30 June 2016.
7.2.3 Contingent liabilities related to legal claims
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of all known material legal claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made (other than for legal costs) where the Directors consider, based on such advice, that claims or actions are unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligations cannot be made.
No contingent liability in respect of such claims has been recognised.

7.3.5 Property purchase by a Director of Barratt Developments PLC
The Board and certain members of Senior Management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules (‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference between transactions with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key personnel of the Group.
The Group entered into the following transaction which, for the purposes of IAS 24 is considered to be a ‘related party transaction’.
In August 2014, Mark Clare, at the time, Group Chief Executive, reserved a flat (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf LLP, a joint venture partnership between BDW Trading Limited (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London and Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a purchase price of £1,692,350. This purchase was conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on four independent market valuations and similar comparable transactions at
that time. An amount of £2,500 was paid on reservation and a deposit of £166,735 was paid on 13 October 2014. The remaining balance was paid on completion on 17 June 2016 in accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trading.
Fulham Wharf LLP is not controlled by and is not a ‘subsidiary undertaking’ of the Company.
On notification by Mark Clare of the above transaction, the Board sought advice from its legal advisers and corporate brokers in respect of the application of Chapter 11 and section 190 did not extend to LLPs and therefore the provisions of Chapter 11 and section 190 did not apply
to this transaction. Consequently, no shareholder approval was required for this transaction.
In June 2016, David Thomas notified the Board of his and his connected person’s intention to buy one property each at the BDW Trading Limited site at Cane Hill. These transactions have not impacted these Financial Statements and further information relating to this can be found on pages 99 and 100.
There have been no ‘smaller related party transactions’ as defined in Listing Rule 11.1.10R for the year ended 30 June 2016 or in the year ended 30 June 2015.
