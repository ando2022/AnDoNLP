CEO'S MESSAGE

A STEP-CHANGE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED
After I started at the helm of Ramirent in the fall of 2016, we set a single target for 2017: to achieve a step-change improvement in our financial performance in all our operating segments. With 2017 now behind us, I have every reason to be proud of the accomplishments of the Ramirent team.

STRONG PROFIT GROWTH, SALES GROWTH AND CASH GENERATION
During 2017, we achieved a step-change in our performance. Our comparable EBITA grew by 45% to EUR 99.0 million with a strong EUR 51.6 million cash flow after investments. All our segments improved their comparable financial performance and particularly gratifying was the strong profit comeback of Sweden and Europe Central segments. Successful turnaround in our low-performing units has been an important factor in improved profitability and the 2017 results are deserved fruits of focused and disciplined efforts by all Ramirent teams.
In 2017, we also achieved the fastest comparable sales growth, 9.3%, since 2012 and succeeded particularly well in growing our key priority areas: rental sales and sales to small and medium-sized customers. During 2017, demand conditions remained favorable in our markets. There were clear improvements in market activity in the Baltics and Europe Central, taking their combined share of the Group's total operating profit to one quarter.
NEW STRATEGY FOCUSES ON OUR CORE BUSINESS
In December, we launched our new strategy for 2018-2020, named "Capital-efficient profitable growth in our core business". We also renewed our financial targets to reflect the new strategy ­ we are determined to reach a 16 percent ROCE by 2020 and grow our EPS during 2018-2020 at a double-digit rate.
Our new strategy focuses on exploiting the solid growth prospects we see in our core, construction equipment rental business. We still have many ways of

improving our performance in the core business. We believe the value proposition for renting can be further strengthened by digitalization and by making a stepchange improvement in service-levels. Our aim is to raise the service-levels to a new benchmark in our industry by developing the rental industry's best performing supply
THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR RENTING INSTEAD OF OWNING CAN BE STRENGTHENED BY DIGITALIZATION AND BY MAKING A STEP-CHANGE IMPROVEMENT IN SERVICE LEVELS.
chain. Also, with tighter performance management standards in our remaining low-performing units, we can continue to improve our performance.
We see great growth potential in the small and medium-sized business sector in all of our segments. Additionally, in 2018 Europe Central and Baltics segments will be reported as one Eastern Europe segment, where the common denominator is the opportunity and the aim for rapid growth.
We also want to continue developing our market-leading position with large customers and be their supplier of choice. With our advanced total solutions and proprietary safety products we have a unique position to improve safety and productivity in construction sites.

CHAPTER HEADLINE

ENGAGEMENT AND SAFETY ALSO WITHIN THE STRATEGIC FOCUS
In a service business like ours, sustainable results happen only when people at all levels radiate positive energy and engagement. During my relatively short time in Ramirent, I have seen a clear increase in energy and engagement across our organization.
A positive development can also be seen in our safety performance, which remains one of the key priorities for Ramirent both internally and in our offering to customers.
Becoming a great and safe place to work is also one of the cornerstones of our renewed strategy. We will continue to invest in our leadership culture and finetuning the basics of our daily work. Our explicit aim by 2020 is to be in the top-quartile in employee engagement and leadership quality.

LOOKING CONFIDENTLY INTO THE FUTURE
We have every reason to feel confident. The demand outlook for the start of 2018 looks favorable across Ramirent's diverse customer base and geographies, and there is still much to be gained by improving our internal operations.
Our new financial targets and the strategic focus on capital-efficiency constitute the right recipe for creating value for Ramirent shareholders in the coming years. Finally, I want to thank all Ramirenters for your outstanding efforts in 2017. A warm thank you also goes out to our shareholders, customers and partners for the trust you have placed in us during the past year.

STRATEGY

CAPITAL-EFFICIENT PROFITABLE GROWTH IN OUR CORE BUSINESS

In our strategy for 2018­2020, we focus on capital efficient profitable growth in our core business ­ general equipment rental and related services. There is untapped potential particularly within small and medium-sized businesses, and by improving our supply chain, we aim to raise the service levels of our industry to a new benchmark.

According to the new strategy, profitability in the coming years is driven through a disciplined focus on profitable businesses, performance management, process excellence, capital efficiency and people leadership.
Ramirent will increase growth efforts particularly within small and medium-sized businesses, and in its operating countries in the Baltics and in Central Europe. By improving the operational performance of our supply chain, we aim to raise the service levels of our industry to a new benchmark.
Our strategy is to grow capital efficiently in our core business with disciplined development of rental and related service businesses. In line with this strategy, Ramirent announced in December 2017 the initiation of a process to assess strategic options, including a potential sale of the Temporary Space business that has limited synergies with the core equipment rental business.
While remaining a wide-range rental equipment supplier, we strongly believe that focusing on product lines and existing geographies, where we can earn ROCE clearly above the cost of capital, is the best way to create sustainable shareholder value in our sector.
THE KEY BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR STRATEGY
WINNING IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS SECTOR Our share among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) is still below our average and we aim to win in this sector by further improving our customer experience and availability.
BECOMING THE LARGE CUSTOMER'S SUPPLIER OF CHOICE We want to further strengthen our strong position and become the large customers' supplier of choice by providing advanced total solutions that improve safety, productivity and sustainability in construction and other industries. Ramirent has a market-leading offering in what it takes to help construction businesses improve their productivity.

BUILDING THE INDUSTRY'S BEST PERFORMING SUPPLY CHAIN We will make a step-change improvement in our availability, delivery accuracy and supply chain efficiency by 2020 by developing and digitizing our processes. There is sizable untapped potential in our supply chain management.
TIGHTENING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT OF LOW-PERFORMING UNITS We will strive to have no units or customer centers delivering below 10% EBIT by 2020 and implement clear performance management standards in the company.
GROWING CAPITAL EFFICIENTLY We will seek above-average growth rates in capital-light product categories and raise our capital efficiency through supply chain improvements and by optimizing the replacement investments. We aim to grow min. 2% p.a. before the effect of growth investments.
BECOMING A GREAT PLACE TO WORK BY FOCUSING ON LEADERSHIP AND SAFETY To raise our performance and pursue the updated strategy and financial targets, we want to create a great place to work by developing the Ramirent leadership culture and our safety standards to be top-quartile by 2020.

Ramirent improves the safety and productivity of our customers through sharing equipment combined with related services and knowledge. The core of our business model is increasing productivity through circularity to small and medium businesses and large customers.
Our business is driven by modern demands on productivity, safety and the environment, accelerating urbanization and demographic change. We aim for a smooth flow of information, machines and services, which, in turn, lead to more efficient ways of working, less costs

and down-time, improved product features and new innovations. By building the industry's best supply chain, we will improve the service levels and the ease of renting thus strengthening the value proposition for rental versus ownership.
Our talented people are the basis for creating a firstclass customer experience and matching our offering to customer needs, which vary from household and industrial maintenance work to renovation and large complex construction projects.

CHAPTER HEADLINE
OUR RENTAL SERVICE WENT ONLINE IN FINLAND
In 2017, Ramirent opened its first web shop for equipment rental in Finland. The service was designed, in particular, with private consumers in mind, and it operates 24/7. A special emphasis was put on mobile usability, as we wanted the service to be readily available anytime and anywhere. The service is supported by a nationwide network of pick-up points. A real-time chat service was also introduced. Over the chat service, Ramirent's own rental advisors offer instruction and tips on choosing and safely operating the right equipment.
The online rental service has been met with very positive feedback. While still new, the outlook of the new service is promising. The network of pick-up points in Finland was expanded during the first year.
Ramirent always strives to make its expertise and first-class equipment even more easily available. An easy to use online rental site is a logical part of that drive, and new approaches to better meet our customers' needs are continuously being developed.

ACCELERATING URBANIZATION

OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

NEW SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS FOR SAFETY AND LEADERSHIP
Ramirent's sustainability work focuses on the four most relevant sustainability topics in our industry: employing the best skills, maximizing safety, ensuring the best use of machines and operating eco-efficiently. In order to better monitor our sustainability KPIs on country, region and customer center level, we are continuosly improving our information flow and clarifying how each Ramirenter can contribute to our sustainability work.

Sustainability is not only at the core of our business model through sharing resources, but also a prerequisite for doing business. We help our customers improve their productivity and safety, and create sustainable innovations in a circular economy.
With the updated strategy, we added new targets for safety and leadership: We aim to be among the top-quartile companies in employee engagement and leadership quality by 2020 and achieve an LTIF < 5. Another major change for 2017 was the renewal of our HSEQ organization. During 2017, we also continued to develop our sustainability reporting to improve transparent communication to external stakeholders, customers, and current and potential Ramirent employees.
MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY
The annual sustainability agenda is carried out by our HSEQ Board headed by the Quality and Efficiency Manager. Our business units make annual plans for monitoring KPIs. Group HSEQ, HR functions and the Executive Management Team follow these regularly.
The Executive Management Team is responsible for setting and managing sustainability targets on a Group level. The Ramirent Board of Directors also monitors sustainability themes, and safety in particular has a high priority. In terms of daily work, sustainability is the responsibility of line management. The HR Board and the HSEQ Board steer the work and bring segments and functions together.
The HSEQ Board was renewed in 2017. Former Health and Safety Forum and Quality and Environment Forum were joined together as one HSEQ Forum. Both HSEQ Board and HSEQ Forum support operating countries in HSEQ related issues to ensure all operations follow international standards. They prepare development projects,

share best practices within the Group and monitor KPIs. Ramirent also founded a Safe Board to focus on new safety products and develop innovative ways of improving customer safety.
RAMIWAY QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Ramirent's sustainability agenda is based on our ISO multisite certification (incl. OHSAS 18001 standards) and our RamiWay quality management system, which defines our key business processes, responsibilities, policies, principles and tools. The system is there to ensure that Ramirent's business processes are in compliance with the legal requirements and that they support operational efficiency and good internal control. Ramiway also ensures that identified good practices and operational KPIs are spread in the Group. During the year, we started to simplify Ramiway processes to enhance the efficiency of common procedures and local ways of working.
In the coming years, we will continue to increase the number of countries operating according to RamiWay. By the end of 2017, it had been implemented in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Preparations for new countries in the Baltics to adopt RamiWay will continue in 2018.
The RamiWay quality management system has a multisite certification, which means that it fulfills the requirements of the standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 for quality, environmental and occupational health and safety. The multisite certification covers Finland, Sweden, the Baltic countries, Denmark and Norway. The following countries already have some of the certifications: Czech Republic, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001; Poland, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001; and Slovakia, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.

EMPLOYING THE BEST SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE

ENGAGED PEOPLE DRIVE SUCCESS

We aim to develop a great place to work in order to provide great service to our customers. Ramirent's 2,800 employees in 10 countries have a key role in helping our customers improve their productivity by enabling them to focus on their core operations. Ramirent wants to serve as an example in directing the industry towards more conscious and modern leadership, where equal opportunities are available for everyone. This year, the main focus has been on leadership development and simplifying processes to smoothen working conditions.

The focus areas in employing the best skills and knowledge in Ramirent are RamiWay of working, performance management, fair rewarding and recognition and diversity. In 2017, Ramirent's HR evaluated company practices and improvement needs. As processes become simpler and smoother, the work flow improves. The identified best practices will be integrated to the way of working in all our operating countries.

engagement levels showed great improvement. Over 92 percent of our people get a sense of achievement in their work and are willing to go the extra mile for Ramirent. In January 2018, our RamiEar survey showed further improvement in overall engagement as the Employee Engagement Index improved to 83.0 (80.0).
SECURING FAIR REWARDING AND RECOGNITION

"OUR WAY TO LEAD"- BEHAVIORS THROUGH A CO-CREATION PROCESS
Leadership development is a top-priority for Ramirent, and in 2017 we defined clear "Our Way to Lead"- behaviors through an inclusive co-creation process. As a result, we now have a set of leadership behaviors defined, a plan for implementation and the tools to follow it up. A total of 140 leaders took part in the Ramirent Leadership Days conference participating in developing the leadership behaviors and in how leadership can be improved at Ramirent.
In the future, Ramirent will host different leadership programs from basic leadership to the top management. An internal talent program down the road is also being discussed.
IMPROVING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SUPPORTED BY A NEW HIGH IN ENERGY AND ENGAGEMENT
In 2017, we updated our performance management and talent and succession processes. The current focus is on making sure our employees will better understand the link between the strategic objectives and their daily work. Another key theme is simplifying processes and making sure we have targets that drive performance and delivers results. As we strengthen our company culture, an increased focus will be placed on the behaviors that will make us a great place to work.
The year started off with a great result in the employee survey from January 2017, Ramirenters' energy and

We also updated our guidelines for compensation and benefits. For the time being, this work has focused specifically on Norway, Sweden and Finland. Our focus is on having a structure to obtain external and internal benchmarks for salary levels. We also expanded the number of participants in our long-term incentive programs and made the individual targets more clear and motivating to each participant.
DIGITALIZATION AND DIVERSITY AS DRIVERS OF RECRUITMENT
The recruitments we have done in 2017 bring us possibilities, fresh ideas and, of course, new colleagues. In terms of recruiting, Ramirent is among the many companies to whom digitalization brings new demands on the skills of our employees. We are also looking to hire individuals with a background in the retail sector, as similar commercial skills are what we seek in our customer center employees.
As a part of building a great place to work, diversity is identified as a key priority at Ramirent. One focus area is to increase the number of women employees, as their share is relatively low compared to many other industries. We will aim for a more inclusive working culture and to widen our reach to female recruits and ultimately increase the number of female managers, in particular.

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR HARASSMENT
One of the most fundamental aspects of a great place to work is that all of our employees feel safe and protected against any harassment based on gender, nationality or any other reason. In the wake of the world news regarding harassment in the fall of 2017, Ramirent's Executive Management Team wanted to show their support by letting every Ramirenter know that we have a zero tolerance policy for harassment and that everyone should feel safe to anonymously report harassment misconduct to our "Speak-up"-line, to members of the Management Team, or to the local HR. A question on harassment was also included in the Rami Ear Survey.

competence level in areas that are strategically important for the Group. In 2017, we arranged four programs on sourcing and business control. A strong focus in 2018 will be training in the new leadership behaviors.
On a local level, the training curriculum during 2017 focused strongly on safety training, training in new products, and customer service as well as employee well-being.
Ramirent's Management Trainee Program ensures that we have capable managers to take the company further. In 2017, we had three trainees from Sweden, Norway and Finland that have now taken permanent positions in different

parts of the organization. We want to make a positive change in the local commu-
nities we operate in. Providing learning opportunities for young people is one concrete example of this. Two refugees were employed during the year in Denmark and in Finland. In Finland, like last year, Ramirent participated in the Business Lead integration program for educated immigrants coming from outside Europe. The program is managed by Hanken & SSE Executive Education. The aim is to help educated immigrants integrate into Finnish society and working life by providing professional development opportunities.

MAXIMIZING SAFETY

SAFETY A KEY PART OF A GREAT PLACE TO WORK
Our personnel's and customers' safety continues to be a top priority at Ramirent. In Ramirent's renewed strategy, safety is stated as a key part of building a great place to work and the safety KPI on the Group level was renewed. In 2017, we continued developing new safety tools, trainings and products. Ramirent is unique in having its own R&D department focusing on developing improved safety features of existing products.

As an equipment rental company serving the still highly accident-prone construction industry, we want to actively promote the safety culture to our customers and provide them with training in matters related to a safe working environment. The important thing for us is to make the industry safer, while also ensuring smoothly operating and cost-efficient construction sites. Our main priorities are raising awareness on safety matters through local events (e.g. Safety Weeks and Safety Days) and trainings for employees and customers.
DECREASING THE NUMBER OF INJURIES
We aim for zero accidents. Reaching that target, however, is a considerable process. In 2017 we set a new target for safety aiming for LTIF (LTIF, accidents per million working hours) to be below 5 by 2020. A positive trend for 2017 was the increase in safety observations. To further improve the tracking of safety observations in all our countries, a new mobile device was developed.
In general, we see our safety levels developing towards a better direction in 2017. Group accident frequency (LTIF) was 7.9 (9.3) in 2017. The absence rate due to illness and injuries in comparison to annual working hours was kept on a good level 2.9 (3.2) percent in 2017.
In addition, close calls and safety observations ­ such as slips that did not result in injury, insufficiently marked areas or disorder at worksites ­ are reported more

We have worked resiliently for improved safety in everyday working environments. Finland is the first Ramirent country to also monitor subcontractor accident frequency.
2017 figures show that our personnel are subsequently more aware of safety-related risks. In the future, the aim is to improve safety by using informative storytelling and ongoing dialogue as well as communicating the importance of the ways we behave in our daily work.

CHAPTER HEADLINE

IMPROVING TRAFFIC SAFETY WITH RAMIRENT'S SAFEPASSTM ROAD BARRIERS
Uncommon for a rental company, Ramirent designs and produces its own products with superior safety features based on its extensive product user experience and on identified safety gaps in existing products. We see growth opportunities especially in the fall protection and traffic safety market..
Ramirent's latest addition to its range in 2017 was the Ramirent SafePassTM road barriers. Construction projects spread beyond the actual work area, and transport and people passing by must be taken into account. When it comes to safety, sturdy barriers that prevent access to the work site are a necessity. Ramirent's SafePassTM barriers were designed to be durable, stackable and easy to install. Instead of using concrete alone, we decided to reduce the weight by pairing concrete with steel. Special rubber feet give the highest possible friction and fences or signs are easily installed on top of the barrier. The SafePassTM barrier has been in the market in Sweden and Norway since July 2017, and it will be introduced in more countries in 2018.
Other Ramirent proprietary safety products include the Ramirent SafePassTM for cyclists and pedestrians, the EnterSafeTM staircase, and the GuardLiteTM fall protection system.

RISK ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES ROOTED IN DAILY WORK

SETTING A NEW BENCHMARK WITH OWN LINE OF UNIQUE SAFETY PRODUCTS

The risk assessment guidelines for internal assessments of Ramirent locations are rooted in our operations and projects. The risk assessment tool includes 150 indicators, such as physical and chemical dangers and rescue planning, for evaluating the risk level of a site. A risk evaluation is conducted at each site every three years and more often, if needed.
CUSTOMER SAFETY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
Our customers' growing safety demands drive us to develop new innovations and applications. In addition to offering machines to rent, we provide our customers with user guidance, safety instructions and necessary safety equipment. Our range of safety training courses is broad and covers on-site safety trainings conducted by RamiSchool safety experts, including for example fall, noise and dust protection.

In terms of safety, we have identified development needs in current product lines and ways of working, and we have started to take measures to improve them. Ramirent has its own specialized R&D department, designing improved safety features to existing products especially related to fall protection and traffic safety. We have based the new products on the vast user data we collect at customer project sites everyday.
In 2017, we launched a protective barrier for roads to join the roster of previous products such as SafePassTM, EnterSafeTM, and GuardLiteTM. The products have all been launched in Sweden and selected products have also been introduced in Norway and Denmark. In 2018, the products will be rolled out in further Ramirent operating countries. This is clearly starting to be a competitive advantage for Ramirent.

ENSURING THE BEST USE OF MACHINES

OPTIMIZING MACHINE REFURBISHMENTS HELPS US GROW MORE CAPITAL-EFFICIENTLY

Ramirent ensures the best use of machines through rigorous lifecycle management and efficient and sustainable procurement from the best brands with environmentally friendly features. The aim is to minimize the environmental impact of rental machinery.

We are committed to using resources efficiently and taking into consideration and minimizing their impacts throughout the lifecycle. This calls for an optimized fleet and supply chain, and operating our logistics as efficiently as possible. During 2017, we have continued to streamline our supply chain processes and developed the supplier evaluations and criteria on a Group level. The aim is to build the best perfoming supply chain in the industry.
SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT
Procurement is a crucial step in ensuring sustainability in Ramirent's business model. It all begins with careful supplier selection during tenders, which always involve environmental criteria such as environmental management systems, resource efficiency and ethical standards.
Aside from sustainability, the selection criteria include aspects related to, for example, the company profile, quality, reliability, logistics, product development, degree of technological leadership, competence, lifecycle support, productivity, sourcing chain, as well as a financial evaluation. Emissions levels are also increasingly considered when procuring new machines.
A positive development we are witnessing is our customers' increasing interest in "green machines," i.e. hybrid and/or electric machines. We have consequently initiated discussions with suppliers to accommodate the demand, and our tenders now include hybrid machines as an option. The work will continue in 2018. In Finland, Ramirent has set targets for CO2 emissions for its own vehicles, and this will be extended to further operating countries.
MANAGING SUPPLIERS AND STREAMLINING SUPPLIER AUDITS
Ramirent has roughly 18,000 suppliers. We have defined guidelines for supply chain management on Group level, while the daily management and operations are carried

out locally. Also, guidance on which suppliers to use is provided for all customer centers. The continuous review of the vast supplier base is carried out through regular audits. In order to streamline the supplier process and sustainability, one strategic aim on a Group level is to optimize the number of suppliers.
During 2017, we continued with the audits of our main suppliers in order to ensure efficiency and streamline the supplier process. The auditing process included 11 categories, from examining ethical standards and risk management, to aspects related to environmental, health, safety and quality management. In total, we performed 12 audits on strategically important suppliers.
In addition, there were regular follow-up meetings on a day-to-day basis throughout the year between fleet suppliers and the line organization regarding HSEQ matters and how to improve the product lifecycle.
Based on the previous audits, we have identified action points for several suppliers to work on sustainability aspects in their own work, such as in regards to our Code of Conduct.
LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT CARES FOR THE PLANET
The best use of machines is guaranteed through careful analysis and also through relevant legislation. All Ramirent machines have a target life length from a span of 5­20 years on average. During procurement, we consider the economic, technical and environmental lifespans, and base our selection of equipment on an estimate of the total cost of ownership. In addition, we pursue to upgrade the existing fleet according to new technological or legislative developments ­ the modules, for instance, are developed in terms of ventilation, isolation and fire resistance. Lifecycle management starts with supplier training and subsequent customer training by Ramirent personnel. The machines also undergo maintenance and service programs at regular intervals.

CHAPTER HEADLINE

BETTER SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY THROUGH IMPROVED INTERNAL COMMUNICATION
During 2017, Ramirent Finland identified a number of issues arising from communication issues, such as working in silos and poor cross-functional information flow. These issues were perceived to stem at least partly from several organizational changes, which have resulted in unclear roles and responsibilities.
To tackle the challenges head-on, we initiated a project aimed at improving internal communication. The project was named Baton in the spirit of relay racing, where the baton is never dropped but diligently passed on.
The Baton project began within our Customer Center, Fleet and Solution Sales departments by introducing a new hub organization, internal digital ticketing tool, and yard logistics, among others. As a result, the quality and efficiency of processes in Southern Finland was enhanced. Best practices will be shared within all countries in our aim to build the industry's best performing supply chain.

INCREASED REFURBISHMENT TO EXTEND THE LIFESPAN OF EQUIPMENT
To continuously improve the smart use of machines, we have begun a refurbishment program. When equipment comes to the end of its lifecycle, we evaluate whether a heavy refurbishment is in order. Refurbishment extends the lifespan of a machine by five years. Giving machines, such as lifts and modules, an extended life is both economically smart and environmentally friendly. The idea is to extend this practice onto additional types of equipment, such as heavy equipment.
STREAMLINED TRANSPORTATION
As most of our environmental footprint comes from our transports, Ramirent's target is to optimize transportations in an eco-efficient and time-saving manner. With the careful planning of logistics, we can deliver equipment from the supplier directly to our customer's worksite, if needed. A focus area is optimizing our hub structure and further improving our transportation efficiency by increasing the role of

centralized warehousing in geographically dense areas. In order to further reduce our environmental foot-
print, we are also developing processes which aim to reach the same sales levels with a smaller fleet capacity. This requires continuous focus on optimizing locations, high turnaround times of rental equipment to be inspected, washed and made available for rent after return. This also supports our capital-efficient growth target.
OWN ASSEMBLY OPERATION FOR SITE MODULES
In 2017 Ramirent established its own assembly operation in connection with its new hub in Tallinn, Estonia. There is a high degree of competence in modular housing production in the Baltics and Ramirent's own product knowhow is used to improve quality of the modules. The assembly operation provides better control over the supply of our largest product group. In-house assembly improves both profitability and service levels. The first modules were delivered in 2017.

OPERATING ECO-EFFICIENTLY

STEP-BY-STEP MORE ECOEFFICIENT IN OUR OPERATIONS

Ramirent offers environmentally sustainable equipment rental combined with related services that also make financial sense. Eco-efficiency is one of our sustainability focus areas, and we are advancing systematically step by step in our ongoing work on optimizing energy consumption and transport to and from customers' job sites. We are always looking for ways to help our customers reduce their environmental impact.

Ramirent is committed to sustainability from the ground up. Resource efficiency is the very core of our business, as renting and sharing equipment reduces environmental burden.
We continuously strive to minimize our daily environmental footprint in everything we do. Our focus areas include optimization of transports, energy efficiency, safe and efficient use of chemicals, and water and waste management. In 2017, we continued our nationwide energy efficiency reviews. Some of the key areas include increasing the amount of recycled waste, reducing and substituting the number of harmful chemicals used with safer alternatives, renewing our hardware to environmentally friendlier ones, and improving logistical coordination to meet full load capacity.
A significant development in Finland in 2017 involved gradually replacing fossil fuel with biodiesel in our own vehicles, which has a positive impact on our CO2 emissions. An overall trend across operating countries is the increased customer interest in hybrid vehicles also used in our equipment rental delivery operation (see more on page 24). In Norway, we are studying the possibility of procuring electric cars.
IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY THROUGH STEP-BY-STEP IMPROVEMENT
Ramirent's overall consumption of electricity is divided between heating, ventilation, lighting, technical equipment and fueling rental machinery and transportation vehicles. We ensure the energy efficiency of our operations by complying to the energy efficiency laws and by setting local KPI target levels and action plans.
In 2017, Ramirent followed up on the energy efficiency reviews in 2016 with a set of action points. These actions included adjusting the time settings for ventilation units, installing motion-detector lighting systems in the washing places, lowering the indoor temperature, switching to LED lights and other lighting adjustments, and improving the IMS systems according to CO2 levels, among others.

Ramirent continued to rate all washing places by categorizing them according to the quality level of each location.
Our chemical management system EcoOnline is now an essential product used both internally and among customers. EcoOnline provides specialized information about chemicals in an easily accessible format, helping employees handle chemicals safely.
FROM WASTE TO REUSABLE MATERIAL
We track the amount of waste. By having fewer partners in waste management, we can improve cooperation and ensure the high quality of reporting. Basing our action points on accurate reports, we are able to increase transparency and optimize actions on a country level: Denmark, for instance, focused especially on this in 2017.
AUDITS TO RENEW RAMIRENT'S MULTISITE ISO CERTIFICATION
Ramirent's multisite ISO certification audits, with focus on the renewed ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards, were conducted during the first quarter of 2017. Findings were handled by the HSEQ teams both locally and on the Group level. Based on the findings, the main processes in our quality management system, Ramiway, were further simplified and streamlined to enable efficient quality follow-up across the Group. The work will continue in 2018. These changes will help Ramirent futher improve quality, safety and productivity of operations.
The Multisite certification covers Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Baltic countries. Central European countries are certified locally: Czech Republic and Slovakia ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and Poland ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001. Efforts to expand the multisite certification to also cover the Central European countries will continue in 2018.

including personnel and other operating costs increased to 270.0 (253.8) million euros or 37.3 (38.2) percent of net sales.
In 2017, income taxes amounted to 13.5 (­6.3) million euros. Effective tax rate for the Group decreased to 17.6 (22.3) percent.

INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
Our business also has an indirect economic impact on

the societies we operate in. We offer our customers well-maintained machinery and equipment so they do not need to invest in their own fleet. We also improve the productivity of our customer industries, as using our solutions frees up time and capital for their core business. Furthermore, through the salaries paid to Ramirent employees, we affect private consumption in our operating countries. Cooperation with our suppliers creates new mutual business opportunities and additional demand in the supply chain of our suppliers. Taxes that we and our employees pay have an impact on society at large.

OUR CODE OF CONDUCT The Code of Conduct states our ethical principles and addresses anti-corruption, the right for collective bargaining and zero tolerance for harassment, child labor, forced labor and discrimination.

Internal control is based on the COSO 2013 framework and comprises five principal components: the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.

SPEAKING UP TO BUILD A BETTER RAMIRENT Ramirent has a system in place that gives all employees an opportunity to speak up about harassment incidents, any suspected financial misconduct or other fraudulent activities anonymously or under their own name. The service is available in the local languages of our operating countries. Suspected misconduct is investigated immediately and confidentially after which measures are taken. Cases are reported to Ramirent's Board of Directors and its Working Committee.
QUALITY POLICY We aim to take good care of our customers. Our industry expertise and continuous improvement of our operational execution enable us to deliver increased value to our customers. Ramirent's Quality Policy summarizes what this statement means in our daily operations.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING PRINCIPLES AND GRI INDEX

SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING PRINCIPLES

The Annual Report 2017 describes our operations and the material sustainability aspects for us and for our stakeholders in 2017. The Annual Report 2017 report contains standard disclosures from the GRI G4 sustainability reporting guidelines. Some of the information is given in the Financial Statements 2017. The specific standard disclosures with indicators are listed in the GRI table.

SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES
The reporting covers Ramirent Plc and its subsidiaries in all countries of operation. If different boundaries are used, this is declared in conjunction with information. A list of the subsidiaries is in Note 7.2 in the Financial Statements. Joint venture companies are not included in the sustainability information. Sustainability information from previous years is mainly presented as pro forma information. The selection of material aspects is based on GRI G4 reporting guidelines and on Ramirent's own and our stakeholders' views (read more on p. 19).
SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES
Environment, health, safety and quality data is collected at customer centers and hubs by dedicated people. Country HR and HSEQ functions are responsible for collecting

the data for each country using local and Group-wide data systems. The Group HR and HSEQ functions compile the Group-wide data.
CAPACITY CHANGES
The total number of customer centers and hubs varied during the year depending on new openings and closures of some locations. Also, the demand for Ramirent services has an effect on the environmental figures, such as the amount of waste.
GLOBAL COMPACT INITIATIVE
Ramirent joined the United Nations' Global Compact initiative in 2015. The GRI index represents how we fulfill the principles of human rights, labor standards, environment and anti-corruption.

January­December EBITDA increased to EUR 205.5 (169.0) million. The EBITDA margin was 28.4% (25.4%) of net sales. Comparable depreciation of tangible assets was EUR 107.8 (103.9) million and including IACs EUR 107.8 (109.8) million.
The Group's January­December comparable EBITA increased to EUR 99.0 (68.1) million, representing 13.7% (10.2%) of net sales and reported EBITA increased to EUR 97.7 (59.2) million or 13.5% (8.9%) of net sales. Sales growth, a good sales mix and progress in turnaround actions in non-performing units contributed to improved EBITA. All our segments improved their comparable EBITA and particularly gratifying was the strong profit comeback of Sweden and Europe Central segments. Items affecting comparability in 2017 included EUR ­2.6 million restructuring charges in Denmark and a non-comparable capital gain of EUR 1.3 million in Norway. In the comparison period, items affecting comparability in EBITA included asset write-downs, reorganization costs and the derecognition of an earn-out liability in total of EUR ­8.9 million.
The share of Fortrent's (joint venture company in Rus-

sia and Ukraine) net result to Ramirent has been reported since January 1, 2017 under the Group's unallocated items. The Fortrent Group's net sales rose by 8.9% and amounted to EUR 31.8 (29.2) million or at comparable exchange rates decreased by 1.1%. In Russia, demand was strongest in Moscow and in new regions, while low construction activity impacted negatively on sales in St. Petersburg. In Ukraine, net sales increased supported by increased construction activity.
Fortrent's EBITA was EUR 4.4 (3.2) million or 13.9% (11.1%) of net sales. Good development in rental sales improved the sales mix and contributed positively to EBITA. Fortrent's net result was EUR 2.0 (2.8) million. The 2016 net result included EUR 1.0 million items affecting comparability related to loan reclassification in Fortrent Group. Ramirent's share of the net result was EUR 1.0 (1.3) million. The 2016 share of the consolidated net result includes items affecting comparability of EUR 0.5 million. On December 1, 2017, Ramirent announced the start of a process to explore strategic options for the equally-held joint venture company Fortrent between Ramirent and Cramo, including a potential sale.

efficiency. As part of the strategy of intensifying efforts to turnaround low-performing units, Ramirent initiated at the end of the year a restructuring of the Danish customer center network and sales force, which was successfully completed. The related restructuring charge of EUR ­2.6 million was mainly due to the termination of leases of customer center facilities. Reported EBITA amounted to EUR 0.4 (2.3) million.

KEY BUSINESS RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
At Ramirent, risk is the potential for loss or harm or the diminished opportunity for gain, that can adversely affect the achievement of Ramirent objectives. The purpose of risk management is to provide key stakeholders with reasonable assurance of achievement of objectives as well as reliability of financial and operative reporting and compliance with associated laws, regulations and internal policies. Risks described below are the key risks to which Ramirent and its shareholders are exposed to.
Changes in the demand of customer industries and economic cycles may happen fast and have a negative impact on the construction market as well as on Ramirent's operations and financial position. Ramirent strives to reduce the risk by maintaining a large and diversified customer base which cover a wide range of industries. The construction sector is the largest customer sector for Ramirent.
Ramirent operates in a highly competitive business environment where new entrants may establish competitive advantage over Ramirent. Ramirent aims to further improve its competitive position through the dual focus in its new strategy for both large as well as small and medium-sized businesses recognizing their different needs. Further opportunities to improve the efficiency and service levels in fleet management and supply chain can be seen. Ramirent aims to optimize the process flow, the fleet assortment, maximize fleet availability and utilization and further reduce operational costs. Ramirent also aims to develop rental industry's best performing supply chain.
Ramirent recognizes the dependencies on information technology services and solutions. Ramirent focuses on further improving its information technology solutions and information security management to avoid interruptions, exposure to data loss and compromised confidentiality or usability of information. Ramirent recognizes the risk of misconduct in our business. The SpeakUp Line is available on all group and local homepages and intranet. All employees and third parties are continuously reminded and encouraged to speak up in person or anonymously on any misconduct matters. All identified matters are investigated and responsible persons will be made accountable.
Ramirent has a decentralized organization model, which implies autonomy in its business units. Ramirent operates in different markets and countries, and recognizes the risk of non-compliance with the local laws and regulations. Managing business in such an organization imposes requirements on reporting and control, which may be cumbersome for the organization. Ramirent has developed communication and training on Group reporting instructions, and continues to improve reporting quality. Further development of internal controls for end-to-end processes is progressing.
The Board of Directors has approved the Risk Management Policy. The Risk Management Policy has been developed based on the COSO ERM Framework, the ISO 31000 standard "Risk Management - Principles and Guidelines" and corporate governance best practices. The Risk Man-

agement Policy is the basis for other policies in Ramirent, including the Internal Control Policy. Risk management is embedded in business processes and continuous. Regular risk assessments are conducted in different areas of business and results incorporated into overall group-wide risk assessment. The reporting to the Board is quarterly. An essential part of the risk management is to maintain and develop appropriate insurance coverage of our fleet. Group insures personnel, financial, operative, strategic and hazard risks, which after risk management measures remain above Group´s risk retention limit and are cost-effective to insure.
Ramirent is subject to certain financial risks such as foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding risks. The financial risk management in Ramirent strives to secure sufficient funding for operational needs and to minimize the funding costs and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other financial risks cost-effectively. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can significantly affect Ramirent's financial result. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations is visible when translating the net sales and financial results of our subsidiaries outside the Eurozone to euros. Changes in exchange rates may increase or decrease net sales or results. Hedging operations are managed by Group Treasury. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of a customer not fulfilling its commitments towards Ramirent. Ramirent's business units are responsible for credit risks related to sales activities and assess the credit quality of their customers by taking into account the customer's financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. When appropriate, advance payments, deposits, letters of credit and third party guarantees are used to mitigate credit risks. Customer credit risks in Ramirent are diversified as trade receivables are generated by a large number of customers.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY, NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RAMIRENT'S BUSINESS MODEL Ramirent's key to improving productivity for its customers is through circularity by sharing resources and knowledge. By sharing and re-using equipment and machines through rental, Ramirent supports the creation of a circular economy. Smooth flow of machines, services and information leads to improved productivity and minimized environmental impact. Key elements of how Ramirent improves productivity are through maximizing safety, operational excellence, and high availability of equipment and services. Sharing resources and information leads also to improved ways of working, improved product features, new innovations and ideas. Ramirent's supply chain management plays an important role in achieving a smooth flow of machines, services and information. Ramirent's responsible business practices form the foundation of all operations.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS
Ramirent is committed to making Ramirent a "Great Place to Work" that has motivated and engaged employees with skills to deliver operational excellence. Ramirent aims to become a Great Place To Work by developing its leadership and safety culture. Ramirent wants to serve as an example in directing the industry towards more conscious and modern leadership, where equal opportunities are available for everyone. Ramirent continuously strives for developing work environment safety, job satisfaction and employee engagement with zero tolerance for any kind of discrimination or harassment. Ramirent aims for consistent performance management combined with fair reward and recognition.
EMPLOYEE COMPETENCE AND ENGAGEMENT
Ramirent aims for increasing personnel's competence levels in areas that are strategically important for the Group which will at the same time ensure employee engagement. Ramirent Academy is the Group's internal competence development program, focusing on increasing the personnel's competence level in areas that are strategically important for the Group. Ramirent's Management Trainee Program ensures that we have capable managers to take the company further. In terms of recruiting, Ramirent is among the many companies to whom digitalization brings new demands on the skills of our employees. We are also looking to hire individuals with a background in the retail sector, as similar commercial skills are sought after also for our customer center employees. Ramirent's leadership behaviors define what good leadership at Ramirent should look like and aim at creating a Great Place to Work and a first class customer experience at all levels.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
Safety is a top priority for Ramirent. We aim to make the construction industry safer. As a company serving a large customer base in the construction and general manufacturing industry, Ramirent actively promotes safety culture within the organization and business partners, and to

all customers by providing training in matters related to safe use of machines and equipment, and building a safe working environment. Ramirent continuously develops tools and practices to help construction projects to be run safely and efficiently in every phase and be completed on time and within budget. Ramirent's own R&D work specializes in safety, in particular, fall protection and traffic safety. Based on the vast machine user data collected from customer project sites throughout the year, Ramirent has developed new products with improved unique safety features.
EMPLOYEE AND SOCIAL MATTERS RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT Together the Ramirent Human Resources Board and Health, Safety, Environmental and Quality (HSEQ) board manage and develop key areas related to Ramirent's staff as well as health and safety risks in Ramirent's operations. Ramirent has developed and implemented internal controls to mitigate the employee related key risks, established relevant transfers of risk where mitigation is not possible and insured certain unforeseen and unexpected events.
Risks related to employee competence and engagement are monitored in annual RamiEar employee surveys. Annual development discussions of personnel have a key role in supporting the well-being and engagement of Ramirent employees. In Ramirent we recognize potential hazard categories of accidents, physical, chemical, biological hazards as well as physical and psychosocial work load. Examples of hazard risks include situations where employees need to work outside in difficult weather conditions or operate non-standard and complex machinery.
The social and employee related risk management practices cover physical inspection of sites, fleet, workspaces and control activities (monitoring of overtime, supervision, medical inspection, internal audits) as well as data analysis and follow up of key performance indicators on a regular basis. Ramirent has invested in good, high-quality and safe working clothes and safety equipment and instructed employees and business partners on Ramirent sites to follow safety instructions. Instructions

and training is provided to employees and customers in regards to the safe use of our machinery and equipment to avoid any personal damages.
HUMAN RIGHTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY
In Ramirent we show respect for human rights. Ramirent Code of Conduct sets forth the key principles of the UN Global Compact which in short are: supporting the protection of human rights, freedom of association and collective bargaining, free labor and undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and working against corruption in all forms. The key principles of conduct at Ramirent are: equality, respect, integrity and confidentiality. The purpose of Code of Conduct is to guide the decisions, procedures and systems of Ramirent in a way that contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations. The Code is applicable to all Ramirent employees, directors, subcontractors and suppliers working with the Ramirent Group. All employees are introduced to the Code at the start of the employment. Conduct matters are also part of annual professional development discussions with the supervisor and surveyed in the RamiEar group-wide employee survey. Results are analyzed and subject for next year development and training programs.
Ramirent's SpeakUp Line is also available for reporting of all suspected violations of human rights or any fraudulent activity. In 2017 no violations of human rights were identified. Zero violations of human rights is also the target for the future. Ramirent continues to improve its policies and practices to better guide employees and business partners as well as to invest into development and education of employees. Key risks related to violation of human rights are similar to the risks mentioned in social and employee related matters. Further risks are potential violations against the freedom of association, right for collective bargaining, unequal treatment of people as well as unfair pay for the employees or subcontractors. Ramirent evaluates the respect for human rights in the tendering process when selecting subcontractors and business partners. The human rights related risk is evaluated as part of regular HR and HSEQ risk management practices and quarterly as part of overall Enterprise Risk Management process.
Ramirent aims to work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery, according to key principles of the UN Global Conduct. Fraud and Anti-Corruption Policy as well as Compliance Policy have been developed in 2017 to help in communicating these issues to all staff. The implementation of these policies is proceeding during 2018 with internal process improvements, Group wide communication and development of follow-up process and KPIs. Ramirent Code of Conduct gives behavioral guidance and sets basis for addressing corruption and bribery. The Code of Conduct is an important tool in our work to prevent misconduct. Violations of the Ramirent Code of Conduct are reported to Ramirent's

Executive Management Team. Ramirent Supplier Code of Conduct is in development for 2018.
Key risks in equipment rental business include fraudulent use of our equipment, fraudulent invoicing from vendors and subcontractors, customer fraud, manipulation of bidding and sourcing processes and bribery of customers.
Managing fraud, corruption and bribery risks is continuous and embedded in Ramirent's business processes. Ramirent is developing the design and implementation for the internal controls system in order to optimize the follow-up activities and ensure better and holistic assurance to the Board. The segment management is working locally on improving the implementation of the key control points in Ramirent end-to-end processes as well as further formalizing the controls and their follow-up.
Ramirent uses the SpeakUp Line to report on suspected anti-corruption and bribery related issues. The Internal Audit function acts as the owner of the line with regular follow-up of messages in it and reports to the Working Committee on the findings. Regular communication to promote and encourage employees and external parties to speak up on fraud and corruption as well as other matters will continue. Policies, procedures and practices are being developed based on the findings.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Ramirent is committed to sustainability from the ground up. Resource efficiency is the very core of our business, as renting and sharing equipment reduces the environmental burden. Ramirent continuously strives to minimize our daily environmental footprint in everything we do. Ramirent offers environmentally sustainable solutions that also make financial sense and we are always looking for innovative ways of helping our customers reduce their environmental impact. The RamiWay includes key procedures related to environmental issues and covers instructions for environmental impact assessments, use of chemicals, waste management and transports of hazardous chemicals. We train our employees and customers' staff on environmental issues on a continuous basis. We follow the development of the rules and regulations, modify our routines and methods according to the changing conditions and inform our customers continuously, e.g. in common projects. Our environmental focus areas include optimization of transports, energy-efficiency, safe and efficient use of chemicals, and water and waste management.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The key environmental risks for Ramirent include operating own premises, handling fleet, repair and maintenance, transportation and disposals of fleet, manufacturing, mobilization and demobilization of modules and scaffolding as well as managing project sites. The requirements concerning environment extend from our own activity also to our suppliers, so that our customers know that our offering fulfills the environmental standards.

RAMIRENT'S GUIDANCE FOR 2018
In 2018, Ramirent's comparable EBIT is expected to increase from the level in 2017.
MARKET OUTLOOK FOR 2018
Ramirent's market outlook is based on the available forecasts disclosed by local construction and industry associations in its operating countries.
The demand outlook for the start of 2018 looks favorable for equipment rental across Ramirent's diverse customer base and geographies. In Finland, market conditions in the equipment rental market are expected to continue to be favorable. In Sweden, continued strong momentum in the construction sector is expected to maintain the demand for equipment rental going into 2018, although the medium-term outlook is more uncertain and the risk level is elevated. The Danish and Norwegian equipment rental markets are estimated to remain fairly stable. In the Baltic countries, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, the market conditions for equipment rental are expected to remain favorable.

Alternative performance measures
In addition to performance measures according to IFRS, Ramirent's consolidated financial statements and other communication to investors contain certain financial performance measures that are not defined by IFRS. These alternative performance measures are used by management to assess the financial and operational performance of the Group. Management believes that the alternative performance measures provide useful information on Ramirent's financial and operational performance and enhance comparability between financial periods.
The alternative performance measures used by Ramirent include e.g. EBITDA, EBITA, Return on capital employed, Return on equity, Equity ratio, Net debt to EBITDA -ratio and Cash flow after investments.
In addition to alternative performance measures Ramirent presents comparable key figures such as Comparable EBITA, Comparable EBIT, Comparable Return on capital employed and Comparable return on equity. These comparable key figures are calculated from the IFRS or alternative performance measures by adjusting "items affecting comparability (IAC)", i.e. incomes, expenses, assets, equity and liabilities arising from activities that amend Ramirent's business operations or are incurred outside its normal course of business, such as restructuring costs, impairment losses, significant write-downs of assets and significant gains or losses on sale of assets and businesses. The comparable key figures are disclosed to enhance comparability between financial periods. Definitions of all IFRS performance measures, alternative performance measures and comparable key figures are disclosed on page 50 of these financial statements.
The alternative performance measures should not be considered as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with the IFRS.

Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differ-

There are no options outstanding or available from any of Ramirent's earlier option programs. There is no general supplementary pension plan for Executive Management Team members.
INFORMATION ABOUT VALID AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING REMUNERATION, AS WELL AS DECISIONS MADE BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS PART OF REMUNERATION
The Annual General Meeting of 2016 resolved to grant to the Board of Directors an authorization to decide on the repurchase of the Company's own shares. The authorization is valid until the Annual General Meeting of 2018, and besides other purposes, the own shares may be repurchased also as part of the Company's incentive program. Own shares have not been repurchased for incentive program purposes during the year 2017.
The Annual General Meeting of 2016 resolved to grant to the Board of Directors an authorization to decide on the share issue and/or issuance of option rights, convertible bonds and/or other special rights entitling to shares. The

RAMIRENT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

RAMIRENT REMUNERATION STATEMENT 2017

authorization shall be valid until March 17, 2021 and it entitles the utilization of the authorization, among other things, for directed share issue as part of the Company's incentive program for personnel (either against payment or for free). The authorization granted in 2016 was utilized for the settlement of the long-term share incentive program 2014.
SETTLEMENT OF THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM 2014 The Board of Directors of Ramirent decided on February 16, 2017 on a directed share issue for the reward payment from Ramirent Long-term incentive program 2014. In the share issue 18,920 existing Ramirent Plc shares were conveyed without consideration to the key persons participating in the Long-term incentive program 2014 according to the terms and conditions of the plan. As the program was set forth to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the key persons of the Group in order to increase the value of the company, there was an especially weighty financial reason for the directed share conveyance.
The key persons are required to hold the shares received on the basis of the program as long as the value of the shares held by a key person in total corresponds to a value less than the person's six months gross salary.
The decision on the directed share issue was based on the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 17, 2016.
ANNUAL BONUSES
The Board sets annually the terms and the targets and the maximum amounts for annual bonuses. The amount of eventual bonuses is based on financial performance criteria, such as EBITA of the Group and the respective segment or country. The achievement of the targets of the CEO and the Executive Management Team members is evaluated by the Working Committee and the payment of the eventually achieved bonuses is confirmed by the Board.
In 2017, the maximum annual bonus for the CEO could be up to 80 percent of his annual base salary. For the other members of the Executive Management Team the maximum annual bonus could be up to 50 percent of their annual base salary.
PERFORMANCE­BASED LONG­TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS During the financial year 2017, Ramirent Plc had three share-based incentive plans in operation. The plans have been established to form part of the long-term incentive and commitment program for the key personnel of the company and its subsidiaries. The aim is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the key personnel in order to increase the value of the company, to commit the key personnel to the company, and to offer the key personnel a competitive reward program based on holding the company´s shares. In the plans the participants are offered the opportunity to earn matching shares on the

basis of share ownership and performance shares on the basis of performance targets set for a three-year earning period. Plan 2014­2016 ended in 2017 and a total number of 18,920 net shares and a cash payment equaling to the value of 28,311 shares were paid. An eventual reward from the earning periods 2015­2017 and 2016­2018 is based on the share ownership (matching), Economic Profit (performance) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), which may cut the total number of shares earned. No reward shall be paid to a person who's employment ends prior to the reward payment. The maximum reward to be based on the basis of the incentive programs 2015 and 2016 will correspond to the value of up to 934,168 Ramirent Plc shares (including also the proportion to be paid in cash).
The Board of Directors of Ramirent Plc also approved on December 14, 2017 a new Performance Share Plan 2018­2020 for the Executive Management Team members. The aim of the new plan is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the Executive Management Team Members in order to increase the value of the company in the long-term, to retain the Executive Management Team Members at the company, and to offer them a competitive reward plan that is based on earning and accumulating the company's shares. The potential reward from this plan will be paid partly in the company's shares and partly in cash in 2021. The cash proportion is intended to cover taxes arising from the reward to the plan participants. The potential reward from the Performance Share Plan 2018­2020 will be based on the participant's short-term incentive plan targets in 2018 as well as on the Group's cumulative EPS development in 2018­2020. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the Performance Share Plan 2018­2020 correspond to an approximate maximum total of 270,000 Ramirent Plc shares including also the proportion to be paid in cash.
DEFERRED INCENTIVE PLANS 2017 AND 2018
The Board of Directors of Ramirent Plc approved on 14 December 2016 a Deferred Incentive Plan (DIP) for 2017 to maximally support the company's short-term key priority of delivering improved EBITA and to offer key employees a competitive reward and retention program. The 2017 Deferred Incentive Plan includes one earning period, calendar year 2017, with a lock-up period of two years whereby the potential reward will be paid in cash in 2020. The incentive plan includes approximately 120 key employees. The members of the Executive Management Team are included in the target group of the 2017 Deferred Incentive Plan. The potential reward from the 2017 incentive plan for the earning period 2017 will be based on the participant's short term incentive plan targets. In addition, to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the Executive Management Team, the total reward potential for Executive Management Team members will also be based on the Group's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the earning period 2017 and the two-year lock-up period. The maximum reward of the Deferred Incentive Plan 2017 to be paid in cash in 2020 will correspond to up to 3.7 million euros.
The Board of Directors of Ramirent Plc approved on

121

RAMIRENT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

RAMIRENT REMUNERATION STATEMENT 2017

December 14, 2017 a new Deferred Incentive Plan 2018 to maximally support the implementation of the company's renewed strategy and to offer key employees a competitive reward and retention program. The Deferred Incentive Plan includes one earning period, calendar year 2018, with a lock-up period of two years whereby the potential reward will be paid in cash in 2021. The incentive plan was extended to include approximately 160 key employees. The potential reward from the incentive plan for the earning period 2018 will be based on the participant's short-term incentive plan targets. The maximum reward of the Deferred Incentive Plan 2018 to be paid in 2021 will amount up to approximately EUR 2.6 million. The members of the Executive Management Team are not included in the target group of the Deferred Incentive Plan as they are part of the Performance Share Plan 2018­2020 where the potential reward is paid in Ramirent shares.
RECOGNITION PRINCIPLES OF THE LONG­TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

The cash­settled portion relates to personal taxes and other employer's contributions.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

AUDITOR'S REPORT

Auditor's Report (Translation of the Finnish Original) To the Annual General Meeting of Ramirent Plc
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
In our opinion, · the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's financial position and financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU · the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
Our opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
We have audited the financial statements of Ramirent Oyj (Business ID: 0977135-4) for the year ended 31 December 2017. The financial statements comprise:
· the consolidated statement of financial position, statement of income, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows and notes, which include a summary of significant accounting policies
· the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements.

our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH OVERVIEW
Materiality · Overall group materiality:  4.5 million.
Group scoping · The group audit scope includes all significant companies in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Poland, covering the vast majority of revenues, assets and liabilities.
Key Audit matters · Revenue recognition · Valuation of goodwill · Valuation and existence of fleet assets
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
INDEPENDENCE
We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to

MATERIALITY
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of

RAMIRENT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

128

AUDITOR'S REPORT

our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.

Overall group materiality
How we determined it
Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied

 4.5 million
Net sales and profit before tax for 2017
We chose the combination of net sales and profit before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, the performance of
the Group is most commonly measured by using these criteria, and it is a generally accepted benchmark.

HOW WE TAILORED OUR GROUP AUDIT SCOPE
We tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls and the size, complexity and risk of individual subsidiaries. The group audit scope was focused on the most significant companies in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Poland. In addition, we performed analytical procedures at group level over the remaining companies.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
KEY AUDIT MATTER IN THE AUDIT OF THE GROUP
REVENUE RECOGNITION Refer to note 2.2 in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group's revenue streams consist of rental of construction machinery and equipment, services related to the rental of machinery and equipment, trade of construction related goods and sale of used equipment.
Rental revenue from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease arrangement. Revenues from services are recognised in the period when the service is rendered to the customer. Equipment, which is no longer held for rental, is transferred from tangible assets to inventory and recorded as revenue when a sales transaction takes place.
Revenue recognition includes a risk that revenue is not recorded in the correct period or that recorded sales transactions have not occurred. Therefore, this has been a focus area in our audit.

revenue transactions including, among other things, the following:
· We used revenue data auditing techniques to check revenue transactions. This enabled us to focus our testing on higher risk transactions.
· We selected sales invoices recorded during the financial period on a sample basis and matched incoming cash to recorded revenue transactions.
· We tested a sample of sales transactions recorded in December 2017 and January 2018 to evaluate that revenue had been recognized in the right period.
· We tested credit invoices issued in January 2018 to ensure that they were recorded in the right financial period.
· We tested a sample of accrued income and deferred revenue balances by reference to supporting documentation.
VALUATION OF GOODWILL Refer to note 3.2 in the consolidated financial statements.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group's goodwill balance amounted to  135 million.
The company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the goodwill. The recoverable amounts are determined using value in use model.
Valuation of goodwill is a focus area in the audit due to the size of the goodwill balance and the high level of management judgement involved in relation to estimates of future cash flows.
Our audit of goodwill valuation focused on management's judgement and estimates used. We have assessed the appropriateness of these through the following procedures:
· We tested the methodology applied in the value in use calculation by comparing it to the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and we tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
· We evaluated the process by which the future cash flow forecasts were drawn up.
· We tested the key underlying assumptions for the cash flow forecasts, including sales and profitability forecasts, discount rates used and the implied growth rate beyond the forecasted period, e.g. by comparing sales forecasts to budget and long-term financial targets approved by the Board of Directors.
· We compared the current year actual results included in the prior year impairment model to corroborate the reliability of management's estimates.
· We considered whether the sensitivity analysis performed by management around key drivers of the cash flow forecast was appropriate. We also considered the appropriateness of the related
disclosures provided in note 3.2 in the Group financial statements.

HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
We reviewed management's key controls around revenue and receivables.
In addition, we performed substantive testing of

AUDITOR'S REPORT

The estimates of the fleet assets' useful lives and residual value have a significant impact on the financial statements both in terms of the annual depreciation charge and the profits recognized on the disposal of fixed assets. In addition, fleet assets have a high frequency of movement in individual assets, through asset purchases, rentals, disposals and transfers around the customer centres.
Valuation and existence of fleet assets is a focus area in the audit due to the size of the fleet assets balance and the high level of management judgement involved in ensuring that fleet assets are accurately valued.
Our audit work included reviewing management's key controls in place to ensure existence and appropriate value of rental assets. Such controls include authorisation of additions, disposals and scrappings, evaluation of the useful economic lives, stock taking routines and the reconciliation of fixed assets registers to the accounting records.
In addition, our audit procedures included, among other things, the following:
· We attended a number of the fleet counts and performed independent test counts to validate the existence of assets and accuracy of the counting performed. We tested that the records from the counts had been used to update both the fixed asset register and the accounting ledgers.
· We selected a sample of assets acquired in the year and agreed the amounts recorded on the fixed assets registers to invoices.
· We tested the depreciation of the fixed assets through a combination of detailed testing and analytical audit procedures. We have no key audit matters to report with respect to
our audit of the parent company financial statements. There are no significant risks of material misstatement
referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability

to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or

the group to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and con-
tent of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view. · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
In our opinion · the information in the report of the Board of Directors
is consistent with the information in the financial statements · the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
