CEO letter

2017

Dear stakeholders,

2017 was a significant year for Fortum. During the year we took many important steps in our strategy implementation. We invested in solar and wind power production, restructured our ownership in Hafslund, and towards the end of the year, announced our investment in Uniper. The impacts of our previous investments in renewables, in circular economy, and in Russia can be seen in our strengthened financial results. Our performance was supported by the improving market conditions which had a positive effect on our 2017 results.
Significant strategic milestones reached
Driving the change for a cleaner world is at the heart of Fortum's strategy and our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency, and providing smart solutions. CO2-free power generation and deep knowledge about how to operate generation assets is in the very core of Fortum's DNA. It is complemented by our thorough understanding of power markets and trading as well as our deep expertise in combined heat and power production. This is the solid foundation that we build our future on.
Our strategy is based on four cornerstones with a clear priority order. Our first priority and most important cornerstone is to drive productivity and industry transformation. Cornerstone number two and our second priority is to offer solutions for sustainable cities. Through cornerstones three and four ­ growing in solar and wind and building new energy ventures ­ we target to secure our long-term competitiveness in the future energy system.
Following the earlier successful Ekokem and Hafslund transactions, we announced the bid for Uniper towards the end of 2017. By investing in Uniper, Fortum continues the strategy implementation and capital redeployment to enable a more efficient use of our balance sheet. Together Fortum and Uniper have a good strategic mix of assets ­ both clean and secure ­ as well as the expertise required to successfully and affordably drive Europe's transition towards a low-carbon energy system. At the end of the acceptance period in February 2018, 47.12% of Uniper's shares had

been tendered to our offer, including Uniper's largest shareholder E.ON's 46.65% shareholding.
The Hafslund restructuring was concluded in the fourth quarter and the new business structure is now in place. Together with our new colleagues from Hafslund, we have updated the strategies for both our Consumer Solutions and City Solutions divisions. We have now set the path forward and will be working together on implementing the strategy. We target annual synergies of EUR 15­20 million by the end of 2020.
In line with our strategy, we are also investing in new renewable generation and targeting a gigawatt-scale portfolio of wind and solar power. In January 2018, we commissioned Russia's first industrial wind power site with a capacity of 35 MW. During 2017, we also started the implementation of other wind power plants in the Nordics and in Russia, invested in solar power in Russia, and commissioned our largest solar power plant in India.
The operating environment improved in 2017
Following several years of decline power prices reached their lowest levels in February 2016. After that prices rebounded and the upward trend continued through most of 2017. The price of coal, which is one of the main drivers for European power prices, continued slightly upward throughout 2017. However, the mild and wet weather resulting in higher hydro reservoirs and higher hydro production volumes, depressed the Nordic power price for the fourth quarter of 2017.
During 2017, the hydrological situation in the Nordic area strengthened due to clearly higher than normal precipitation. At the beginning of 2017, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 75 TWh and by the end of the year the reservoir level increased to 86 TWh.
Prices for CO2 emission allowances declined during the first half of the year, but rebounded and ended the year clearly above the 2017 level, which added to the volatility in the Nordic power prices. In December 2017, the EU took a very welcome decision to strengthen the EU emission trading scheme. Although the new legislation will increase the emission reduction target and strengthen

2

the Market Stability Reserve, it still falls short of meeting the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement.
Strong financial, but disappointing safety performance
Our performance improvement in 2017 was broad-based, with comparable operating profit increasing in most segments. The Generation, City Solutions, and Russia segments continued to perform well, while the Consumer Solutions segment continues to be under pressure due to the tight competitive situation. The acquisitions of Ekokem and Hafslund are already impacting our results positively, further strengthened by our continued Fortumwide focus on cost and overall efficiency. We have now reached the targeted EUR 100 million savings in fixed costs announced in 2016. The cost savings have enabled us to invest in new ventures for the future.
Going forward we will continue to focus on cost efficiency and investment prioritisation. Sustainability and safety continue to be very important for us at Fortum. 2017 was a challenging year in terms of occupational safety. We did not reach our targets for lost workday injury frequency, especially for contractors. This was a clear disappointment, even though we succeeded in reducing the number of severe accidents to only one. We continue to be committed to keeping our promise to provide a safe workplace for all.
In 2017, our CO2 emissions decreased slightly. Our specific emissions remained at the same level as the previous year and continue to be at a low level compared to other European power producers.
Accelerating the energy transition with our Uniper investment
The investment in Uniper is a large investment for Fortum and is in line with our strategic goal to drive productivity and industry transformation in Europe. We are also convinced that the investment will accelerate Europe's energy transition in line with our vision "For a cleaner world".
Out of Uniper's 38 GW generation capacity approximately 50% is based on gas, 30% based on coal, and 20% is hydro and nuclear

power, all of which will have an important role to play during the transition towards a low-carbon energy system. While coal-fired generation must be phased out over time, we have a responsibility to ensure security of supply and affordable energy for Europeans during the transition. Uniper's declared role as a provider of security of supply is an excellent match with Fortum's ambition to accelerate the energy transition with increasing renewable generation and innovative solutions.
We aim to take an active role in driving European energy transition. We see plenty of opportunities for co-operation with Uniper to add value for all stakeholders, and we have entered into talks with Uniper to formalise the relationship between our companies after the transaction is finalised. Going forward, Fortum will focus on being an active, supportive, and reliable shareholder of Uniper and a constructive strategic partner to the company, its employees, and other stakeholders. We truly see our investment as a win-win for all involved.
Strategy execution continues with disciplined capital allocation
Fortum has been and will continue to be committed to a cleaner Europe and a controlled transition to a low-carbon energy system. Fortum's CO2-free production capacity has grown substantially over the last few decades and we will continue to focus on increasing it.
To the extent we have fossil production, our goal and strategy is, of course, to make it as efficient as possible. Our specific CO2 emissions from power generation, measured as grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour produced (gCO2/kWh), makes us one of the lowest emitters of all utilities in Europe. In 2017, 96% of our power generation in the European Union was CO2-free. Including the Russian power generation, which is mainly gas-based, and our Indian solar power we are still in the category of one of the cleanest utilities with 61% CO2-free and specific CO2 emissions of 173 gCO2/kWh.
The energy sector is among the key sectors that can contribute to mitigating climate change, but the focus should not be solely on electricity generation that accounts for only 20% of energy consumption in the EU. At Fortum, we have decided to take an active role in tackling the challenge also by creating solutions for

sustainable cities, by developing new products and services to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint, and by building new energy ventures that we believe will play an important role in the future sustainable energy system.
As the strategy implementation and capital redeployment continues, our dividend payment capability will be further strengthened. Fortum's Board of Directors is proposing an unchanged dividend of EUR 1.10 per share for the calendar year 2017. Our ambition is to pay a stable, sustainable, and over time increasing dividend now and in the future, and given the prevailing market conditions, our goal is to avoid a temporary dividend cut.
I would like to thank all our employees for the excellent work and true commitment during the year and our customers and all other stakeholders for the continued trust in us.
Pekka Lundmark President and CEO

Megatrends and the energy industry
The world we live in is changing at an ever-increasing pace. Staying competitive requires companies to be very aware of the underlying megatrends and to take an active role in driving the change for a better future.
This is especially true for the energy industry, as decarbonisation of the energy system plays an essential role in meeting the environmental targets of society. Only by working actively to decarbonise the energy system, significantly expand the share of renewable energy, reduce the emissions, increase the efficiency of older assets, and increase the amount of flexibility in the system can we mitigate climate change.
There are four megatrends that shape the energy sector: climate change and resource efficiency, urbanisation, digitalisation & new technologies, and active customers. These megatrends will bring profound changes not only to how energy is produced and sold to customers, but also to how it is consumed. The megatrends will also push to maximise the value of resources, such as waste and biomass.
Climate change and resource efficiency
Climate change and global warming is one of the largest challenges facing mankind. The problem is global, and global efforts and commitment are required in order to solve it. Discussions about climate change have been ongoing for decades, but actions have not been sufficient, due to lack of commitment, although positive developments have been seen in some regions.
With the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, mitigation of climate change rose to the top of the agenda all over the world. The commitment to mitigate climate change in order to limit global warming is now so widely spread that it affects every industry. The effects can be seen everywhere, e.g. the increase in low- or zero-emission housing, better fuel efficiency, the increase in the number of electric vehicles, the rapid growth in solar and wind power production, fuel switches to more environmentally friendly fuels, increased resource efficiency, and waste recycling.

The whole energy industry is very heavily affected by this megatrend. This can be seen in the transition to low-carbon and renewable generation, which increases the share of intermittent power production and the need for demand response and flexible generation capacity. The increased need for resource efficiency paves the way for circular economy solutions.
Urbanisation
The second megatrend is urbanisation. Over the last decades an ever-increasing share of the world's population has moved to urban areas and the trend is continuing. This megatrend is very evident in the emerging markets of Asia, where an increasing share of the global GDP growth comes from the growing urban areas.
For many people in developing countries urbanisation might also mean electrification as 1.2 billion people still lack access to electricity. Increased urbanisation creates a demand for sustainable, efficient, and reliable utility services. In many areas of the world the current heating, cooling and energy production is based on old technologies with high emissions and low efficiency. The increasing urbanisation creates a demand for utilities with efficient solutions for heating, cooling, and electricity production.
New solutions are also needed for transportation and waste management. The amount of waste is expected to nearly double between 2015 and 2025. Even with the increase in recycling and waste-to-energy solutions, the global municipal solid waste going to landfills is projected to grow over the coming years.

Digitalisation & new technologies
Technology development has always been a driver for change. Digitalisation as a megatrend is further fuelled by the accelerated pace of commercialisation and adoption of new technologies. The processing power of devices is increasing and the amount of connected devices is growing exponentially. This in combination with an ever-increasing amount of data readily available for consumers and businesses creates the perfect breeding ground for innovation.
This megatrend affects all companies and businesses. Rapid technological development and high adoption rates quickly drive down the costs for new technologies.

In the energy sector the cost of wind and solar power is decreasing. In the next 25 years the amount of solar power is expected to grow 12-fold and wind power more than 3-fold. This development leads to an increasing share of intermittent power production and fewer running hours for traditional baseload power. This challenges the way the energy system has been functioning, where production has been able to adapt to the changing power demand of customers.
Digitalisation opens up for new storage and demand response solutions, which will change the way the customer interacts with the market. There will be new ways to produce, market, sell, and deliver products and services offered by utilities, start-ups, and

new market entrants. Through these services, customers can take an active part in balancing a future power system that is heavily dependent on intermittent power production.
Active customers
As new technologies are creating a market for new products, there is another megatrend driving the change: active customers. Customers are becoming more conscious about their choices and how they affect society. Customers are more willing to participate in the energy markets, they are aware of what the new technologies enable, and they are demanding services and solutions for that, e.g. home automation, electrical vehicles with smart charging solutions, local power production and storage, as well as demand response solutions.
The market for prosumers (consumers who produce some of their own energy) is growing rapidly. They require solutions for storage and two-way power flows to/from their house, as they act both as consumers and producers of energy. This challenges how the energy markets traditionally have worked and offers great potential for innovation and growth.
The large majority of customers are not yet demanding these types of services, but as the services emerge, they can be expanded to the masses on a large scale, which will have profound effects on the whole market.

By utilising demand response, Fortum's Spring venture has built a one-megawatt virtual battery with the help of one thousand of its consumer customers. The growing virtual battery will play an increasingly important role in maintaining energy system balance.

Market Development
Following several years of declining power prices long-term low levels were reached in February 2016. After that prices rebounded and the upward trend continued until September 2017. The price of coal (one of the main drivers for European power prices) continued slightly upward throughout 2017. However, the mild and wet weather resulting in higher hydro reservoirs and higher hydro production volumes depressed the Nordic power price for the fourth quarter of 2017.
Prices for CO2 emission allowances (EUA) started at EUR 6.5 per tonne in the beginning of 2017 and declined to only EUR 4.5 in May. Thereafter CO2-prices increased steadily to EUR 8.2 per tonne at the end of 2017. This added to the price volatility on the Nordic power market.
In 2017 the hydrological situation strengthened due to clearly higher than normal precipitation in the Nordic area. At the beginning of 2017, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 75 TWh,
Following several years of declining power prices the long-term low levels were reached in February 2016. After that prices rebounded and the upward trend continued until September 2017.

which is 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23 TWh lower than a year earlier. By the end of the year, reservoirs were 3 TWh above the long-term average and 11 TWh higher than at the end of 2016.
During the first five month of 2017 the Nordic spot power prices were higher than in 2016, mainly due to the very low prices in the beginning of 2016. During the end of the year spot prices were around the same levels as the previous year.
The average system spot price in Nord Pool for the year 2017 was EUR 29.4 per MWh, and the average area price in Finland was EUR 33.2 per MWh and EUR 31.2 per MWh in Sweden SE3 (Stockholm). The main driver for the price increase was the clearly higher marginal cost of coal condensing power, which has contributed to stronger continental prices and increased exports from the Nordics.
Nordic electricity consumption in 2017 increased only marginally by 2 TWh to 392 TWh compared to 2016. A modest basic demand growth seen in the Nordic countries contributed to the increase in consumption.

Strategy
The transition towards a cleaner world
The entire energy sector is undergoing a transformation. Our vision is "For a cleaner world" and reflects our ambition to
drive the transformation towards a low-emissions energy system and optimal resource efficiency.
Our mission is to engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a cleaner world. Our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions. This way we deliver excellent shareholder value.
Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy in answering to these challenges. Business and responsibility are interconnected, underlining the role of sustainable solutions as a competitive advantage. In our operations, we give balanced consideration to economic, social and environmental responsibility. We assess our impacts and address sustainability throughout the value chain.
Our values ­ curiosity, responsibility, integrity, and respect ­ form the foundation for all our activities.
Fortum's strategy
Fortum's strategy has four cornerstones: · Drive productivity and industry transformation · Create solutions for sustainable cities · Grow in solar and wind · Build new energy ventures
Drive productivity and industry transformation As the entire energy sector is transforming, our first priority is to participate in the consolidation of the generation business in Europe.
Fortum wants to drive the change towards a cleaner world. However, the change will not happen overnight. Also during the transition we need an energy system that is secure, flexible, and clean. In addition to wind and solar power we need stable and reliable production, such as flexible hydro and gas power, that

secures the functioning of the society at all times, also when there is no wind and the sun does not shine.
In our strategy implementation, one of our goals has been to take a leading role in the consolidation of the European generation business, also through sizable acquisitions. In September 2017, we announced that we have agreed with E.ON to acquire their stake in Uniper and after the offer period ended in February 2018, 47.12% of the shares had been tendered, including E.ON's 46.65% shareholding. Uniper's stated role as the provider of security of supply will be an excellent match with our ambition to accelerate the energy transition with increasing renewable generation and innovative solutions. Both are needed to make the change

happen and each play a crucial part as Europe transitions from a conventional to a cleaner and more secure energy future.
Create solutions for sustainable cities We are utilising our know-how and experience to create scalable, sustainable solutions that improve the quality of urban life.
Growing cities and urban areas are facing multiple challenges, such as high emissions from inefficient heating, cooling, and electricity production, increasing amounts of waste, as well as high traffic pollution and noise. We offer today's digitalised active customers, businesses, and communities heating, cooling, waste management, recycling, and energy-related solutions. This way we

8

help the cities and its inhabitants solve the challenges sustainably and support building a circular economy.
We have successful partnerships in several cities, and joint ventures with Stockholm and Oslo, to jointly develop solutions for greener cities.
With the acquisitions of Ekokem and Turebergs in 2016, we broadened the scope of our City Solutions to include efficient resource management within the circular economy, which complement our competences in the energy sector well.
For us circular economy means that materials are recycled and utilised as efficiently as possible. At the same time, hazardous substances are removed from circulation. We believe that a phased migration to a circular economy offers a positive perspective and invaluable solutions to today's problems.
Our goal is to develop our recycling and waste management business and launch new solutions on the market for utilising waste as a raw material. We support industries and social actors to find solutions in which someone's waste is another's raw material.

Grow in solar and wind Solar and wind power have huge growth potential.
Increasing the generation of carbon-neutral energy is one important way to control climate change. Therefore, renewable energy sources play a key role in the change towards a cleaner world. By investing in solar and wind power we are also securing our long-term competitiveness.
We target a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio. These technologies are rapidly maturing. At the same time, utility competences are becoming increasingly important as subsidy schemes are gradually being phased out and renewable energy production is becoming more market-based.
We have started the transition and have 295 MW of solar and wind capacity in the Nordics, Russia, and India as well as several on-going projects. We have also announced plans to further expand our wind power production in Russia.

Build new energy ventures Technological and digital disruption accelerate energy sector transformation. Our goal is to be in the forefront of energy technology and application development.
Digitalisation is enabling us to create new customer offerings and improve the productivity of our businesses. Our focus areas include development of smart home solutions, electric transportation, demand response, and energy storage. Breaktrough's in these areas can transform the way we use energy.
In addition to our own R&D, we are investing in funds and cooperating with start-ups ­ jointly innovating both new technologies and business models in the changing energy industry landscape.

CO2-free Other

The Fortum transformation
Sustainability and CO2-free power generation have been part of Fortum's strategy for several decades. We believe that the energy system needs to transform to a system with substantially lower emissions, higher resource efficiency, and a higher share of power generation based on renewables. The transformation will not happen overnight and we must provide customers with a secure energy supply at a competitive price during the transition towards lower emissions. In implementing our strategy we have worked to increase our CO2-free power generation.
We also have generation capacity based on fossil fuels, located mainly in Russia, and we have worked to increase its efficiency and reduce its specific emissions. We continue to focus on increasing our solar and wind power capacity over the coming years, and we are targeting a gigawatt-scale portfolio in solar and wind power.
Long-term focus on increasing CO2-free power generation
Over the past decades Fortum has been working for a more sustainable world. We have increased our annual CO2-free power generation from around 15 TWh in 1990 to 45 TWh in 2017. The development has not always been linear, as annual variations in hydropower production have a significant impact.
We were among the early proponents for a market-based price on CO2. We are advocating for market-based solutions and a strengthening of the EU ETS to drive the necessary change in the energy system. In our own operations we have invested in CO2-free power generation, and the carbon exposure of our production in Europe is among the lowest in Europe at 28 gCO2/kWh in 2017. The respective figure for Fortum overall was 173 gCO2/kWh in 2017.

10

Increase efficiency and reduce specific emissions
When Fortum acquired the Russian power and heat generation company TGC-10 (currently PAO Fortum) in 2008, we committed to a substantial capacity investment program. In 2016, the investment programme was finalised. Thereby our Russian power and heat generation capacity has increased substantially. By investing in high-efficiency combined power and heat plants, we have increased the power and heat output and at the same time substantially decreased the specific CO2 emissions from our Russian power and heat production.
Fortum is now operating a fleet of power and heat plants with efficiency and emissions ranking among the best of our peers in Russia.
Grow in solar and wind
In addition to CO2-free hydro and nuclear power production, we believe that solar and wind power will play an essential role in the future. Solar power is becoming one of the most competitive forms of new power generation in many parts of the world, and we are targeting investments totalling EUR 200­400 million in solar power in India.
The market conditions in the Nord Pool area and in Russia are more suitable for wind power, and Fortum is increasing its investments heavily. In January 2018, Fortum commissioned the country's largest wind farm in Russia. In Sweden, Fortum is participating in the Blaiken wind park that is already operational and in the Solberg wind farm, which is due to be commissioned in 2018. In Norway, Fortum recently acquired the operational Nygårdsfjellet wind farm and the Ånstadblåheia and Sørfjord wind farms that are to be commissioned in 2018 and 2019 respectively.
Our target in wind power is up to 1,000 MW in the Nord Pool area and up to 500 MW in Russia.
Although the solar and wind capacity is still small compared to Fortum's current total power generation capacity of close to 14,000 MW, the growth in 2017 was substantial and the capacity increased from 58 MW to 295 MW.

We are satisfied with the progress of our strategy implementation during the year. Following the earlier Ekokem and Hafslund transactions, we announced the bid for Uniper towards the end of 2017. By investing in Uniper, Fortum continues the capital redeployment to enable a more efficient use of our balance sheet. The offer period commenced in November. At the end of the initial acceptance period in mid-January 2018, 46.93% of Uniper's shares had been tendered to our offer, including E.ON's 46.65% shareholding. Uniper shareholders who have not yet accepted our offer still have a chance to do so within the additional acceptance period.
Uniper's and Fortum's businesses complement each other well. Together Fortum and Uniper have a good strategic mix of assets ­ both clean and secure ­ as well as the expertise required to successfully and affordably drive Europe's transition towards a low-carbon energy system. We aim to take an active role in driving European energy transition. We see plenty of opportunities for co-operation with Uniper to add value for all stakeholders, and we have entered into talks with Uniper to formalise the relationship between our companies after the transaction is finalised. We truly see our investment as a win-win for all involved.

Quarterly financial information

Investor information

The Hafslund restructuring was concluded in the fourth quarter and the new business structure is in place. Together with our new colleagues from Hafslund, we have updated the strategies for both our Consumer Solutions and City Solutions divisions. We have now set the path forward and will be working together on implementing the strategy. We target annual synergies of EUR 15­20 million by the end of 2020.
In line with our strategy, we are not only focusing on taking part in the European power sector consolidation, we are also investing in new renewable generation and targeting a gigawattscale portfolio of wind and solar power. In January 2018 we commissioned Russia's first industrial wind power site with a capacity of 35 MW. In addition, we have recently started the implementation of other wind power plants in the Nordics and Russia and invested in solar power in Russia, and commissioned our largest solar power plant in India.
In the fourth quarter our performance improvement was broadbased, with comparable operating profit increasing in all operative segments. The Generation, City Solutions and Russia segments continued to perform well, while the Consumer Solutions segment continues to be under pressure due to the tight competitive situation. The acquisitions of Ekokem and Hafslund are already impacting our results positively, further strengthened by our continued Fortum-wide focus on efficiency. We have now reached the targeted EUR 100 million savings in fixed costs announced in 2016. The cost savings have enabled us to invest in new ventures for the future. Going forward we will continue to focus on cost efficiency and investment prioritisation.
Sustainability and safety continue to be very important for us at Fortum. 2017 was a challenging year in terms of occupational safety. We did not reach our targets for lost workday injury frequency, especially for contractors. This was a clear disappointment, even though we succeeded in reducing the number of severe accidents to only one. We continue to be committed to keeping our promise to provide a safe workplace for all. In 2017, our CO2 emissions decreased slightly. Our specific emissions remained at the same level as the previous year and continue to be at a low level compared to other European power producers.

As the strategy implementation and capital redeployment continues, our dividend payment capability will be further strengthened. Fortum's Board of Directors is proposing an unchanged dividend of EUR 1.10 per share for the calendar year 2017. Our ambition is to pay a stable, sustainable and over time increasing dividend now and in the future, and given the prevailing market conditions, our goal is to avoid a temporary dividend cut.
Uniper investment
In September 2017, Fortum announced it had signed a transaction agreement with E.ON under which E.ON had the right to decide to tender its 46.65% shareholding in Uniper SE into Fortum's public takeover offer. In November, Fortum launched a voluntary public takeover offer to all Uniper shareholders at a total value of EUR 22 per share implying a premium of 36% to the price prior to intense market speculation on a potential transaction at the end of May. The offer is subject to competition and regulatory approvals. Already in October 2017, Fortum received approval from the US competition authorities. Fortum expects to finalise the transaction in mid-2018.
The investment in Uniper delivers on Fortum's previously announced capital redeployment strategy and investment criteria. Uniper's businesses are well aligned with Fortum's core competencies, are close to Fortum's home markets and are highly cash generative. Fortum expects the investment to deliver an attractive return that will support the company in accelerating the development and implementation of sustainable energy technologies, without sacrificing a competitive dividend.
The offer will be financed with existing cash resources and committed credit facilities, with Barclays Bank PLC originally underwriting 100% of the credit facilities, including ongoing liquidity requirements. In October the credit facilities were syndicated to selected relationship banks of Fortum. Dividends received from the stake in Uniper will contribute to a stable and sustainable dividend for Fortum's shareholders. Fortum will account for Uniper as an associated company unless control according to IFRS is attained; as such, EBITDA and cash flow contribution, as well as the EPS effect on Fortum's results, will

depend on the final outcome of the offer. As a result of this transaction, Fortum's leverage will rise above our given guidance for net debt/EBITDA level of around 2.5x. Over time however, Fortum expects its cash generation in combination with the dividend from Uniper to reduce this level towards the stated target.
In January 2018, Fortum announced that shareholders representing 46.93% of the shares in Uniper had accepted the offer during the initial acceptance period, including E.ON. Uniper shareholders who have not tendered their shares to the offer within the initial acceptance period can still tender during the additional acceptance period that began on 20 January 2018 and ending on 2 February 2018. Fortum expects to publish the total amount of shares tendered on 7 February 2018.
Hafslund transaction
On 26 April 2017, Fortum and the City of Oslo entered into an agreement to restructure their ownership in Hafslund ASA, one of the largest listed power groups in the Nordic region. On 4 August 2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of the ownership in Hafslund. Fortum sold its 34.1% stake in Hafslund ASA to the City of Oslo, acquired 100% of Hafslund Markets AS and 50.0% of Hafslund Varme AS (renamed as Fortum Oslo Varme AS) including the City of Oslo's waste-to-energy company Klemetsrudanlegget AS (renamed as Fortum Oslo Varme KEA AS), and 10% of Hafslund Produksjon Holding AS.
The total debt-free price of the acquisitions was EUR 940 million. The combined net cash investment of the transactions, including the dividend received in May 2017, was EUR 230 million. Fortum booked a one-time tax-free sales gain in its 2017 results, totalling EUR 324 million, which corresponds to EUR 0.36 earnings per share. Transaction costs of EUR 4 million for the acquisitions were included in Items affecting comparability. The acquired businesses were consolidated into Fortum Group from 1 August 2017.

In 2017, sales were EUR 4,520 (3,632) million. The increase was mainly due to the strengthening Russian rouble and the consolidation of Ekokem, Hafslund and DUON. Comparable EBITDA totalled EUR 1,275 (1,015) million. Comparable operating profit totalled EUR 811 (644) million. Comparable operating profit was positively impacted by the consolidation of Hafslund, higher achieved power prices, lower real estate and capacity taxes in Swedish nuclear and hydro power plants and by improved result in the Russian operations. Operating profit totalled EUR 1,158 (633) million. Fortum's operating profit for the period was impacted by items affecting comparability of EUR 347 (-11) million, including updated provisions, sales gains, transaction costs and the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for hedging, as well as nuclear fund adjustments ( Note 5). The sales gains include a one-time tax-free sales gain of EUR 324 million from the divestment of the 34.1% stake in Hafslund ASA ( Note 38).
In 2017, Fortum reached the targeted EUR 100 million savings in fixed costs announced in 2016. At the same time, the cost spend has been shifted to businesses under development and new ventures.
The share of profit from associates and joint ventures was EUR 148 (131) million, of which Hafslund represented EUR 39 (51) million, TGC-1 EUR 32 (38) million and Fortum Värme EUR 66 (66) million. The share of profit from Hafslund is based on the company's published fourth-quarter 2016 and January­June 2017 interim reports. The share of profit from TGC-1 is based on the company's published fourth-quarter 2016 and January-September

2017 interim reports ( Note 18). Due to the restructuring of Hafslund and the divestment of Fortum's 34.1% share in the company, Fortum will no longer have share of profits from Hafslund ASA.
Net finance costs amounted to EUR 195 (169) million, including costs relating to financing arrangements for the Uniper transaction.
Profit before income taxes was EUR 1,111 (595) million. Taxes for the period totalled EUR 229 (90) million. The effective income tax rate according to the income statement was 20.6% (15.2%). The comparable effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of the share of profit from associated companies and joint ventures as well as non-taxable capital gains and other major one-time income tax effects, was 18.8% (20.0%) ( Note 12). The profit for the period was EUR 882 (504) million. Earnings per share were EUR 0.98 (0.56), of which EUR -0.14 per share was related to a Swedish income tax case and EUR 0.38 (-0.02) per share was related to items affecting comparability ( Note 6 and Note 36).
Cash flow
In 2017, net cash from operating activities increased by EUR 372 million to EUR 993 (621) million, due to a EUR 260 million increase in comparable EBITDA, a EUR 193 million decrease in realised foreign exchange gains and losses, a EUR 133 million decrease in income taxes paid and a EUR 183 decrease in working capital compared to the previous year. The foreign exchange gains and losses of EUR -83 (110) million relate to the rollover of foreign exchange contract hedging loans to Russian and Swedish subsidiaries. In June 2016, Fortum paid income taxes in Sweden totalling EUR 127 million regarding an ongoing tax dispute. The change in working capital in 2017 was EUR 81 (-102) million. The biggest impact was the effect of the daily cash settlements for futures in Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe ( Additional cash flow information).
Investments excluding acquisitions increased by EUR 58 million to EUR 657 (599) million compared to the previous year. Acquisition of shares amounted to EUR 972 (695) million mainly

due to the Hafslund transaction in 2017 and the acquisitions of Ekokem and Polish DUON in 2016. Divestment of shares, mainly the Hafslund transaction, amounted to EUR 741 million (39). Net cash used in investing activities decreased to EUR 807 (1,701) million including the increase in cash collaterals of EUR -3 (-359) million given as trading collaterals to commodity exchanges.
Cash flow before financing activities was EUR 187 (-1,080) million, mainly impacted by the Hafslund transaction.
In 2017, Fortum paid dividends totalling EUR 977 (977) million. Payments of long-term liabilities totalled EUR 543 (934) million, including the repayment of bonds of EUR 343 million and other loan repayments of EUR 200 million. The net decrease in liquid funds was EUR 1,241 (3,064) million.
Assets and capital employed
At the end of the reporting period, total assets amounted to EUR 21,753 (21,964) million, a decrease of EUR 211 million. Liquid funds at the end of the period amounted to EUR 3,897 (5,155) million. Capital employed decreased by EUR 477 million and was EUR 18,172 (18,649) million.

Equity
Equity attributable to owners of the parent company totalled EUR 13,048 (13,459) million.
The decrease in equity attributable to owners of the parent company was EUR 411 million, mainly due to the net profit for the period of EUR 866 million, translation differences of EUR -369 million and the dividend payment of EUR 977 million.
Financing
Net debt increased by EUR 1,036 million to EUR 988 (-48) million. At the end of the reporting period, the Group's liquid funds
totalled EUR 3,897 (5,155) million. Liquid funds include cash and bank deposits held by PAO Fortum amounting to EUR 246 (105) million. In addition to liquid funds, Fortum's undrawn committed credit facilities totalled EUR 1.8 billion ( Note 23), excluding

committed credit facilities of EUR 12.0 billion for Fortum's offer for Uniper shares.
Net financial expenses totalled EUR 195 (169) million, of which net interest expenses were EUR 132 (139) million. Net financial expenses include costs relating to financing arrangements of the Uniper transaction.
In September 2017, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings placed both Fortum's long-term and short-term credit ratings on credit watch negative on possible adverse impacts of the planned Uniper investment. In January 2018, Standard & Poor's downgraded Fortum's long-term credit rating from BBB+ to BBB with a Negative Outlook due to the Uniper investment. The short-term rating was affirmed at level A-2. Fitch Ratings rates Fortum's long-term credit rating at level BBB+ and the short-term rating at level F2.

Key figures
At the end of 2017, the comparable net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.8 (0.0).
Gearing was 7% (0%) and the equity-to-assets ratio 61% (62%). Equity per share was EUR 14.69 (15.15). Return on capital employed improved to 7.1% (4.0%). Fortum targets a long-term Return on capital employed of at least 10%.
Market conditions
Nordic countries
According to preliminary statistics, electricity consumption in the Nordic countries was 392 (390) terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2017.
At the beginning of 2017, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 75 TWh, which is 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23 TWh lower compared to the previous year. At the end of 2017, the reservoirs were 86 TWh, which is 3 TWh above the longterm average and 11 TWh higher compared to the previous year. Precipitation in the Nordics, was clearly above the normal level both in the fourth quarter and during the full year 2017.
The average system spot price in Nord Pool for the year 2017 was EUR 29.4 (26.9) per MWh, and the average area price in Finland was EUR 33.2 (32.4) per MWh and EUR 31.2 (29.2) per MWh in Sweden

(SE3, Stockholm). The main driver for the price increase was the clearly higher marginal cost of coal condensing power, which has contributed to stronger continental prices and increased exports from the Nordics.
In Germany, the average spot price in 2017 increased to EUR 34.2 (29.0) per MWh.
The market price of CO2 emission allowances (EUA) increased from EUR 6.5 per tonne at the beginning of the year to EUR 8.2 per tonne at the end of 2017.
Russia
Fortum operates both in the Tyumen and Khanty-Mansiysk area of Western Siberia, where industrial production is dominated by the oil and gas industries, and in the Chelyabinsk area of the Urals, which is dominated by the metal industry. The Russian market is divided in two price zones and Fortum operates in the First Price Zone.
Russian electricity consumption in 2017 was 1,035 (1,027) TWh and the corresponding figure for the First Price Zone was 799 (787) TWh.
In 2017, the average electricity spot price, excluding capacity price, was unchanged at RUB 1,204 (1,204) per MWh in the First Price Zone.

European business environment and carbon market
Revision of the EU ETS approved
After two and a half years of legislative processing the revision of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for the period 2021­2030 was adopted in December. The new rules will increase the annual emission reduction target of the ETS from the current 1.74% to 2.2%. From the carbon market balance and pricing perspective the essential improvement is the strengthening of the Market Stability Reserve (MSR), including a temporary doubling of the intake rate from 12% to 24% during 2019­2023 and cancellation of allowances from the reserve from 2023 onwards. In addition, the new directive includes a provision for voluntary cancellation of allowances from the market.
However, the agreed setup is not yet in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and meets only the lower end of the EU 2050 goal to reduce emissions by 80­95% by 2050.
Swedish hydropower legislation
In June, the Swedish Government released a proposal on revision of hydro legislation including changes in the Environmental Act. This is a follow-up of the Swedish energy agreement done in summer 2016 and includes adjustments to meet requirements based on the EU Water Framework Directive. The aim is to mitigate environmental impacts and facilitate more efficient power production. According to the proposal, environmental permits for hydropower should be revised during a 20-year period in accordance with a national plan for prioritisation. The Ministry of Environment aims to have the revised legislation in place in March 2018.
Fortum emphasises the need to reform the Swedish system for hydro management. However, the proposal fails in ensuring a fair balance between environmental improvements and power production and a reasonable level of legal certainty.
The energy agreement requires hydro power companies to carry the full cost of environmental improvements. The largest hydro power companies are planning a joint fund in order to

secure financing for the improvements. The fund is expected to be in operation from July 2018 provided that the revision of hydro legislation has been completed.
Swedish nuclear waste fund fee approved
In December, the Swedish Government decided on the waste fund fees for the period 2018­2020. The fees are based on a new structure with a calculated lifetime of 50 years and on parts of the funds capital being invested in shares.
Swedish nuclear and hydro taxes adopted
In May, the Swedish Parliament adopted the proposed changes of nuclear and hydropower taxation in accordance with the energy agreement from June 2016. Starting from 1 July 2017, the tax on installed effect in nuclear reactors decreased by 90%, from SEK 14,770/MW/month to SEK 1,500/MW/month, and on 1 January 2018 the tax was abolished. The hydropower real-estate tax will be reduced from 2.8% to 0.5% in four steps by 2020.
Development of Nordic energy cooperation
Development of regional energy cooperation in the Nordic context moved forward in 2017. Following the June 2017 report by independent investigator Jorma Ollila, the Nordic energy ministers discussed the report in their annual meeting in November. They agreed on next-step actions to implement these proposals, including a proposal to establish a Nordic electricity market forum comprising various actors in the sector to discuss topics particularly related to development of the Nordic regional power market.
Segment reviews
Generation
The Generation segment comprises power production in the Nordics including nuclear, hydro and thermal power production, powerportfolio optimisation, trading and industrial intelligence, and nuclear services globally.

1) The Nordic power sales income and volume includes hydro and nuclear generation, excluding minorities. It does not include thermal generation, minorities, customer business or other purchases.
2) Power plants are often built jointly with other power producers, and owners purchase electricity at cost including interest cost and production taxes. The share of profit/loss is mainly IFRS adjustments (e.g. accounting for nuclear-related assets and liabilities) and depreciations on fair-value adjustments from historical acquisitions ( Note 18).

In 2017, the Generation segment's total power generation in the Nordic countries was 44.2 (45.3) TWh. CO2-free production accounted for 99% (99%) of the total production.
Comparable EBITDA increased to EUR 603 (527) million. Comparable operating profit improved to EUR 478 (417) million. The increase was mainly related to the higher achieved power price, and lower real-estate and capacity taxes in Swedish hydro and nuclear power plants, and was partly offset by lower nuclear production volumes resulting from the closure of Oskarshamn 1 and lower nuclear availability.
Operating profit clearly increased to EUR 501 (338) million and was positively affected by EUR 23 (-79) million of the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for hedging Fortum's power production, updated provisions, and by nuclear fund adjustments ( Note 5).

The share of profits from associated companies and joint ventures totalled EUR -1 (-34) million ( Note 18).
The Nordic power price achieved in the Generation segment was EUR 31.8 (31.0) per MWh, EUR 0.8 per MWh higher than in 2016. The average system spot price of electricity in Nord Pool was EUR 29.4 (26.9) per MWh. The average area price in Finland was EUR 33.2 (32.4) per MWh and in Sweden (SE3, Stockholm) EUR 31.2 (29.2) per MWh.

On 4 August 2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of its ownership in Hafslund. Hafslund Markets has been consolidated into the results of Consumer Solutions as of 1 August 2017
Electricity and gas sales volumes totalled 24.4 (14.8) TWh. The total customer base at the end of the period was 2.49 (1.36) million.
Sales increased to EUR 1,097 (668) million, mainly due to the consolidation of Polish DUON and Hafslund.
Comparable EBITDA amounted to EUR 57 (55) million and comparable operating profit was EUR 41 (48) million. The consolidation of Hafslund had a positive effect of EUR 22 million on the comparable EBITDA and EUR 13 million on the comparable operating profit. The result improvement was offset by the lower average margin in electricity and gas products and higher costs arising from the increased focus and spend on the development of new digital services. The renegotiated invoicing service agreements for external distribution companies also had a negative impact on the results.
Operating profit declined to EUR 39 (59) million affected by sales gains and the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives, mainly used for hedging, EUR -2 (11) million ( Note 5).

After the completion of the multi-year investment programme in March 2016, Fortum's total capacity in Russia amounts to 4,794 MW, including 35 MW of solar power acquired at the end of 2017. The generation capacity built after the year 2007 amounts to 2,333 MW. Under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA ­ "new capacity") this capacity entitles Fortum to guaranteed payments for approximately ten years after the commissioning of each new unit. The received capacity payments vary depending on age, location, type and size of the plant, as well as on seasonality and availability. The CSA payments can also vary somewhat on an annual basis, as they are linked to Russian Government long-term bonds with eight to ten years maturity.
In March 2017, the System Administrator of the wholesale market published its annual data which is the basis for the CSA payment calculation. These components comprise among others the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the consumer price index (CPI) and re-examination of earnings from the electricity-only (spot) market (done every three and six years after commissioning of a unit). Fortum's CSA payment for 2017 was revised upwards to compensate for lower earnings from the electricity-only market. In addition, certain power plants were entitled to higher CSA payments when entering into the sevento-ten year time period of generation. The increase of the CSA payment was somewhat offset by lower Government bond rates and consumer price index (CPI).
Fortum's Russian capacity generation, totalling 2,461 MW, was allowed to participate in the Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS ­ "old capacity") for 2017. All Fortum plants offered in the auction were selected. Fortum has obtained forced mode status for 195 MW of its capacity, i.e. it receives higher-rate capacity payments.
In 2017, the Russia segment's power sales volumes amounted to 30.5 (29.5) TWh and heat sales volumes totalled 19.8 (20.7) TWh. The power volumes increased due to commissioning of the Chelyabinsk GRES unit 3.

Sales increased to EUR 1,101 (896) million, mainly supported by the strengthening of the Russian rouble, higher received CSA payments, the change in the heat supply scheme in Tyumen and commissioning of the Chelyabinsk GRES unit 3.
The Russia segment's comparable EBITDA was EUR 438 (312) million and the comparable operating profit was EUR 296 (191) million. The Russian rouble had a positive effect of EUR 31 million. The commissioning of the new unit, higher received CSA payments, higher power volumes, as well as improved bad-debt collections also affected the results positively.
Operating profit was EUR 295 (226) million, including sales gains of EUR 0 (35) million ( Note 5).
The share of profits from associated companies and joint ventures totalled EUR 31 (38) million ( Note 18).

Through its interest in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), Fortum is participating in the building of Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), a 1,600-MW nuclear power plant unit in Finland. The plant's start of regular electricity production is expected to take place in May 2019, according to the plant supplier AREVA-Siemens Consortium.
Olkiluoto 3 is funded through external loans, share issues and shareholder loans according to shareholder agreements between the owners and TVO. As a 25% shareholder in Olkiluoto 3, Fortum has committed to funding of the project pro rata. At the end of December 2017, Fortum's shareholder loans to TVO amounted to EUR 145 million and the outstanding commitment for was EUR 88 million ( Note 20).

The company was acquired as part of the acquisition of the electricity and gas sales company Grupa DUON S.A. (currently Fortum Markets Polska S.A.) in 2016. The divestment was concluded on 28 July 2017. The sale had a minor positive impact on Fortum's 2017 results.
Russia
On 27 April 2017, Fortum and RUSNANO, a Russian state-owned development company, signed a 50/50 investment partnership (joint venture) in order to secure the possibility of a Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) wind portfolio. In June, 1,000 MW of the bids of the Fortum-RUSNANO wind investment fund were selected in the Russian renewable energy auction. The bids were for projects to be commissioned during 2018­2022 with a price corresponding to approximately EUR 115­135 per MWh. The projects will be covered by CSA for a period of 15 years. The investment decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis within the total mandate of the wind investment fund. Fortum's equity stake in the wind investment fund totals a maximum of RUB 15 billion (currently approximately EUR 220 million). The amount is to be invested over time (approx. 5 years), subject to separate investment decisions. The investment fund has selected Vestas as the supplier of wind turbines in Russia. In October 2017,

the wind investment fund made an investment decision on the first 50-MW wind farm. The wind farm is expected to start production during the first half of 2019.
In November 2017, Fortum completed the replacement investment at the Chelyabinsk GRES power plant. The new combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) unit with 247.5 MW of electricity generation capacity and 174 MW of heat capacity started commercial operation. The new turbine replaces the previous eight turbine generators in the power plant. This unit is not within the scope of the previously completed larger investment programme and consequently receives Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS) payments. Fortum's Chelyabinsk GRES site has electricity generation capacity of 742 MW and heat production capacity of 988 MW.
On 30 November 2017, Fortum signed an agreement to acquire three solar power companies from Hevel Group, Russia's largest integrated solar power company. The transaction was closed in December 2017. All three power plants are operational with a total capacity of 35 MW. The plants will receive Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) payments for approximately 15 years after commissioning at an average CSA price corresponding to approximately EUR 430/MWh. The plants were commissioned in 2016 and 2017. Hevel Group will provide operation and maintenance services for all three power plants.
Other
In January 2017, Fortum finalised the acquisition of three wind power projects from the Norwegian company Nordkraft. The transaction consists of the Nygårdsfjellet wind farm, which is already operational, as well as the fully-permitted Ånstadblåheia and Sørfjord projects. The wind farms are expected to be commissioned in 2018 and 2019. When built, the total installed capacity of the three wind farms will be approximately 170 MW. On 29 September 2017, Fortum announced the decision to invest in the Sørfjord wind farm in northern Norway. The Sørfjord wind park will have 23 wind turbines with a total capacity of 97 megawatts. The wind turbines for Sørfjord will be delivered by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy.
In March 2017, Fortum commissioned the 70-MW solar plant at Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan, India and in December 2017

Fortum commissioned the 100-MW solar plant at Pavagada solar park in Karnataka, India. Fortum won a reverse auction for the projects in 2016. The power plants will operate based on a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with a fixed tariff for 25 years. The Power Purchase Agreements have been made with National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), India's largest power utility.
Research and development
Sustainability is at the core of Fortum's strategy and, alongside Fortum's current businesses, the company is carefully exploring and developing new sources of growth within renewable energy production.
Fortum's goal is to be at the forefront of energy technology and application development. To accelerate innovation and the commercialisation of new offerings, Fortum is strengthening its in-house innovation and digitalisation efforts and building partnerships with leading global suppliers, promising technology and service companies, and research institutions. Fortum makes direct and indirect investments in start-ups that have promising new innovations focused on connectivity, have disruptive potential and accelerate the transition towards a circular economy. Fortum also invests in technologies that support better utilisation of the current asset base and that can create new markets and products for Fortum. The company is continuously looking for emerging clean energy solutions and for solutions that increase resource and system efficiency.
The Group reports its R&D expenditure on a yearly basis. In 2017, Fortum's R&D expenditure was EUR 53 (52) million, or 1.2% (1.4%) of sales.

The maximum number of shares that may potentially be delivered as a reward under the 2018­2020 LTI plan, based on the currently prevailing price of Fortum's share, is expected not to exceed 700,000 shares.
Events after the balance sheet date
On 8 January 2018, E.ON SE announced that it had decided to tender its 170,720,340 Uniper SE shares (corresponding to 46.65% of shares and voting rights) into Fortum's public takeover offer.
On 19 January 2018, Fortum announced that 46.93% of the share capital and the voting rights in Uniper were tendered during the initial acceptance period of Fortum's voluntary public takeover offer for the outstanding shares of Uniper corresponding to 171,736,647 shares. The initial acceptance period ended on 16 January 2018 and the additional acceptance period resumed on 20 January 2018 and will end on 2 February 2018.

Key drivers and risks
Fortum's financial results are exposed to a number of economic, strategic, political, financial and operational risks.
One of the key factors influencing Fortum's business performance is the wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic region. The key drivers behind the wholesale price development in the Nordic region are the supply-demand balance, the prices of fuel and CO2 emission allowances, and the hydrological situation.
The world economy has recently been growing at an increasing pace. The overall economic growth impacts commodity and CO2 emission allowance prices, which has an effect on the Nordic wholesale price of electricity. In Fortum's Russian business, the key drivers are economic growth, the rouble exchange rate, regulation around the heat business, and the further development of the electricity and capacity markets. In all regions, fuel prices and power plant availability also impact profitability. In addition, increased volatility in exchange rates due to financial turbulence could have both translation and transaction effects on Fortum's financials, especially through the Russian rouble and Swedish krona.
In the Nordic countries, the regulatory and fiscal environment for the energy and environmental management sectors has also added risks for companies. The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment develops in a way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare for. In response to these uncertainties, Fortum has analysed and assessed a number of future energy market and regulation scenarios, including the impact of these on different generation forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum's strategy was renewed in 2016 to include broadening the base of revenues and diversification into new businesses, technologies and markets. The environmental management business is based on the framework and opportunities created by environmental regulation. Being able to respond to customer needs created by the tightening regulation is a key success factor.

Outlook
Nordic market
Electricity is expected to continue to gain a higher share of total energy consumption. Electricity demand in the Nordic countries is expected to grow by approximately 0.5% on average, while the growth rate for the next few years will largely be determined by macroeconomic developments in Europe, and especially in the Nordic countries.
The price of oil and coal in 2017, was on a clearly higher level compared to the previous year. The price of CO2 emission allowances (EUA) also increased during the fourth quarter of 2017. The price of electricity for the upcoming 12 months decreased in the Nordics due to a stronger hydrological balance but increased in Germany due to higher fuel prices.
Late in January 2018, the forward quotation for coal (ICE Rotterdam) for the remainder of 2018 was around USD 88 per tonne and the market price for CO2 emission allowances for 2018 around EUR 8.90 per tonne. The Nordic system electricity forward price at Nasdaq Commodities for the remainder of 2018 was around EUR 27 per MWh and for 2019 around EUR 26 per MWh. In Germany, the electricity forward price for the remainder of 2018 and 2019 was around EUR 35 per MWh. Nordic water reservoirs were about 2 TWh below the long-term average, and were 7 TWh higher than a year earlier.
Generation
The Generation segment's achieved Nordic power price typically depends on such factors as hedge ratios, hedge prices, spot prices, availability and utilisation of Fortum's flexible production portfolio, and currency fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects from changes in the power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change in the Generation segment's Nordic power sales achieved price will result in an approximately EUR 45 million change in Fortum's annual comparable operating profit. Achieved power price includes also the results of optimization of Fortum's hydro and nuclear

production as well as operations in the physical and financial commodity markets.
As a result of the nuclear stress tests in the EU, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) has decided on new regulations for Swedish nuclear reactors. For the operators, this means that safety investments should be in place no later than 2020.
The process to review the Swedish nuclear waste fees is done in a three-year cycle. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co (SKB) has updated the new technical plan including earlier shut down of some nuclear plants for the SSM to review. The final decision on the new nuclear waste fees for years 2018­2020 was made by the Swedish Government in December 2017 and was in line with SSM's proposal to the Government. On 25 October 2017, the Swedish Parliament decided on changes in the legal framework impacting calculations of nuclear waste fees and the investment of the nuclear waste fund. In the revised legal framework the assumed operating time for calculating the waste fee is 50 years, as opposed to the previous assumption of 40 years. The fund is now also allowed to invest in other financial instruments in addition to bonds. Based on these changes the annual waste fees for Fortum will increase by approximately EUR 8 million.
On 3 July 2017, Fortum announced the decision by the Administrative Court in Stockholm, Sweden, related to Fortum Sverige AB's hydro production-related real-estate tax assessments for the years 2009­2014. The Court decided in Fortum's favour. The disputed amount for the five years was a total of SEK 508 million (EUR 52 million). Fortum will book the tax income (subject to income tax) only after the legal decision has entered into force. Hydropower plants have been subject to a real-estate tax rate that has resulted in an approximately 12 times higher real-estate tax per kWh compared to any other production, due to different tax rates and different valuation factors. The tax authority has appealed the decision.
In October 2016, the Swedish Energy Agency presented a concrete proposal on how to increase the production of renewable electricity by 18 TWh in 2020­2030 within the electricity certificate

system, as part of the Energy Agreement. In April 2017, the Swedish Government decided that the increase will be carried out in a linear manner.
In September 2016, the Swedish Government presented the budget proposal for the coming years. One of the key elements was the proposal that the taxation of different energy production forms should be more equal, and the tax burden of nuclear and hydro should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The budget states that the nuclear capacity tax will be reduced to 1,500 SEK/MW per month from 1 July 2017 and abolished on 1 January 2018. As a result, the tax for Fortum decreased by EUR 32 million due to the tax decrease and by another EUR 5 million due to the premature closure of Oskarshamn 1 in the middle of the year. In 2017, the capacity tax was EUR 52 million. In 2018, there is no capacity tax. As stated in the Government's budget, the hydropower real-estate tax will decrease from 2.8% to 0.5%; the tax will be reduced in four steps: in January 2017 to 2.2%; in January 2018 to 1.6%; in January 2019 to 1.0%; and in January 2020 to 0.5%. In 2017, the tax for Fortum decreased by EUR 20 million to EUR 95 million. In addition to the decrease in the tax rate, the hydropower realestate tax values, which are linked to electricity prices, will be updated in 2019. The real-estate tax values are updated every six years. With the current low electricity prices, the tax values in 2019 would be clearly lower than today. The process for renewing existing hydro permits will also be reformed.
In 2015, the Swedish OKG AB decided to permanently discontinue electricity production at Oskarshamn's nuclear plant units 1 and 2. Unit 1 was shut down on 17 June 2017, approximately 2 weeks earlier than planned, and unit 2 has been out of operation since June 2013. The closing processes for both units are estimated to take several years.

City Solutions
In City Solutions, stable growth, cash flow and earnings are achieved through investments in new plants and through acquisitions. Fuel cost, availability, flexibility and efficiency as well as gate fees are key drivers in profitability, but also the power supply/demand balance, electricity price and the weather affect profitability.
In May 2016, the Finnish Government decided to increase the tax on heating fuels by EUR 90 million annually from 2017 onwards. The negative impact on Fortum is estimated to be approximately EUR 5 million per year.
The development of acquired business operations of Fortum Oslo Varme is estimated to require integration-related one-time costs and increased investments over the coming years. The realisation of cost synergies are estimated to gradually start materialising from 2019 onwards with targeted annual synergies of EUR 5­10 million expected to be achieved by the end of 2020.
Consumer Solutions
After the acquisition of Hafslund Markets in August, a new business strategy for Consumer Solutions, was approved by the Fortum Board of Directors in December. The strategic objective is to establish Consumer Solutions as the leading consumer business in the Nordics, with a customer-centric multi-brand structure.
Competition in the Nordic electricity retail market is expected to remain challenging, with continued pressure on sales margins and increasing customer churn. To counter the market challenges and create a solid foundation for competitive operations, Consumer Solutions will increase its resources and cost spend on developing new digital services for consumers.
The combined Hafslund Markets and Fortum Markets business, while largely complementary, have identified synergy potential, in terms of both revenue and costs. The short-term priority will be on achieving identified revenue synergies by leveraging established best practices and providing additional products and services to the whole customer base. The realisation of cost synergies will

start materialising once the integration of Hafslund Markets is completed, expected from 2019, with cost synergy realisation gradually increasing over the coming years, and targeted annual synergies of approximately EUR 10 million to be achieved by the end of 2020.
Russia
The Russia segment's new capacity generation built after 2007 under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) has been a key driver for earnings growth in Russia, as it receives considerably higher capacity payments than the old capacity. Fortum will receive guaranteed capacity payments for a period of approximately 10 years from the commissioning of a plant. The received CSA payment will vary depending on the age, location, size and type of the plants, as well as on seasonality and availability. CSA payments can vary somewhat annually because they are linked to Russian Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years maturity. In addition, the regulator will review the earnings from the electricityonly market three and six years after the commissioning of a unit and could revise the CSA payments accordingly. Furthermore, the level of the CSA payments increases starting from the seventh year of the 10-year period.
In June 2017, 1,000 MW of the bids of the 50/50-owned FortumRUSNANO wind investment fund were selected in the Russian wind auction. The bids are for projects to be commissioned during the years 2018­2022 with a price corresponding to approximately EUR 115­135 per MWh. The projects will be covered by CSA for a period of 15 years.
The long-term Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS) for the years 2017­2019 was held at the end of 2015, the CCS for the year 2020 in September 2016, and the CCS for the year 2021 in September 2017. All Fortum plants offered in the auction were selected. Fortum also obtained forced mode status, i.e. it receives payments for the capacity at a higher rate for some of the "old capacity". For the years 2017­2019, forced mode status was obtained for 195 MW; for the year 2020, 175 MW, and for the year 2021, 105 MW.

In December 2017, Fortum acquired three solar power companies from Hevel Group, Russia's largest integrated solar power company. All three power plants are operational and will receive CSA payments for approximately 15 years after commissioning at an average CSA price corresponding to approximately EUR 430/MWh. The plants were commissioned in 2016 and 2017.
Fortum's Ulyanovsk wind farm is listed in the registry of capacity as of January 2018. The 35 MW power plant is Russia's first industrial wind park. It will receive CSA payments for a guaranteed period of 15 years.
The Russian gas price increased by 3.9% in July 2017 and the increase of the annual average gas price for 2017 was 2.0%.
Capital expenditure and divestments
Fortum currently estimates its capital expenditure, including maintenance but excluding acquisitions, to be in the range of EUR 600­700 million in 2018 most of which is related to hydro and CHP capacity as well as new investments in renewables. The maintenance capital expenditure in 2018 is estimated at approximately EUR 300 million, well below the level of depreciation.

Taxation
The effective corporate income tax rate for Fortum in 2018 is estimated to be 19­21%, excluding the impact of the share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures, non-taxable capital gains, and a Swedish income tax case.
On 11 May 2017, the Administrative Court in Stockholm, Sweden, gave its decisions related to Fortum's income tax assessments for the year 2013. The Court's decisions were not in Fortum's favour. Fortum has appealed the decisions. If the decisions remain in force despite the appeal, the negative impact on the net profit would be approximately EUR 28 million (approximately SEK 273 million). Fortum has not made a provision for this, as, based on legal analysis, the EU Commission's view and supporting legal opinions, the cases should be ruled in Fortum's favour. The assessments concern the loans given in 2013 by Fortum's Dutch financing company to Fortum's subsidiaries in Sweden. The interest income for these loans was taxed in the Netherlands. The Swedish tax authority considers just over a half of the interest relating to each loan as deductible, i.e. deriving from business needs. The rest of the interest is seen as non-deductible. The decisions are based on the changes in the Swedish tax regulation in 2013.
On 30 June 2017, the Court of Appeal in Stockholm, Sweden, ruled against Fortum related to Fortum's income tax assessments in Sweden for the years 2009­2012. Due to the decision of the Court of Appeal, Fortum booked a tax cost of 1,175 MSEK (EUR 123 million) in the second-quarter 2017 results. The booking did not have any cash flow effect for Fortum, as the additional taxes and interest have already been paid in 2016. The case concerns Fortum's right to deduct intra-group interest expenses in Sweden in the years 2009­ 2012. Fortum restructured its operations and reallocated loans in 2004­2005 to secure future operations. Fortum does not agree with the Court's decision and had applied for the right to appeal from the Supreme Administrative Court.

Hedging
At the end of 2017, approximately 70% of Generation's estimated Nordic power sales volume was hedged at EUR 28 per MWh for 2018, and approximately 40% at EUR 25 per MWh for 2019.
The reported hedge ratios may vary significantly, depending on Fortum's actions on the electricity derivatives markets. Hedges are mainly financial contracts, most of them electricity derivatives quoted on Nasdaq Commodities.

Sustainability

Business model
Fortum's business activities cover the production and sales of electricity and heat, waste-to-energy and circular economy solutions as well as energy-sector expert services and various consumer solutions. Fortum is the third largest power generator and the largest electricity retailer in the Nordic countries. Globally, the company is one of the leading heat producers. As two thirds of Fortum's power production is hydro and nuclear, it is also among the lowest-emitting generators in Europe.
Fortum's ambition is to increase its CO2-free power generation. The company also has generation capacity based on fossil fuels, located mainly in Russia, and it has worked to increase its efficiency and reduce its specific emissions. Fortum is focusing on increasing its solar and wind power capacity heavily over the coming years.
With core operations in 10 countries, Fortum employs a diverse team of close to 9,000 energy-sector professionals. Fortum has 128 hydro power plants as well as 26 CHP (combined heat and power), condensing and nuclear power plants. Globally, the company supplies heat in 22 cities and towns and has five main waste treatment facilities. Fortum's key markets are the Nordic and Baltic countries, Russia, Poland and India.
Sustainability approach
Fortum strives for balanced management of economic, social and environmental responsibility in the company's operations, emphasising the following focus areas:

Economic responsibility Economic benefits to our stakeholders Long-term value and growth
Sustainable supply chain
Customer satisfaction

Social responsibility Operational and occupational safety Secure energy supply for customers
Personnel wellbeing
Business ethics and compliance

Environmental responsibility
Energy and resource efficiency
Reduction of environmental impacts
Climate-benign energy production and systems
Solutions for sustainable cities

The Group-level sustainability targets are linked to the main sustainability focus areas and emphasise Fortum's role in society. They measure not only environmental and safety targets, but also Fortum's reputation, customer satisfaction, employee wellbeing, and the security of power and heat production. Targets are set annually and are based on continuous operational improvement.
The achievement of the sustainability targets is monitored in monthly, quarterly and annual reporting. Fortum publishes a yearly Sustainability Report with additional information on the company's sustainability performance.

Fortum is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange and is included in the STOXX Global ESG Leaders, OMX GES Sustainability Finland, ECPI® and Euronext Vigeo Eurozone 120 indices. Fortum is also ranked in category A- in the annual CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) rating 2017, and it has received a Prime Status (B-) rating by the German oekom research AG.
Fortum's sustainability reporting covers all functions under Fortum's operational control, including subsidiaries in all countries of operation. Sustainability information relating to Hafslund Markets' and Fortum Oslo Varme's operations is included in Fortum's reporting as of August 2017. The figures for power and heat generation, capacities and investments include also figures from Fortum's share in associated companies and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners on cost basis. The Meri-Pori power plant is included fully in sustainability figures as Fortum has the environmental permit.
Sustainability risks
Fortum's operations are exposed to risks, which if materialised can have adverse effects on the environment and the safety and security of employees, contractors and neighbouring societies. Key sustainability risks are presented in the Risk management part in the Operating and financial review. Climate change and the need for decarbonisation and resource efficiency is changing energy industry in a profound way and these changes also create new business opportunities for Fortum.
Sustainability governance and policies
Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-driven and is based on the company's Values, the Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Sustainability Policy and other Group policies and their specifying instructions. As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy, the highest decision making of these issues falls on the duties of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility on sustainability matters.

Economic responsibility
Fortum's goal is to achieve excellent financial performance in strategically selected core areas through strong competence and responsible ways of operating. Fortum measures financial performance with return on capital employed (target: at least 10%) and capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA around 2.5).
Fortum is a significant economic actor in its operating countries. The most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum's operations come from revenue from customers, procurements of goods and services from suppliers, compensation to lenders, dividends to shareholders, growth and maintenance investments, employee wages and salaries, and taxes paid. In 2017, investments in CO2-free production were EUR 375 (270) million.
Fortum supports social development and wellbeing in its operating countries by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum produces to society include not only corporate income taxes but also several other taxes. In 2017, Fortum's taxes borne were EUR 445 (365) million. Fortum publishes its tax footprint annually.
Targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored annually. In the One Fortum Survey in 2017 company reputation among key stakeholders was 72.3 (72.5) points (on a scale of 1­100) and exceeded the target of 70.7 points. The stakeholder groups selected for the One Fortum Survey differ between the years 2016 and 2017. The reference value for the 2017 target-setting (70.7) is the reputation index (69.7) given by the same stakeholder groups in 2016. The Group target (70­74 points) for customer satisfaction was achieved among all business areas, but not in retail electricity sales. The Recycling and Waste Solutions unit was not part of the One Fortum survey in 2017.
Fortum's total purchasing volume in 2017 was EUR 3.2 (2.5) billion and Fortum had about 16,000 suppliers of goods and services. Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct. Fortum assesses the performance of its business partners with supplier qualification and supplier audits. In 2017, Fortum audited a total of 11 (13) suppliers in China, India, Russia, Slovenia, Estonia and Finland. Most of the non-compliances

identified in the audits in 2017 were related to occupational safety, working hours and remuneration.
Environmental responsibility
Fortum's Group-level environmental targets are related to CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents.
The Group Sustainability Policy together with the Minimum Requirements for EHS Management steer Fortum's environmental management. Investments, acquisitions and divestments are assessed based on the sustainability assessment criteria defined in the Group's Investment Manual. Operational-level activities follow the requirements set forth in the ISO 14001 environmental management standard, and 99.8% (99.9%) of Fortum's power and heat production worldwide has ISO 14001 certification.
Circular economy
Fortum's aim is to promote resource efficiency improvements and the transition towards a more extensive circular economy. Resource efficiency and maximising the added value of waste and biomass are key priorities in the environmental approach, as defined in the Group Sustainability Policy.
In 2017, Fortum received a total of 1.2 million tonnes of nonhazardous waste and 640,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from customers. As much of the waste stream as possible is recycled, recovered or reused. Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse as a material is incinerated in Fortum's waste-to-energy plants in the Nordic countries and Lithuania.
Sustainable energy production
Fortum's energy production is primarily based on carbon dioxidefree hydropower and nuclear power and on energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP). In line with the strategy, Fortum is targeting a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio.
In 2017, Fortum's power generation was 73.2 (73.1) TWh and heat production 28.6 (27.8) TWh. 61% (62%) of the total power generation was CO2-free. In the EU area, 96% (96%) of the power

generation was CO2-free. In 2017, Fortum built and acquired 294 MW of renewable, carbon-free production.
The main fuels that Fortum uses to produce electricity and heat are natural gas, nuclear fuel, coal, waste-derived fuels and biomass fuels. The most significant fuel was natural gas, which accounted for 62% (62%) of the total fuel consumption. The next highest fuel use was uranium 21% (23%). Coal accounted for 10% (10%) of the total fuel use, and waste-derived fuels and biomass fuels 3% (2%) and 3% (3%), respectively. Russia accounted for 99% of the use of natural gas and 51% of the use of coal.

Climate change mitigation
Fortum expects the concern about climate change to increase the demand for low-carbon production and energy-efficient solutions and products. Fortum aims to mitigate climate change by investing in CO2-free energy production and by improving energy and resource efficiency. Fortum is also adapting its operations to climate change in production planning and in the assessment of growth projects and investments.
In 2017, Fortum's direct CO2 emissions were 18.3 (18.6) Mt. 84% (83%) of CO2 emissions originated from Russian power plants. Direct CO2 emissions decreased due to the reduction in condensing power production. Of the total CO2 emissions, 2.3 (2.7) Mt were within the EU's emissions trading scheme (ETS). The estimate for Fortum's free emission allowances is 1.0 (1.0) Mt.

Water withdrawal Fortum uses large volumes of water at various types of power plants and in district heat networks. In most cases, power plants do not consume water ­ the water is discharged back to the same water system from where it was withdrawn. Fortum withdrew a total of 2,100 (2,100) million m3 of water in power and heat production; 94% of this amount was used as cooling water.
Radioactive waste In 2017, 23.4 (19.6) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from Loviisa power plant's reactors in Finland. High-level radioactive spent fuel is stored in an interim storage at the Loviisa power plant site. The final disposal of the high-level radioactive waste is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the first half of the 2020s.
Biodiversity Fortum's main impacts on biodiversity are related to hydropower production. Fuel procurement and flue-gas emissions may also have a negative impact on biodiversity. On the other hand, increasing CO2-free production mitigates the biodiversity loss caused by climate change. Fortum's Biodiversity Manual, revised in 2017, defines the company's approach in biodiversity management.
Environmental incidents Fortum's target is fewer than 21 major EHS incidents annually. Major EHS incidents are monitored, reported and investigated, and corrective actions are implemented. In 2017, there were 20 (22) major EHS (environmental, health and safety) incidents in Fortum's operations. There were 10 (11) environmental incidents, out of which eight were spills. Fortum paid fines totalling RUB 8,000 (EUR 121) for the permit violation involving exceeding the wastewater emission limit in Russia. The major EHS incidents did not have significant environmental impacts.

Social responsibility
Fortum's social responsibility targets are related to the secure supply of electricity and heat for customers, operational and occupational safety as well as employee wellbeing.
Employees
The Group Human Resources Policy is based on the company's Values, Leadership Principles and Code of Conduct. The HR Policy guides the daily work in the company, and the implementation of the policy is followed up regularly through the employee engagement survey, the annual performance and development discussions, as well as other feedback practices.
Fortum's operations are mainly based in the Nordic countries, Russia, Poland and the Baltic Rim area. The total number of employees at the end of 2017 was 8,785 (8,108). The number of employees increased mainly due to the acquisition of Hafslund.

Occupational safety For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation of the company's business and an absolute prerequisite for efficient and interruptionfree production. Fortum strives to be a safe workplace for the employees and for the contractors and service providers who work for the company. The Group Sustainability Policy, the Minimum Requirements for EHS Management and more detailed Grouplevel EHS manuals steer the work. A certified OHSAS 18001 safety management system covers 98.4% (99.9%) of Fortum's power and heat production worldwide.
2017 was a challenging year in terms of occupational safety. Only the total recordable incident frequency (TRIF) for own employees and the number of severe accidents met the set target level.

The TRIF for Fortum employees was 1.8 (1.9) per one million working hours, which is better than the target ( 2.5). The lostworkday injury frequency (LWIF) for own personnel was 1.2 (1.0), which did not meet the set target level (1.0).
The lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) for contractors continues to be Fortum's main challenge. The LWIF for contractors per million working hours was 4.2 (3.0), and Fortum did not achieve the target of 3.5. The same challenge applies to the combined LWIF (own employees and contractors): the result was 2.4 (1.8), exceeding the target of 1.9.
In 2018, Fortum will implement new tools to assess contractor safety performance as part of the supplier qualification process and will also evaluate their safety practices in a more systematic manner during work. Fortum will also introduce external safety training for both the management level and key individuals leading safety work as well as the most challenging business areas.
In 2017, as in 2016, there were no accidents leading to a fatality in the company's operations.
Open leadership, personnel development and wellbeing In late 2017, Fortum launched the company's revised Values and new Leadership Principles. The Open Leadership framework supports cooperation across units and aims to create an environment that fosters innovation, flexibility and agility.
ForCare, Fortum's programme for overall wellbeing at work, aims to promote health, safety, employee work capacity and work community functionality. As part of ForCare, the Energise Your Day wellbeing programme was launched in several new operating countries in 2017. The percentage of sickness-related absences excluding DUON and Hafslund was 2.2 (2.3), which is better than the target level of 2.3. The percentage of sickness-related absences for Hafslund was 3.0.
Respect for human rights
Fortum's goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and to apply these principles in own operations as well as in country and partner risk assessments and supplier audits.

A sustainability assessment, including a human rights evaluation, is carried out for investment projects ­ especially in new operating areas ­ and also for new countries where Fortum plans to expand the sales of products and services. In 2017, 15 (28) of these assessments were made.
In 2017, there were no grievances related to human rights filed through Fortum's formal grievance channels, nor were there any grievances carried over from the previous year.
Society
An uninterrupted and reliable energy supply is critical for society to function. With planned preventive maintenance and condition monitoring, Fortum ensures that the power plants operate reliably to produce the electricity and heat customers need. The energy availability of the company's CHP plants in 2017 was, on average, 96.1%; the target was above 95%.
Fortum's operations impact the local communities where the power plants are located, and the company engages in many kinds of collaboration with local stakeholders. Fortum's Policy for Sponsoring and Donations was revised in late 2017. According to the policy Fortum's sponsoring will focus on wellbeing of children and youth, renewable energy projects, R&D and innovations supporting Fortum's strategy, recycling, recovery and reutilization. The company also does significant collaboration with different research and development projects, particularly with Nordic universities. In 2017, Fortum's support for activities promoting the common good totalled about EUR 4.9 (2.9) million. The grants awarded by Fortum Foundation were about EUR 696,000 (675,000). Fortum Foundation is not part of Fortum Group.

Risk management

Risk management framework and objectives
Fortum's Risk Management framework is comprised of the Group Risk Policy and supporting documents. The Group Risk Policy includes an overview of Fortum's risk management systems consisting of the general principles of risk management and the main features of the risk management process. The objective of the risk management systems are to; · support the development of the Group strategy, · support strategy execution, · support the achievement of agreed targets within acceptable
risk levels so that the Group's ability to meet financial commitments is not compromised, · ensure the understanding of material risks and uncertainties affecting Fortum, and · support the prevention of accidents that can have a severe effect on the health and safety of employees or third parties, and from incidents that can have a material impact on Fortum's assets, reputation or the environment.
Risk management organisation
The main principle is that risks are managed at source meaning that each Division, Development Unit and Corporate Function Head is responsible for managing risks that arise within their business operations. However, in order to take advantage of synergies, certain risks are managed centrally. For example, Group Treasury is responsible for managing financial risks and cyber and information security risks are managed by Corporate Security. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is responsible for monitoring the efficiency of the company's risk management systems and for annually reviewing the Group Risk Policy and the material risks and uncertainties. Corporate Risk Management, a function headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reporting to the CFO, provides instructions and tools which support the Group in running an efficient risk management process. Corporate Risk Management is responsible for assessing and reporting maturity of

Fortum's risk management process is designed to support the achievement of agreed targets by ensuring that risk management activities are consistent with the general principles of risk

management and that risks are monitored and followed-up in a prudent manner. The main features of risk management process consist of event identification, risk assessment, risk response and risk control. Identification is carried out according to a structured process and risks are assessed in terms of impact and likelihood according to a Group-common methodology. Impact is assessed not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of health and safety, the environment and reputation. Risk owners, responsible for implementing actions to respond to the risk, are defined by the business and operational management. Risk responses can be to avoid, mitigate, transfer or absorb the risk. Risk control processes, which include monitoring and reporting of risks, are designed to support compliance with approved instructions, manuals and guidelines and to ensure that risk exposures remain within approved limits and mandates.
Fortum's Board of Directors annually approves the Group Risk Policy and the CEO annually approves Group Risk Instruction

covering commodity market risks, counterparty credit risks, and operational risks. Fortum also has other Group policies and instructions covering e.g. compliance, sustainability, treasury and cyber and information security risks which are aligned with the Group Risk Policy. Risk mandates or limits are defined for commodity market risks, counterparty credit risks and financial risks.
Risk factors
Strategic risks
The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment develops in way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare for. Future energy market and regulation scenarios, including the impact of these to Fortum's business, are continuously assessed and analysed. It is part of Fortum's strategy

to, in the long-term, broaden the base of revenues and diversify into new businesses, technologies and markets.
Risks which could hinder Fortum in executing this strategy are continuously assessed, monitored and reported as part of the strategy work. These risks include an inability to identify and carry out successful investments and acquisitions with the related project and integration risks, inability to manage and respond to changes in energy policy and the regulatory environment, and inability to manage and respond to changes in technology.
Investment and acquisition risks Fortum's strategy includes growth of operations in new businesses, technologies and geographies, and any future investment or acquisition, including partnerships, entails risk such as: · increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources, · the need to understand the value drivers and their uncertainties
in investments or potential acquisition targets, · the need to understand and manage new markets with different
cultural and compliance requirements, · the need to understand and manage risks related to
sustainability and safety issues.
These risks are managed as part of the investment process which includes requirements for risk identification and assessment and action plans before investment decisions are made, and also sets requirements to follow-up risks in projects and acquisitions.
Energy policy and regulation risks The energy business is heavily influenced by national and EUlevel energy policies and regulations, and Fortum's strategy has been developed based on scenarios of the future development of the regulatory environment in both existing and potential new businesses and market areas. The overall complexity and possible regulatory changes in Fortum's various operating countries pose a risk if we are not able to anticipate, identify and manage those changes efficiently.

Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in the development of laws and regulations in order to manage these risks and proactively contribute to the development of the energy policy and regulatory framework.
Nordic/EU Fortum's strategy in the power sector is based on a market-driven development, which would mean more interconnections and competition supported by increasing policy harmonization. Even if the Nordic power market has a long tradition of harmonization, national policies vary considerably when it comes to e.g. taxation, permitting, subsidies and market model meaning that we have to manage risks related to both EU regulation and national regulation. Potential risks related to the future energy and climate policy framework include; · The development towards integrated, flexible and dynamic
power market hampered by increasing policy costs and uncoordinated national mechanisms, · Overlapping national carbon policies diluting the EU ETS and carbon price despite the ETS reform, · Increasing cost burden for hydro power in Finland, driven by fish obligations, grid costs and real estate taxation and unbalanced implementation of the EU Water Framework directive in Sweden, potentially leading to lower production volumes, · Sustainability requirements for forest biomass leading to reduced availability and increasing costs, · Implementation of national waste incineration taxes or other measures due to opposition to incineration hampers the competitiveness of waste-to-energy, · Substantial retroactive changes and/or discontinuation of prevailing CHP support schemes in Baltic countries and Poland or deteriorating competitiveness of CHP due to fuel tax increases, · Emergence of windfall tax discussions following possible positive electricity and carbon price development.

The inter-linkage of these issues as well as national measures such as taxation create uncertainty and changes in policies in one area could undermine the effects of policy changes in other areas.
Russia Russia is exposed to political, economic and social uncertainties and risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation, economic and social upheaval and other similar factors. The current economic sanctions may be enlarged and/or extended having direct and indirect impacts on the business environment. The main policy-related risks in Russia are linked to the development of the whole energy sector, part of which, like the wholesale power market, is liberalised while other parts, like gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. The wholesale power market deregulation in Russia has been implemented to a large extent according to original plans. However, regulated sectors are inherently always exposed to a risk of regulatory changes which could affect Fortum's operations.
Technology risks Fortum's strategy includes developing or acquiring new technologies, as well as digitalizing the business. Fortum's R&D and innovation activities focus on the development of the energy system towards a future solar economy. Fortum is, for example, developing circular economy, bio-economy and other renewable energy concepts as well as innovative solutions for its customers. New technologies expose Fortum to risks related to intellectual property rights, data privacy and viability of technologies. Technology risks are managed primarily through developing a diversified portfolio of projects consisting of different technologies.
Sustainability risks
Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development are integral parts of Fortum's strategy. Fortum gives balanced consideration to economic, environmental and social responsibility. Changes to laws, regulations and the business environment can pose a risk if not identified and managed effectively and the same applies to changes in views of our main

stakeholders. In order to identify and manage these risks, Fortum endorses a number of international voluntary charters, standards and guidelines in the area of sustainability, conducts stakeholder surveys annually and has defined internal policies and instructions on how to conduct business. Corporate Functions, Divisions and Development units identify and assess sustainability risks related to their operations and define mitigation measures annually. Corporate Sustainability executes oversight as part of the Group's risk management process.
Environmental, health and safety and social risks Operating power and heat generation plants, circular economy services and waste management involves use, storage and transportation of fuels and materials that can have adverse effects on the environment and expose personnel, contractors and third parties to safety risks. Assessment of environmental risks and preparedness to operate in exceptional and emergency situations follows legislative requirements as well as the requirements in the environmental management standard (ISO 14001). The same approach, based on the requirements in the operational health and safety standard (OHSAS 18001), applies to risks related to occupational health and safety and actions in emergency situations.
Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social risks related to Fortum's supply chain are evaluated through supplier qualification, internal and external audits and risk assessments including partner and country risk assessment. Corrective and preventive actions are implemented when necessary. EHS related risks together with social risks arising in investments are evaluated in accordance with Fortum's Investment manual. Environmental risks and liabilities in relation to past actions have been assessed and provisions have been made for future remedial costs.
Fortum's operations are exposed to physical risks caused by climate change, including changes in weather patterns that could alter energy demand and, for instance, hydropower production volumes. Higher precipitation and temperatures may affect hydropower production, dam safety, and also bioenergy supply

and availability. Fortum adapts its operations to the changing climate and takes it into consideration, for example, in production and maintenance planning and in evaluating growth and investment projects.
Tax risk Fortum operates in a number of countries and is therefore exposed to changes in taxation and how tax authorities interpret tax laws. Changes in the international fiscal environment have created a tax environment that is leading to new or increased taxes and new interpretations of existing tax laws which has decreased the predictability and visibility around how our operations are taxed.
Fortum's tax policy aims to identify simple and cost-efficient solutions to manage taxes in a sustainable manner. Fortum's tax policy is based on a principle that tax is a consequence of business and that compliance with tax rules and legislation and transparency result in a correct tax contribution. This policy leaves no room for artificial or other aggressive solutions. Fortum is continuously following the development of tax related issues and their impact on the Group and maintains an active dialogue with tax authorities in unclear cases. Tax-related issues are communicated openly both internally and externally and Fortum's tax footprint is published annually.
Business ethics and compliance risks Fortum's operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations set forth by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory bodies in all markets in which Fortum operates. Fortum's ability to operate in certain countries may be affected by future changes to local laws and regulations.
Fortum Code of Conduct enhances the understanding of the importance of business ethics for all Fortum employees, contractors and partners. Prevention of corruption is one of the Code of Conduct's focus areas. Fortum has procedures for anti-corruption including prevention, oversight, reporting and enforcement based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. Fortum's supplier code of conduct sets

sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and services. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and is divided into four sections: business principles including anti-corruption, human rights, labour standards and environment.
Fortum systematically identifies, assesses, mitigates and reports compliance risks including risks related to sustainability and business ethics. Internal controls are implemented to prevent the possibilities of unauthorised activities or non-compliance with Group policies and instructions.
Financial & commodity market risks
Commodity market and fuel risks Fortum's business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and availability of commodities used in the production and sales of energy products. The main exposure is toward electricity prices and volumes, prices of emissions and prices and availability of fuels. Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity market risks in accordance with annually approved Hedging Guidelines, Strategies and Mandates. For further information on hedge ratios, exposures, sensitivities and outstanding derivatives contracts, see Note 3 Financial risk management.
Electricity price and volume risks In competitive markets, such as in the Nordic region, the wholesale price of electricity is determined as the balance between supply and demand. The short-term factors affecting electricity prices and volumes on the Nordic market include hydrological conditions, temperature, CO2 allowance prices, fuel prices, economic development and the import/export situation.
Electricity price risks are hedged by entering into electricity derivatives contracts, primarily on the Nasdaq Commodities power exchange. Hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as electricity and other commodity market prices, the hydrological balance and other relevant parameters change. Hedging of the Generation segment's power sales is performed in EUR on a Nordic level covering both Finland and Sweden, and the currency

component of these hedges in the Swedish entity is currently not hedged. In Russia, electricity prices and capacity sales are the main sources of market risk. The electricity price is highly correlated with the gas price and exposure is mitigated through the use of fixed-price bilateral agreements. In India, the electricity price received from solar production are fixed through long term powerpurchasing agreements.
Emission and environmental value risks The European Union has established an emissions trading scheme to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions. In addition to the emissions trading scheme, there are other trading schemes in environmental values in place in Sweden, Norway and Poland. Part of Fortum's power and heat generation is subject to requirements of these schemes. There is currently no trading scheme in Russia for emissions or other environmental values.
The main factor influencing the prices of CO2 allowances and other environmental values is the supply and demand balance. Fortum hedges its exposure to these prices and volumes through the use of CO2 futures and environmental certificates.
Fuel price and volume risks Power and heat generation requires use of fuels that are purchased on global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are natural gas, uranium, coal, various biomass-based fuels and waste. The main risk factor for fuels that are traded on global markets such as coal and natural gas, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely affected by demand and supply imbalances that can be caused by, for example, increased demand growth in developing countries, natural disasters or supply constraints in countries experiencing political or social unrest. For fuels traded on local markets, such as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms of availability of the raw material of appropriate quality is more significant as there may be a limited number of suppliers. Due to the sanctions and economic development in Russia, the risks related to imported fuels from Russia have increased.
In the Nordic market, exposure to fuel prices is limited due to Fortum's flexible generation capacity which allows for switching

between different fuels according to prevailing market conditions. In some cases, the fuel price risk can be transferred to the customer. The remaining exposure to fuel price risk is mitigated through fixed-price physical delivery contracts or derivative contracts. The main fuel source for heat and power generation in Russia is natural gas. Natural gas prices are partially regulated, so the price risk exposure is limited.
Liquidity and refinancing risks Fortum's business is capital intensive and there is a regular need to raise financing. Fortum maintains a diversified financing structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt instruments and geographical markets. Liquidity and refinancing risks are managed through a combination of cash positions and committed credit facility agreements with its core banks. The credit risk of cash positions has been mitigated by diversifying the deposits to highcredit quality financial institutions and issuers of corporate debt. In relation to the offer for Uniper shares, Fortum has commitments from 10 relationship banks to provide credit facilities at the request of Fortum in an aggregate amount of up to EUR 12,000 million.
Currency and interest rate risks Fortum's debt portfolio consists of interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives on a fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing maturity profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt portfolio through use of different types of financing contracts and interest rate derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps.
Fortum's currency exposures are divided into transaction exposures (foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash flows and balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates will have an impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation exposure (foreign exchange exposure that arises when profits and balance sheets in foreign entities are consolidated at the Group level). The main principle is that material transaction exposures should be hedged while translation exposures are not hedged, or are hedged selectively. An exception is the Generation segment's hedging of power sales in Sweden where the currency component is currently not hedged. The main translation exposures toward the

Investor information

EUR/RUB, EUR/SEK and EUR/NOK are monitored continuously. Changes in these currency rates affect Fortum's profit level and equity when translating results and net assets to euros.
Counterparty risks Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a contractual arrangement with an external counterparty including customers, suppliers, partners, banks, clearing houses and trading counterparties.
Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative instruments are often volatile. The majority of commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX commodities. The trend toward more use of futures contracts instead of forward contracts is decreasing the credit exposure toward clearing houses. Derivatives contracts are also entered into directly with external counterparties and such contracts are limited to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the financial or commodity markets.
Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity, Fortum has counterparty credit exposure to a number of banks and financial institutions. The majority of the exposure is toward Fortum's key relationship banks, which are highly creditworthy institutions, but also includes exposure to the Russian financial sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions as well as to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and contracting parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated to the most creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks.
Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across a wide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is higher than in the Nordic market. In order to manage counterparty credit risk, Fortum has routines and processes to identify, assess and control exposure. Credit checks are performed before entering into commercial obligations and exposure limits are set for larger individual counterparties. Creditworthiness is monitored through the use of internal and external sources so that mitigating actions

can be taken when needed. Mitigating actions include demanding collateral, such as guarantees, managing payment terms and contract length, and the use of netting agreements.
Operational risks
Operational risks are defined as the negative effects resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or equipment, or from external events. Process-related risks are assessed and controls for the most relevant risks are defined and implemented as part of the internal controls framework. Equipment and system risks are primarily managed through monitoring and maintenance planning. In addition, all Fortum's industrial assets are covered by a Group Master Policy covering property damage and business interruption risks which mitigates the impact of internal and external events.
Operational risks at production facilities
Combined heat and power (CHP) and recycling and waste CHP production and the recycling and waste business involve the use, storage and transportation of fuels and waste (including hazardous waste). Leakage and contamination of the surrounding environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party liabilities. An explosion or fire at a facility could cause damages to the plant or third-parties and lead to possible business interruption. These risks are mitigated by condition monitoring, preventive maintenance and other operational improvements as well as competence development of personnel operating the plants. Requirements for waste are clearly specified and samples are tested for selected incoming waste deliveries. Risks in large CHP projects are mitigated through contract structures and insurance coverage.
Hydro power Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can lead to physical damages, business interruptions, and third- party liabilities. A long-term program is in place for improving the surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme flood situations. In Sweden, thirdparty liabilities from dam failures are strictly the plant owner's

responsibility. Together with other hydro power producers, Fortum has a shared dam liability insurance program in place that covers Swedish dam failure liabilities up to SEK 10,000 million.
Nuclear power Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority interests in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power companies. At the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and improvement of nuclear safety is a continuous process performed under the supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland (STUK).
Third-party liability relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the plant operator's responsibility and must be covered by insurance. As the operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a statutory liability insurance policy of 600M SDR (Special Drawing Right) and the same type of insurance policies are in place for the operators where Fortum has a minority interest.
Cyber and information security risks Fortum's business operations are dependent on well-functioning IT and information management systems and processes. Due to the nature of the business, large amounts of data are processed, often in real-time, and used for decision-making and in internal and external communication and reporting. Securing information and availability of the systems are essential for Fortum. Cyber security risks, including risks related to information, industrial control systems (ICS), digitalization and privacy, are managed centrally by Corporate Security. Group instructions and procedures set requirements for managing and mitigating cyber security risks.
General Data Protection Regulation will become applicable on 25th of May 2018. The regulation contains a number of requirements related to processing personal data. Therefore, Fortum has established a Group-wide program to ensure the fulfilment of the requirements.
IT functions in the business, support functions and outsourcing partners are responsible for identifying and mitigating operational IT security related risks as well as managing IT security incidents. IT functions are also responsible for IT service continuity.

Components of Consolidated statement of comprehensive income (OCI) are items of income and expense that are recognized in equity and not recognized in the consolidated income statement. They include unrealized items, such as fair value gains and losses on financial instruments hedging future cash flows. These items will be realized in the Consolidated income statement when the underlying hedged items is recognized. OCI also includes gains and losses on fair valuation on available for sale financial assets, actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans, items on comprehensive income in associated companies and translation differences.
Fair valuation of cash flow hedges mainly relates to electricity prices in future cash flows. When electricity price is higher (lower) than the hedging price, the impact on equity is negative (positive).
Translation differences from translation of foreign entities, mainly RUB and SEK.

Translation differences
Translation of financial information from subsidiaries in foreign currency is done using average rate for the income statement and end rate for the balance sheet. The exchange rate differences occurring from translation to EUR are booked to equity. Translation differences impacted equity attributable to owners of the parent company with EUR -369 million during 2017 (2016: 335). Translation differences are mainly related to RUB and SEK. Part of this translation exposure has been hedged and the foreign currency hedge result, amounting to EUR 28 million (2016: 5), is included in the other OCI items.
For information regarding exchange rates used, see Note 1 Accounting policies. For information about translation exposure see Note 3.6 Interest rate risk and currency risk.

Cash flow hedges
The impact on equity attributable to owners of the parent from fair valuation of cash flow hedges, EUR 75 million (2016: -188), mainly relates to cash flow hedges hedging electricity price for future transactions. When electricity price is lower/higher than the hedging price, the impact on equity is positive/negative.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests have increased with EUR 155 million during 2017 mainly due to the acquisition of Fortum Oslo Varme AS which is consolidated as a subsidiary with 50% non-controlling interest. See also Note 38 Acquisitions and disposals.

Realised foreign exchange gains and losses relate mainly to financing of Fortums Russian and Swedish subsidiaries and the fact that the Groups main external financing currency is EUR. The foreign exchange gains and losses arise from rollover of foreign exchange contracts hedging these internal loans as major part of the forwards are entered into with short maturities i.e. less than twelve months.
Capital expenditures in cash flow do not include not yet paid investments. Capitalised borrowing costs are presented in interest paid.

1.6.2 Adoption of new IFRS standards from 1 Jan 2018 or later Fortum will apply the following new or amended standards and interpretations starting from 1 January 2018 or later:

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Nature of change New standard. The standard focuses on revenue recognition models and will replace IAS 11 and IAS 18.

Date of adoption 1 January 2018

Impact

Fortum has completed the analysis of the significant business areas and has not identified any material changes from IFRS 15 implementation. Analysis includes the following main steps:

· Identification and assessment of the main revenue streams, · Determining key areas of potential differences between old and new revenue
recognition principles and

· Reviewing a sample of contracts.

The conclusions requiring the greatest degree of management judgement are as follows:
· Electricity sales to wholesale market: Physical electricity trades to Nord Pool or other wholesale markets are made either during the same day or day before the delivery and the duration of the contract is thus very short. The transaction price is the spot price and there are no variable elements. Electricity sales continue to be recognized upon delivery and hence there are no changes identified compared to the current recognition principles.

· District heating: In many areas the district heating service covers both the distribution and sale of heat. Even if heat is produced by a third party, Fortum is usually responsible for delivering the whole service and is acting as a principal for the heat sales as well. Fortum has concluded that the distribution and sale of heat are not separate performance obligations and are both covered by the promise to stand-ready to supply heat to the customer. Also the fees charged for connecting the end customer to the district heat network are part of the same performance obligation. The fees charged from the customer generally comprise a fixed monthly charge and a variable component that is determined based on the volume of heat supplied. In accordance to the IFRS 15 principles, the fixed charge and the variable heat volume charge are allocated and recognised in line with the fees chargeable from the customer. In Russia, Baltics and Poland there are also areas, where Fortum operates only the heat production facilities while some third party is responsible for the distribution of heat. In these areas the performance obligation is to supply heat. There are no changes identified compared to the current revenue recognition principles.

42

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

· Waste management services: Majority of the revenues from waste management services arises from the fees charged for receiving the waste from customers (i.e. gate

8

fees). The fee is usually determined based on the volume of waste received and there

9

are no variable elements in the pricing. Fortum is required to treat the waste and this

10

performance obligation is satisfied when the treatment is performed. Transportation

of the waste form another performance obligation, which is recognized once the

11

service is performed. There are no changes identified to the current practices.

12

· Electricity sales to retail customers: Fortum's contracts with the consumer and business

13

customers cover the electricity sales, while the distribution service is delivered by the

14

transmission company operating the local network. There is only one performance

15

obligation, which is to stand-ready to supply electricity to the customer. The

transaction price generally includes both a fixed monthly fee and a variable fee that

16

depends on the volume of electricity supplied. As with the district heating business,

17

the fixed and variable components are to be recognized as revenue based on the fees chargeable from the customer.

18

19

IFRS 15 will change the treatment of sales commission costs for obtaining new

20

customers, which are currently mostly expensed. In the future the sales commissions

shall be capitalized as intangible assets and depreciated over the expected contract

21

term. Implementation of IFRS 15 will thus impact the timing and classification of

22

expenses, but the impact to Fortum Comparable operating profit is not expected to be material.

23

24

Further details on the impact will be disclosed in the Q1/2018 interim report. Fortum

25

will use the transition relief for not to restate the comparative information at the date of

initial application.

5

Impact

Fortum is finalising the implementation and testing phase including model validations, process and system updates and preparation of the new disclosures including possible opening balance sheet adjustments. The interpretations taken are: · Classification and measurement of financial assets - Most financial assets will be
classified under "Held-to-Collect" business model and accounted for as amortised cost when they meet the SPPI criteria. TVO shareholder loan meets the criteria for equity investment and it will be reclassified. · Fortums commodity derivative hedging will benefit from the possibility to apply hedge accounting for one or several risk components separately or in aggregation. In the Nordic area Fortum considers system and electricity price area differential (EPAD) products perfect hedges for corresponding electricity price risk components. This will reduce the volatility in Fortums profit and loss currently recognized as items affecting comparability. Vast majority of the non-hedge accounted electricity derivatives in December will qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. · Implementation of expected credit loss ("ECL") model is completed. Fortum has implemented counterparty specific ECL models to be used on individual contract basis for deposits, shareholder loans and trade receivables with large customers whereas portfolio models will be used for trade receivables with consumers and small business customers. Fortum has prepared analysis based on historical data, which indicates no material impacts. Actual impacts will fluctuate due to seasonality of the business.
Further details on the impact will be disclosed in the Q1/2018 interim report. Fortum will use the transition relief for not to restate the comparative information at the date of initial application.

Impact

Currently under IAS 17, lessees recognize leases either as operating leases or finance

6

leases. The new standard no longer distinguishes between operating and finance leases from a lessees point of view, and most right-of-use assets are recognized in

7

the balance sheet. For lessors, there are no significant changes. In brief, IFRS 16

8

requirements contain the following:

9

· A lessee shall recognize all leases, except for short-term and low value leases, in the

10

balance sheet. · For lessees, both the value of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding liability

11

shall be recognized in the balance sheet.

12

13

IFRS 16 is effective for financial periods starting on 1 January 2019 or later. The

14

European Union endorsed the use of the standard on 31 October 2017.

15

Currently, Fortum has mainly operating leases with varying lease terms and

16

prolongation rights. The majority of the operating leases are for the use of land and

17

office buildings. Total future lease obligations amounted to EUR 160 million at the end of the reporting period (Dec 31 2016: 74). Hence, the impacts of the standard to the

18

consolidated financial statements are not expected to be material.

19

20

The IFRS 16 analysis is on-going and will be completed during 2018. Analysis include: · Reviewing current lease contracts reported as operating lease commitments

21

· Going through supplier lists and identifying potential lease arrangements

22

· Determining incremental borrowing rates

23

· Calculation of accounting impacts.

24

No major issues have been identified so far. Fortum plans to apply the modified

25

retrospective method, which means the comparative figures will not be restated.

clauses, are in place with the majority of the counterparties. Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity, Fortum has counterparty credit exposure
toward a number of banks and financial institutions. This includes exposure to the Russian financial sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions as well as to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and contracting parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated to the most creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks. Limits with banks and financial institutions are monitored so that exposures can be adjusted as ratings or the financial situation changes, and Fortum is following the development of economic sanctions against Russia as part of the monitoring process.
Credit risk relating to customers is spread across a wide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is higher than in the Nordic market.

as tax exempt. The purpose of this is to tax the operative income of the company and avoid taxing the

assets are depreciated more rapidly for tax than for accounting purposes resulting in lower current tax payments at the start of an asset,s lifetime and higher tax payments at the end of its lifetime. This difference results in a deferred tax liability.
12.4 Total taxes
Taxes borne indicate different taxes that Fortum pays for the period. In 2017 Fortum's taxes borne were EUR 445 million (2016: 365). Taxes borne include corporate income taxes (excluding deferred taxes), production taxes, employment taxes, taxes on property and cost of indirect taxes. Production taxes include also taxes, on production and on property, paid through purchased electricity from associated companies.

12

options a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair

13

value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Fortum share) based on the monetary

14

value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding stock options.

15

The number of shares calculated as above is deducted from the number of shares that would have

16

been issued assuming the exercise of the stock options. The incremental shares obtained through the

17

assumed exercise of the options and warrants are added to the weighted average number of shares

19

outstanding.

20

Options and warrants have a dilutive effect only when the average market price of ordinary shares

21

during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants. Previously reported earnings per

share are not retroactively adjusted to reflect changes in price of ordinary shares.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

9

The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through

10

profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on

11

the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the classification of its

12

financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.

13

14

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS

15

A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short

16

term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets

17

18

in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be

19

realised within 12 months of the closing date.

20

21 LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
22

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are

23

not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to

24

a debtor. They are included in non-current assets, except for maturities under 12 months after the closing

25

date. These are classified as current assets.

26

27

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS

28

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or

29

not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless there is an

30

intention to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the closing date.

31

Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade-date ­ the date on which the Group

32

commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction

33

costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Investments are derecognised

34

when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and

35

the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

36

Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are

37

subsequently carried at fair value. Loans are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

38

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the `financial assets at fair value through

39

profit or loss' category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Gains and

issuer's specific circumstances. The Group assesses at each closing date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or
a group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss ­ measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss ­ is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities. The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements. Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39. All other net-settled commodity contracts are measured at fair value with gains and losses taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); 2) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or 3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Group

deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the

9

asset or liability. When a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain

10

or loss existing in equity is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately

11

also recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the

12

cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised in the income statement.

13

14

FAIR VALUE HEDGE

15

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded

16

in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that

17

18

are attributable to the hedged risk.

19

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount

20

of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss for the

21

period to maturity.

22

23

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

24

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain

25

or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity;

26

the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

27

Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation

28

is disposed of.

maturity. Only for those electricity derivatives, which have cash flows in different years, the fair values are

35

split between non-current and current assets or liabilities.

Investments in unlisted shares classified as Available-for-sale financial assets, for which the fair value

10

FAIR VALUES UNDER LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY

11

The fair value of some commodity derivatives traded in active markets (such as publicly traded electricity

OTHER MEASUREMENTS

12

options, coal, gas and oil futures) are market quotes at the closing date.

The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to

13

approximate their fair values.

14

FAIR VALUES UNDER LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY

15

The fair value of financial instruments including electricity derivatives traded in active markets (such as

16

publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market

17

18 prices at the closing date. Known calculation techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are

19

used to determine fair value of interest rate and currency financial instruments. The fair value of interest20

rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward

21

foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the closing date. Fair

22

values of options are determined by using option valuation models. The fair value of financial liabilities

23

is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that

24

is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. In fair valuation, credit spread has not been

25

adjusted, as quoted market prices of the instruments used are believed to be consistent with the objective

26

of a fair value measurement.

27

The Group bases the calculation on existing market conditions at each closing date. Financial

28

instruments used in Fortum are standardised products that are either cleared via exchanges or widely

29

traded in the market. Commodity derivatives are generally cleared through exchanges such as for

30

example Nasdaq Commodities Europe and financial derivatives done with creditworthy financial

31

institutions with investment grade ratings.

16 Intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at the historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are amortised on a straight-line method over their expected useful lives.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred when bringing the software into use. Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to five years).
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES Trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, as applicable. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and licences over their estimated useful lives (15­20 years).
CONTRACTUAL CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value on acquisition date. The contractual customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at costs less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected duration of the customer relationship.
GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and tested yearly for impairment. Goodwill on acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in investments in associates and joint ventures and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

EMISSION ALLOWANCES

6

The Group accounts for emission allowances based on currently valid IFRS standards where purchased

7

emission allowances are accounted for as intangible assets at cost, whereas emission allowances

8

received free of charge are accounted for at nominal value. For CO2 emissions from power and heat

9

production, a provision is recognized. CO2 emission costs is settled by returning emission allowances. To

10

the extent that the Group already holds allowances to cover emission costs, the provision is measured at

11

the carrying amount of those allowances. Any shortfall of allowances held over the obligation is valued

12

at the current market value of allowances. The emission cost is recognised in the income statement within

13

materials and services. The sales gains and losses of emission allowances not used for covering the

14

obligation from CO2 emissions, are reported in other income.

15

16

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

17

18

The individual assets' carrying values are reviewed continuously to determine whether there is any

19

indication of impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable

20

amount if it is greater than the estimated recoverable amount.

21

In addition, impairment needs are assessed and documented once a year in connection with the

22

long-term forecasting process. Indications for impairment are analysed separately by each division

23

as they are different for each business and include risks such as changes in electricity and fuel prices,

24

regulatory/political changes relating to energy taxes and price regulations etc. Impairment testing needs

25

to be performed if any of the impairment indications exists. Assets that have an indefinite useful life and

26

goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.

27

Value in use is determined by discounting the future cash flows expected to be derived from an

28

asset. If it's not possible to estimate the cash flows generated by an individual asset, the impairment

29

testing is performed on a cash-generating unit level. Fortum defines the cash-generating unit as the

30

smallest business area where the tested assets generate cash flows that are independent of the cash

31

flows generated by other assets in other business areas. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating

32

unit or lowest level of groups of cash-generating units that benefit from the synergies of the acquired

33

goodwill. Cash flow projections are based on the most recent long-term forecast that has been approved

34

by management and the Board of Directors. Cash flows arising from future investments such as new

35

plants are excluded unless projects have been started. The cash outflow needed to complete the started

36

projects is included.

37

Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment charge are reviewed for

38

possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

increase the amount of goodwill by EUR 285 million. The acquisitions enable scale benefits and

25

combination of competences that support Fortum's strategic growth and cash flow ambitions in the

26

Nordic retail electricity and district heating markets and will also enhance the development of new and

27

greener technologies and services. Hafslund Markets is integrated in Consumer Solutions segment and

28

Fortum Oslo Varme in City Solutions segment. The purchase price allocation is still preliminary and also

29

the allocation of goodwill to separate cash generating units is still on-going.

30

During 2017 Fortum finalised the purchase price allocation for the Waste Solutions Oy Group

31

(formerly Ekokem Corporation) acquired in 2016. The acquisition supports Fortum's vision and strategy

32

of creating solutions for sustainable cities in the whole City Solutions division and as a result, the

33

goodwill from this acquisition is allocated to the City Solutions segment level.

The cash flows used in determining the value in use for each cash generating unit are based on the

30

most recent long-term forecasts and are determined in local currency. The period covered by cash

31

flows is related to the useful lives of the assets being reviewed for impairment. The growth rate used

32

to extrapolate the cash flow projections until the end of assets, useful lives is in line with the assumed

33

inflation. In Russia the generation capacity built after 2007 under the Russian Government,s Capacity

34

Supply Agreements receives guaranteed capacity payments for a period of 10 years.

35

The discount rate takes into account the risk profile of the country in which the cash flows are

36

generated. There have not been any major changes in the discount rate components or in the methods

37

used to determine them. The long-term pre-tax discount rate used were: City Solutions 7.4%, Consumer

The increase of property, plant and equipment arises mainly from the acquisition of Fortum Oslo Varme Group in City Solutions segment in August 2017. The increase was offset by the translation differences in SEK

25

and RUB.

26

See Note 38 Acquisitions and disposals for additional information on the acquisition of Hafslund Markets Group and Fortum Oslo Varme Group.

Property, plant and equipment that are subject to restrictions in the form of real estate mortgages amount to EUR 318 million (2016: 236). See Note 35 Pledged assets and contingent liabilities.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income statement, because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method on temporary differences arising between

Retained earnings when distributed as dividends are subject to withholding tax (Russia) or distribution tax (Estonia). Provision has been made for these taxes only to extent that it is expected that these earnings

22

will be remitted in the foreseeable future. At the end of the year deferred income tax liabilities of EUR 28 million (2016: 19) have been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the

23

distributions.

24

Deferred tax assets and liabilities from acquisitions and disposals in 2017 are mainly related to restructuring of the ownership in Hafslund together with the City of Oslo, acquisition of Solar power plants in Russia

25

and wind power companies in Norway. In addition, the deferred tax asset relating to tax loss carry forwards increased net in 2017 mainly because of the additional taxable losses in the Netherlands partly offset by the

Deferred tax assets of EUR 20 million (2016: 56) have not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements, because the realisation is not probable. The major part of the unrecognised tax asset relates to loss carry-forwards that are unlikely to be used in the foreseeable future.
Tax loss carry-forwards increased in 2017 mainly because of the additional taxable losses in Netherlands and decreased mainly because of use of losses carry forwards in Russia.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS:

Legal liability for Loviisa nuclear power plant

15

ASSUMPTIONS MADE WHEN ESTIMATING PROVISIONS RELATED TO NUCLEAR PRODUCTION The provision for future obligations for nuclear waste management including decommissioning of Fortum's nuclear power plant and related spent fuel is based on long-term cash flow forecasts of estimated future costs. The main assumptions are technical plans, timing, cost estimates and discount rate. The technical plans, timing and cost estimates are approved by governmental authorities.

The legal liability on 31 December 2017, decided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in

16

December 2017, was EUR 1,161 million.

17

18

The legal liability is based on a cost estimate, which is done every year, and a technical plan, which

19

is made every third year. The current technical plan was updated in 2016. Following the update of the

20

technical plan in 2016, the liability increased due to updated cost estimates related to interim and final

21

storage of spent fuel. The legal liability is determined by assuming that the decommissioning would start

22

Any changes in the assumed discount rate would affect the provision. If the discount rate used would

be lowered, the provision would increase. Fortum has contributed cash to the State Nuclear Waste

31

Based on the Nuclear Energy Act in Finland, Fortum has a legal obligation to fully fund the legal liability decided by the governmental authorities, for decommissioning of the power plant and disposal of spent fuel through the State Nuclear Waste Management Fund.
Both in Finland and in Sweden nuclear operators are legally obligated for the decommissioning of the plants and the disposal of spent fuel (nuclear waste management). In both countries the nuclear operators are obligated to secure the funding of nuclear waste management by paying to government operated nuclear waste funds. The nuclear operators also have to give securities to guarantee that sufficient funds exist to cover future expenses of decommissioning of the power plant and disposal of spent fuel.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the

ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS

15

Environmental provisions are recognised, based on current interpretation of environmental laws and

16

regulations, when it is probable that a present obligation has arisen and the amount of such liability can

17

18 be reliably estimated. Environmental expenditures resulting from the remediation of an existing condition

19

caused by past operations, and which do contribute to current or future revenues, are expensed as 20

incurred.

21

Environmental provisions include provisions for obligations to cover landfills and clean-up obligations

22

for contaminated land areas. Provisions are determined based on the surface area of the landfill site,

23

remaining land area to be landscaped or otherwise cleaned-up, and the unit cost of conducting the

24

coverage and clean-up activities in the future.

25

Environmental provisions are also booked for aftercare and monitoring obligations arising from landfill

26

permit holder's requirement to take into account potential danger to health or the environment posed by

27

a landfill site for a period of at least 30 (up to 60) years after the coverage. The aftercare and monitoring

28

provision is determined on the basis of estimated costs and estimated number of years of filling the landfill.

30

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

31

Asset retirement obligation is recognised either when there is a contractual obligation towards a third

32

party or a legal obligation and the obligation amount can be estimated reliably. Obligating event is e.g.

33

when a plant is built on a leased land with an obligation to dismantle and remove the asset in the future

34

or when a legal obligation towards Fortum changes. The asset retirement obligation is recognised as part

35

of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment when the asset is put in service. The costs will be

36

depreciated over the remainder of the asset's useful life.

Comparability of information presented in tables and graphs
Fortum announced the sale of Swedish Distribution business in March 2015. After the divestment of the Swedish Distribution business Fortum has no electricity distribution operations and therefore Distribution segment was treated as discontinued operations in 2015, with restatement of year 2014, according to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Information in the tables and graphs presented for year 2012 or earlier is not restated due to the adoption of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. Adoption of standards influences treatment of Fortum's holding in AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholms stad (Fortum Värme) in the consolidated financial statements. From 1 January 2014 onwards Fortum Värme is treated as a joint venture and thus consolidated with equity method. Before the change the company was consolidated as a subsidiary with 50% minority interest.

Segment key figures

Following the acquisition of the Russian company, PAO Fortum, Fortum changed its segment reporting during 2008. Comparison numbers were restated in 2008. Fortum renewed its business structure as of 1 March 2014. The reorganisation lead to a change in Fortum's external financial reporting structure as previously separately reported segments Heat and Electricity Sales
were combined into one segment: Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions. Fortum has applied new IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements from 1 January 2014. The effect of applying the new standards to Fortum Group financial information relates
to AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholm Stad (Fortum Värme), that is treated as a joint venture and thus consolidated with equity method from 1 January 2014 onwards. Before the change the company was consolidated as a subsidiary with 50% minority interest.
Fortum announced the sale of Swedish Distribution business in March 2015. After the divestment of the Swedish Distribution business Fortum does not have any distribution operations and therefore Distribution segment has been treated as discontinued operations starting from 2015 with restatement of year 2014, according to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Fortum reorganised its operating structure as of 1 April 2016. The business divisions are: Generation (mainly the former Power and Technology); City Solutions (mainly the former Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions) and Russia. Because of the minor financial impact, the comparable segment information for 2015 was not restated.
As of 1 March 2017, the City Solutions division was divided into two divisions: City Solutions and Consumer Solutions, both reported as separate reporting segments (see Note 5 Segment reporting). Fortum has restated its 2016 comparison segment reporting figures in accordance with the new organisation structure.

Notes to the parent company financial statements, FAS

1 Accounting policies and principles
The financial statements of Fortum Oyj are prepared in accordance with Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS).
1.1 Sales
Sales include sales revenue from actual operations and exchange rate differences on trade receivables, less discounts and indirect taxes such as value added tax.
1.2 Other income
Other income includes gains on the sales of property, plant and equipment and shareholdings, as well as all other operating income not related to the sales of products or services, such as rents.
1.3 Foreign currency items and derivative instruments
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been valued using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date have been valued using the exchange rate quoted on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences have been entered in the financial net in the income statement.
Fortum Oyj enters into derivative contracts mainly for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures in Fortum Group.
Accounting principles of financial derivatives, see Note 3 Financial risk management, Note 14 Financial assets and liabilities by categories and Note 15 Financial assets and liabilities by fair value hierarchy in the Consolidated financial statements.
1.4 Income taxes
Income taxes presented in the income statement consist of accrued taxes for the financial year and tax adjustments for prior years.
1.5 Shares in group companies
The balance sheet value of shares in group companies consists of historical costs less write-downs. If the estimated future cash flows generated by a non-current asset are expected to be permanently lower than the balance of the carrying amount, an adjustment to the value must be made to write-down the difference as an expense. If the basis for the write-down can no longer be justified at the balance sheet date, it must be reversed.

1.6 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
The balance sheet value of property, plant and equipment consists of historical costs less depreciation and possible impairments. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using straight-line depreciation based on the expected useful life of the asset.

The depreciation is based on the following expected useful lives:

Buildings and structures Machinery and equipment Other intangible assets

15­40 years 3­15 years 5­10 years

1.7 Pension expenses
Statutory pension obligations are covered through a compulsory pension insurance policy or Group's own pension fund. Costs for pension fund are recorded in the income statement based on contributions paid pursuant to the Finnish pension laws and regulations.

1.8 Long-term incentive schemes
Costs related to the Fortum long-term incentive plans are accrued over the earnings period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.

1.9 Provisions
Foreseeable future expenses and losses that have no corresponding revenue to which Fortum is committed or obliged to settle, and whose monetary value can be reasonably assessed, are entered as expenses in the income statement and included as provisions in the balance sheet.

1.10 Presentation of the primary statements and notes
Information presented in the notes is given separately for Fortum Group companies and for associated companies of the Group.

Auditor's report

To the Annual General Meeting of Fortum Oyj
Report on the Audit of Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Fortum Oyj (business identity code 1463611-4) for the year ended 31 December, 2017. The financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in total equity, consolidated cash flow statement and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as well as the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements.
In our opinion · the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's financial position
and financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, · the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
Our opinion is consistent with the additional report submitted to the Audit Committee.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
In our best knowledge and understanding, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and group companies are in compliance with laws and regulations applicable in Finland regarding these services, and we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of regulation (EU) 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided have been disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We have also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls. This includes consideration of whether there was evidence of management bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Investor information

Key audit matter
Valuation of fixed assets and goodwill Refer to Notes 2, 16 and 17.
· The consolidated balance sheet includes property, plant and equipment amounting to EUR 10,510 million and goodwill amounting to EUR 613 million.
· The main assumptions used in the valuation of energy production property, plant and equipment and goodwill relate to the estimated future operating cash flows and the discount rates.
· In acquisition the assumptions relates to determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.
· The potential indicators for impairment are among other things changes in electricity and fuel prices, regulatory/political changes relating to energy taxes and price regulations.
· The assumptions used in the valuation of the balances in question require management judgment.
· This matter is a significant risk of material misstatement referred to in EU Regulation No 537/241, point (c) of Article 10(2).

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have evaluated the process how management has assessed the indicators for potential impairment. We have performed audit procedures on impairment models relating to material cash generating units.
· We obtained entity's impairment testing documentation for goodwill and energy production assets when tested and evaluated the rationale of key assumptions applied by management, including commodity price forecasts, profit and cash flow forecasts, terminal values, foreign exchange rates and the selection of discount rates.
· We have compared, that the forecasts used in the impairment testing calculations are based on long term forecast approved by management.
· We challenged management's assumptions and judgments with reference to historical data and, where applicable, external benchmarks.
· We assessed the models used in the impairment testing and carried out our testing for the sensitivity calculations.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Associated companies and joint ventures Refer to Notes 2, 18 and 36.
· Fortum participates in a number of associated companies and joint ventures with a total carrying amount of EUR 1,900 million in the consolidated financial statements.
· The assessment of the recoverable value of the associated companies and joint ventures incorporates significant management judgments and estimates.
· The associated companies and joint ventures are joint contractual arrangements, which include several complex accounting, regulatory and legal aspects as described in note 36. These aspects may have significant impact on Fortum's financial reporting.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have reviewed and evaluated the management's process to monitor and control the significant associated companies and joint ventures as well as to follow the related legal cases.
· We have assessed and challenged the management judgment and assumptions used determining the recoverable amount for associated companies and joint ventures. We have also evaluated the accuracy of the calculations prepared to quantify the recoverable amount.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Fair value measurement of derivatives and hedge accounting Refer to Notes 3, 6, 7, 14 and 15.
· In Fortum's consolidated financial statements total derivative assets amounts to EUR 521 million and total derivative liabilities amounts to EUR 414 million. The net effect of changes in fair values of derivatives hedging future cash flow amounts to EUR 14 million in items affecting comparability in the consolidated income statement and the cash flow hedges in other equity components amount to EUR 74 million.
· The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined through the application of valuation techniques which often involve management judgment. Fortum's business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and volume of commodities used in the production and sales of energy products. The main exposure is toward energy prices. Electricity price risk is hedged by entering into electricity derivative contracts. Fortum uses hedging instruments to reduce the effect of electricity price volatility.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· Our audit procedures included an assessment of internal controls over the hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing, measurement of fair value measures, and evaluating the methodologies, inputs, judgments made and assumptions used by management in determining fair values.
· For Fortum's fair valuation models, we evaluated rationale of the models and accounting treatment applied. We compared observable inputs against independent sources and externally available market data.
· We have assessed the existence and completeness of outstanding derivative contracts as of 31 December 2017 by requesting confirmations from the counterparties.
· We have assessed that financial instruments included in hedge relationships are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
· We have assessed the adequacy of the presentation for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting applied in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Nuclear related assets and liabilities Refer to Notes 2 and 28.
· Nuclear related assets and liabilities in consolidated balance sheet amount to EUR858 million.
· Fortum's nuclear related provisions and the related part of the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund are both presented separately as disclosed in note 28.
· Fortum's share in the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund is accounted for according to IFRIC 5 which states that the fund assets are measured at the lower of fair value or the value of the related liabilities.
· Due to complexity and materiality, the accounting treatment for nuclear decommissioning is complex and requires application of special accounting practice and management judgment when forming estimates for the basis of accounting such as technical plans, timing, cost estimates and discount rate.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We have assessed Fortum's accounting manual and principles for Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting, whether they are in line with IFRS accounting principles.

· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.

Key audit matter
Income taxes Refer to Notes 2, 12, 27 and 36.
· Fortum has several tax assessments ongoing.
· The accounting treatment and disclosing of tax cases require management to make judgments and estimates in disclosing and accounting tax contingencies and receivables as described in note 27.
· Ongoing tax assessments are lengthy and at various stages from preliminary discussions with tax authorities through to court proceedings, where obtaining the final tax assessments can take a number of years prior to concluding.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
· We performed testing regarding Fortum's tax positions in the significant tax jurisdictions in which Fortum operates.
· We assessed the rationale of management's assumptions and challenged the management judgment applied in relation to disclosing and accounting the tax contingencies and receivables of the tax cases. Together with our tax specialist we have also assessed the company's external opinions which have been used to support the management's assumptions.
· We assessed the adequacy of related disclosures as well as the accounting treatment in the financial statements.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO for the financial statements
The Board of Directors and the President and CEO are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the President and CEO are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the President and CEO are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities in the audit of financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control. · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the President and CEO use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Reporting Requirements
Information on our audit engagement
We were first appointed as auditors by the Annual General Meeting on 16.3.2006, and our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 11 years.

Other information
The Board of Directors and the President and CEO are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Operational and Financial Review and the information included in the Financials, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the Operating and Financial Review prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the Financials is expected to be made available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to Operating and Financial Review, our responsibility also includes considering whether the Operating and Financial Review has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
In our opinion, the information in the Operating and Financial Review is consistent with the information in the financial statements and the Operating and Financial Review has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Other opinions
We support that the financial statements should be adopted. The proposal by the Board of Directors regarding the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet is in compliance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. We support that the Board of Directors of the parent company and the President and CEO should be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.

Corporate Governance Statement

Board of Directors

Executive Management Team

Corporate Governance Statement 2017
Fortum Corporation (FORTUM) has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki since 18 December 1998. Fortum's industrial sector, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland is the majority owner in Fortum with 50.76% of the shares as of 31 December 2017.
Corporate governance at Fortum is based on Finnish laws and the company's Articles of Association. Fortum complies fully with and has prepared this corporate governance statement in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2015. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors.
Fortum prepares consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act as well as the appropriate Financial Supervision Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki's rules. The company's operating and financial review and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Accounting Act, Securities Markets Act, and the opinions and guidelines of the Finnish Accounting Board.
The auditor's report covers the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2015 is available on the website of the Securities Market Association at

Description of Governance
Governing bodies of Fortum
The decision-making bodies managing and overseeing the Group's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its two Committees, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Executive Management.
Fortum also has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims to advance Fortum's businesses by facilitating a dialogue and exchange of views between Fortum and its stakeholders. During 2017, the Advisory Council consisted of 14 representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups and three employee representatives.
As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy, the highest decision making of these issues falls on the duties of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility on sustainability matters. Therefore Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for decision making on economic, environmental and social issues.

Each share is entitled to one vote. A shareholder who is present at the General Meeting of Shareholders also has the right to request information on matters to be considered at the meeting. Before the end of each financial year Fortum states on the Annual General Meeting website and in the Investor Relations calendar the date by which a shareholder must declare his/her proposals to the General Meeting.
Decisions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such decisions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividends, discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, appointment of the Board of Directors and the external auditors, and deciding on their remuneration.
In accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no more than three months and no less than three weeks before the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the company's website or in two newspapers chosen by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is to be held once a year, in June at the latest.

The Annual General Meeting on 9 April 2013 established a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. The purpose and task of the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare and present to the Annual General Meeting, and, if necessary, to an Extraordinary General Meeting, a proposal on the remuneration, size and members of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board seeks candidates for potential board members.
The Shareholders' Nomination Board consists of four members, three of which are appointed by the company's three largest shareholders, who shall appoint one member each. The Chairman of the Board of Directors serves as the fourth member. The members are nominated annually and their term of office ends when new members are nominated to replace them. Fortum's three largest shareholders that are entitled to appoint members to the Shareholders' Nomination Board are determined on the basis of the registered holdings as of the first working day in September in the year concerned. In the event that a shareholder does not wish to exercise their right to appoint a representative, it shall pass the right to the next-largest shareholder who would not otherwise be entitled to appoint a member to the Nomination Board. The Shareholders' Nomination Board forwards its proposals for the Annual General Meeting to the Board of Directors by 31 January each year.
Diversity Principles for the Board of Directors
The Shareholders' Nomination Board uses diversity principles for the Board of Directors in line with the Corporate Governance Code 2015. The principles are applied in preparing proposal concerning nomination of board members. The diversity principles include, among others, that the board composition shall include expertise from the geographical areas where Fortum conducts its business, the background profession of the board members shall include

such competences that support realisation of Fortum's strategy and that enable board members to challenge management decisions and to exercise their role of having oversight. In addition, the board composition shall include both genders. Fortum's target is to comply with the principles issued in the Government Resolution dated 17 February 2015 on equal gender representation in the boards of listed companies with the aim of the board consisting of at least 40% each of women and men by 2020. The Shareholders Nomination Board reviews the diversity principles and their implementation annually.
Fortum reports the objectives, actions and progress of the diversity principles in its corporate governance statement. The Shareholders' Nomination Board has applied the diversity principles in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of board members for the Annual General Meeting 2017 and for the upcoming Annual General Meeting of 2018. The Shareholders' Nomination Board deems that the current board composition and the proposed board members for the Annual General Meeting 2018 include all the competences defined in the diversity principles in well balanced manner.
The proposal for the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2018 consists of 3 women and 5 men. The current Board of Directors consists of 3 women and 4 men, corresponding to a ratio of 42.9% and 57.1%.

The main features of the Internal Control and Risk Management Systems
The internal control and risk management systems relating to financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and aim to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Risk management systems
Fortum's Board of Directors approves the Group Risk Policy that defines the objective, main principles and division of responsibilities for risk management. The Group Risk Policy also includes a description of the main features of the risk management process which is applicable to all processes including financial reporting.
Internal controls in relation to financial reporting
Fortum's internal control framework is based on the main elements from the framework introduced by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The controls including financial reporting controls, have been defined based on the main risks in the process. Internal controls are an integral part of compliance in Fortum covering key areas of business ethics, regulatory compliance and internal controls.

Control environment
The standards, processes and structures in internal control are set through Group policies, Group instructions and the Fortum internal control framework. Fortum's internal control framework is designed to support operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with laws, regulations and policies. The internal control framework defines the key controls and minimum requirements for the key processes. During 2017, Group Instruction for Compliance Management was implemented also describing the roles and responsibilities in terms of internal controls. Corporate Accounting and Control is responsible for the overall control structure of the financial reporting process. Fortum Controllers' manual defines instructions and guidelines relating to financial reporting.

Fortum's organisation is decentralised, and a substantial degree of authority and responsibility is delegated to the divisions in the form of control responsibilities. Fortum's control governance follows the so-called "Three lines of defense" model as illustrated in the graphic.
Risk assessment
Risks are continuously identified and analysed as part of the risk management process. Material risks, that might, if realised, have financial impact or lead to non-compliance are reported at least annually to the ARC, and follow-up of actions and improvements are integrated in operational management. The currently ongoing Internal Controls Quality Programme is to review and enhance

existing controls to ensure that the key risks in the processes are mitigated.
Control activities
Control activities are applied in the processes and, from the financial reporting perspective, they ensure that errors or deviations are prevented or detected and corrected.
The Corporate Accounting and Control unit together with the Record-to-Report internal controls process team determine the control requirements and the scope covering the financial reporting process. Divisions and units define their controls based on these common requirements. Responsibilities are assigned for the control activities and for ensuring that the control coverage is in accordance with the defined requirements and scope.
Control requirements for the financial reporting process include controls regarding the initiation, recognition, measurement, approval, accounting and reporting of financial transactions as well as disclosure of financial information. The general IT controls support the financial reporting controls in areas like access control and back-up management.
Responsibilities are assigned to finance functions ensuring that analyses of the business performance, including analyses on volumes, revenues, costs, working capital, and asset values are performed in accordance with the control requirements.
Information and communication
The Controllers' manual includes the Fortum Accounting manual, Investment manual and reporting instructions, and other instructions relating to financial reporting. Regular core controllers' meetings, headed by the Corporate Controller, steer the Finance function. Regular Accounting Network Forum meetings are to inform about upcoming changes in IFRS, new accounting policies and other changes in reporting requirements.
Monitoring and follow-up
Financial performance and key short-term risks and uncertainties related to business operations are reported monthly to the Fortum Executive Management.

Corporate Governance Statement

Board of Directors

Executive Management Team

As part of the Fortum internal control framework, divisions and units regularly assess the maturity of the control activities they are responsible for including the financial reporting process controls. The Head of Internal Controls reports the maturity assessments results and improvement actions to the management and to the ARC. Internal control design and operating effectiveness are also assessed as part of the audits by Internal Audit. Audit results, including corrective actions and their status, are regularly reported to the management and to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Auditing
Internal Audit Fortum's Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance function that is responsible for examining and evaluating the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group's management and corporate governance processes, internal control system, risk management, and operational processes. The Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Audit form the basis for the work of Internal Audit.
External Audit The Group and the parent company have one external auditor, which shall be an audit firm certified by the Central Chamber of Commerce. Due to ongoing mergers and acquisition processes some of the target companies have other audit firms during the transition period. The external auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting for a term of office that expires at the end of the first Annual General Meeting following the election.
Fortum's Annual General Meeting on 4 April 2017 elected Authorised Public Accountant Deloitte Oy as the company's external auditor, with Authorised Public Accountant Reeta Virolainen having the principal responsibility.
The Annual General Meeting decided on 4 April 2017 that the auditor's fee be paid pursuant to invoice approved by the company.
The fee paid to the auditor for services rendered and invoiced in 2017 totalled approx. EUR 1,448,000. In addition, the audit

firm was paid a total of approx. EUR 1,158,000 for non-audit and advisory services rendered and invoiced.
Code of Conduct and Compliance Programme
Fortum's Code of Conduct is based on the shared corporate values which form the ethical basis for all work at Fortum. Fortum values were updated in 2017. Fortum's Code of Conduct was rebranded and relaunched in 2017 (originally launched in 2007 and updated 2015) to whole company, including Recycling and Waste Solutions and Hafslund, and is published in ten languages. The Code of Conduct has been approved by the Board of Directors. Fortum employees are responsible for reporting any suspected misconduct to their own supervisors, to other management members or, if necessary, directly to Internal Audit. Additionally, Fortum employees and partners can report suspicions of misconduct confidentially to the Fortum Head of Internal Audit via the "raise-a-concern channel" on Fortum's internal and external web pages. The report can be submitted in several languages and anonymously if necessary. In Russia, Fortum even has a separate compliance organisation with compliance officers in place.
Prevention of corruption is one of the Code of Conduct's focus areas. Fortum has procedures for anti-corruption including prevention, oversight, reporting and enforcement based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. Fortum also has a country and partner risk evaluation process to support the understanding and management of compliance needs at the local business and partner level. These also cover export control and antimoney laundering aspects.
Fortum has a compliance programme which covers key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics. It is managed with risk-based prioritisation. Internal Controls are integral part of the compliance and both the Group Compliance Officer and the Head of Internal Controls report to the General Counsel independently of the business.
The Code of Conduct and compliance topics and instructions are communicated through internal and external communication channels. Alignment is enforced by top management with their full commitment.

Insider Administration
Fortum complies with the EU regulation No. 596/2014 on market abuse (MAR) and EU regulation No. 1227/2011 on wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and related regulation. Fortum complies also with the Guidelines for Insiders issued by Nasdaq Helsinki.
Persons discharging managerial responsibilities
Persons discharging managerial responsibilities and the persons associated with them are under a duty to disclose their transactions with Fortum's financial instruments. Fortum has defined persons discharging managerial responsibilities to be the members of the Board of Directors and Fortum Executive Management.
Duty to disclose and Closed Window

Fortum makes the said transactions public with a stock exchange release.

Remuneration

2017

Remuneration Statement 2017

Dear Shareholders,
Fortum has determinedly executed the strategy that was designed and introduced in spring 2016 to ensure the company's successful growth and continued profitability as Europe transitions towards clean energy. The most visible steps include our investment in Uniper, the restructuring of our Hafslund ownership, the acquisition of Ekokem, and our sizeable investments into new renewable and low carbon production such as wind, solar, biomass and waste-to-energy power plants.
At the same time, we are strengthening our corporate culture to ensure that the company is ready to meet the challenges brought upon the rapidly changing operating environment. For a company undergoing change it is of utmost importance that we have leaders and employees who are highly motivated and consistently performing very well. During the year we introduced Open Leadership as the main framework for developing our people and leadership culture. Our refreshed values, our leadership principles, as well as fair and transparent remuneration are key enablers to the success and continuous improvement of our company.
At Fortum we expect a lot from our people and in turn reward the high performance they deliver in line with our strategy, culture and values. We emphasise clear measurable targets aligned with Fortum's strategy and our reward and incentive programmes are designed to attract and retain high calibre employees and to support the creation of shareholder value.
The criteria for Fortum's short-term incentive plan are set annually by the Board of Directors and is based on the company's financial and operational performance. 2017 was a good year for Fortum as our strategy implementation proceeded well and the financial results improved clearly. Accordingly, the financial targets in the short-term incentive plan were reached. However, the performance in our key safety indicator Lost workday injury frequency was not on a satisfactory level and we have further increased our efforts to reach best practice safety levels in all units.

The criteria for Fortum's long-term incentive plans are set by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each plan. The performance during the earnings period 2014­2016 was satisfactory and the 2014­2019 long-term incentive plan exceeded the minimum performance criteria and vested at 27%. This resulted in approximately 150,000 shares being awarded to eligible participants in 2017. The performance for the earnings period 2015­2017 also exceeded the minimum performance criteria and the 2015­2020 LTI plan vested at 26% on average.

Fortum's continued success relies to a great extent on the dedication and hard work of our people. We want to be a company where people grow, thrive and exceed our ­ and their own ­ expectations. We trust that this is the best way to reach sustainable long-term success.
Matti Lievonen Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Governance
Remuneration at Fortum is directed by the Group's remuneration principles and Fortum's general compensation and benefits practices as well as guidance set out in the Government Resolution on State-Ownership Policy. This Remuneration Statement has been prepared and issued in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2015.
The Shareholders' Nomination Board, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), the Board of Directors and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee are all involved in the preparations and decision-making regarding remuneration at Fortum.
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Principles
At Fortum, we strive for a performance-focused culture where our people understand: · the company, its strategy and performance targets, · how they as individuals can impact the results, · the link between business performance and remuneration, and · the importance of delivering sustainable business results.
This philosophy underpins our remuneration principles which are designed to encourage and recognise high performance and behaviour in line with Fortum's values.
Fortum follows a total compensation approach where all remuneration elements are taken into account when setting and reviewing salaries; base salaries, short- and long-term incentive opportunities as well as different benefits.

Key Remuneration Principles

Effective performance leadership

We motivate our people by setting challenging targets. We encourage initiative taking, active leadership of own and team performance as well as collaboration to enable desired behaviour and achieve business success. We emphasise setting and cascading clear targets aligned with Fortum's strategy as an essential part of good leadership on all levels. We emphasise cross-unit and cross-function collaboration in reaching our business objectives, also reflected in target setting. Rewarding is tightly linked to the overall performance leadership in Fortum.

Performance driven remuneration

We reward concrete achievements in implementing Fortum's strategy and achieving business targets and desired change. We differentiate performance and pay for real achievement. Both low and high performance have consequences.

Competitive remuneration

We take into consideration relevant market and industry practices as well as different business models and their needs when defining the level and nature of compensation and benefits, aiming to be an attractive employer for the relevant persons with needed skills and competences.

Effective communication

To gain full advantage of the compensation and benefits programs, we emphasize clear, transparent and regular communication about the company's as well as the individual's performance, in particular clarifying the link between performance and variable compensation. We invest in developing managers' knowledge of performance and reward practices and programmes.

Integrity and compliance

We run our performance and reward processes and programmes with high integrity and follow local legislation in each country where we operate. We follow the Corporate Governance Code for Finnish listed companies as well as the guidelines regarding remuneration for the management of state-owned companies. We don't accept any kind of compliance breach.

The awards are based on the achievement of Group financial performance, divisional targets, and individual targets. The target incentive opportunity is 20% and the maximum incentive opportunity is 40% of the annual base salary.

Long-term incentives (LTI)
The purpose of Fortum's long-term incentive programme is to support the delivery of sustainable, long-term performance, align the interests of management with those of shareholders and assist in committing and retaining key individuals.
Fortum's LTI programme provides participants with the opportunity to earn company shares. Under the LTI programme and subject to the decision of the Board of Directors, a new LTI plan commences annually.
The Board of Directors approves participation of the Fortum Executive Management members in each annually commencing LTI plan. Subject to a decision by the Board of Directors the President and CEO is authorised to decide on individual participants and potential maximum awards for other participants than the Fortum Executive Management in accordance with the nomination guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Participation in the LTI plan precludes the individual from being a member in the Fortum Personnel Fund.
Each LTI plan begins with a three year earnings period, during which participants may earn share rights if the performance criteria set by the Board of Directors are fulfilled.
If the minimum performance criteria are not exceeded, no shares will be awarded. If performance is exceptionally good and the targets approved by the Board of Directors are achieved, the combined gross value of all variable compensation cannot exceed 120% of the person's annual salary in any calendar year.
After the earnings period has ended and the relevant taxes and other employment-related expenses have been deducted, participants are paid the net balance in the form of shares.
For LTI plans commencing in 2013 onwards, any shares awarded to Fortum Executive Management members are subject to a three-year lock-up period in accordance with the State-Ownership Guidelines in force at the time the LTI plan was introduced. Subject to a decision by the Board of Directors, the lock-up period can be reduced to one year for those Fortum Executive Management members whose aggregate ownership of Fortum shares is greater than or equal to their annual salary. For other participants (i.e. below the Fortum Executive Management), the lock-up period is one year. For LTI plans commencing prior to 2013, the lock-up period is three years for all LTI plan participants.

4

If the value of the shares decreases or increases during the lockup or retention period, the participant will carry the potential loss or gain.
To reflect the changes in the State-Ownership Guidelines in 2016, for LTI plans commencing in 2017 and beyond, the share awards will not be subject to a minimum lock-up period. However, Fortum Executive Management members whose aggregate ownership of Fortum shares does not yet fulfil the shareholding requirement are required to retain at least 50% of the shares received until the required level of shareholding is met.
The Board of Directors has the right to revise the targets set in the incentive plans, deviate from the payment based on achievement of the set earnings criteria, or to discontinue any ongoing incentive plan. Remuneration that has been paid out without grounds shall be reclaimed in accordance with the regulations on returning an unjust enrichment and remuneration. A payment which has been influenced by the recipient's unethical conduct, may be recovered based on the terms of the LTI programme.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is using independent advisors in support of its work.
Pensions
Members of the Fortum Executive Management in Finland participate in the Finnish TyEL pension system, which provides a retirement benefit based on earnings in accordance with the prescribed statutory system. In the Finnish pension system earnings are based on base pay, annual bonuses and taxable fringe benefits, but gains realised from the LTI plans are not included. Members of the Fortum Executive Management outside Finland participate in pension systems based on statutory pension arrangements and market practices in their local countries.
In addition to the statutory pensions, the members of the Fortum Executive Management have supplementary pension arrangements. The Group principle is that all new supplementary pension arrangements for the President and CEO as well as the Fortum Executive Management are defined contribution plans.
The retirement age for Fortum's President and CEO is 63, and for the other members of the Fortum Executive Management the retirement age varies between 60 and 65. For the President and

CEO and other members of the Fortum Executive Management, the maximum supplementary pension premium is 25% of the annual base salary. For the members joining the Fortum Executive Management after the end of the year 2016 as well as for those current members to whom the premium has been below 20% of the annual salary, the pension premium is 20% of the annual base salary as of 1 January 2017. Finnish members of the Fortum Executive Management, who joined Fortum prior to 1 January 2009, are entitled to a supplementary defined benefit pension plan. This currently applies to only one member of the Fortum Executive Management and in this case, the pension is provided by Fortum's Pension Fund.

The Board of Directors approved the amended LTI programme in December 2016. The share awards will not be subject to a minimum lock-up period but members of the Fortum Executive Management will be required to retain 50% of the shares until they have achieved their required shareholding level of 100% of the annual salary. For other key employees included in the new LTI plan no lock-up period will be applied. Under the 2017­2019 LTI plan, the Board-approved earnings criteria are based on earnings per share (50%) and relative total shareholder return (50%) measured against the European Utilities Group. Under the plan, the maximum gross number of shares to be delivered after the earnings period in 2020 is 580,120 shares (based on participant status on 31 December 2017). In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved the same earnings criteria, i.e. earnings per share (50%) and relative total shareholder return (50%) for the 2018­2020 LTI plan.

Fortum as a tax payer 2017

The energy sector, including Fortum, is in the middle of a transition. Global megatrends, such as climate change, emerging new technologies, changes in consumer behavior, and questions regarding resource efficiency, are having a major impact on the energy sector globally. These changes make it harder for Fortum to have the predictability that we need to be able to operate in this capital-intensive sector and to finance operations in an efficient and safe manner. We therefore need to have as much predictability as possible in other areas such as tax.
As set out in our tax policy below, we aim to identify simple and cost-efficient solutions to manage our taxes in a sustainable

manner. The goal is to ensure that our businesses can continue to invest, to operate flexibly and efficiently, and to safeguard returns to our shareholders.
Fortum operates in more than 20 countries. The majority of our business is based on local fuels and energy sources, local production, local distribution of heat, and sale of energy to customers locally. Therefore our profits are typically generated locally and similarly the taxes are paid locally.
Taxation is always a consequence of business operations and is therefore always based on business decisions and needs. For us this means that there will always be tax impacts arising from the long

lifetimes of our investments, from price levels which are set locally and from the efficiency of our financing. It is important that we can operate and finance our businesses efficiently, carry out investments and manage financing risks in all the countries where we operate. Financing, which underpins all our operations, is one of the international aspects of Fortum's tax profile. Therefore predictability and stability of our operating environment are crucial for us.
The extent and nature of the taxes Fortum pays is shown by our total tax contribution. In 2017, it was EUR 966 (2016: 741) million of which EUR 445 (2016: 365) million related to taxes borne and EUR 521 (2016: 376) million to taxes collected. Finland, Sweden and Russia are our biggest production countries. In 2017, the taxes borne in Finland were EUR 98 (2016: 101) million, in Sweden EUR 246 (2016: 201) million and in Russia EUR 38 (2016: 23) million.
Taxes borne include corporate income taxes (excluding deferred taxes), production taxes, employment taxes, taxes on property, and the cost of indirect taxes. Taxes collected include VAT, payroll taxes, excise taxes and withholding taxes.
While income taxes are paid on taxable profit, Fortum also pays other taxes based on, for example, fuel usage, waste, production capacity, and the value of real estate. As a major part of our taxes are not based on profits, our total taxes borne in relation to our accounting profit (total tax rate) will increase if the profit level decreases. With the current low electricity prices, these

non-profit-based taxes account for a more significant share of costs of operations than before. Such a large tax burden, which is unrelated to profitability, can be a significant challenge to run an economically viable business.
Tax environment in 2017
The operating environment has been affected by the global macro economic problems and the related challenges to the public finances. In many of the our operating countries, taxes on the energy sector have been increasing in the past years. Combined with low electricity prices, high taxes threaten the profitability of utilities, including Fortum.
With this background, 2017 can partly be seen as a turning point for the energy sector. While some countries continued to increase tax rates especially for production and property taxes, Finland did not implement plans to increase real estate tax rate on power plants and Sweden decided on a staged alignment of the real estate tax rates for hydro operations with real estate tax rates for other electricity producers and industrial real estate by 2020. At the same time the capacity tax on nuclear power was completely abolished in Sweden from the beginning of 2018. The approach taken in Finland and Sweden was welcome as it makes the tax burden sustainable again.

Intense political interest in taxes and especially the focus on so-called aggressive tax planning has decreased the predictability and stability of all business operations. For example, the OECD's BEPS work, the EU Commission's anti-tax avoidance directive (ATAD), and the EU Accounting directive work are changing existing rules, policies and even fundamental aspects of taxation. In 2017, the developments in this area has been two-fold. Firstly, OECD has placed predictability high on its agenda. We appreciate this positive development and wish it to continue. Secondly, as the ATAD directive has been confirmed, which creates a minimum requirement for rules such as interest deductions, it lowers the predictability. These rules vary between countries and their impact can extend beyond combatting aggressive tax planning. Strong national interests in the area of taxation are often reflected both in the drafting of legislation and its interpretations, giving rise to further uncertainty. The EU's proposal for dispute resolution is a further positive development, but it will not tackle the matters at the heart of the uncertainty of the tax environment.
Taxes are high on the political agenda, putting pressure on governments to develop new legislation quickly, often without proper preparation and impact assessment. We are seeing hurriedly designed tax rules being in conflict with underlying fundamental legislative principles at the level of the EU and in individual Member States and we expect this to continue. For example, the Administrative Court in Stockholm made a bold decision in favour of Fortum in which it held that the real estate tax for hydro operations in Sweden created an unlawful negative state aid (i.e. the tax is in conflict with EU legislation) as it taxes the hydro power operations more heavily than other forms of power generation. The tax authorities have appealed this decision.
Fortum's approach to taxation ­ our tax policy
Fortum's tax policy is based on the fact that taxes should be handled as part of the business process and tax management supports the corporate strategy. Therefore, taxes are managed based on Fortum Group's operating strategy with a focus especially on the protection of the parent company's dividend distribution capability, in order to meet our dividend policy. Currently the main focus has been on growth through mergers and acquisitions including strong focus on positive cash flow. These corporate

level targets also steer the tax strategy with focus on ensuring the correct taxes being paid where and when they should be. Taxes are managed through actions within the normal business processes and control points.
Tax planning is managed to support business efficiency and profitability in order to create and protect shareholder value, while respecting existing regulations. This ensures that we appropriately assess, report and pay our taxes to the tax authorities to the benefit of our stakeholders and wider society.
We always operate within the law and on the basis of being open and transparent with tax authorities in all the jurisdictions where we operate. We also follow guidelines set out by the Ownership Steering Department in the Finnish Prime Minister's Office. Predictability and transparency of both international and local legislation as well as interpretations and decisions by tax authorities on all levels are critical to us, as all our investments have

a long lifetime and our operations are capital intensive. We respect existing regulations, such as market-based pricing of internal transactions (the arm's length principle). We pay taxes in the country where our business operations are located and where the value added is generated, in accordance with the local regulations.
Tax risk management ­ During the year we regularly assess the uncertainties relating to taxation in our business. We report tax risks and how they are managed and assured annually to the Audit and Risk Committee in line with our internal calendar and risk-related work.
The risk analysis in 2017 identified particular risks that require mitigation. These included low levels of predictability due to the implementation of certain ATAD rules, developments in the Finnish real-estate tax, tax leakage on acquisitions and the late involvement of the tax department in some investment projects. To mitigate these risks, we aim to make tax issues, an integral part of our business processes, to improve communication around taxes and further develop analysis on our tax position and raise management's awareness of them.
Our Corporate Tax Team manages and mitigates tax-related uncertainties by targeting predictability in the taxes for the business operations in all our operating countries. This means that in unclear cases we discuss with tax authorities or seek advice from experts to clarify interpretations. We pay special attention to the correctness and transparency of our tax returns, and we discuss our positions with tax authorities.
Tax governance ­ The Vice President Taxation implements our tax approach and is responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures which support the tax approach are in place, maintained and implemented in the same manner in all countries. Furthermore, the VP Taxation is responsible for ensuring that the Corporate Tax Team has the proficiency and experience to implement our approach appropriately.
The VP Taxation reports to the CFO. Furthermore, tax issues, such as tax strategy, legal processes and tax-related risks are followed on a regular basis by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors. The chart on this page presents the different tax functions within the Corporate Tax Team.
Transparency and relationships with governments ­ In Fortum's tax reporting we are committed to ensuring that

stakeholders are able to understand the important elements of our tax position and that the information provided is fair and accurate. We have published our tax footprint as part of our annual reporting since 2012. In our tax reporting we apply the 2017 guidelines of the Ownership Steering Department of the Finnish Prime Minister's Office for majority state-owned companies as the Finnish state is the majority shareholder in Fortum. We strive for effective collaboration with authorities to clarify existing rules, so that we can respond to potential challenges in a timely manner and avoid surprises.
We believe that transparency is crucial both for our external and internal stakeholders. Open, transparent and consistent communication guides our tax footprint reporting. To create the best possible understanding of us as a tax payer and of the impact of taxes on our business and on the societies we operate in, we continue to develop our tax footprint report.
At Fortum, we recognise the demands of our stakeholders for more information on taxes and our disclosures reflect this. We report both our effective tax rate and total tax rate. In line with the 2017 tax reporting guidelines for state-owned companies in Finland, we apply the principle of materiality in our financial reporting, i.e. we publish tax information on the most significant

countries, and we publish more detailed information about taxation for the majority of the countries in which Fortum operates in this report. Furthermore, we publish information about our companies registered in countries that are considered by the EU, the OECD and the Global Forum to be tax havens. We disclose all significant tax-related decisions concerning, for example, tax audits and appeals.
Legal structure and intra-group financing
To support our strategy and dividend policy, Fortum's legal structure is designed to mitigate various financial risks in our operations, ensure sound and efficient financing of operations and investments, and safeguard the parent company's financial strength and dividend distribution capability in accordance with Fortum's dividend policy. The financing and holding of our operations is located in the EU area, in countries where the operating environment is the most predictable. Our Finnish operations are owned through the parent company, our Swedish operations by our Swedish holding company and our operations in other countries mainly by our Dutch and Irish holding companies. The taxes are, however, paid in the country where the revenue is generated independently of the ownership structure.

Case | Acquisitions and ownership restructuring
Fortum's main production countries in 2017: Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Poland, Norway, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia Other main Fortum countries: India, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Belgium

Within Fortum Group, there are a number of active holding and finance companies. We explain below the commercial reasons for such companies, how they operate and their relationship to our core business operations.
In 2017, Fortum acquired wind power generation companies in Norway and restructured its ownership of the Norwegian energy company Hafslund. Fortum's income from the local operations, for example wind power in northern Norway and heating operations in Oslo is taxed in Norway.
In order to increase its heating and power generation capacity, which in turn leads to more income and more tax revenue for Norway, Fortum has to invest.
Such investments in Norway require financing, at least in part through borrowing from group finance companies. The interest paid by the company making the investment gives rise to taxable income for the group finance entity that lends the money and receives the interest. The finance entities independently manages its own financial position including setting the interest rate for the loans. These interests are set at arm's length, and so reflects the costs that would be incurred if the investment company were to borrow from an external bank.
Why do you have separate financing and holding companies? Fortum Group needs to have a corporate legal structure that provides the necessary flexibility to deal with negative events. Financing and holding companies independently bear the risks associated with their operations and so protect Fortum Oyj's, the parent company's, distributable funds as losses from financing operations and other negative events are primarily booked in holding and finance companies.

Could you finance and hold operations directly from the parent company Fortum Oyj? Finance and holding companies protect Fortum Oyj from losses. Having direct financing or holding would not give the necessary flexibility to protect Fortum Oyj from these losses.
Is Fortum avoiding taxes by having separate financing entities? Each financing company is taxed on its profits from financing operations based on normal local standards and rules. Netherlands taxes profits at 25% and Ireland at 12.5%. Financing companies regularly distribute part of their profits to Fortum Oyj.
Why does Fortum have a finance company in Ireland as you don't have any other operations there? Ireland has stable and predictable legislation concerning financing and holding operations. Ireland also offers a favorable statutory tax rate of 12.5%.
Do the financing companies have artificial operations? Each finance company has its own personnel capable of executing financing operations. Each finance company carries their own risks independently from other group companies and from any other business operation. Financing companies fund our commercial financing needs such as acquisitions and investments in capital intensive power and heat production.
Is Finland losing tax revenue as a result of Fortum's separate holding and finance companies? No, as these companies protect the parent company's distributable reserves, they also protect the Finnish tax base from losses. An example of this is the losses that arose in the Dutch finance company in 2017, not in Finland.

Financial statement disclosures

Fortum publishes tax information as part of its financial statements. Income taxes and deferred taxes in the balance sheet are included and explained in the tax notes to the financial statements. The most relevant parts of these tax notes are reproduced below, with some commentary to explain some of the drivers of the numbers. See Note 12 Income tax expense and
Note 27 Income taxes in balance sheet for further information. The effective income tax rate according to the income statement
was 20.6% (2016: 15.2%). The tax rate used in the income statement is always impacted by the fact that the share of profits from associates and joint ventures is recorded based on Fortum's share of profits after tax. Other major items affecting the effective income tax rate are one-time tax exempt capital gains and losses, tax rate changes and major one-time tax effects.

The comparable effective income tax rate is presented to better reflect the Group's tax position when comparing the current period to previous periods. Items affecting comparability are not included in the comparable effective income tax rate. The comparable effective income tax rate for 2017 was 18.8% (2016: 20.0%). The table below explains the difference between the statutory tax rate in Finland compared to the rate at which Fortum is taxed on its profit before income tax decreased by profits from associated companies and joint ventures and by tax exempt capital gains or losses as per the tax charge on the income statements excluding tax rate changes and major one-time tax effects.
The effective income tax rate and comparable effective income tax rate reflect the income tax expense recognised in the income statement including changes in deferred taxes. When the pre-tax

The one-time tax-free capital gain in 2017 mainly relates to the restructuring of the ownership in Hafslund. The other major one-time tax effect relates to Fortum booking a tax cost of EUR 115 million because of the unfavorable decisions from the Administrative Court of Appeal in Sweden relating to the income tax assessments for 2009­2012.

Deferred taxes in the balance sheet
Deferred taxes illustrate timing differences between the treatment of costs under accounting and tax rules. The timing differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the most significant of which for Fortum are explained below.

Deferred tax liabilities in 2017 mainly relate to property, plants and equipment in Finland, Sweden and Russia. The deferred tax asset relating to tax losses and tax credits carry forwards increased net in 2017 mainly because of the additional taxable losses in the Netherlands partly offset by the usage of losses carry forwards in Russia.

Case | Tax losses and timing of income taxes paid
If a company has poor profitability, it may make tax losses that cannot be utilised in the period in which they arise, but can be carried forward and used to offset taxable profits in the future. A concrete example of tax losses is the one-time write-down of the two reactors at the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in Sweden during 2015; this gave rise to significant losses that will only be utilised once the Swedish operations return to profit. It may take many years to fully utilise the losses. The future benefit of these losses is booked as a deferred tax asset (or reduction of deferred tax liability) in the balance sheet. In years in which the tax loss is utilised, the company will have taxable profits, but will pay no tax, as the losses from previous years are used to offset the taxable profits arising in the current year. The tax contribution of Fortum with its capital intensive businesses should be considered over a longer period of years rather than over one year.

Fortum's tax indicators and country-by-country taxation
In line with the 2017 guidelines of the Ownership Steering Department of the Finnish Prime Minister's Office for majority state-owned companies, Fortum has selected key indicators that reflect the nature of its business operations and the related tax. As Fortum's operations are capital-intensive and have a long lifetime,

the net assets has been selected as the best determinant of our value creation in each country. Our operations are not labour-intensive, nor is revenue the most relevant base for a value creation indicator. Therefore, for our operations, the table below presents assets used in operations along with taxes borne and taxes collected for the eleven of the most significant countries of operation. To ensure a good understanding of our value creation, we also present interest

bearing loan receivables, as financing is crucial for the success of our operations. We trust this is the best determinant of value creation for our operations.

Comments by country
Finland: Low electricity prices have resulted in low levels of profit and consequently in lower amounts of corporate income tax in 2017. Sweden: Income taxes increased in 2017 as a one-off mainly due to unfavorable decision from the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm in relation to year 2009­2012 (See Note 36 Legal actions and official proceedings). The level of property and production taxes are slightly reduced due to the Swedish parliament's decision to gradually reduce these taxes. Russia: Taxes on property were increased by tax rate changes. The tax depreciation on investments in new power and heat plants result in low corporate income taxes borne. The fact that

more income tax will be paid in the later years of an asset's life is recognised by booking a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet. Poland: Income taxes have increased due to the one time effect of the sale of the gas infrastructure company DUON Dystrybucja. Estonia: Undistributed corporate profits are tax exempt. The taxation of profits is postponed until the profits are distributed as dividends. Norway: At the beginning of August 2017, Fortum made the restructuring of ownership in Hafslund that increased our presence in the Norwegian heat and retail markets. Denmark: Taxes increased mainly by Fortum entering into the waste solution business during 2016.

The Netherlands: The Dutch financing operations were lossmaking in 2017 due to lower interest margins and a one-off realisation of financial risks in its loan portfolio. Ireland: Income is taxed at normal 12.5% tax rate. Belgium: The effective tax rate is lowered from the nominal rate due to so called notional interest deduction based on Belgium law. Luxembourg: Our activities in Luxembourg are minimal and are estimated to be closed within 2018.
The table above reflects the current challenging power and financial markets as well as the tax environment. The high total tax rates in Sweden and Finland reflect lower profits in those countries, driven by the current price of power and the significant amount of taxes that are not based on profits. We have organised the financing of our operations so that it also protects our capability to distribute

9

dividends. This simultaneously also protects the tax base in Finland.
Other payments to the public sector
In addition to taxes borne and taxes collected, we make other compulsory tax-like payments to the public sector, payments that are not compensation for goods or services received. For example, in 2017 we paid EUR 43 (2016: 38) million in employer's statutory pension contributions.
We are also a significant dividend payer. Fortum's Board of Directors proposes to the 2018 Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 977 (2017: 977) million be paid for 2017. The Finnish State's share of this would be about EUR 496 (496) million.
Ongoing tax appeals
Lack of clarity in tax legislation and changes in the interpretation of tax rules can result in a long delay between a transaction taking place and its tax treatment being agreed with the relevant tax authority.
Fortum had several tax audits ongoing during 2017. Based on these and earlier audits Fortum has received income tax assessments in Sweden for the years 2009­2015 and Belgium for the years 2008­2012.
Fortum has appealed all assessments received. Based on legal analyses, no provision has been accounted for in the financial statements related to Sweden 2013­2015 and Belgium 2008­2012 tax audits.
Fortum has received a positive decision from the Stockholm Administrative Court in June 2017 relating to hydro property tax in Sweden. According to the decision the property tax rate on hydro power (that is higher than the tax on other types of electricity production) comprises unlawful state aid (i.e. the tax law is against EU legislation) and the property tax shall be set to 0.5 percent of the tax assessment value. The disputed amount for the five years totalled EUR 52 million. The Swedish Tax Authority has appealed the decision and the case is pending before the Administrative Court of Appeal in Sweden. The decision is expected in 2018.
See Note 36 Legal actions and official proceedings for more information.

Information about companies registered in countries considered to be tax havens
The EU, the OECD and the Global Forum have established a list of countries considered to be tax havens. Fortum has a fully-owned captive insurance company in Guernsey, for insurance reasons; it also has a stake in Nature Elements Asia Renewable Energy and Cleantech Fund L.P., which makes research and development investments and is located in the Cayman Islands. Fortum's earnings from both companies were negative and are subject to normal taxation in Finland. The taxes borne on these operations were EUR null in 2017.

Fortum operates internationally and, therefore, our international financing operations are located in EU countries with stable operating environments and predictable taxation. We have financing and leasing companies in Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the recent tax management debate, the Netherlands and Ireland have also been mentioned as tax havens. We pay taxes in each of these countries of operation based on local rules and normal tax rates: the Netherlands 25%, Belgium 33.99% (29.58% from 2018) and Ireland 12.5%. Fortum's subsidiary companies are listed by country in the Note 40, Subsidiaries by segment, of the consolidated financial statement.

We have defined our most important sustainability focus areas in the areas of economic, social and environmental responsibility.
Our focus areas are based on Fortum's and our stakeholders' views of the significance of the impacts on the company and its ability to create value for its stakeholders and on the environment. Our understanding of stakeholder views is based on the results of the extensive stakeholder survey conducted annually as well as on information gained through other stakeholder collaboration.
In 2015, a total of 2,133 stakeholder representatives, more than 60% of them representing personnel, participated in our latest separate sustainability survey. In that sustainability survey, decision makers, organisations, employees and the general public

put special emphasis on the significance of security of supply of heat and electricity, management of sustainability-related risks, and sustainable ways of operating. Our personnel emphasised the safety of operations. The general public considered the use of renewable energy sources as important. Our goal is to conduct our separate sustainability survey again during 2018.
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee and safetyrelated targets are part of Fortum's short-term incentive scheme. In addition to the Group-level targets, divisions have their own targets. Fortum's Board of Directors annually decides on the
7

sustainability targets to be included in the incentive scheme. The injury frequency for Fortum employees and for contractors was included in the incentive scheme in 2017.
The 2018 incentive scheme remains unchanged in terms of safety targets (the injury frequency rate for personnel and contractors), but the Board can, if it wants, take into consideration in the result also other safety-related incidents and especially the number of severe occupational accidents. The target for severe occupational accidents is zero. The weight of the sustainability target in the incentive scheme is 10% (2017: 10%).

Successes and development needs:
· Our reputation is strong particularly among public administration, opinion makers, non-governmental organisations and Fortum's personnel.
· The target for customer satisfaction was achieved in all business areas, but not in retail electricity sales.
· We achieved our target in specific carbon dioxide emissions. In 2017, specific emissions from total energy production were 184 gCO2/kWh.
· By the end of 2017, we exceeded the Group energy efficiency target (>1,400 GWh/a) at the annual level by about 100 GWh.
· We strive to be a safe workplace for own and our contractors' employees. In 2017, one severe occupational accident occurred. There were no accidents leading to a fatality.
· Mergers and acquisitions implemented as part of our growth strategy weakened Fortum's occupational safety level that had been at a rather good level before. During 2018 we will focus on establishing Fortum's safety practices in our new operations.
· In 2017, the focus of our auditing was on solar module suppliers in particular. We conducted 11 supplier audits in six countries.

Our targets for 2018
Our sustainability targets are based on continuous operational improvement. We achieved our Group target for energy efficiency in 2017, and for that reason we raised the target by 500 GWh. Our new target for energy efficiency improvement is >1,900 GWh/a by 2020 compared to 2012.
We also renewed our occupational safety targets. At the Group level we are focusing on monitoring the number of severe occupational accidents and the combined own personnel and contractor Lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) per million working hours. The indicator is the same as in the short-term incentive scheme. The target level for the combined LWIF is on 2.1. The target is very challenging because the realised combined LWIF was 2.4. In terms of severe occupational accidents, we had a target of 0 accidents by 2020. However, in the 2018 target setting, Fortum's Board tightened the target to zero already by 2018.
As a new indicator in 2018 we will monitor the GAP index measuring how well the Group's EHS minimum requirements are realised at the power plant level. The target is that the minimum requirements will be realised in practice and that there will be no serious deviations detected in terms of their compliance (target level 3.0).

Governance and management

Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-driven and is based on the company's values, the Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Sustainability Policy and other policies and
their specifying instructions defined at the Group level. We comply with laws and regulations. All of our operations are guided by good governance, effective risk management, adequate controls and the internal audit principles supporting them.
Fortum's goal is a high level of environmental and safety management in all business activities. Calculated in terms of sales, 99.8% of Fortum's electricity and heat production operations at the end of 2017 were ISO 14001 certified and 98.4% were OHSAS 18001 certified. The level of certification slightly dropped due to acquisitions and investments. The divisions and sites develop their operations with internal and external audits required by environmental, occupational safety and quality management systems.
Responsibilities
Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy, so the highest decision-making authority in these issues is with the Board of Directors, which has joint responsibility in matters related to sustainability. For this reason, Fortum has not designated a Sustainability Committee for decision-making on economic, environmental and social issues. The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decisionmaking in these matters, when necessary.
The Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability approach and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual planning. The targets are ultimately approved by Fortum's Board of Directors. Fortum Executive Management monitors the achievement of the targets in its monthly meetings and in quarterly performance reviews. The achievement of the targets is regularly reported also to Fortum's Board of Directors.
Fortum's line management is responsible for the implementation of the Group's policies and instructions and for day-to-day sustainability management. Realisation of the safety targets is a part of Fortum's short-term incentive system. Fortum's Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordination and development of sustainability at the Group level and for maintaining an adequate situation awareness and oversight regarding sustainability.
Sustainability management by topic
Sustainability management in the areas of economic responsibility, environmental responsibility and social responsibility is described in more detail in Appendix 1. Additionally, more detailed information about the management of different aspects and impacts is presented by topic in this Sustainability Report.

Policies and commitments
Fortum is a participant of the UN Global Compact initiative and the UN Caring for Climate initiative. We support and respect the international initiatives and commitments, and national and international guidelines listed in the table, and they guide our operations in the areas of economic, environmental and social responsibility.
Fortum's EHS minimum requirements were updated in 2017. We focused particularly on updating contractor management practices to improve contractor safety.

Business ethics and compliance

We believe there is a clear connection between high standards of ethical business practices and excellent financial results. As an industry leader, we obey the law, we embrace the spirit of integrity, and we uphold ethical business conduct wherever we operate.
Code of Conduct sets the basic requirements
The Fortum Code of Conduct and Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct define how we treat others, engage in business, safeguard our corporate assets, and how we expect our suppliers and business partners to operate.
Fortum's Board of Directors is responsible for the company's mission and values and has approved the Fortum Code of Conduct. The online training on the Code of Conduct is part of the induction programme for new employees. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and has been approved by the Head of Procurement in collaboration with the purchasing steering group.
About 95% of Fortum's total purchasing volume, excluding purchases by DUON, is purchased from suppliers with a purchasing volume of EUR 50,000 or more. Geographically they target mainly suppliers in Russia, Finland, Sweden and Poland. The Supplier Code of Conduct is part of purchase agreements with a contract value of EUR 50,000 or more.
In line with the Code of Conduct, Fortum has zero tolerance for corruption and fraud and does not award donations to political parties or political activities, religious organisations, authorities, municipalities or local administrations.
Compliance risks
The compliance risks related to our business operations include the potential risk of bribery or corruption, fraud and embezzlement, non-compliance with legislation or company rules, conflicts of interest, improper use of company assets, and working under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Compliance risk management is an integrated part of business operations, and key compliance

risks, including action plans, are identified, assessed and reported annually. This applies also to the management of risks related to sustainability.
Training
Fortum has a Total Compliance programme covering key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics. It is managed with a risk-based prioritisation.
Training is a fundamental part of the Total Compliance programme. In 2017, training was provided to employees working in the Recycling and Waste Solutions business area in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. Training for employees of Fortum Oslo Varme and Hafslund Markets also was started. Fortum's Code of Conduct booklet was updated due to the brand renewal, and all Fortum employees received the booklet electronically.
Training on the Market Abuse Regulation and insider regulations was provided for those management teams that had not received the training earlier. Targeted training on internal controls and focusing on the process-level improvement of controls was also arranged for selected management teams and experts. Training on competition law issues was provided for the functions responsible for sales and for the selected individuals joining Fortum through acquisitions. Additionally, Anti-Money Laundering training for key stakeholders was arranged.
The supplier qualification process was renewed in 2016 and the majority of the personnel received training back then. Training events held in 2017 targeted Fortum's personnel in the Baltic countries and Poland, as well as Recycling and Waste Solutions personnel in Finland, Sweden and Denmark.
Reporting misconduct
In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum has an external "Raise a concern" channel. The same mechanism is used for
reporting any suspected misconduct relating to the environment, labour practices or human rights violations, and it is available to all

stakeholders. In Russia, Fortum has a separate compliance organisation in place and employees there are encouraged to use the channels provided by the compliance organisation. They may, however, also use the "Raise a concern" channel should they so wish.
Suspected misconduct and measures related to ethical business practices and compliance with regulations are regularly reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Suspected cases of misconduct
A total of 178 reports of suspected misconduct were made in 2017. By year-end, 167 cases had been closed. About one third of the investigated cases were related to non-compliance with laws and regulations or with company rules, which constituted the majority of the cases. In these cases, corrective action was taken by reviewing and developing existing processes and instructions and by providing training for employees.
Fortum has zero tolerance towards alcohol and drug use. About 40% of the cases were related to alcohol abuse by either Fortum's or contractors' employees during working hours. As a result of the investigations, five employment contracts were terminated either by immediate dismissal or by mutual agreement, and 12 written warnings were given. There were 14 cases of misconduct reported to the police. There was no cause for action to be taken in 18 of the cases investigated.
No cases of suspected corruption or bribery related to Fortum's operations were reported in 2017.
Fortum also requires its goods and service suppliers as well as its business partners to comply with a zero tolerance policy towards corruption and bribery. As part of supply chain management, we requested a report from the goods and service suppliers we had knowledge of possible cases of misconduct. We requested the reports to include information about e.g. the corrective measures taken related to the supplier's own operations. The reports

were considered sufficient and didn't lead to the termination of a contract.
We deal with potential cases of corruption in a professional manner, in accordance with the defined compliance investigation process, in line with applicable laws and with respect to the rights and personal integrity of all parties involved.
Restricting competition
There were three ongoing investigation cases in Russia in 2017. Two of these cases had been initiated in the previous year. During the year Fortum was not subject to any significant monetary fines for competition law violations.
Other significant fines
In Norway, Fortum Oslo Varme was ordered to pay a fine of NOK 150,000 (EUR 16,043) for a district heating pipe leakage that caused burns to a third party. In Denmark, Fortum Waste Solutions OW A/S was ordered to pay a fine of DKK 60,000 (EUR 8,066) for a work-related accident that took place in 2016. The handling of another work-related accident originating in 2015 in Fortum Waste Solutions OW A/S was on-going.

Stakeholders

Our way of operating responsibly includes continuously identifying the views of our stakeholders and finding a balance between the different expectations our stakeholders have. Dialogue, feedback and good collaboration are the key ways to promote a mutual understanding with our stakeholders.
Stakeholder collaboration
Collaboration with different stakeholder groups helps Fortum to assess and meet the expectations that stakeholder groups have towards the company. We engage in an active dialogue with the different stakeholders associated with our operations. We conduct annual stakeholder surveys. We monitor and assess the public dialogue in the countries where we operate, and we have increased the dialogue with our stakeholders also through social media channels. Feedback from customers drives the development of our products and services. Additionally, our activities in national and international organisations help to deepen our understanding of global sustainability issues and their connections to our business.
Management of stakeholder collaboration at Fortum is assigned particularly to communications, public affairs, group sustainability, the functions responsible for electricity and heat sales and energy production, as well as many of our experts. Responsibilities for managing stakeholder collaboration are primarily determined by stakeholder group or interaction theme. Key interaction areas, e.g. public affairs, and corporate communications, have annual plans that guide the activities.
Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's key stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims to increase the dialogue and the exchange of views between the company and its stakeholders.

Information through surveys
In collaboration with third parties, we annually conduct surveys regarding stakeholder collaboration.
The aim of these surveys is to help Fortum assess and respond to the important stakeholder groups' expectations of the company. The surveys also measure the success of our stakeholder collaboration. Additionally, the surveys provide information about emerging sustainability trends and risks we should acknowledge. We use the survey results in business planning and development and in identifying material aspects in corporate responsibility.
The One Fortum survey and its results in terms of customer satisfaction and reputation are presented in the section
Customer satisfaction and reputation. As part of the One Fortum survey, we regularly survey what our stakeholders consider to be the
most important areas of sustainability.

Fortum's bid for Uniper raised stakeholder interest
Fortum announced a voluntary public takeover offer for all shares in Uniper towards the end of 2017. By investing in Uniper, Fortum continues the capital redeployment to enable a more efficient use of its balance sheet and delivers on its strategic goal to drive productivity and industry transformation in Europe. The offer period commenced in November and in early January E.ON tendered its 46.65% shareholding to Fortum. At the end of the acceptance period in early February 2018 altogether 47.12% of Uniper's shares were tendered to Fortum. The offer is still subject to competition and regulatory approvals. Fortum expects to finalise the transaction in mid-2018.
Fortum's bid for Uniper is one of the biggest in the history of Finnish economy and it has gained a lot of attention both nationally and internationally. Also many stakeholders such as SRI investors and non-governmental organisations have contacted Fortum to discuss the bid. The main concern raised by the various stakeholders has been the strategic fit of Uniper's fossil-based production with Fortum low-carbon assets and, consequently, the potential increase of Fortum's carbon footprint. Our anticipated role as Uniper's biggest shareholder has also been connected with the discussions around the Nord Stream 2.
A powerful combination to drive the European energy transition
Together Fortum and Uniper have the strategic mix of assets ­ both clean and secure ­ as well as the expertise required to successfully and affordably drive Europe's transition towards a low carbon energy system. Fortum's power production is divided roughly in three equal parts consisting of hydropower and other renewables, nuclear power and gas-fired production. Also Uniper is much more than a coal company. Approximately 70% of the company's power generation is based on low-carbon gas-fired generation and CO2 free hydro and nuclear power. The share of the company's CO2 free production is about 20%. Fortum's investment in Uniper does not increase the total CO2 emissions in Europe.
Conventional energy production continues to play an important role in ensuring affordable and secure supply of energy during

the transition. Furthermore, gas-fired generation, in particular, can respond to the increasing intermittent renewable production, providing the flexibility needed in geographies where sufficient hydropower resources are not available. Fortum expects its investment in Uniper to deliver an attractive return that will further support us in accelerating the development and implementation of sustainable energy technologies.
Fortum continues to be fully committed to its strategy and sustainability targets ­ this has not changed. Fortum's carbon exposure (gCO2/kWh) is already one of the lowest within the European power generation industry and we have a proven track-record on driving transition to a low-CO2 direction. This is something that we consider our core competence and competitive advantage.
Towards a low carbon energy system with efficient policies
Fortum is of the opinion that phasing out coal-fired generation to mitigate climate change is absolutely necessary, but it must be executed in a controlled and affordable manner. It is the role of political decision makers to agree on the conditions and set up the frameworks that make this transition possible. Fortum respects these decisions, but argues that decision-makers should provide a level playing field for companies operating in the integrating European energy market.
Over the year, several European countries have been discussing specific measures to forbid the use of coal in energy production to advance the transition. However, in Fortum's opinion, the best tool to phase out coal is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). If allowed to work properly, the ETS will drive emissions down in an economically efficient manner as it is neutral to the technology and location. Should individual member states, nevertheless, decide to issue a coal ban, it is important that the decision-makers do respective changes in the ETS, so that their action lead to true emission reduction and not shift emissions from one country or sector to another.

Ensuring a responsible supply chain for coal Fortum also acknowledges that not only the use of coal, but also the origin of coal is a source of concern to some stakeholders. Fortum can only comment its own supply chain. However, both Fortum and Uniper are members of the Bettercoal initiative, which drives for sustainable coal supply chain. Bettercoal companies are committed to use Bettercoal tools in their coal purchasing. The Bettercoal Code sets out the ethical, social and environmental principles and provisions that members of Bettercoal expect organizations producing coal in their supply chain to align with. What comes to Fortum's power plants, the coal Fortum uses in Finland and Sweden originates from Russia. The coal used in Poland originates mainly from Poland. Fortum's power plants in Russia use coal originating from Russia and Kazakhstan.

Case | NGO cooperation in India

In December 2017 the 100-MW Pavagada solar plant was connected to the grid in India. Thousands of migrant workers from diverse backgrounds around the country, with different religions, cultures, ethnicities, language, food habits and social rituals were involved in the construction phase.
Parivartan, a grassroots-level NGO was brought in to help Fortum to draw synergy from this diversity and to ensure functionality between the workers. The Parivartan team members became a part of the community. They shared the same living conditions at the workers' housing accommodations throughout the construction period. They started with small steps by first encouraging the workers to use good hygiene practices and gradually stepped up their efforts by sharing their knowledge about worker's rights, the value of safety, respect for women workers, and how to use and share all the wellbeing facilities provided by the company.
Parivartan employed many ingenious ways of communicating. They organized Saturday movies, and when the house was full they would take a break and talk about one of the topics. Separate events were also organised for female workers to discuss topics important to them. Parivartan trained workers to volunteer as, for example, hygiene inspectors, safety stewards and day care attendants for children. All aligned behaviours were rewarded. Parivartan also brought fun and games to their pitch and communicated thrugh street dramas. This approach ensured better recall and implementation of good practices at the workplace and better personal and group wellbeing.
The results were impressive: the rate of absenteeism dropped, safety compliance increased, and the use of alcohol or other misconduct became nonexistent.
Fortum's activities have also been appreciated by the governmental health officials. Our well maintained housing accommodations and the high standards achieved in preventing diseases common in the area have been showcased as a benchmark for other solar developers.

Economic impacts

Fortum is a significant economic actor in Finland, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Norway and the Baltic countries. We continuously monitor the impact and wellbeing generated by our operations to our stakeholders. The key stakeholders include lenders and shareholders, customers, personnel, suppliers of goods and services, and the public sector.
The most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum's operations come from revenue from customers, procurements of goods and services from suppliers, compensation to lenders, dividends to shareholders, growth and maintenance investments, employee wages and salaries, and taxes paid.
Our operations also have indirect economic impacts. The Finnish State owns 50.8% of Fortum's shares, and we contribute to a functioning society by, among other things, paying taxes and dividends. These secure society's basic functions and build wellbeing. Investments and the procurement of goods and services provide employment both locally and outside our operating areas. New investment proposals are assessed against sustainability criteria. In terms of suppliers of goods and services, we also assess the global impacts, paying particular attention to suppliers of goods and services operating in risk countries. The wages and taxes paid have a positive impact on local communities.

Customer satisfaction and reputation

For Fortum, customer satisfaction and reputation are a top priority in implementing the company's strategy and in growing the business. We have set Group-wide targets for customer satisfaction and for our reputation.
Customer in the centre
The Group-wide Customer in the centre development programme, which was launched in 2015 with the aim of promoting a customercentric culture in our company, continued in 2017. One of our five must-win battle (MWB) development programmes is "Put the customer in the centre". The programme contains specific projects to improve the customer experience and our offering, e.g., by utilising the opportunities brought by digitalisation. As an expanding company, it is also important to ensure that our new customers are satisfied with our services. In 2017 we expanded in Norway, where Fortum acquired 100% of Hafslund's Markets business area, which consists of several electricity retail brands. In conjunction with that, Fortum gained 1.1 million new customers, increasing our Nordic customer base to 2.5 million.
One Fortum survey provides information about all stakeholder groups
We use the extensive One Fortum survey to annually measure customer satisfaction and our reputation and the factors that impact them. The survey is conducted yearly in spring and it covers customers, decision makers, capital markets, non-governmental organisations and opinion influencers as well as Fortum's personnel. In Finland and Sweden, we also survey the views of the general public and media. During autumn we also conduct a followup survey among our electricity sales customers.
We conducted the One Fortum survey in 2017 in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, the Baltic countries, Russia and India. Over 4,600 customers and nearly 3,100 other stakeholders were interviewed. We also monitor other publicly available research

sources, but up to year-end 2017 we have defined Group targets and our identified development areas on the basis of the One Fortum survey results. As of 2018 we will use multiple monitoring data to best accommodate the multiple electricity retail brands Fortum now owns after the Hafslund acquisition.
Customer satisfaction
In the annual One Fortum Survey in spring, our district heating customers' satisfaction remained overall fairly unchanged and in most countries on a good level. Among our retail electricity sales customers, the satisfaction decreased somewhat in Norway and in Poland, whereas in Finland and Sweden the results were stable. Our Power Solutions customers ranked us a bit lower this year compared to last year, but the satisfaction is still on a very good level. The Recycling and Waste Solutions unit was not part of the One Fortum survey in spring 2017. In the autumn 2017 One Fortum follow-up survey, the results were stable among the electricity retail customers in Finland and Norway compared to autumn 2016, while in Sweden we improved a bit. We saw a slight decrease in the satisfaction in Poland.
In the autumn 2017 measurement we also included new Fortum units in the survey scope. Several of the acquired Hafslund Markets brands were measured as well as our Recycling and Waste Solutions unit, which had the highest customer satisfaction level of all measured Fortum units in the One Fortum Survey.
Our Group-level target for all business areas in 2017 was to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of "good", i.e. 70­74 on a scale 0­100, in the One Fortum survey. The target was achieved among all business areas, but not in retail electricity sales.

Reputation
Our reputation is strongest amongst opinion influencers and non-governmental organisations, followed by decision makers and our own personnel. The biggest change compared to the previous year was among capital markets, where the result recovered significantly from the drop in the previous year. Our reputation continues to be weakest among the general public. Based on the survey results, we should continue our efforts to improve social responsibility and customer centricity and to maintain our good operational expertise.
The Group-level target for our reputation in 2017 was a rating of 70.7 in the One Fortum survey, measured as the average rating given by all stakeholders included in the One Fortum Survey, apart from customers. Rankings given by customers are not included in the reputation index calculation because we treat customer satisfaction as a separate entity. In 2017, we achieved an average rating of 72.3 among these stakeholder groups. The target set for 2018 (73.0) includes the same stakeholder groups as in 2017.
Brand
We also monitor brand development, i.e. what impression the general public has about our brand. The survey includes the measurement of, e.g., brand awareness, preference and brand attributes.

Supply chain management

Fortum is a significant purchaser of goods and services. We actively strive to reduce the environmental impacts caused by our operations and to improve economic and social wellbeing. We also manage risks related to our supply chain. The aim is that open and efficient collaboration creates value for both parties.
Electricity purchases increased significantly
Fortum's purchasing volume in 2017 was EUR 3.2 (2016: 2.5) billion. Electricity purchased from the Nordic wholesale electricity market for retail sales, investments, and fuel purchases accounted for the majority of Fortum's purchases. The number of electricity customers increased with the acquisition of Hafslund, which also increased electricity purchases from the wholesale markets by 40% compared to 2016.
Of our purchases, EUR 657 (2016: 599) million targeted various investments. The biggest investments, EUR 173 million, were made in Finland. A large share of the investments is contracted out in full with materials, installation and other service as well as contractor work included in the total purchase.
Fortum's fuel purchases in 2017 totalled EUR 564 (2016: 524) million. We purchase fuels from international and local suppliers. Our fossil fuel purchases totalled about EUR 498 (2016: 448) million, biomass fuels about EUR 48 (2016: 44) million, and nuclear fuel about EUR 35 (2016: 38) million.
The rest of our purchases, EUR 2.0 (2016: 1.4) billion, consist of other goods and services. The figure includes electricity purchased from the Nordic wholesale electricity market for retail sales. The other goods and services purchases were related to, for example, operation and maintenance as well as to other functions, such as IT solutions, marketing and travel.

Purchases, EUR million

Investments, 657 Fuels, 564 Other purchases, 2,001

Half of purchases from Europe
Half, i.e. 50%, of the purchasing volume was purchased from suppliers operating in Europe, mostly in Finland, Sweden and Poland. This does not include electricity purchases from the Nordic wholesale market. 47% of Fortum's purchases were from risk countries. The majority of these purchases were from Russia.
Violations related to work conditions and human rights are more likely in risk countries than in non-risk countries. Fortum's risk-country classification is based on the ILO's Decent Work Agenda, the UN's Human Development index and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions index.
In 2017, we had about 16,000 (2016: 15,000) suppliers of goods and services. About 1,500 of the suppliers were in risk countries. Excluding the Russia Division's local suppliers, there were about 260 suppliers in risk countries.

Sustainable fuel purchasing
The most significant environmental impacts of our supply chain are related mainly to fuels, particularly to coal and biomasses. There are significant environmental aspects associated with open-pit coal mining, including natural resource efficiency, emissions to air, water and soil, and impacts on biodiversity. Significant occupational health and safety risks can be related to working in underground mines. The sustainability aspects of biomass sourcing are related primarily to biodiversity, but risks particularly outside the EU can also include, for instance, illegal logging or human rights violations.
In fuel purchasing, special attention is paid to the origin of the fuel and to responsible production. In 2017 we had about 150 suppliers in our fuel supply chain, 6% of them operated in risk countries.

Natural gas The natural gas used in Russia, the Baltic countries and Finland originated from several different suppliers in Russia. The natural gas used in Poland originated from Poland and the natural gas used in Norway originated from Norway.
Coal The coal used in Finland originated from Russia. The coal used in Poland originated mainly from Poland. The power plants in Russia used coal originating from Russia and Kazakhstan.
Fortum is a member of the Bettercoal initiative, and uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain.
Biomass The biomass we used consisted mainly of forest residue chips, chips from roundwood and industrial wood residues that originated from Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries, Norway and Poland. About 57% of the wood-based biofuel used by Fortum in 2017 originated from certified sources. The share was over 70% in Finland.
Our goal is that 80% of the wood-based biomass fuel we use is certified by a third party by the end of 2020. We also aim to apply for

The bio-oil plant integrated with Fortum's Joensuu power plant has a sustainability system approved by The Finnish Energy Authority. The system is used to prove compliance with nationally legislated sustainability criteria for bio-oil.
Uranium The fuel assemblies used at the Loviisa power plant in Finland are completely of Russian origin. The fuel supplier acquires the uranium used in the fuel assemblies from Russian mines in accordance with Fortum's agreement. In 2017, the uranium originated from the Krasnokamensk, Khiagda and Dalur mines.
Both ARMZ Uranium Holding Co., a uranium producer, and TVEL, which is responsible for refining and manufacturing uranium, have environmental and occupational safety systems in place in all their plants. All three uranium mines have ISO 14001 environmental certification. The Khiagda mine has also an OHSAS 18001 certified occupational health and safety management system. The zirconium material manufacturing plant and the plant responsible for manufacturing uranium oxide pellets and fuel assemblies have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification and OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety management system certification.
We regularly assess the quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management systems of our nuclear fuel suppliers and the manufacturing of nuclear fuel assemblies. In summer 2017, Fortum's representatives assessed the operations of Fortum's Russian fuel supplier's uranium mine. The plant was in good condition technically, and its quality and environmental management systems were certified.

Sustainable supply chain
We expect our business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct. Fortum's key tools in supply chain management are country and counterparty risk assessments, supplier qualification and supplier audits.
Codes of conduct cover basic requirements
The Fortum Code of Conduct forms the foundation for ethical business conduct and defines how we treat others, engage in business, and safeguard our corporate assets.
The Supplier Code of Conduct includes the sustainability requirements for suppliers of services and goods. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact initiative and is divided into four sections: anticorruption, human rights, labour standards, and the environment. The country and counterparty risk assessment follows the same structure.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is used in all our countries of operation and is included in all purchase agreements with a contract value of EUR 50,000 or more. Training related to the Supplier Code of Conduct were arranged in 2017 for Fortum's Baltic functions and for the Recycling and Waste Solutions personnel in Finland and Sweden.

Supplier qualification
We assess the level of operations of our business partners through supplier qualification and supplier audits. The supplier qualification is made when the purchase volume is EUR 50,000 or more. In the qualification process, suppliers respond to a survey that we use to help determine, among other things, the supplier's possible operations in risk countries, certified management systems, and the occupational safety level of the contractors. We pay special attention also to anti-corruption practices.
If potential risks in the supplier's operations are identified through the questionnaire, a more extensive self-assessment questionnaire may be sent or a supplier audit is conducted. The extensive self-assessment questionnaire is always sent to fuel suppliers and the suppliers of Fortum India.
The supplier qualification process was renewed in 2016, and the majority of the personnel received training in the new practices. Training events were held in 2017 for Fortum's personnel in the Baltic countries and Poland, and Recycling and Waste Solutions personnel in Finland, Sweden and Denmark.
The Russia Division uses its own supplier qualification process that is based on Russian procurement law. In the Russian operations, we set supplier requirements for business principles, ethics, environmental management, and occupational health and safety practices.

Supplier audits support assessments
In supplier audits, we assess the supplier's compliance with the requirements in Fortum's Supplier Code of Conduct. Audits are always done on-site, and they include production inspections, employee interviews, and reviews of documents. If noncompliances are found, the supplier makes a plan for corrective actions and we monitor the implementation of them.
Fortum uses an international service provider for conducting audits, especially in risk countries. In Fortum's own operating countries, the audits are performed mainly by own personnel.
In 2017, we conducted a total of 11 (2016: 13) supplier audits for a total of ten suppliers in China, India, Russia, Slovenia, Estonia and Finland.
Most of the non-compliances identified in the audits in 2017 were related to occupational safety, overtime hours and remuneration. The audits conducted did not reveal noncompliances related to freedom of association, discrimination, or child or forced labour, but we issued a recommendation to two Chinese suppliers to strengthen their practices to prevent the potential use of child labour.
Fortum uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain. Bettercoal audits are always conducted by a third, accredited party. The Bettercoal Assessment Programme was renewed in 2017. In the renewed programme, coal suppliers commit already in the initial phase to the Bettercoal Assessment by signing a Letter of Commitment. In 2017, one of Fortum's Russian coal suppliers and one Kazakhstan coal supplier signed the Letter of Commitment. One of Fortum's Russian coal suppliers was audited in February 2018. Additionally, two of Fortum's coal suppliers have been audited in previous years.

Environmental impacts
Some of the environmental impacts of energy production are global or wide-reaching, some are regional or local. In terms of Fortum's operations, the key environmental aspects include: · Climate change · Use of renewable energy sources · Circular economy · Flue-gas emissions · Hydropower's environmental impacts and biodiversity · Fuel procurement
We manage our environmental impacts with environmental management systems. 99.8% of our electricity and heat production is ISO 14001 certified.
Climate change mitigation
We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by increasing carbon dioxide-free energy production and the use of renewable energy sources, and improving energy efficiency of production. 61% of the total electricity we produced in 2017 was carbon dioxide-free. We made several investments and investment decisions that will significantly grow our wind and solar power production in the years ahead.
Circular economy boosts resource efficiency
We recycle significant amounts of waste and energy production by-products generated in our operations. Additionally, our circular economy services separate from municipal waste streams substances that can be utilised as materials and for energy production.
The continuous improvement of resource and energy efficiency is important in terms of the sufficiency of natural resources and climate change mitigation. In improving the energy efficiency of our own production, we have gained expertise that we have put to use in providing energy-efficiency services to other energy companies.

Advanced combustion technology
Fuel use generates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particle emissions that degrade air quality and cause acidification of soil and water systems. These emissions can be effectively reduced with various flue-gas cleaning technologies. Special expertise in combustion technology is one of Fortum's strengths, and we have supplied our own power plants and many other energy companies with combustion technology solutions to reduce nitrogen oxides.

Mitigation of hydropower's environmental impacts
Damming rivers and regulating water systems change the natural water levels and discharges and cause changes in aquatic habitats. We actively take part in research activities in the sector and implement voluntary and permit-based measures to develop the biodiversity, fish populations and the multi-use of water systems where we produce hydro power.

Sustainable energy production

Our energy production is based primarily on carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power and on energy-efficient combined heat and power production. In line with our strategy, we are targeting a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio.
Fortum's power generation in 2017 was 73.2 (2016: 73.1) TWh and heat production 28.6 (2016: 27.8) TWh. 61% (2016: 62%) of our power generation was carbon dioxide-free and 30% (2016: 30%) was produced from renewable energy sources. About 9% (2016: 7%) of our heat production was produced from renewable, carbon-free energy sources.
Power generation and heat production by energy source are presented in the accompanying tables. The figures include also figures from Fortums share in associated companies and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners on cost basis.
More renewable energy
We commissioned two new solar power plants in India in 2017, in addition to the previous 15-MW solar power capacity. The new solar power plants are the 70-MW Bhadla solar power plant and the 100-MW Pavagada solar power plant. At the end of 2017, we acquired the 10-MW Pleshanovskaya and 10-MW Grachevskaya solar power plants, and the 15-MW Bugulchanskaya solar power plant in Russia.
Fortum has actively invested also in wind power. At the beginning of 2017, we acquired Nygårdsfjellet's 32-MW wind power park and the licensed Ånstadblåheia (about 50 MW) and Sørfjord (about 90 MW) wind power projects in Norway. Additionally, there were under construction the 35-MW Ulyanovsk wind power park in Russia, and in Sweden the Solberg 75-MW wind power park, of which Fortums share of ownership is 50%. Ulyanovsk, Solberg and Ånstadblåheia wind power parks are estimated to start production in 2018.
In 2017, Fortum and RUSNANO established a 50/50-owned wind investment fund that was awarded the right to build 1,000 MW of wind power in Russia in 2018­2022 in the RES capacity selection auction. The wind investment fund made a decision on

construction of the first 50-MW wind farm in Russia. The wind farm is expected to start production in 2019.
In 2017, the refurbishments of Fortums own hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland introduced 8 MW of new, renewable electricity production capacity.
New, energy-efficient production capacity
Replacement of a high-pressure turbine was carried out at the Loviisa nuclear power plant's unit 1 during the annual outage. This replacement increased the plant unit's nominal output by 5 MW.
In Russia, the third new CHP unit at the Chelyabinsk GRES power plant was completed at the end of 2017. The plant is fuelled by natural gas, and its electricity production capacity is 248 MW and heat production capacity 174 MW. The first power plant unit of the same size was completed in late 2015 and the second in spring 2016.
Construction of the new CHP plant in Zabrze, Poland, continued; the plant is scheduled for completion in 2018. The power plant has a maximum production capacity of 75 MW electricity and 145 MW heat, and the plant replaces the old coal-fired plants units in Zabrze and Bytom. The plant is primarily fuelled by refusederived fuel (RDF) and coal. The Russia and Poland investments improve the efficiency of energy production and reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions into the environment in relation to produced energy.
Energy production from waste and biomass fuels
In early August 2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of its ownership in Hafslund together with the City of Oslo. In the arrangement, Hafslund's district heat business operations and the City of Oslo's waste-to-energy company Klemetsrudanlegget AS (KEA) were combined into one company, and Fortum acquired 50% of the combined company. Fortum has operational responsibility for the joint venture.
The total heat production capacity of Fortum Oslo Varme is 1,111 MW. The Klemetsrud waste-to-energy plant incinerates
30

mainly municipal waste, and the plant's production capacity is 148 MW heat and 19 MW electricity. Haraldrud's heat power plant has a 56-MW bioboiler, a 30-MW waste boiler, a 25-MW electricity boiler and two 50-MW gas boilers. In addition to the Haraldrud heat plant, there are nine other heat plants in the Oslo region.

Case | Society's Commitment: Carbon-free district heating in Espoo by 2030

The City of Espoo and Fortum made a commitment in 2017 to make Espoo's district heating system carbon-free and CO-neutral by 2030. Our joint pledge to Society's Commitment to Sustainable Development has been published on the Finnish National Commission on Sustainable Development's commitment2050.fi website. We are also participating in the national implementation of the global Agenda2030 for Sustainable Development.
The goal will be achieved by, among other things, developing and investing in new energy production solutions that aim to utilise waste heat flows, biomass and recycled fuels, as well as geothermal energy when possible. Additionally, we are developing new solutions and services for customers and thereby enabling sustainable, efficient and smart energy use. In city planning, extensive energy analyses at the master and town planning level are being compiled and energyplanning expertise is being utilised to meet climate targets. Land-use planning supports low-emission lifestyles.
Over the past four years, heat production in Espoo has already integrated a heat pump plant in Suomenoja utilising heat from treated wastewater, a conversion to wood pellets at the Kivenlahti heat plant, the combustion of bio-oil at the Vermo heat plant, and a thermal energy storage in Suomenoja. Additionally, we have implemented various waste heat projects, like heat recovery at Ericsson's data centre in Kirkkonummi and heat recovery at the Espoo Hospital. In just a short period of time, these measures have increased the share of waste heat and biomass fuels in heat production from close to zero to more than 25%.
In 2017, we advanced the realisation of the new Kivenlahti biomass fuelled heat plant by submitting an environmental permit application. Our goal is to start construction of the new heat plant during 2018. Additionally, we have advanced other new plant investments that will make it possible to stop using coal in Espoo's district heat production in the 2020s.
We made significant investments in 2016­2017 to expand the district cooling system in the southern region of Espoo. Based on CO-free and environmentally friendly free cooling, the expanded district cooling system will be fully deployed in 2018. In the district cooling system the thermal energy generated in the cooling of buildings is recycled back into the district heating network.

Climate change mitigation

Our vision ­ For a cleaner world ­ defines our ambition to move towards a low-emission energy system and optimal resource efficiency. Our main tools in climate change mitigation are increasing renewable energy production, improving energy efficiency and providing smart energy solutions for our customers.
Risks and opportunities associated with climate change
We believe that our know-how in carbon dioxide-free hydro, nuclear, wind and solar energy and in energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) production is a competitive advantage. We expect the concern about climate change to increase the demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient energy products and solutions. Our developing circular economy services also meet this demand, as the use of non-recyclable and non-recoverable waste in energy production replaces fossil fuel and reduces the formation of greenhouse gases generated from biodegradable waste at landfills.
Our operations are exposed to physical risks caused by climate change, including changes in weather patterns that could alter energy demand and energy production volumes. Higher precipitation, flooding and extreme temperatures may affect, for instance, hydropower production, dam safety, and bioenergy supply and availability. Hydrological conditions and temperature also affect the short-term electricity price in the Nordic power market.
Potential strategic risks are related to regulation and to the future energy and climate policy, which impacts decision making on, for example, the technology used at production plants and the fuel selections, such as the use of biomass fuels. In addition to climate change mitigation, we also aim to adapt our operations to the changing climate, and we take climate change into consideration in, among other things, production planning and the assessment of growth projects.

Towards low-emissions production
In Europe, we produce carbon dioxide-free electricity with hydro, nuclear and wind power and at CHP plants that utilise biomass and waste-derived fuels. In the EU area, 96% (2016: 96%) of our electricity production was carbon-free in 2017. The rest of the electricity was produced mainly with coal. We produce solar power in India.
Our electricity production in Russia is based on fossil fuels, mainly on natural gas. Our new plant units in Russia are based on gas turbine technology, which represents the best available technology in natural gas combustion. 61% (2016: 62%) of our total electricity production was carbon dioxide-free.
The following investments and projects, among others, directly or indirectly reducing carbon dioxide emissions were completed in 2017: · Bhadla and Pavagada solar power plants in India · District heating and district cooling construction project in
Tartu, Estonia · Heat recovery at a data centre to Espoo district heating network
in Finland · Replacement of the high-pressure turbine in unit 1 at the Loviisa
nuclear power plant in Finland · Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland We have estimated that these projects will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 162,000 tonnes.
Projects under construction and decisions on new investments are described in more detail in the
Sustainable energy production section.

The Tartu district heating and district cooling system expansion project wins the Global District Energy Climate Award 2017.

Innovative fuels
Fortum HorsePower is a service concept in which Fortum delivers bedding to horse stables and picks up the bedding-manure mixture for combustion. In 2017, bedding-manure mixture was collected from more than 200 horse stables in Finland. Fortum combusts the bedding-manure mixture at the Järvenpää CHP plant, and it was delivered also to other energy companies. The service was rolled out also in Sweden in 2017.
The Joensuu bio-oil plant produced about 11,200 tonnes of bio-oil, the majority of which was used at a heat plant in the Joensuu power plant area and at the Vermo heat plant in Espoo, Finland.
Emissions trading
Over 79% of carbon dioxide emissions from our energy production in the Nordic countries, the Baltic countries and Poland are within the sphere of the EU's emissions trading scheme. We had a total of 50 (2016: 45) plants in six member countries within the EU's emissions trading scheme in 2017. Fortum was granted free emission allowances corresponding to 1.0 (2016: 1.0) million tonnes. Our carbon dioxide emissions within the EU's emissions trading scheme were 2.3 (2016: 2.7) million tonnes. In terms of the emissions allowances, we had a deficit and had to purchase the shortfall of emissions allowances from the markets.
Fortum's view is that emissions trading is the most cost-efficient way to achieve emissions targets. In late 2017, a consensus was reached between the Commission and the Parliament regarding the revision of the EU's emissions trading directive for 2021­2030; national adoption of it will start in member states in 2018. Fortum expects the revision to make emissions trading more efficient and to strengthen its steering effect. We are of the opinion that the proposed EU governance model should eliminate national and EUlevel policy measures that overlap with emissions trading.
We also want to promote the establishment of a global carbon pricing and carbon market. Fortum has signed the Carbon Price Communiqué, an international business statement for setting a price on carbon emissions. We also participate in several international business initiatives promoting the role of business in

climate change mitigation. These include the UN Global Compact's Caring for Climate initiative and the World Bank's Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition initiative. In Finland, Fortum is a member of the Climate Leadership Council.
Carbon funds
Fortum is a participant in the international Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) climate fund. In 2017, we received a total of about 12,000 CER emission reduction units from this fund. So far, we have received a total of 2,760,000 emission reduction units, and we estimate that we will still receive about 120,000 units during the PCF's operating period.
FORTUM'S POSITION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EU CLIMATE POLICY
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 totalled 23.3 (2016: 23.6) million tonnes. Scope 1 emissions were 18.4 million tonnes, Scope 2 emissions 0.1 million tonnes, and Scope 3 emissions 4.8 million tonnes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported on a pro forma basis and the figures of the comparison years have not been adjusted because of partially insufficient data. The effect of the Hafslund business acquisition is estimated to be less than 2% of our greenhouse gas emissions.
Direct greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 1
The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are generated from the use of fossil fuels in electricity and heat production. A small amount of emissions is generated from the use of company vehicles and leaks related to the natural gas distribution. Our direct greenhouse gas emissions were 18.4 (2016: 18.8) million CO2-equivalent tonnes. The share of carbon dioxide from our direct greenhouse gas emissions was 99%. The share of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from our total greenhouse gas emissions was 79%.

Of the direct carbon dioxide emissions, 84% (2016: 83%) originated from the Russian operations and 9% (2016: 10%) from Finland. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased from the previous year by about 260,000 million tonnes primarily because of the decreased condensing power production. Fortum's direct biogenic carbon dioxide emissions were 1.2 (2016: 1.3) million tonnes.
The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions covers carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Carbon dioxide emissions as well as methane and nitrous oxide emissions have been calculated on the basis of plant-specific fuel data. The amounts of HFC compounds and SF6 are reported on the basis of the amounts of gas added to the equipment. Specific emission factors of gases are based on IPCC publications.

Indirect greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 2
Greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity purchased for our own use were 102,700 (2016: 95,500) tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent. Carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 99.6% of this. The share of Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions of our total greenhouse gas emissions was 0.4%.
69% of Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated on the basis of information received from electricity suppliers. The rest, including Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in Russia, has been estimated on the basis of country-specific breakdown of electricity production.

Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions ­ Scope 3
The majority of our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the purchases of goods and services, investments and the production and transportation of fuels. The transportation of waste received from customers also creates greenhouse gas emissions in our circular economy business. Other activities (e.g. employee travel and waste management) account for less than 1% of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.

Our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 were an estimated 4.8 (2016: 4.7) million tonnes. The share of Scope 3 emissions was 21% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate that all our Scope 3 emissions come from fossil energy sources.

Annual specific emissions Specific emissions (5-year average) Target (5-year average)

Our specific carbon dioxide emissions from total electricity production (Scope 1) in 2017 were 173 (2016: 173) g/kWh. Our specific carbon dioxide emissions from power production in the EU area were 28 (2016: 28) g/kWh. The specific carbon dioxide emissions from our electricity production, measured as g CO2/kWh, are low compared to other European electricity producers. Our specific emissions in 2016 were one of the smallest among European major electricity utilities. European reference data for 2017 is not yet available.

The boundary for specific carbon dioxide emissions generated from electricity production differs from other environmental reporting. The figures include also figures from Fortums share in associated companies and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners on cost basis. This electricity production is based on hydro, wind and nuclear power, and the production doesn't cause direct carbon dioxide emissions.
In the calculation of electricity production's specific emissions, CHP plant emissions have been allocated for electricity and heat using the efficiency method presented in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidelines, with heat production efficiency of 90% and electricity production efficiency of 40%.

Improving energy efficiency

Energy efficiency is a key factor in energy production ­ from both an economic and environmental perspective. Improving energy efficiency at power plants refers to measures we implement to increase the efficiency of production processes or reduce the energy consumption of plants or equipment. This enables us to produce more electricity or heat for our customers without increasing fuel consumption.
The energy efficiency of power plants can be increased through investments and technical improvements, preventive maintenance, and by training personnel in the optimal operation of the plant and in monitoring the plant's operating economy. Improving power plant availability also increases energy efficiency, as unplanned plant start-ups are reduced.
Energy-efficiency investments
In fuel-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel's energy as efficiently as possible. Our most important means to improve the energy efficiency of fuel use is to increase combined heat and power (CHP) production. In CHP production, up to 90% of the energy content of the fuels can be utilised. Separate electricity production's efficiency is about 40­60%.
A high-pressure turbine was replaced at the Loviisa nuclear power plant's unit 1 in 2017. The replacement increased the unit's
1,502 GWh/a
Energy-efficiency improvement Target: >1,400 GWh/a by 2020

nominal output by 5 MW, which means that in an average year it can produce 40 GWh more electric energy. The Loviisa plants unit 2 will undergo the same replacement during the 2018 annual outage.
In addition, other projects to improve energy efficiency were completed in 2017: · Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland,
27 GWh · Heat recovery from a data centre to Espoo's district heating
network in Finland, 17 GWh · Construction of a district cooling plant in Tartu, Estonia,
12 GWh · Installation of a preheater at the Bytom Miechowice CHP plant
in Poland, 9 GWh The energy-efficiency improvement projects are calculated to yield an annual energy savings of about 131 GWh.
Target was achieved
Fortum's target has been to achieve an annual energy savings of more than 1,400 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012. By the end of 2017, the annual cumulative energy savings achieved was 1,502 GWh, which exceeded the set target by about 100 GWh. The target was increased by 500 GWh/a, and the new target is to achieve annual energy savings of 1,900 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012.
Energy-efficiency services for homes
Fortum has introduced energy-efficiency services for private customers in Finland and Sweden. Fortum's customers can, for instance, control and optimise the heating of their homes based on electricity price and demand or they can monitor energy consumption with an in-home display.

Energy-efficiency services for businesses
Fortum's operation and maintenance services have been improving the energy-efficiency of our customers' power plants already for decades. We have expanded our energy-efficiency services: in addition to an individual power plant, we can review the development of a broader urban area and the profitability and environmental impacts of investments related to them. In addition to production, the review takes into consideration the energy distribution to customers and the changes in energy consumption. Energy-efficiency services were delivered to Finland and Eastern Europe in 2017.
ENERGY-EFFICIENCY SERVICES FOR HOMES ENERGY-EFFICIENCY SERVICES FOR BUSINESSES
Fuel consumption
The most significant fuel used in our energy production was natural gas, and the next highest fuel use was uranium and coal. Our goal in the future is to produce increasingly more added value from biomass fuels and waste-derived fuels. The share of waste-derived fuels used in energy production in 2017 increased due to the growth of our circular economy business.

The energy-specific fuel consumption has been calculated based on the usage volumes and fuel-specific caloric values measured at the power plants. Uranium consumption has been calculated as the thermal heat generation in the reactors. Russia's share of the total fuel consumption in 2017 was about 67%. Russia accounted for 99% of our use of natural gas and 51% of our use of coal.
Energy intensity
In 2017, our fuel consumption in electricity and heat production was 110 (2016: 111) TWh, or 394 (2016: 398) PJ. Additionally, we acquired 479 (2016: 460) GWh of electricity from external electricity suppliers. With these energy resources, we produced 53,900 GWh of electricity, 27,900 GWh of heat, 30 GWh of cooling, and 53 GWh of bio-oil. The total energy consumption, calculated as the difference between the procured energy resources and net production, was 45,000 (2016: 47,900) GWh, or 162 (2016: 172) PJ.
In combustion-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel as efficiently as possible. In 2017, our average fuel use efficiency was 59% (2016: 64%). The decline in fuel use efficiency was due to the increased use of waste-derived fuels. The efficiency has been calculated by dividing the electricity and heat energy produced with the fuel by the energy content of the fuel used in the production.
The energy intensity of our own production was 1.7 (2016: 1.4). The intensity figure has been calculated by dividing the amount of used energy resources by the total net production of energy products, including also hydropower, wind power and solar power.

Circular economy

Challenges for rapidly growing major cities and growth centres include not only the management of emissions but also growth in waste volumes. Fortum's goal is to offer expert solutions and sustainable circular economy services for cities.

Recovery of maEFtneinerairagllysd:irs6ep4co6osvaketlr:y(4a:8s17h,2,k11tpklat stic, o

il, metal, others)

By circular economy we mean that materials are utilised as efficiently as possible and hazardous materials are removed from circulation. We also recover by-products and wastes generated in energy production whenever possible.
Our circular economy business has grown in the Nordic countries. We acquired Turebergs Recycling AB at the end of 2016. The business receives and processes ash and slag and recovers purified materials for use in infrastructure construction materials. An important part of the business is the separation of metals for reuse. The operation is concentrated mainly in the Stockholm area.
We completed the restructuring of the Hafslund business ownership at the beginning of August 2017. The City of Oslo's waste-to-energy plant Klemetsrud, which is the largest energy recovery plant in Norway, and the Haraldrud heat plant, which also has a waste incineration boiler, were transferred to Fortum's ownership through the transaction.
Waste management services
Reliable waste management and resource efficiency are important in a society based on sustainability. Fortum's aim is to promote the transition towards a more extensive circular economy. We offer waste management services for customers in the Nordic countries and Lithuania.
In 2017, we received a total of approximately 1.2 million tonnes of non-hazardous waste from our customers; contaminated soil accounted for 212,000 tonnes of that amount and ash 301,000 tonnes. We also received about 640,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from our customers; contaminated soil accounted for 88,000 tonnes of that amount and ash 88,000 tonnes. As much of the waste stream as possible is recycled, recovered or reused. Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse as a material is incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants. This reduces the use of virgin fossil or renewable fuels in electricity and heat production. Waste that is unsuitable for recovery is disposed of at landfilling sites.

Recovery of materials
Various types of waste can be reused as raw materials. Of the waste received from our customers in 2017, we recovered as materials about 650,000 tonnes; environmental construction materials accounted for about 362,000 tonnes of that amount, recoverable ash accounted for about 159,000 tonnes, and processed raw materials and products about 80,000 tonnes. The material recovery rate of the waste was 57%. In addition, about 226,000 tonnes of recoverable materials originated at Fortums own power and heat plants.
We are continuously developing activities that increase the proportion of waste materials kept in circulation: · We refine new plastic out of waste plastic received from
customers. · We pick up and process our customers' waste oils to be refined
and reused as industrial lubricants. · We recycle scrap metals generated in the maintenance activities
of our power plants and other facilities. We also recover and separate metals from customers' municipal waste and boiler slag. · We process ash and slag, sand, sludge, dredging masses and slurries from energy production and other industries for reuse in various types of environmental construction and earthwork.

Hazardous waste treatment
We take hazardous waste out of circulation in a sustainable manner and we clean the hazardous substances from materials that end up in recycling by offering solutions to treat hazardous waste while also producing clean energy and ensuring a safe final disposal. High-temperature incineration ensures the best available solution for the destruction of hazardous substances.
We have three high-temperature incineration plants: in Riihimäki, Finland; Kumla, Sweden; and Nyborg, Denmark. At these facilities, 353,000 tonnes of hazardous waste and 390,000 tonnes of non-hazardous waste were incinerated in 2017, producing electricity and district heating for the surrounding areas.
Contaminated soil
In 2017, we received and treated about 300,000 tonnes of contaminated soil from our customers. We directed metal, rocks, concrete and wood, sieved from the soil for reuse as raw materials. Soil that is suitable for environmental construction is used at our own construction sites and industrial waste reception centres. In addition, we treated about 140,000 tonnes of contaminated soil at customer sites.
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION

Waste and by-products
Ash is a by-product of the use of fuels in power and heat production, and gypsum and other desulphurisation products are by-products of flue-gas desulphurisation. Ash and desulphurisation products account for a more than 90% share, on average, of the by-products and waste from our energy production.
The maintenance of power and heat plants generates scrap metal and other conventional industrial waste and, to a smaller extent, waste oil and other hazardous waste. We aim for the highest possible utilisation and recovery of by-products and waste. The waste management service providers we use are properly licensed and reliable waste management companies.
In addition to conventional industrial waste, the Loviisa nuclear power plant also generates radioactive waste, which we treat in accordance with the requirements of Finnish nuclear energy legislation. The volume of radioactive waste generated is small, but special solutions are needed in their treatment and final disposal.
The total volume of by-products and waste generated at Fortum's power and heat plants in 2017 was about 850,000 (2016: 735,000) tonnes. Of this volume, 45% was recycled or reused. Alongside the growth of our circular economy business, the use of waste-derived fuels has increased and, consequently, the volume of by-products.

The Sustainable Development Forum of Finnish Energy selected Fortum's Circular Economy Village project as the Climate Deed of the 2017. Municipal waste is recycled at the Circular Economy Village in Riihimäki.

Ash and gypsum
Ash is created in the combustion of all solid fuels. About 70% of the ash from our plants operating in Europe is utilised as a raw material, e.g. for the construction industry, road construction and soil improvement, and as backfill. Ash from the power plants in Russia is stored in ash basins, because there is no demand for wet ash sludge in Russia.
Coal-fired power plants generate either a wet or semi-dry desulphurisation by-product. Gypsum created as a by-product in the wet desulphurisation process at the Meri-Pori power plant in Finland is suitable for use as raw material for the construction industry. In 2017, 100% (2016: 100%) of the gypsum was utilised. The desulphurisation product created at the Suomenoja power plant is not suitable for utilisation.
In 2017, about 810,000 (2016: 695,000) tonnes of ash, 4,000 (2016: 8,500) tonnes of gypsum, and 12,800 (2016: 12,700) tonnes of the other desulphurisation product were generated. The increase in the volume of ash was due to the increased use of waste-derived fuels. The decrease in the volume of gypsum was due to the reduction in condensing power production in Finland. About 40% of the ash was generated at Russian plants, 21% in Poland and 10% in Finland. The ash recycling rate was 47% (2016: 37%)
By-products that cannot be utilised are transported to the appropriate final disposal at landfilling sites. In 2017, about 446,000 (2016: 453,000) tonnes of by-products were transported for landfilling, or in Russia for ash basins.
The reported volumes of ash and gypsum from our European power plants are based on the weighing of the truckloads. Ash volumes at our Russian power plants are calculated on the basis of the ash content of the coal.

Radioactive waste
At the Loviisa nuclear power plant, low-level radioactive maintenance waste is disposed in Loviisas repository. In 2017, 19.0 (2016: 13.9) tonnes of low-level radioactive waste went into final disposal. Intermediate-level radioactive liquid is generated mainly from spent ion exchange resins and wastewater from the controlled area. Liquid waste is processed into solid form at the solidification plant for liquid radioactive waste before final disposal in Loviisas repository.
High-level spent nuclear fuel is stored in an interim storage at the Loviisa power plant site. In 2017, 23.4 (2016: 19.6) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from Loviisa power plant's reactors. 2.9 (2016: 2.5) g/MWh of spent fuel was generated per produced energy unit. Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima have established Posiva Oy to handle the technical implementation of the final disposal of the spent fuel, and final disposal is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the first half of the 2020s.
Other waste
Other, conventional waste generated during the operation and maintenance of power and heat plants is sorted, and waste that can be recycled, such as metal, is sent for further processing. Hazardous waste is delivered to licensed hazardous waste treatment facilities.
The power and heat plants generated a total of about 34,200 (2016: 29,400) tonnes of other waste, approximately 3,200 (2016: 2,700) tonnes of which was hazardous waste. In addition, about 500 tonnes of contaminated soil was removed for disposal in Finland. The reported volumes of other waste are based mainly on the information provided by the waste management companies.

Material recovery from demolition project of the power plant
Fortum decided on the demolition of the Inkoo condensation power plant in the end of 2016, and the demolition work started in spring 2017. The Inkoo demolition project is one of the biggest demolition projects in Finnish industrial history. Fortum's recycling and waste solutions is responsible for the demolition work. In 2017, a total of about 9,200 tonnes of waste was generated in the demolition project of the Inkoo power plant, and about 1,000 tonnes of it was hazardous waste. About 90% of the dismantled waste was recovered. In addition, about 200 tonnes of contaminated soil was removed.

Biodiversity

The degradation of biodiversity is one of the biggest environmental problems globally. We need to know our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystem services to be able to assess the related risks and opportunities.
Our impacts on biodiversity
Fortum's impacts on biodiversity are primarily related to our hydropower production operations in Finland and Sweden. Hydropower construction and the related water regulation alter the conditions in water systems and thus impact the diversity of the aquatic habitat and, in particular, the fish population. Emissions from fossil fuel-based energy production may decrease local biodiversity, especially in Russia. Indirect impacts may be caused by, for example, large-scale procurement of biomass and other fuels. However, our production of CO2-free energy replaces fossil fuel-based energy production and thus mitigates climate change, which is globally one of the greatest threats to biodiversity.
Fortum's biodiversity engagement
In 2017 we updated Fortums Biodiversity Manual, which defines Fortum's approach in biodiversity management. According to the manual, biodiversity issues are systematically considered as part of our environmental management processes and our operations throughout Fortum. The manual contains specific instructions for biodiversity issues in current operations, new projects, the supply chain as well as for reporting and communication.
Sustainable use of biomass fuels has been actively debated in recent years. Fortum's position is that EU-wide, harmonised and binding sustainability criteria for all bioenergy is needed. The EU Commission's proposal to extend the existing sustainability criteria for bioliquids to cover also solid biomass and biogas is in line with Fortum's position. The proposal is included in the EU Commission's legislative "Smart and Clean Energy Package" published on 30 November 2016. Legislation is expected to be finalised in 2018.

Fortum is a member of the Bettercoal initiative and uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain. Biodiversity aspects related to coal mining are covered in Bettercoal assessments.
We aim to improve biodiversity in connection with our operations, carry out biodiversity-related projects and cooperate with stakeholders in projects. We assess the impacts of our new projects. We offset and reduce the impacts of hydropower production on biodiversity. We carried our obligatory fish care measures valued at EUR 1.9 million and several types of voluntary environmental projects valued at EUR 1.5 million.
Habitat restoration and other projects
Most of our habitat restorations and other projects improving biodiversity are related to hydropower production. Additional information about our hydropower-related projects supporting biodiversity is available on our website.
River strategies focus on environmentally effective solutions Based on the earlier mapping of valuable riverine biodiversity areas in 2015, by the end of 2017 we finalised our river strategies for all of the rivers where we operate hydropower plants. The aim of these river-tailored strategies is to balance the increasing need for flexible hydropower and the needed case-by-case selected environmental improvements by focusing environmental actions on valuable species and habitats in the most important areas environmentally. We started implementing the strategies in 2017 with the licensing of the first projects.
Restoring river stretches by tearing down dams In Sweden, we tore down the Acksjön dam in a tributary of the River Klarälven. The operation was successfully carried out in cooperation with local stakeholders. The tearing down resulted in a new 100 m long stretch of river and the removal of a migration

barrier that will benefit biodiversity. A similar case is the Kolsjön dam. An application for removal of the Kolsjön dam has been submitted to the environmental court.
In Sweden, we have mapped out and prioritised old dams that have low value for hydropower production, but have environmental impacts on riverine ecosystems. The aim is to restore habitats and river continuum in places with biodiversity benefits.
Restoring fish habitat At the River Dalälven in Sweden, we restored a 180 m-long river stretch in 2017. The aim was to increase possibilities for sea trout to spawn in the River Dalälven. Gravel and boulders were added to the river. We carried out the restoration in cooperation with the local fishing organisation in Älvskarleby. The restoration was part of the "Biodiversity in lower Dalälven" project, with the goal to enhance fish spawning of migratory fish in the River Dalälven. The project, a cooperative effort between regional authorities and another hydropower company, was finalised in 2017.
Monitoring of the River Vuoksi in Finland gave positive results regarding fish abundance at previously restored riverine habitats upstream of the Imatra hydropower plant. Together with our cooperation partners, the City of Imatra and regional environmental authorities, the restored areas were further amended by morphological modifications in November 2017.
Protection of red listed species We improved the habitat of Myrstarr (Carex heleonastes), a rare aquatic plant species growing downstream of the Laforsen dam in the River Ljusnan in Sweden. The plant habitat was cleared from bushes and other vegetation that would suppress the Carex plants. The conditions need to be maintained to safeguard the plant at the site.

Biomass fuels actions Forest certification schemes will continue to play a strong role in verifying the sustainability of wood-based biomass. Certified woodbased biomass fuel originates from sustainably managed forests in which special attention is paid to biodiversity. We annually collect data on the volume of certified wood-based biomass fuel used in our power plants in Finland, Sweden, Poland and the Baltics. Our goal is that 80% of all wood-based biomass fuel we use is verified by a third party by the end of 2020. We aim to obtain a Chain of Custody certificate for our wood-based biomass fuel purchasing by the end of 2018.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HYDROPOWER PRODUCTION
We established a private nature conservation area in Muhos as a 100th anniversary gift to Finland.

Case | Fish trap and transport facility for Montta power plant in the River Oulujoki, Finland
A trap and transport facility for fish was completed in late August in conjunction with the Montta hydropower plant on the River Oulujoki. We use the trap and transfer facility to capture salmon and trout as they migrate upstream; it enables the fish to be efficiently and safely transported around the migration barriers. The facility correspond to the lower portion of a fishway. The fish swimming into the facility can be transferred into a tanker truck and transported across several power plant dams to tributaries upstream for spawning. Based on experiences gained elsewhere, this results in significantly more broodfish in the spawning areas than if all the necessary fishways between the sea and the spawning areas were built. Fortum has good experiences with transporting landlocked salmon in Sweden on the River Klarälven, which is harnessed for hydropower production.
From the new trap and transport facility, fish can also be transferred into reservoirs for fishing, or their roe that has gone through natural selection can be taken to the Montta fish farm where Fortum produces salmon and sea trout for stocking in the River Oulujoki.
The trap and transport facility is a joint project by Fortum, the Muhos, Utajärvi and Vaala municipalities, the North Ostrobothnia ELY Centre, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to revitalise salmon and trout in the River Oulujoki. The facility has special national significance because it will gain experiences for use in migrating fish projects on other constructed rivers.
The trap and transport facility is part of the overall conservation of the fish population in the River Oulujoki. Fish conservation is based on the stocking of migrating fish, strengthening the natural life cycle, and developing the quality of the stock fish. In recent years, Fortum has invested over EUR 5.5 million in the modernisation of the Montta fish farm and the construction of the trap and transport facility.

Emissions into air

Fortum's activities cause various emissions into air. Greenhouse gases that accelerate global climate change are generated primarily from the use of fossil fuels and the combustion of waste of a fossil origin.
Flue-gas emissions causing local environmental and health effects are generated from all incineration. Nitrogen oxides are generated from the nitrogen contained in the fuel and in the combustion air. Sulphur dioxide, in turn, is generated from the sulphur that is an impurity in, e.g., coal, peat and oil. Particle emissions are fine-grained ash generated primarily in the combustion of solid fuels and waste. Depending on the origin of the fuel and waste, the particles contain various heavy metals.
Improving air quality
It is possible to decrease nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle emissions through fuel selections, combustion technology, and various flue-gas cleaning technologies. Fortum has worldclass know-how in combustion technology, and we have delivered combustion technology solutions to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to many other power utilities. In 2017, we implemented nitrogen oxides reduction projects in Poland, and bio-oil burner modification projects in Sweden.
Our Meri-Pori and Suomenoja power plants are equipped with a desulphurisation plant. Our waste incineration plants located in Riihimäki, Finland; Kumla, Sweden; Nyborg, Denmark; and Oslo, Norway, are equipped with efficient flue-gas cleaning systems. Harmful emissions to air are minimised with various filters and scrubbers selected on the basis of the waste to be incinerated.
Stricter standards
The EU has set very strict limits for flue-gas emissions; meeting the requirements necessitates the use of best available technology (BAT). Our nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle emissions have, in fact, decreased significantly in our European production

over the past decades. Emissions limits became even stricter when the Industrial Emissions Directive came into force in 2016.
All Fortum power plants operate in compliance with the terms of their environmental permits, and the plants meet the new emissions requirements, for the most part. Investments in fluegas cleaning process and systems will be made in 2018­2019 at the Suomenoja power plant in Finland and the Rejtana heat plant in Poland.
At Russian power plants, emissions are limited in accordance with Russian legislation. The new legislation currently being drafted in Russia will bring stricter emissions standards in the future.
Flue-gas emissions
Our sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions were 18,800 (2016: 22,500) tonnes, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions 27,500 (2016: 26,000) tonnes and particle emissions 15,800 (2016: 16,800) tonnes. 77% (2016: 81%) of sulphur dioxide, 81% (2016: 82%) of nitrogen oxide and 98% (2016: 98%) of particle emissions originated from Russian operations. In 2017, the most significant source of particle emissions, 9,200 (2016: 9,100) tonnes, was the Argayash CHP power plant in Russia.
The reporting of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particle emissions from our European power plants is based on continuous measurement. Other flue-gas emissions data is based on discontinuous measurements or are calculated using fuel consumption data and specific emission factors. Specific emission factors are based on measurements taken at regular intervals, on information from the equipment supplier, or on regulatory norms.
Carbon dioxide emissions are reported in the section Greenhouse gas emissions.

Water use

Fortum uses large volumes of water at various types of power plants and in district heating networks.
Risks and opportunities related to water use
Risks related to Fortum's water availability are relatively small and local, according to our assessments. The majority of our water withdrawal volume is seawater for the cooling of power plants. In most cases we don't consume water; it is returned into the same water system from which it was taken. India is the only country, where we operate in areas of high or extremely high water risk; our water use in India is low. Within the policy framework, we identify the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in Sweden as a potential risk to hydropower production.
The Argayash CHP power plant in Russia takes water from a nearby lake, the level of which is regulated by pumping water from another lake. The amount of additional water pumped was insufficient until 2017, and the water surface level was reduced significantly. New permit limits, effective in 2017 and 2018, should ensure water adequacy. Fortum also has an ongoing investment project to increase the recycling of water. When the investment is completed part of the purified water can be returned to the production cycle. This will allow to take less water from the lake.
There are currently temporary water loading permit limits in force at the Russian Chelyabinsk CHP-2 and CHP-3 and the Argayash CHP power plants. These power plants have agreed with the authorities on action plan that aims to reduce the load on waterways.
Improving the efficiency of water use and reducing leaks in the district heating network generate cost savings for us. We monitor the water use of our power plants, and we implement measures that improve water use efficiency when needed. With good water use management in hydropower production, we can optimize our production and control the impacts to the environment and to stakeholders, impacts like flooding and droughts.

In our operations we are preparing for changes in water availability in the future as the climate changes. The preparation is related to, for example, production planning, dam safety, investment projects, the rise in the cooling water temperature, and flood protection. In hydropower production planning we are preparing for climate change by taking into consideration changes in precipitation and temperature and extreme weather phenomena. We are also monitoring the need for adjustments to regulation permits with changes in seasonal variation; one permit change is currently under way in preparation for autumn flooding.
The Loviisa nuclear power plant is prepared for nature's extreme phenomena and possible oil spill due to an accident at sea with a seawater-independent back-up cooling system including air-cooled cooling towers.

Our forms of water use
The majority of Fortum's power and heat production capacity is located in the Nordic countries, Russia and Poland. The Baltic Sea and local fresh water systems are the most important water sources for our plants. Municipal tap water is used mainly at CHP plants in major cities.
We withdrew 2,120 (2016: 2,140) million m3 of water in 2017. Seawater accounted for about 72% of this amount. Our water

withdrawal includes 8 million m3 of water delivered to customers. The reported water withdrawal and water use volumes are based on measurements and on calculations of water consumption.
Cooling water Condensing power production requires large volumes of cooling water. Cooling water accounts over 90% of our water withdrawal.
Fortum has two condensing power plants in Finland: the Loviisa nuclear power plant and the Meri-Pori power plant. Both are located in coastal areas and use direct seawater cooling. The Loviisa nuclear power plant withdrew and discharged back into the sea 1,372 million m3 of cooling water in 2017. No water is consumed in the process and the water withdrawn is discharged back into the sea. The only change is an approximately 10 °C increase in the temperature of the cooling water. Additionally, in Russia, Fortum has the Nyagan condensing power plant, which uses river water for cooling.
Condensing power is occasionally produced also at our CHP plants. In most cases, the cooling water is withdrawn from a local water system, such as a river or lake. In Russia and Poland, cooling towers are used, so some of the cooling water evaporates into the atmosphere.

District heating network Fortum is a major supplier of district heating in Finland, Norway, Poland, Russia and the Baltic countries. Fortum has a total of about 3,400 kilometres of district heat pipes in these countries. Water is used as the heat transfer media in district heating. Some water is lost through leaks that occur in the pipes, so occasionally water must be added to the district heating network.
Process water A thermal power plant needs water in the water-steam cycle when electricity is generated with a steam turbine. Because of leaks in the pipes, occasionally water must be added to the water-steam cycle. Water is also needed in power plant auxiliary processes, for example in flue-gas cleaning with wet scrubber technology, and in radioactive waste handling and storage at nuclear power plants.
Hydropower production and fish farming We produce hydropower from water flowing in rivers in Finland and Sweden. The power plants are typically located in big rivers that have no problems with regards to water supply. Water is not consumed in our hydropower production, it is not typically directed to another water system, and the water properties are not altered. However, the water system is often regulated for hydropower production, and the regulation changes the water flow and level patterns compared to their natural state.
We have precise knowledge of the water situation in those waterways where we use hydropower, and we use real-time hydrological forecasts in production planning. We don't report river discharges as a hydropower-related water withdrawal.
We farm and stock fish to offset the impacts of hydropower production. The majority of the fresh water withdrawn for fish farming is returned into the bodies of water with only a slight change in its properties. We have included water use at the fish farms in water volumes since 2016.
Our water use in water risk areas According to the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, the solar power plants in India are the only of our power plants located

in high to extremely high risk (level 3­5) areas in terms of water risk. The Amrit (5 MW) and the Kapeli (10 MW) power plants use groundwater we have purchased, and the Bhadla (70 MW) plant uses surface water. Water for the Bhadla plant is withdrawn from the channel shared by several actors in the solar park area. Fortum gets a fixed amount of its water discharge. The Pavagada (100 MW) plant completed at the end of 2017 has not yet used water in 2017.
Water is used to clean the solar panels at our solar power plants in India. India's share of our water use in 2017 was about 6,000 (2016: 4,000) m3, i.e. only 0.0003% of our total water withdrawal. While the water volumes are small, we aim to increase the efficiency of our water use in India. We have set a target in the Indian solar power production environmental management system to discontinue the use of water for cleaning panels at our current solar power plants by 2020. At the Amrit solar power plant, we have built an absorption basin to collect and absorb rainwater. By improving the efficiency of the cleaning processes, water use at the Amrit and Kapeli power plants decreased by 11% in 2017. We are also developing waterless cleaning methods for solar panels. We will start a waterless cleaning pilot project in the first part of 2018.
Wastewater
Wastewater generated at our power plants is either treated at the power plant's own wastewater treatment plant and discharged into a water system or it is piped to a municipal wastewater system for further processing. In Russia, the wet method is used to pump ash from power plants into ash ponds. Part of the water from the ponds is recycled back to the power plant and part is released into a water system after sedimentation.
Wastewater contains solids and nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphor, and heavy metals. Wastewater effluents can impact local water quality as well as the nutrient and oxygen balance of the water system. Our plants generated a total of 64 (2016: 56) million m3 of wastewater, of which 97% was released into the environment after being treated and 3% was piped to municipal wastewater treatment plants. 
About 66% of the wastewater is discharged water from fish farms. Discharged water is purified and its nutrient content

is monitored in line with permit conditions. The sludge water separated from the process water at the Montta fish farm in Finland has been piped to a municipal wastewater treatment plant since 2016, which has reduced the nutrient load on the water system.
About 1.0 (2016: 1.3) tonnes of oil was released into water systems through wastewater.
The thermal load discharged into water systems with cooling water was 17 (2016: 17) TWh. The Loviisa nuclear power plant's share of this was 16 TWh. Temperature measurements indicate that the cooling water has increased the temperature of surface water by 1­2 °C within a 1­2 kilometre radius from the discharge point. The reported wastewater is based on measurements and calculations.
NURES products for purifying radioactive waters
Initially developed for the needs of the Loviisa nuclear power plant, the NURES products are a unique solution for purifying radioactive waters. A selective ion exchange material purifies liquid waste more efficiently than any other alternative on the market. In 2017, we continued product deliveries globally, and, in addition to ion exchange materials, we supplied a radioactive liquid purification system to customers in Finland and Germany.

Environmental non-compliances and incidents

At the Group level, we monitor the number of major EHS incidents, which, in part, reflects the quality of environmental management. In 2017, there were 20 (2016: 22) major EHS incidents, and 10 (2016: 12) of these were significant environmental incidents. Significant environmental incidents include spills of over 100 litres into the environment, significant environmental permit violations, and other environmental non-compliances that have a significant impact on environment.
Spills and leaks into the environment
In 2017, there were 8 (2016: 1) spills and leaks of more than 100 litres into the environment, all in the Nordic countries. In Finland, there were four incidents of refrigerant leakage at the Suomenoja heat pump plant. Also in Finland, there was leakage from a container of chemical waste to be transport to Riihimäki and a spill involving a tank of lubrication oil used at the waste-toenergy plant. In Sweden, a chemical leak occurred at the wasteto-energy plant in conjunction with the emptying of the scrubber. Additionally, a diesel spill took place during a transport related to the hydropower production investment project in Sweden. The incidents have been investigated to find corrective measures. The incidents did not have significant environmental impacts.
Significant environmental permit violations
There were two (2016: 11) environmental permit violations in 2017, one of them in Russia and the other in Denmark. At the Nyagan GRES power plant in Russia, the permit limit for the sanitary wastewater emissions was exceeded. The process wastewater limit was exceeded at the waste-to-energy plant in Denmark. The incidents have been investigated to find corrective measures.
Environmental enquiries and grievances
Power plants receive environmental enquiries and other contacts every year, and they are mainly handled locally. The aim is to communicate in advance about upcoming measures that have

possible environmental impacts, for example, through local media and at public events.
Fortum's website also has a grievance channel that our stakeholders can use to report problems possibly caused by our operations. No new environment-related grievances were reported to us through this channel in 2017.

Fines
In 2017, Fortum paid fines totalling RUB 8,000 (EUR 121) for permit violations involving exceeding the sanitary wastewater emission limits.

Security of supply

A functional society requires an uninterrupted and reliable supply of energy. Fortum is committed to working for cleaner energy production. Implementing our vision ­ For a cleaner world ­ requires a reliable supply of economically priced energy delivered to customers as we transition towards a lowcarbon energy system.
Hydropower balances the growing, but weather-dependent, fluctuating production of other renewable energy forms like solar and wind. The flexibility of hydropower is needed to secure the functionality of the energy system and the power grid and to balance fluctuations in the price of electricity.
If a sufficient supply of hydropower is not available, then adjustable natural gas power production can be used to balance fluctuations in renewable energy production and to secure the supply of electricity. With planned preventive maintenance and condition monitoring, we ensure that our power plants operate reliably to produce the electricity and heat customers need.
Power plant availability at a good level
We measure the availability of our CHP and hydropower plants with an energy availability indicator. Energy availability is calculated by dividing the power plant's actual production in the period under review by the theoretical maximum production. Planned maintenance outages are not included in the calculation. If the outage at a CHP plant is longer than planned, it is considered a production interruption, which decreases the energy availability. The energy availability of our CHP plants in 2017 was, on average, 96.1% (2016: 97.4%); the target level was over 95.0%.
For hydropower plants, outages due to a failure and unplanned or prolonged outages decrease the availability factor only if they lead to spillage. The energy availability of our hydropower plants was 98.2% (2016: 98.7%).
The load factor describing the availability of the Loviisa nuclear power plant is among the best in the world for pressurised water reactor power plants. The Loviisa nuclear power plant's load factor in 2017 was 92.7% (2016: 91.1%).
Interruptions in heat distribution
Fortum has about 3,400 km of district heating networks in Finland, Norway, Poland, Russia and the Baltic countries. The aim is to keep interruptions in district heat distribution as short as possible by carrying out planned and preventive refurbishment and maintenance activities.
Fortum sold the Polish gas distribution company DUON Dystrybucja S.A. in summer 2017, because gas distribution is outside Fortum's core strategy.

Employees

In 2017, an average of 8,507 (2016: 7,994) employees worked at Fortum. The highest number of employees was in Russia, 3,710 (2016: 3,814) on average. The average and the year-end total personnel figures include 200 employees who are not included in the other figures and tables presented in this report. These individuals include the civil contractors working in the Consumer Solutions division in Poland, Sweden and Norway.
Permanent employees accounted for 95.2% (2016: 96.1%) of the personnel. Of these, the share of full-time employees was 98.1% (2016: 98.5%).
During the year 734 (2016: 476) new employees joined Fortum, and 855 (2016: 968) employment relationships were terminated, 206 of which by the employer. The number of employment relationships terminated due to production and financial reasons was 77. Departure turnover in 2017 was 10.5% (2016: 13.0%). Voluntary departure turnover was 5.4% (2016: 5.6%).
With the acquisition of Hafslund, 722 new employees joined Fortum. Other acquisitions and outsourcings decreased the number of personnel by a total of 185 (2016: 248) people.
Contractor employees worked at Fortum sites for a total of approximately 1,249,000 (2016: 1,113,000) days during the year. The figure is based on contractors' hourly logs and on estimates made on the basis of job costs and average hourly rates. The figure has been calculated on the basis of an 8-hour work day.

Equal remuneration
Salary levels at Fortum are compliant with established industry practices in each country, local legislation and labour market agreements. We remunerate personnel for achievement of the strategic business targets and successful implementation of changes. Remuneration is based on job grade levels, job performance and local job market practices.
In the incentive scheme, the maximum amount of the shortterm variable remuneration is based on the individual's job, and the amount of the final incentive pay is based on the job-based salary level and the achievement of the goals of the business unit and the individual. For the reasons mentioned above, a male/female comparison of the short-term incentive pay is not expedient.
However, the global human resources data system and the harmonised job grade classification system enable the examination and reporting of pay equality for the base salary in all our operating countries. Besides the centralised HR data management system, a separate, local, data system is also used in Russia, and therefore the data on Russia's pay equality is reported separately. With the corporate acquisitions made in 2017, the companies merged with Fortum ­ and for which the job grade classification and the

integration of the personnel system has just started ­ are not included in the figures.
Our reporting covers all personnel groups except individuals working in blue-collar positions. A male/female comparison in this group is not done because of the small group sizes. Bluecollar workers accounted for about 32% of Fortum's personnel. In countries where the number of personnel is small, we have reported these countries collectively under "Other countries" so that the data are not identifiable. The figures presented are not comparable with last years figures because the method of calculation has been changed.
In our operating countries, total number of personnel included in the comparison was 3,091, of which 1,124 (36%) were female.

The base salaries of female employees in 2017 were, on average, 18% lower than the male base salaries. When examining the differences by employee group and by country, the differences ranged between -1% to -16%.
In Russia, the difference between female and male salaries was -19% on average. The total number of personnel included in the comparison was 2,202.

Employee-employer relations
Fortum's business operations are developed and strengthened in good collaboration with employees. We believe that the successful management of business is built on relationships of trust between management and employees and on the free flow of information. Fortum respects employees' freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
In our operating countries, freedom of association and collective bargaining are guaranteed by law. The exception to this is India, which has not ratified the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention on the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. In India, we comply with the same practices as in other countries of operation, and we do not limit or prohibit the right to freedom of association.
We apply local collective bargaining agreements in compliance with the scope of each respective agreement in all our operating countries. Collective bargaining agreements cover nearly 85% of Fortum's employees in our biggest operating countries and range from 6% coverage in Latvia to about 100% in Finland, Sweden and Russia. There are no collective bargaining agreements in Lithuania, Poland and India. Employment contracts are based on local legislation and on the company's human resources policy.

Fortum European Council
Fortum European Council (FEC) is Fortum's Europe-level cooperation function in which personnel and employer representatives meet. FEC convenes, as a rule, once a year. In 2017, the Fortum European Council (FEC) held a meeting in Poland, and personnel representatives from Finland, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Denmark participated. The Council's meeting focused on, among other topics, Fortum's strategy, corporate culture, leadership, wellbeing and safety. In addition to Fortum European Council meetings, local level meetings are held several times a year in different countries based on need.
Restructuring situations
In situations of organisational restructuring, we negotiate with personnel representatives in compliance with each country's local legislation and contractual procedures. In situations involving personnel reductions, we want to primarily support the reemployment of the personnel.
In restructuring situations, the length of the obligatory negotiation period depends on the scale of upcoming changes and varies in Fortum's different operating countries. The shortest period for obligatory negotiations is three weeks (Finland) and the longest is 90 days (India). There is no statutory obligatory negotiation period in Sweden, Norway and Lithuania.
The minimum notice period is based on local legislation, collective agreements or employment contracts, which are in harmony with the local legislation and agreements.
In situations involving personnel reductions, we offer outplacement services on a per case and per country basis, and, in cooperation with local unemployment authorities or service providers, we investigate the possibilities to arrange vocational or

other training enhancing employability. Retraining for employees who continue working is arranged based on organisational and individual needs. In situations involving personnel reductions, the content of the support package that we offer is decided based on local needs. The financial compensation of the package is usually based on the years of employment at Fortum.
Employee wellbeing
Our operating environment is constantly changing, and we want to support our personnel in the change by paying special attention to work wellbeing. In line with our new leadership principles, the development of work wellbeing supports the work environment and corporate culture, which helps our employees to succeed.
Energise Your Day wellbeing programme expanded to new operating countries
The goal of the work wellbeing model, ForCare, is to promote the health and occupational safety of our employees and the functionality of the work community. Operating under the ForCare model since 2016, the Energise Your Day wellbeing programme aims to support and encourage all Fortum employees to maintain and improve their overall wellbeing.
In 2017 the Energise Your Day programme was expanded, and is now under way in nine of our operating countries. The Energise Your Day programme starts with a self-assessment-based wellbeing survey; close to 4,700 Fortum employees have responded to the survey. The response rate is 73%. Based on the responses, the most sought after support and tools are for recovery and stress management.
Based on the wellbeing survey results, employees are offered various wellbeing services, such as lectures, coaching clinics, campaigns and other wellbeing activities. Self-management, stress management, recovery, nutrition and physical activity are among the themes.
We promote wellbeing at the workplace also through what is called an early-support model. We increase open communication between employees and supervisors by discussing and mapping the reasons for absences.

Occupational safety and health care
Occupational safety and health care are organised in our operating countries in line with local legislative requirements. The occupational safety committees represent all personnel groups, and they regularly address issues related to occupational safety and workplace wellbeing.
All our employees are within the sphere of occupational health care. We emphasise the significance of preventive activities in promoting wellbeing in the company. The occupational health care costs per person in Finland, before the share reimbursed by Kela (The Social Insurance Institution of Finland), were EUR 533 (2016: 460).
Fortum conducts regular examinations of its personnel in accordance with local laws. Employees who in their work are exposed to e.g. noise, dust, radiation or who perform shift work are within the sphere of the examinations. Occupational health care also participates in various discussions and assessments in the work community. The occupational health care professionals support supervisors by providing information on preventive actions as well as alternatives when the ability to work decreases. Occupational health care also offers methods and tools for these situations.
2.2%
Sickness-related absences Target:  2.3%

In 2017, the percentage of sickness-related absences (excluding DUON and Hafslund) was 2.2 (2016: 2.3), which is better than the target level of 2.3. For males, the percentage of sickness-related absences was 1.9 (2016: 2.1) and for females 2.9 (2016: 3.0). The sickness absence rate is calculated based on the reported working hours of the permanent employees. The percentage of sicknessrelated absences for Hafslund was 3.0. In addition to expansion of the Energise Your Day occupational wellbeing programme, the management of sickness-related absences was one of our focus areas in 2017.
There was one (2016: 8) case of suspected occupational disease in Finland. The case was related to noise and involved a male employee. The case was determined to be non-occupational.
An indication of the good management level of working capacity and workplace wellbeing at Fortum is the average retirement age, which was 62 (2016: 62) years. In 2016, the average effective retirement age in the earnings-related pension scheme in Finland was 61.1 years (Source: Finnish Centre for Pensions).

Employee development
Our goal is to be a forerunner in the future energy system. This means that our corporate culture must evolve to be more flexible and agile. That is why we have drafted new Leadership Principles and have updated our company's Values.
Our Open Leadership framework is based on views and input received from the Fortum Sound employee survey, Fortum Summit, Fortum European Council (FEC), and Must-Win-Battle development programmes, among others. This input emphasised the need for more collaboration between units as well as an environment fostering innovation and smart risk-taking. Based on feedback we received, there is a need within the teams to better understand how the daily work advances the implementation of our company's strategy. Open Leadership aims to address these issues.
FORTUM'S LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES
BELIEVE THE BEST IN OUR PEOPLE We believe in our people, which empowers them to believe in themselves, grow and exceed their own expectations.
WANT THE BEST FOR OUR PEOPLE We create a work environment and company culture that help our people thrive.
EXPECT THE BEST FROM OUR PEOPLE As we believe in our people and provide them with a good work environment, we can expect them to deliver results. We are confident they will even exceed our expectations.
Our Leadership Principles promote openness and curiosity towards the world, our customers, the industry, and each other.

Our Values form the foundation for our corporate culture and guide our decision-making. Fortum's Values have withstood the test of time, and that is why we updated only some elements of our Values so that they are in even better alignment with our strategic context and our situation. Our updated Values are:
CURIOSITY We question the status quo and have the courage to explore.
RESPONSIBILITY We have a strong sense of responsibility.
INTEGRITY We believe in transparency.
RESPECT We greatly value each other and all our stakeholders.
Our Leadership Principles and our Values have already been introduced and discussed in various management meetings and in other unit and team meetings. Leadership Principles have also been a central part of seminars and training events that have been arranged in conjunction with the Ways of Working project.

The change in our working culture and the move of the headquarters into a new multi-space office require learning on the part of the personnel and the ability to renew ways of working. The purpose of the Ways of Working change management trainings, launched in late 2017, is to offer tools to support better collaboration and self-leadership. The target group of the training includes all the employees and their managers who are moving to the new premises.
The total number of all training hours in 2017 was 62,189 (2016: 39,129). The Safety and Security eLearning aimed at all Group personnel contributed to the increase in the number of training hours. Training costs in 2017 totalled EUR 3.6 (2016: 3.1) million.
Performance and development discussions support the achievement of targets and professional growth
We support employee development through the annual performance and development discussions; all employees are within the scope of the annual discussions.
The main target of the performance and development discussion is to ensure that the employee has clear targets that align with the business as well as the competencies supporting the achievement of the targets and professional growth.
The achievement of the targets forms the basis for payment of incentives. All employees who have a minimum of three months

Faster feedback from personnel
In 2017 we adopted a new, quick pulse survey tool. By asking ten questions we can measure personnel engagement and satisfaction. The tool replaces the previously used Fortum Sound employee survey, and it will be conducted every six months. The employees and supervisors see the survey results immediately after the feedback is given.
The survey conducted in October 2017 had a response rate of 69%. According to the results, 68% of the personnel feel a commitment to the company. Based on the survey results, the personnel feel that Fortum is an innovative company and pursues new ways to operate. There is a clear connection seen between one's own work duties and the company's targets, and the respondents felt that they can trust management's decisions.
Targets of development included increasing the collaboration between the divisions and units, encouraging smart risk-taking, and decreasing the decision-making hierarchy. Open Leadership aims to have an impact on these issues.

Safety and security

For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation of our business, and safe performance is a sign of professionalism.
Occupational and operational safety
We strive to be a safe workplace for our employees and for the contractors and service providers who work for us. We believe that all work injuries are preventable when competence and the right attitude prevails, when potential risks are addressed and when measures are taken to safeguard against them. Good operational safety is an absolute prerequisite for safe and efficient operations in terms of the employees and the environment.
In 2017, we had the following Group-level key safety indicators: · Injury frequency (TRIF* and LWIF**) for own employees and
(LWIF) for contractors · Number of severe*** accidents · Major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents · Quality of investigation process of occupational accidents,
major EHS incidents and near misses Fortum's Board of Directors has approved the following amendments for 2018: at the Group-level, the LWIF combined (own employees and contractors) will be used as the main safety indicator. Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) for own employees will be used as a follow-up indicator. In addition, the

GAP index measuring compliance with the Group's minimum requirements for EHS management is a new Group safety indicator.
The safety targets apply to all Fortum employees and are part of the Group's short-term incentive plan.
Safety improvements needed
2017 was a challenging year in terms of occupational safety. The safety performance of our employees is still at a relatively good level but exceeds the lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) target level of 1.0, and we have not been able to reduce the number of contractor accidents.
The LWIF for both own employees and contractors has increased mainly due to the integration of Recycling and Waste Solutions, where the safety actions implemented on the ground have not yet resulted in an improved safety performance.
As a result, only the total recordable incident frequency (TRIF) for own employees and the number of severe accidents met the set target level. The LWIF for own employees per million working hours was 1.2 (2016: 1.0) and the TRIF was 1.8 (2016: 1.9).
The LWIF for contractors continues to be our main challenge. The LWIF for contractors per million working hours was 4.2 (2016: 3.0), and we did not achieve the target of 3.5. The same challenge applies to the combined LWIF (own employees and contractors):

the result was 2.4 (2016: 1.8), exceeding the target of 1.9. However, we can be pleased that there have been no accidents leading to a fatality in Fortum's operations in the last three years.
Our target defined in 2017 is to reduce severe accidents to zero by 2020. We had one severe accident in Russia in 2017; our target for the Group was 5. Consequently, Fortum's Board of Directors amended the target and we are now aiming for zero severe accidents already in 2018.
In reporting accidents, we comply with the principles of the United States Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and ILO's Practices on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases to the extent that they conform with the legislation in Fortum's countries of operation.

Operational safety
We track major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents as a Group target; these incidents cover fires, leaks >100 litres into the environment, explosions, nuclear and dam safety incidents, and environmental non-compliances. There were 20 (2016: 22) EHS incidents in 2017; the target was 21. There was one (2016: 0) INES event exceeding level 0 (INES = International Nuclear Event Scale). The incidents did not cause significant harm to people, operations or the environment.
Common guidelines steer our operations
Fortum has Group-level EHS instructions and minimum requirements that set requirements for all the operations for which we have operative responsibility. The requirements are updated regularly, and the divisions performance in complying with the revised requirements is assessed yearly.
The two proactive KPIs (Quality of EHS incident investigations and GAP index) introduced in 2017 help ensure compliance with the Group minimum requirements for EHS management and thus reduce the risk of improper work practices. They also ensure a timely investigation of incidents, the sharing of lessons learned, and reduce the risk of repeating the same mistakes again. Both of these proactive KPIs are also internal control points of the EHS processes.
A Safety and Security eLearning programme, compulsory for all personnel, was launched in spring 2017. The training for Fortum Executive Management took place already in January 2017. By year end, all personnel had completed the e-learning. In 2018, Fortum will also introduce external safety training for both the management level and key individuals leading safety work as well as for the most challenging business areas in terms of safety.
A development project addressing contractor safety was carried out during the year. New tools were developed to assess contractor safety performance as part of the supplier qualification process and to evaluate their safety practices in a more systematic manner during work. The project also included benchmarking with leading European companies to assess best practices in contractor management. Key persons were trained on the new tools and implementation of them will continue during 2018.

We will continue our efforts to improve safety
Our goal is to continuously improve the safety of our operations. Our target for LWIF combined (own employees and contractors) for 2018 is 2.1 (2017: 1.9). Setting a higher numeric target than in 2017 might seem controversial, but it is challenging considering that the actual result in 2017 was 2.4. Achieving the target of 2.1 requires robust safety improvement actions and implementation of Fortum's EHS minimum requirements.
Excellent occupational safety continues to be a promise we want to keep also in the years ahead. We are committed to achieving the contractor safety level target (LWIF 2.0) by 2020.
Corporate security
Through corporate security, we strive to ensure the uninterrupted continuity of business and the safety of people, information, our assets and processes in normal and exceptional situations. Uninterrupted energy production and distribution is important both for Fortum's business operations and for an energy-dependent society. Our Corporate Security unit is responsible at the Group

level for personnel and operational security; cyber security and data security are also within the scope of the unit's areas of responsibility.
Securing personnel and business safety
Compliance with the minimum safety requirements improves our operational ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and thus reduces unplanned maintenance outages and improves productivity.
We assess risks related to people, business and information in all geographical areas where Fortum has potential operations and business travel. Risks impacting the company and business operations may be related to political situations, terrorism, crime, conflicts and business partners.
Corporate security is improved also by gaining a deeper understanding of the security situation so that we can anticipate and prevent risks before they materialise.
Cyber security
Security with the information we handle and with our IT systems ensures that we can meet society's and our customers' expectations. Our cyber security programme is currently divided into data, IT and digital services security and security of automation systems. The aim is to ensure the production and distribution of power and heat and the functioning of new digital services, like Internet of Things applications.
In IT security, we aim to ensure the accessibility, integrity and confidentiality of critical information. We also take seriously our compliance with the regulations related to the protection of personal data. Customer data protection is discussed in the
Product responsibility section. We actively engage in collaboration with authorities and other
stakeholders to understand and prevent new and growing cyber threats. We launch campaigns to increase employee awareness of security risks. We promote ways of operating that take employee information security into consideration by, e.g., providing guidelines and online training.

Contingency planning
The main disaster and emergency situations we prepare for are related to our critical operations, such as power plant and dam safety and securing other operations.
For dam and nuclear safety, emergency preparedness obligations in Finland and Sweden are based on regulatory provisions; likewise, there are terrorism-related preparedness obligations in Russia. Otherwise, emergency preparedness obligations prescribed by authorities are of a general nature. Based on its own risk assessments, Fortum independently defines the crisis and exceptional situations it prepares for and drafts action plans for.
Fortum's crisis and emergency management instructions are prepared for Group, division and site levels. The testing and updating of the crisis management and continuity plans are the responsibility of each division and line organisation. Crises impacting Group operations more broadly are managed at the Group level. Crisis communication instructions have been prepared for e.g. power and heat outages and for the Loviisa nuclear power plant. Corporate Security is responsible for crisis management development, e.g., for organising rehearsals and supporting planning. Group Communications is responsible for crisis communication.
In 2017, an emergency preparedness exercise for hydropower production in Finland was held. The annual emergency preparedness exercise related to a nuclear power accident was held at the Loviisa power plant.

Corporate citizenship

Social responsibility is a cornerstone of Fortum's operations. Our operations impact the local communities where our power plants are located, and we engage in many kinds of collaboration with local stakeholders.
We support activities promoting the common good in society, including the work of organisations and communities in our operating countries. Fortum's Policy for Sponsoring and Donations was revised in December 2017. According to the policy, Fortum's sponsoring will focus on the wellbeing of children and youth, renewable energy projects, R&D and innovations supporting Fortum's strategy, recycling, recovery and reutilisation. For 2017, we are reporting support for society pursuant to the categorisation based on the previous version of the Sponsoring and Donations Policy. Fortum also engages in significant collaboration with different research and development projects, particularly with Nordic universities.
We actively participate in national and international organisations. Public affairs and collaboration with authorities are a priority in the energy sector.
Local impacts and collaboration with local communities
We are an important employer and significant tax payer in our operating areas. In addition, our investments improve the local infrastructure. Of our energy production forms, hydropower has the most significant impacts on local communities and local forms of land use. Hydropower construction and use may alter the fluctuation range and rhythm in the discharge and water level in waterways as well as the fish fauna. These changes impact fishing, recreational use, and boating. We mitigate and compensate the adversities caused by hydropower production through numerous measures, such as stocking fish and building boat launch ramps.
We communicate openly, honestly and proactively, and we engage in a dialogue with the stakeholder groups located in the vicinity of our power plants. We carry out collaboration

projects with local communities. We conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA) for our projects in accordance with legislative requirements. The hearing of stakeholders is part of the EIA process. In addition, relevant stakeholders are heard in all permit procedures.
Examples of our activities with local communities in 2017: · We arranged open-house events at power plants in different
countries of operation; thousands of locals attended the events. · We continued publishing the Naapurina ydinvoimala (Nuclear
power plant as a neighbour) magazine in Loviisa, Finland, and maintained an active dialogue with local residents and representatives of the city of Loviisa. · In Riihimäki, Finland, an active dialogue with local residents is supported by a cooperation council convening twice a year. · Projects aiming to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of hydropower were under way in Finland and Sweden in collaboration with municipalities, research facilities, fishermen, universities and environmental organisations. For example, the River Oulujoki restoration and multi-use framework agreement was renewed for 2018-2021 in Finland. Within the agreement, we continue improving environmental conditions and recreational use of the river with local partners. In Sweden, we finalised a multiannual, cooperation research project in on migratory fish in River Klarälven. · We held the fifth River Clean-Up for sports clubs in Sweden. More than 1,700 children and adults raised money for sports activities by collecting 17.5 tonnes of trash along the banks of four rivers (Dalälven, Klarälven, Ljusnan and Gullspångälven) where Fortum has hydropower plants. · We continued supporting local communities with several projects in the vicinity of the Kapeli and Amrit solar power plants in India. Among other things, Fortum has improved water and electricity supply in the villages as well as supported local schools by building a new classroom and furnishing the kitchen for providing lunch for the children. In three villages in the

vicinity of the Bhadla power plant, a community development programme was started. The programme includes a Self Help Group for local women and provides drinking water through a "Water ATM". · We support the communities in power plant areas through various donations. In Poland, e.g., we supported workshops and scholarships for talented children raised in difficult conditions and installed solar panels on the rooftop of a kindergarten. In Russia, we supported medical care for children with serious diseases. In Finland, elementary schools in the Hausjärvi and Riihimäki region were supported to join "Vihreä lippu" sustainable development programme.
Support for society
As part of Finland 100, the centenary of Finland's independence, Fortum made donation of EUR 1 million to four Finnish universities. Fortum Waste Solutions distributed a total of EUR 120,000 in grants to five environmental management research projects. The grant, awarded by the company's environmental scholarship fund, is the largest research grant in the industry to be awarded by a company on an annual basis. In 2017, our support for activities promoting the common good totalled about EUR 4.9 (2016: 2.9) million.
Fortum Foundation supports research, education and development in the natural, technical and economical sciences within the energy industry. Fortum Foundation is not part of Fortum Group. The grants awarded by Fortum Foundation in 2017 were about EUR 696,000 (2016: 675,000).
The goal of the collaboration with universities and colleges is to develop Fortum's business, promote energy-sector research and development, and foster Fortum's recruiting and training opportunities.

Examples of our collaboration with universities and colleges in different operating countries: · In Sweden, there is a multi-year project under way that
aims to offer sustainability-related training to more than 4,000 educators. Fortum's collaboration partners in the project are Pedagog Värmland, Karlstad municipality, engineering and consulting company ÅF, and Chalmers University of Technology. · In Estonia and Lithuania, Fortum is a member of the Baltic Innovative Research and Technology Infrastructure (BIRTI), which coordinates collaboration between universities, scientific institutes and entrepreneurs. · In Latvia, Fortum is taking an active part in the THERMOS (Thermal Energy Resource Modelling and Optimisation System) project. It is an EU Horizon 2020-funded research project that will provide advanced energy system data and models to make heat network planning faster, more efficient, and more cost effective.
Sponsorship projects
In 2017, we continued sponsoring the coaching of children and youth in football, volleyball, basketball, and track and field. Through the Fortum Tutor programme, we offer tutors to support coaches in their daily work as well as financial support for teams to train new coaches. Fortum Tutor operates in Finland and in the Baltic cities where Fortum has power plants. In 2017, we were the main partner for the world's largest junior volleyball tournament in Finland. Fortum Power Cup attracted thousands of junior players and their coaches for outdoor games.
The Fortum Honorary Energy Donor mobile app has been in use in Poland. It encourages people to engage in physical activity. The distance covered during a physical activity can be converted into energy, for which Fortum makes a financial donation to selected charities.

In 2017, more than 1,500 school kids in Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, and other cities in the Chelyabinsk region completed the "AboutEnergy" educational programme sponsored by Fortum. The goal of the programme is to teach children to use resources efficiently and to foster an ecological mindset.
During the school year, 67 classes in 20 schools in the participating cities and the districts took the total of more than 2,000 lessons under this programme. The most active students were invited to a closing event in Chelyabinsk. They passed a final exam on the course they completed and took part in various activities. There was also a Jeka computer game tournament ­ a game developed by the Housing and Utilities Foundation to teach and promote energy saving skills.
Fortum first launched the "Culture of the new generation: energy saving and efficiency" project in 2015. The "AboutEnergy" programme has been praised by local educators and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Chelyabinsk region. Along with theoretical studies, it includes workshops, excursions, creative competitions and environmental campaigns.

Human rights

Fortum supports and respects internationally recognised human rights, which are included in the key human rights agreements. Our own operations have a direct or indirect impact on the realisation of the human rights of our own personnel, those working in the supply chain, and members of local communities.
Management of human rights issues and personnel training
Our goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and to apply these principles in our own operations as well as in country and partner risk assessments and supplier audits. Fortum's approach to the management of human rights issues is described in more detail in Appendix 1: Sustainability management by topic, Human rights.
Fortum's Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordinating and developing sustainability, including human rights issues, at the Group level.
The online course for Fortum's Code of Conduct includes training in human rights-related issues. The course is part of the induction programme for new employees. The Supplier Code of Conduct includes human rights requirements and they are reviewed as part of the Code of Conduct training. Trainings were arranged in 2017 for Fortum's Baltic functions and for the Recycling and Waste Solutions personnel in Finland and Sweden.
In 2017 Fortum participated in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs' round table discussions about the human rights issues of Finnish companies operations located in risk countries. Non-governmental and labour market organisations also participated in the discussions. The discussions resulted in a joint statement that was published in conjunction with a stakeholder event in March 2018.

Assessment of human rights impacts
A sustainability assessment is carried out for our investment projects and takes into consideration the environmental, occupational health and safety, and social impacts of the project. The sustainability assessment includes a human rights evaluation, especially in new operating areas. A human rights assessment is also part of the systematic assessment of country and counterparty risks when planning a project.
The process has two parts: a light and a deep assessment. A light assessment is done for all new countries in which one of our business units is planning the sales of products or services, and it is based on publically available sources. In 2017, 14 of these assessments were made. One deep assessment was made.
Fortum's supplier audits cover the most important human rights aspects related to purchases. The supplier audits conducted in 2017 and their results are described in more detail in the section
Sustainable supply chain.
Identified impacts on human rights, corrective measures and grievances
All forms of child and forced labour are strictly prohibited and in violation of Fortum's Code of Conduct. Of our operating countries, India has not ratified the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention on the minimum age and the worst forms of child labour. Our functions in India require job applicants to be of adult age. We have not identified risks related to the use of forced labour in our own operations. Support of employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining are discussed in the section Employee-employer relations.
Internal reporting channels used for reporting any suspected misconduct relating to labour practices or human rights violations are defined in Fortum's Code of Conduct. In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum has an external "Raise a concern" channel which is available to all stakeholders.

Fortum participated in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs' round table discussions about the human rights issues of companies.
There were no grievances related to human rights, labour rights or discrimination filed through formal grievance channels in 2017, nor were there any grievances carried over from the previous year.

Product responsibility

Fortum is a clean energy company that provides customers with electricity, heating and cooling as well as smart solutions to improve resource efficiency. Our ambition is to engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a low-carbon energy system and optimal resource efficiency.
Fortum is the third largest power generator and the largest electricity retailer in the Nordic countries. We are one of the world's largest producers of heat. We also offer district cooling, energy efficiency services, recycling and waste solutions, and the largest electric vehicle charging network in the Nordic countries.
Guarantee-of-origin-labelled and renewable electricity
Hydro and nuclear account for two-thirds of our electricity production, making us one of the Nordic countries' leading sellers of carbon dioxide-free and guarantee-of-origin-labelled electricity. All the electricity we sold to household customers in Finland and Sweden in 2017 was renewable and carbon dioxide-free hydro, wind or solar power. The origin of the electricity was guaranteed with European Guarantees of Origin. A guarantee of origin is proof that the electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. Some of the electricity we sell is also guaranteed with the panEuropean EKOenergy label granted by environmental organisations and, in Sweden, with the Bra Miljöval label.
Services to customers
In recent years Fortum has introduced many new services that reduce environmental impacts and give customers better opportunities to control their electricity consumption and costs. The sustainable solutions we offer to growing urban areas in energy production, traffic and waste management also support a circular economy. The number of consumers participating in energy production is growing. The solutions offered by Fortum for this area are related to home automation, smart EV charging, local energy production and storage, and flexible demand. Additionally,

we offer diverse expertise services for energy systems, electricity and heat production and for the process industry.
Marketing communications and customer data protection
Our goal is to present products and services truthfully in all our marketing and communication materials. We strictly follow responsible marketing communication guidelines, and we do not present misleading statements. In statements regarding environmental issues, we follow the regulations for environmental marketing.
In 2017 Fortum received from the Finnish Energy Authority one request of further clarification as regards a marketed product. The Finnish Energy Authority also sent a separate request to add missing information on the Authority's web pages. The requested information was provided within the set timeframe. The Swedish Consumer Agency as well as the Energy Market Inspectorate

in Sweden requested Fortum to implement some changes in its marketing communication. Fortum is in the process of implementing the requested changes. The Energy Market Inspectorate also ordered an injunction in the case, which Fortum has appealed.
Data protection legislation has been amended in recent years. In 2016 the EU published the Data Protection Regulation, which will take effect in May 2018. We have prepared for the regulation to take effect by launching a data protection programme, and several development projects for personal information processing have been started in conjunction with it. In 2017 the Data Protection Ombudsman initiated an enquiry against Fortum Markets A/S in Norway. Due to a software failure, some data classified as personal data were mismanaged. The software functionality has been corrected, but the case was pending at the year end.

Reporting principles

We report on sustainability in this Sustainability Report and in the Online Annual Review. Non-financial reporting, in line with the Accounting Act, is included in the Operating and Financial Review in the Financials. Additionally, we describe sustainability-related governance practices in the Corporate Governance Statement, and strategy and the CEO's view in the CEO Letter. Our reporting entity also includes the Tax Footprint.
In our sustainability reporting, we follow the integrated reporting principles, and we apply specific disclosures of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards we have identified as material.
We gain information about our stakeholders' views through the One Fortum survey, the stakeholder sustainability survey and other stakeholder collaboration. Our selection of material topics is based on Fortum's own and our stakeholders' views regarding the materiality of the impacts.
We report sustainability information annually in Finnish and English. In our annual reporting we describe Fortum's operations in 2017 as well as some information from January­February 2018. The previous reporting was published in March 2017, and our next reporting will be published in February/March 2019. In addition to the annual reporting, we report on our sustainability activities in Fortum's interim reports.
Reporting scope and boundaries
Reporting related to operations and management covers all functions under Fortum's control, including subsidiaries in all countries of operation. The figures for power and heat generation and investments include also figures from Fortums share in associated companies and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners on cost basis. Possible deviations to these principles are reported in conjunction with information applying different boundaries. A list of Fortum's subsidiaries is included in the
Financial Statements Note 40 Subsidiaries by segment. Information from previous years is mainly presented as pro
forma information, i.e. on the basis of the organisation and

the functions of each year; the impacts of ownership changes in production facilities, for example, have not been updated afterwards in the previous figures.
The company AB Fortum Värme samägt med Stockholms stad (Fortum Värme, at present Stockholm Exergi) is classified in the Financial Statements as a joint venture and is consolidated with the equity method. Fortum Värme is not included in Fortum's sustainability targets and indicators nor in the descriptions of management practices. Fortum Värme's sustainability information is available in Fortum Värme's sustainability report.
Fortum completed the divestment of its Distribution business on 1 June 2015. In this report, the information for 2017 and 2016 and, as a general rule, also for 2015 does not include the Distribution business.
On 4 August 2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of its ownership in Hafslund ASA with the City of Oslo. Sustainability information relating to Hafslund Markets' and Fortum Oslo Varmes operations is included in Fortum's reporting as of 1 August 2017.
On 28 July 2017, Fortum concluded the divestment of its 100-per cent shareholding in the Polish gas infrastructure company DUON Dystrybucja S.A, which is included in the sustainability reporting up to 30 June 2017.
Exceptions to the accounting practice are presented in conjunction with each figure.
Capacity changes
Fortum commissioned unit 3 (248 MW electricity and 174 MW heat) of its Chelyabinsk GRES combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Russia in November 2017. During 2017 Fortum acquired or commissioned 205 MW of solar power capacity in India and Russia and 32 MW of wind power capacity in Norway. Through the Hafslund ASA ownership restructuring, 19 MW of electricity and 1,111 MW of heat production capacity was transferred to Fortum.

The commissioned and acquired capacity during the year is included in the reporting starting from their commissioning.
Measurement and calculation principles
Data for economic performance indicators is collected from the audited Financial Statements and from financial accounting and consolidation systems.
The environmental information of the report covers the plants for which Fortum is the legal holder of the environmental permit. In such cases, the plant information is reported in its entirety. An exception is the calculation of specific CO2 emissions and fuel use from the Meri-Pori power plant, where the calculation covers only Fortum's share of production and emissions as specified in the operation agreement between Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima Oy.
Fortum utilises a Group-wide database with instructions for collecting site-level environmental data. Sites are responsible for data input, emissions calculations and the accuracy of the information provided. The Corporate Sustainability unit compiles the data at the Group level and is responsible for the disclosed sustainability information.
Fortum's CO2 emissions subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are annually verified at the site-level by external verifiers. Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions have been reported in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Analysis performed by an external consultant.
Fortum's human resources (HR) management system is used in all Fortum's operating countries and is the main system for employee-related personal and job data. In Russia, the employee data system covers mainly superiors. In addition, Russian operations have their own, local data system. Other social responsibility data, such as occupational health-related data, originates from various data systems.

Independent limited assurance report on Fortums Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2017

To the Management of Fortum Corporation
We have been engaged by Fortum Corporation (hereafter: Fortum) to provide a limited assurance on Fortum's Fossil Greenhouse Gas Emissions (hereafter: GHG Emissions) broken down by scope 1, 2 and 3 for the reporting period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (hereafter: GHG Emissions Disclosures). The information subject to the assurance engagement is presented in the section "Greenhouse gas emissions" of Fortum's sustainability reporting 2017 (hereafter: GHG Reporting).
Management's responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation of the GHG Reporting in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in Fortum's reporting principles and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (hereafter: GHG Protocol). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the GHG Reporting that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, selecting and applying appropriate criteria and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Assurance provider's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the reported GHG Emissions Disclosures within Fortum's GHG Reporting based on our engagement. Our assurance report is made in accordance with the terms of our engagement with Fortum. We do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Fortum for our work, for this assurance report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410 to provide a limited assurance on performance data. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and

perform the assurance engagement to obtain a limited assurance whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that the GHG Emissions Disclosures have not been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.
We did not perform any assurance procedures on the prospective information, such as targets, expectations and ambitions, disclosed in the GHG Reporting. Consequently, we draw no conclusion on the prospective information.
A limited assurance engagement with respect to the GHG Emissions Disclosures involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the reported GHG Emissions. The procedures performed depend on the practitioner's judgment, but their nature is different from, and their extent is less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls and consequently they do not enable us to obtain the assurance necessary to become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.
Our procedures on this engagement included: · A review of management systems, reporting and data
compilation processes · Selected interviews of persons conducting scope 1, 2 and 3
analysis and data owners · Review of assumptions and emission factors used in calculations · Analytical testing of consolidated data · Testing of source data on spot check basis We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Our independence, quality control and competences
We complied with Deloitte's independence policies which address and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International Federation of Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional

Accountants in their role as independent assurance providers and in particular preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our independence and impartiality and from any involvement in the preparation of the report. We have maintained our independence and objectivity throughout the year and there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair our independence and objectivity.
Deloitte Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance and sustainability expertise with professional qualifications. Our team is experienced in providing sustainability reporting assurance.

Conclusion
On the basis of the procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information subject to the assurance engagement is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GHG Protocol or that the GHG Emissions Disclosures are not reliable, in all material respects, with regard to the reporting criteria.
Our assurance statement should be read in conjunction with the inherent limitations of accuracy and completeness of the GHG Reporting.

Management of economic responsibility

Targets and approach
Policies and commitments Responsibilities
Monitoring and follow-up

Description
For Fortum economic responsibility means competitiveness, performance excellence and market-driven production that creates long-term value for our stakeholders and enables sustainable growth. Satisfied customers are key to our success and active consumers will have a crucial role in the future energy system. Fortum has indirect responsibility for its supply chain. We conduct business with companies that act responsibly.
Each new research and development project is assessed against the criteria of carbon dioxide emissions reduction and resource efficiency. Likewise, new investment proposals are assessed against sustainability criteria as part of Fortum's investment assessment and approval process. In our investments we seek economically profitable alternatives that provide the opportunity to increase capacity and reduce emissions.
We measure financial performance with the return on capital employed (target: at least 10%) and capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA around 2.5). The realisation of financial targets in 2017 is reported in the Financial performance and position section of the Financials.
The financial management system is based on Group-level policies and their specifying instructions, and on good governance, effective risk management, sufficient controls and the internal audit principles supporting them. Other key elements steering financial management are presented in the section Policies and commitments and in
Appendix 2.
The CFO and the Group's Financial unit, division management, and ultimately the CEO and the Board of Directors are responsible for issues related to finances and financial statements and for broader financial responsibility issues. Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section Governance and management.
The Board decides on the company's financial targets as a part of the annual business planning process. Realisation of the targets is monitored on monthly basis both at the division level and by Fortum Executive Management. Fortum's management monitors the realisation of financial targets quarterly as part of the business performance assessment, and key indicators are regularly reported to Fortum's Board of Directors. Financial key indicators related to investments are monitored in divisions' investment forums and by Fortum Executive Management. We report regularly on the direct and indirect financial impacts on our most important stakeholder groups. Fortum also uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards indicators to measure economic responsibility.

Management of environmental responsibility

Targets and approach
Policies and commitments Responsibilities Monitoring and follow-up

Description
Fortum's aim is to provide its customers with environmentally benign products and services. We strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations by using best available practices and technologies. We emphasise a circular economy, resource and energy efficiency, the use of waste and biomass, and climate change mitigation in our environmental responsibility.
Our company's know-how in carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power production and in energy-efficient combined heat and power production, investments in solar and wind power, as well as solutions for sustainable cities play a key role in environmental responsibility. We measure the realisation of the environmental responsibility with the following indicators, for which we have set Group-level targets: · Specific CO2 emissions · Energy efficiency · Major EHS incidents · Quality of investigation process of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents, and
near misses · GAP index, quality of implementation of EHS minimum standards (2018) Additionally, we have a Group-level target for the number of supplier audits.
Environmental management is based on Fortum's Sustainability Policy. Other key elements steering environmental management are presented in the section
Policies and commitments and in Appendix 2. We assess environmental risks as part of the Group's risk assessment process. Risk
assessment process is reported in the section Operating and financial review/Risk management of the Financials.
Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section Governance and management.
The Group's key indicators are reported regularly to Fortum's Board of Directors and are published in Fortum's Interim Reports. Major EHS incidents are reported monthly, specific carbon dioxide emissions and the quality of investigation process are reported quarterly, and energy efficiency improvements as well as the GAP index are reported annually to Fortum Executive Management.
The divisions and sites follow and develop their operations with audits required by environmental management systems. Internal and external auditors regularly audit our ISO 14001 standard-compliant management system.
The CO2 emissions of plants within the sphere of the EU's emissions trading scheme are audited annually on a per plant basis by an external verifier accredited by the emissions trading authority. The verification addresses the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the monitoring system and the reported data and information relating to emissions. The plants must annually submit to the authorities a verified emissions report of the previous calendar year's carbon dioxide emissions.
Our supply chain monitoring system covers also environmental responsibility and is presented in the section Management of social responsibility: Human rights. We map our stakeholders' views annually with the One Fortum survey and with separate sustainability surveys.

The divisions and sites follow and develop their operations with audits required by safety and quality management systems. Internal and external auditors regularly audit our OHSAS 18001 standard-compliant management system.
Work wellbeing, indicated as a percentage of sickness-related absences is reported to the Fortum Executive Management every quarter. In addition, work wellbeing is monitored through other Group-level indicators, such as the ratio between actual retirement age and the statutory start of the retirement pension. Feedback about the personnel's wellbeing and work satisfaction is received also from wellbeing survey as part of the Energise Your Day programme and from employee survey.
We map our stakeholders' views annually with the One Fortum survey and with separate sustainability surveys.
