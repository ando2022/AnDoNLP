Message from Patrick Koller

The trends in today's automotive industry directly reflect our evolving society. The industry as a whole is experiencing the most significant revolution in its history as it adjusts to increasing demand for connectivity, health & wellness, personalization and sustainability.

The increasing autonomy and connectedness of vehicles is

radically altering the driving experience and as a consequence

the vehicle interior. Different use cases are emerging for

occupants allowing both drivers and passengers to be able to

work or relax in certain situations. Faurecia has taken

full measure of this, pioneering a comprehensive

ways to improve air quality and mobility for their

citizens. To meet these challenges, the industry

needs to continue to improve the performance

of traditional powertrains, as well as accelerate powertrain

electrification.

In 2017 Faurecia accelerated significantly its strategy focused on Smart Life on Board and Sustainable Mobility. The Group signed several major partnerships with ZF, Mahle and Accenture, invested in eight startups and signed agreements with several major academic research establishments. This investment in the future was achieved at the same time as a strong financial and operational performance.

I would like to thank all Faurecians around the world for this excellent year and for managing to balance both short term operational excellence with a strong acceleration of innovation for the future.

Faurecia 2017: a new trajectory

Automotive megatrends
accelerating the technology revolution
Three major automotive trends are impacting Faurecia and accelerating the technology revolution:
CO2 and emissions regulations continue to strengthen and societal pressure is increasing The powertrain mix is rapidly evolving towards increased electrification Connected vehicles are a reality and autonomous driving is developing fast

CO emissions regulations 2
continue to strengthen
From above 150g CO2/km ten years ago, regulations have been rapidly imposing dramatic reductions around the world. Whilst EU standards are the strictest, targeting 95g CO2/km in 2021, China and the US will also converge to below 100g by 2025. Beyond that date, it is likely that the levels will continue to fall. In addition, the WLTP test cycle enforcement from September 2017 has, on average, an additional 10 - 15% impact on measured emissions making the target even more difficult to reach. Pollutant emissions regulations (NOx and particulate NOx matter primarily) impact both diesel and direct injection gasoline engines. Whilst low emissions standards have already been reached with the implementation of EURO 6 legislation in Europe, Tier 2 in the US and the upcoming Euro 5 equivalent in China, the next challenges are the new real driving condition test procedures. These complementary test procedures are now being progressively introduced in Europe thus making emission targets more difficult to reach.

Commercial Vehicles and High Horsepower engines (HHP)
The main commercial vehicle markets that remain to be regulated are China and India which together represent around 50% of global volumes. These are now converging with Europe.
As legislation comes into place including in coastal areas, the high horsepower market, including marine applications, is also rapidly increasing.

 Regulations will lead to an increase in the complexity and therefore the value of after-treatment for all vehicles.
 In terms of the mix of solutions required by the market, lightweight, energy recovery and low pressure EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) are gaining importance.
 For Air Quality, the emphasis will be on breakthrough innovations such as ASDS (Ammonia Storage and Delivery System) in particular for the rapidly growing commercial vehicle market as well as the high horsepower market.

Automotive megatrends accelerating the technology revolution

The powertrain mix is evolving towards increasing electrification
Electrification of the powertrain is an undisputed trend and hybrid vehicles could represent over 30% of the market by 2025.
For full electric vehicles (battery and fuel cell) the ramp up rate is difficult to predict given the complexity of the different factors: technical, economic, political and societal. The diesel decline is making convergence to 2021 CO2 targets more difficult, so investment in electrification is accelerating. The market should ramp up after 2020 for both pure and hybrid electric vehicles. The arrival of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) will speed up from 2030 due to their advantages in terms of range and refueling time.

TECHNOLOGY IMPACT
Powertrain electrification drives increased need for technologies such as energy recovery systems. Acceleration of both battery and fuel cell electric vehicles is driving the need for lightweight battery housing and integrated battery thermal management and well as efficient fuel cell systems and lightweight fuel cell tanks.

Connected vehicles are a reality and autonomous driving is arriving
Two main forces are reshaping the car industry:
 Connectivity: cars become part of the Internet-ofthings
 Autonomous driving: cars become partly or totally autonomous.
The trend for connected cars is driven both by legislation for safety (emergency calls), customer expectations for infotainment and technology developments for autonomous cars. Autonomous driving will progressively allow the car driver to be hands-off the steering wheel, then eyes-off and ultimately mind-off the road in more and more situations. As a result, the vehicle occupants will be able to enter into non-driving occupations such as relaxing, working and socializing. OEM strategies for autonomous driving depend on the type of player: traditional OEMs are progressively moving up the chain through levels two, three and four whereas new entrants are moving directly to level 4 and already anticipating level 5.
In this context, the car interior will be completely reinvented. The "Cockpit of the Future" will be:
 Connected: smart and intuitive,
 Versatile: adaptive and transformable according to the driving situation,
 Predictive: welcoming, responsive, proactive and self-learning.

Sustainable Mobility strategic highlights
Advanced fuel cell systems
Fuel cell technology is a long term electric vehicle solution which offers increased autonomy (over 500 km) and quicker refueling time compared to battery electric vehicles. By 2030, Faurecia estimates that over 2 million vehicles equipped with fuel cell technology could be in production. Faurecia has identified two areas in which it intends to compete in the long term: hydrogen storage and management, and bipolar plates and stack systems.

10

/ 2017 Registration Document

A strong ecosystem
Carbon fiber composite is the ideal material for hydrogen tanks which have to withstand high pressure (700 bars) whilst being as light as possible. Through the partnership with STELIA Aerospace Composites, Faurecia will be able to design, industrialize and commercialize high pressure hydrogen tanks made of carbon fiber composites for fuel cell electric vehicles
Through its investment in Ad-Venta, a specialist in pressure valves for efficient and safe hydrogen storage, Faurecia has exclusive access to a unique, reliable and compact valve which allows pressure management from 700 to 10 bars for delivery to the fuel cell.
With its five-year agreement with the CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), Faurecia will benefit from more than two decades of CEA research and expertise in fuel cell stacks and key components such as bipolar plates. Combined with Faurecia expertise in fluid dynamics and catalysis, the Group will be able to develop, mass-produce and commercialize a high performance fuel cell stack.

Smart Life on Board
strategic highlights

Faurecia is in a unique position based on its product portfolio and competences to become the leading interior supplier of the automotive industry. In 2017, Faurecia focused in particular on the development of its competencies in the fields of:
Smart surfaces
Connectivity, Infotainment and HMI systems
Advanced safety, health and wellness
Fully-integrated cockpit

Smart surfaces
Consumers are expecting an intuitive and attractive interaction with the car. "Smart surfaces" are merging surface materials, displays and decoration and will integrate thermal, sound and lighting systems. All of these require seamless integration into the vehicle with an intuitive interface.
Faurecia expanded its smart surface opportunities through internal capability development and in particular the creation of a pilot plant in Meru, including a clean room with optical bonding. It also invested in start-ups such as Canatu (3D-tactile films) and TactoTek (plastronics).
COCKPIT OF THE FUTURE LAB
Faurecia has set up multidisciplinary teams within its Cockpit of the Future Lab that combine various skills (architects, ergonomists, electronics engineers, etc.) from the Interiors and Seating Business Groups as well as new expertise. The aim is to develop use cases and solutions that integrate the products and technologies of Faurecia and its partners. Faurecia has Cockpit of the Future Labs in Paris, San Francisco, Yokohama and Shanghai.

Connectivity, Infotainment and HMI systems
The infotainment market is moving from internally integrated and proprietary development to open platforms. Android is expected to take a leading position in the in-vehicle infotainment Operating System (OS) landscape due to its advantages as a free, open-source OS with easy integration to the individual's ecosystem. This also facilitates the seamless connectivity between home and vehicle that users are expecting.
In 2017, Faurecia's investment in Parrot Automotive and the acquisition of Coagent (China) brings it into the playing field for infotainment and connectivity and represents an important step in software competencies and applications development. Parrot Automotive and Coagent present distinct characteristics:
 Parrot Automotive has developed standard and modular solutions which can be very flexible vs. traditional industry solutions. Parrot Automotive solutions are scalable & upgradable (Over-TheAir) and offer secure hardware, software and data protection. The Parrot Automotive architecture and set-up allows shortened development times and competitive innovative solutions. Parrot Automotive is well positioned to benefit from the growth of the Android core OS segment.
 Coagent is quick and agile in developing new solutions, is very competitive, and has easy access to Chinese OEMs, suppliers and a digital service ecosystem. The Coagent portfolio integrates displays for clusters, center stacks and other endconsumer applications.

Smart Life on Board strategic highlights
With the support of Accenture, Faurecia has been able to integrate into the Parrot Automotive system voice-activated control, based initially on Amazon Alexa, for navigation, infotainment and seat comfort. This demonstrator, presented at the Las Vegas CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in January 2018, shows Parrot Automotive's unique know how in software development and electronics design combined with Faurecia's systems integration capabilities across the full vehicle interior.

Advanced safety, health and wellness
With the emergence of autonomous driving, additional use cases where occupants can work, socialize or relax will become prevalent. This presents major challenges for safety, acoustics, postural and thermal comfort as traditional systems rely on the occupant being in a relatively limited number of positions inside the vehicle.
Advanced safety
Faurecia developed a partnership with ZF to develop innovative safety and interior solutions linked to different potential occupant positions in the vehicle for autonomous driving. As occupant positions may no longer be fixed facing forward and upright, new solutions for seat-belts and air bags will be needed. The active safety of the future will be occupant centric and integrated into seating system.
Faurecia and ZF have developed an all-new frame concept: the Advanced Versatile Structure (AVS) which provides a safety cocoon in all positions of the seat. It offers intelligently powered kinematics to allow occupants to effortlessly recline, lift, adjust and swivel their seat and then return it smoothly and quickly back to the upright driving position. Crucially, the seatbelt and belt retractor are both integrated into the seat, meaning the seatbelt can function

12

/ 2017 Registration Document

optimally in different seat positions. ZF and Faurecia have also worked to integrate a pre-safe technology with an automatic emergency return action to the safest position. In addition, on both the driver and passenger side the frame has airbags on its outer edges, protecting occupants in the event of an accident.

Health and Wellness
The cockpit will learn the occupant's preferences over time to provide a more comfortable and enjoyable onboard experience. This starts with first identifying the occupants and, based on their profile, establishing a baseline recommendation for thermal comfort, postural comfort and audio. Over time, as the occupants adjust their settings, the seats will register these adjustments and leverage Artificial Intelligence to learn and predict when the occupant will need certain adjustments to maintain the most positive overall experience.
Faurecia developed a partnership with Mahle to develop innovative interior thermal management technologies for future mobility solutions. This includes several collaboration fields addressing topics such as air distribution, air conditioning integration solutions for electric vehicles and the mutual development of
Full-integrated Cockpit
Critical in the evolution of the interior is also the increasingly high-level of systems integration of multiple functions and features. Customers are looking at Faurecia as a "solution-provider" for multiple vehicle-level performance functions, which can include safety, thermal management, sound and acoustic performance, comfort, perceived quality and ergonomics.

Faurecia 2017: a new trajectory

personalized thermal management for the Cockpit of the Future. The first demonstration of this collaboration was demonstrated at CES with the thermal comfort seat that optimizes seat heating and cooling using Mahle and Faurecia's combined technology expertise. Faurecia has taken occupant health and wellness a step further by creating Active Wellness 2.0TM, which employs a system of sensors in the seat and cameras in the instrument panel to analyze data on the occupant's biometrics. In this way, the system can provide the best level of comfort and well-being, and enhanced safety. Importantly, the system can help the driver remain alert by detecting drowsiness or stress and triggering the appropriate response.
Faurecia is well positioned to master the fullyintegrated cockpit with the following capabilities:  Identify and fulfil end-consumers' needs and create
associated superior User Experiences (UX);  Master the major elements of the interior sub-system,
in particular in smart surfaces, infotainment and connectivity, adaptive safety and thermal and postural comfort;  Understand subsystem architecture with capabilities for hardware, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning;  Be the system supplier, able to integrate all technologies required to deliver an attribute or function. Based on its systems integration expertise as well as its unique positioning in both seating and interiors, Faurecia has integrated a full Cockpit of the Future into a serial production vehicle which was demonstrated at the CES show. It demonstrates a versatile architecture and smart systems for a safe and personalized user experience for different driving modes. Functions demonstrated including a personalized welcome, a morphing instrument panel, an immersive sound experience, a smart control unit and an advanced safety and comfort seat.

Operating efficiency

In order to drive performance throughout development phase, Faurecia has introduced the notion of excellence in program management. This new approach takes the above elements and adds:
 System audits on the requirements of the program to ensure discipline in execution;
 Performance indicators reviewed monthly with anticipation of risks.
These various tools have significantly improved program performance in terms of financial achievements, quality, time and serial launches.

Digital transformation and excellence in production
Digital transformation
Since 2015, Faurecia has engaged in a strategic transformation of its operations, using the Industry 4.0 or "Internet of Things" approach. The emergence of new solutions, such as collaborative robots ("cobots") or self-guided handling devices (AGVs or "Autonomous Guided Vehicles"), has led to a breakthrough in the automation of assembly and handling of our products. The implementation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology allows products to be tracked inside the production sites, from reception to shipping, which automates certain logistical tasks, and adapt the process parameters according to the reference of each manufactured product. In addition, the connection of programmable controllers in the production machinery to computer databases allows real-time analysis of many parameters, prevents breakdowns and avoids the production of non-compliant parts.
After an investigation phase in 2015, Faurecia selected a number of digital technologies, whose maturity and economic relevance were confirmed in 2016 on some thirty pilot sites.
From 2017, the Digital Transformation of Operations entered mass deployment mode, with several hundred cobots and AGVs installed during the year. Dozens of factories have digital dashboards, allowing real-time information sharing on the smooth running of production lines. Thus, the reaction of operational teams is immediate in case of quality drift or production line stoppage.
The implementation of these digital management tools, combined with "big data" for an ever greater control of manufacturing processes, opens up new prospects for optimizing the operating conditions of production lines, for ever better use of industrial assets.

Quality results
The quality performance of Faurecia measured in rejected parts per million pieces delivered to customers (ppm) calculated on average half-yearly is now stabilized at a result below the target of 15 ppm set by Group.
This quality performance is mainly due to the rigorous application of the method defined in Faurecia's Quality Breakthrough Plan, well as to specific actions related to the application of the 2017 quality basics. In 2017, a reinforcement plan has been implemented in order to guarantee the application of the quality fundamentals, and of the 20 rules related to the Safety and Regulation, which involve each of the Group's employees on a daily basis. For this, the number of quality audits conducted at the production sites has been increased. Faurecia is now recognized by its main customers for having achieved one of the highest levels in the world in terms of quality.
Faurecia has benefited from its experience in solving quality problems to continually evolve its methodology, the Quick Response Continuous Improvement (QRCI). The QRCI is a management attitude according to which any defect must be the subject of a corrective action within twenty-four hours, then of a complete and factual analysis to determine the causes of the problems encountered the technical solutions and their roll-out across functions. The QRCI is applied at all levels of the Group, from the operator on the production line to the supervision of the workshops and site management, but also within the project development teams and development centers.

The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

The net cash inflow was 435.3 million over the year compared to a net cash inflow of 458.5 million in 2016. It can be explained as follows:
 the operating margin before depreciations and amortizations of non-current assets or EBITDA reached 1,889.3 million compared to 1,639.3 million in 2016, due to the increase in operating income for 200.1 million and the increase in depreciation and amortization by 49.9 million;
 restructuring represented cash outflows of 88.3 million compared to 63.5 million in 2016;
 net financial costs represented cash outflows of 124.5 million, versus 132.0 million in 2016;
 the change in working capital requirement, including receivables factoring, represented a positive impact of 213.0 million compared to 162.5 million in 2016. This change consisted in part of an increase in inventories of 185.3 million, a net increase in trade receivables of 103.9 million, an increase in trade payables of 595.2 million and a positive variation of other trade receivables and payables for 93.0 million. The evolution of these balance sheet positions was impacted by exchange rate changes;
 capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and on intangible assets represented cash outflows of 738.6 million, versus 638.0 million in 2016;
 capitalized research and development costs represented cash outflows of 468.9 million, versus 406.9 million in 2016;
 income taxes represented cash outflows of 286.5 million, compared to 257.7 million in 2016;
 finally, other cash flow items represented 39.8 million in inflows, compared to 154.8 million in inflows in 2016.
Net debt stood at 451.5 million at the end of December 2017, versus 341.5 million at year-end 2016.

The Group's shareholders' equity rose from 3,157.1 million at year-end 2016 to 3,508.3 million at the end of December 2017, an increase of 351.2 million mainly driven by the net income for the year.
The main elements of long-term financial resources are the syndicated credit facility for 1,200 million, signed in December 2014 and renegotiated in June 2016, maturing in June 2021, and which was not drawn at December 31, 2017, the 700 million of bonds maturing in June 2022 and the 700 million of bonds maturing in June 2023.
1.1.1.8. Outlook
In the current environment and in line with the latest IHS forecast, Faurecia expects worldwide automotive production to grow by around 2%(1) in 2018 vs 2017.
Based on this assumption(1) and continued momentum in building profitable growth, Faurecia targets for the full-year 2018:
 sales growth of at least +7% (at constant currencies) i.e. at least 500 bps above worldwide automotive production growth;
 operating margin above 7% of sales;
 net cash flow of above 500 million;
 earnings per share of 5.00.
These targets exceed the 2018 ambitions that Faurecia announced at its April 2016 Capital Markets Day.
After the Capital Markets Day held in London on June 27, 2017 and focused on Sustainable Mobility, Faurecia will hold a new Capital Markets Day in Paris on May 15, 2018, which will focus on Smart Life on Board (Seating and Interiors) with an update on Sustainable Mobility.

(1) Main regional automotive production assumptions (PC + LV < 3.5t): · Europe: at least +2%; · North America: below +1%; · China: at least +2%. 2018 currency assumptions: · USD/ @ 1.20 on average; · CNY/ @ 7.80 on average.

The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies

The consolidated financial statements of the Faurecia group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB, as adopted by the European Union and available on the European Commission website.
These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as the related International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations.
The standards used to prepare the 2017 consolidated financial statements and comparative data for 2016 are those published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) as of December 31, 2017, whose application was mandatory at that date.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Since January 1, 2017, Faurecia has applied the amendments to standards IAS 7, IAS 12 and the amendments and revisions to the existing standards which have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
However, Faurecia has not undertaken any early application of the new standards, amendments or interpretations whose application is mandatory from December 31, 2017, irrespective of whether or not they are adopted by the European Union. The impact analysis of these standards and amendments is in progress.
In particular, as regards IFRS 15, Faurecia has carried out an in depth analysis of contracts and sales transactions in order to identify and assess any change to the presentation of the sales figure and the rules for recognition over time. This analysis has confirmed Faurecia will operate as an agent for monoliths sales, these sales will then be recorded at net value in the income and total sales would be only added-value sales, as defined by Faurecia. Indeed, these components are used in catalyst and their technical specifications are directly settled between final customer and monoliths producer. They are bought by Faurecia to be integrated to emission control systems sold to final customers without added value. This impact on sales is presented in the Note 4.
Moreover, revenue on tooling will generally be recognized at the transfer of control of these toolings to the customer, usually shortly before serial production starts and development costs will generally be recognized as set up costs for the serial parts production and capitalized, they will then no more be considered as a revenue distinct from product sales, except specific cases depending on the contract with the customer; the corresponding impacts are not significant.
IFRS 9 will not generate any significant impact on the Group financial statements. As regards IFRS 16, analysis are in progress to identify the impact of the standard.
The accounting principles applied are given in each Note hereafter.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions when measuring

certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations. These estimates and assumptions are primarily used when calculating the impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, as well as for measuring pension and other employee benefit obligations. They are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The results of the sensitivity tests carried out on the carrying amounts of goodwill and provisions for pensions and other employee benefits are provided in Notes 10 and 25.2, respectively. In addition, Note 11 "Intangible Assets" describes the main assumptions used for measuring intangible assets.
Value added sales represent total sales excluding monoliths. Monoliths are precious metals and ceramics used in emission control systems.
1.A Consolidation principles
Companies over which the Group exercises significant influence and which are at least 20%-owned are consolidated when one or more of the following criteria are met: annual sales of over 20 million, total assets of over 20 million, and debt of over 5 million.
Non-consolidated companies are not material, either individually or in the aggregate.
Subsidiaries controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 50% of a company's voting rights, and may also arise as a result of shareholders' agreements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated as of the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are no longer consolidated as of the date that control ceases.
Companies over which the Group exercises significant influence but not control, generally through a shareholding representing between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method.
The Faurecia group's financial statements are presented in euros.
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is generally their local currency. The assets and liabilities of these companies are translated into euros at the year-end exchange rate and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in equity.
However certain companies located outside the euro or the US-dollar zone and which carry out the majority of their transactions in euros or US dollars may, however, use euros or US dollars as their functional currency.
All material inter company transactions are eliminated in consolidation, including inter company gains.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method are not significantly different from those applied by the Group.

Note 3 Post-balance sheet events
No significant post-balance sheet events have occurred.

Note 4 Information by operating segment

The Group is structured into three business units based on the nature of the products and services offered:
 Seating (design and manufacture of complete vehicle seats, seating frames and adjustment mechanisms);
 Interiors (design and manufacture of instrument panels, complete cockpits, door panels and modules, and acoustic systems);
 Clean Mobility (design and manufacture of exhaust systems).
These business units are managed by the Group on an independent basis in terms of reviewing their individual performance and allocating resources. The tables below show reconciliation between the indicators used to measure the performance of each segment ­ notably operating income ­ and the consolidated financial statements. Borrowings, other operating income and expense, financial income and expenses, and taxes are monitored at the Group level and are not allocated to the various segments.
4.1 Accounting principles
Sales are recognized when the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the modules or parts produced are transferred. This generally corresponds to when the goods are shipped.
For development contracts or the sale of tooling, sales are recognized when the technical stages are validated by the customer. If no such technical stages are provided for in the contract, sales are recognized when the related study is completed or the tooling is delivered.

Operating margin is the Faurecia group's principal performance indicator.
It corresponds to net income of the fully consolidated companies before:
 the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations (customer relationship,...);
 other non-recurring operating income and expenses, corresponding to material, unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization costs and early retirement costs, the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business, the closure or sale of an industrial site, disposals of non-operating buildings, impairment losses and reversals recorded for property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, as well as other material and unusual losses;
 income on loans, cash investments and marketable securities;
 finance costs;
 other financial income and expenses, which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets, the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges, changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in IAS 39, and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;
 taxes.

Note 8 Corporate income tax

Deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method for temporary differences arising between the tax bases for assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts on the consolidated financial statements. Temporary differences mainly arise from tax loss carryforwards and consolidation adjustments to subsidiaries' accounts.
Deferred taxes are measured using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Corporate income tax can be analyzed as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available in the short or medium term against which the temporary differences or the loss carry forward can be utilized.
When appropriate, a deferred tax liability is booked to cover taxes payable on the distribution of retained earnings of subsidiaries and associates which are not considered as having been permanently reinvested and for which the Group is not in a position to control the date when the timing difference will reverse.

Note 9 Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury stock. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts net income attributable to owners

of the parent and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares (including stock options, free shares and convertible bonds).

The dilutive impact of the bonds was calculated using the treasury stock method.
In relation to stock options, this method consists of comparing the number of shares that would have been issued if all outstanding stock options had been exercised to the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value.

Starting in 2017, the potentially dilutive impact of free shares is taken into account considering the number of shares to be distributed for the plans of which the realization of the performance conditions has already been stated. This impact was not material on the computation of the earnings per share after dilution on previous periods.

Note 10 Goodwill

In case of a business combination, the aggregate value of the acquisition is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value determined at their acquisition date.
A goodwill is recognized when the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceed the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once a year and more often if there is an indication that it may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs). A CGU is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

The CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the level within the operating segment at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The Group has identified the following CGUs:
 Seating;
 Interiors;
 Clean Mobility.
The carrying amount of assets and liabilities thus grouped is compared to the higher of its market value and value in use, which is equal to the present value of the net future cash flows expected, and their net market value including costs of disposal.

Cash generating units and impairment tests
Impairment tests are carried out whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment testing consists of comparing the carrying amount of an asset, or group of assets, with the higher of its market value and value in use. Value in use is defined as the present value of the net future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or group of assets.
The assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units, or CGUs).
Impairment tests are performed on each group of intangible assets (development costs) and property, plant and equipment attributable to a customer contract. This is done by comparing the aggregate carrying amount of the group of assets

concerned with the present value of the expected net future cash flows to be derived from the contract.
An impairment loss is recorded when the assets' carrying amount is higher than the present value of the expected net future cash flows. A provision is also recorded for losses to completion on loss-making contracts.
In case of a triggering event, impairment testing is also carried out on general and corporate assets grouped primarily by type of product and geographic area.
The cash inflows generated by the assets allocated to these CGUs are largely interdependent due to the high overlap among various manufacturing flows, optimization of capacity utilization, and centralization of research and development activities.
Manufacturing assets whose closure is planned are tested independently for impairment.

The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

The cash flow forecasts used to calculate value in use were based on the Group's 2018-2020 strategic plan which was drafted in mid-2017. The volume assumptions used in the 20182020 strategic plan are based on external information sources.
The main assumption affecting value in use is the level of operating income used to calculate future cash flows and particularly the terminal value. The operating margin assumption for 2020 is 8% of value added sales for the Group as a whole.
Projected cash flows for the last year of the Strategic Business Plan (2020) have been projected to infinity by applying a growth rate determined based on analysts' trend forecasts for the automotive market. The growth rate applied for the yearend 2017 test was 1.4% (1.4% applied for 2016).

Faurecia called on an independent expert to calculate the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows. The market parameters used in the expert's calculation were based on a sample of 19 companies operating in the automotive supplier sector (8 in Europe, 5 in the United States and 6 in Asia). Taking into account these parameters and a market risk premium of 7% on average, the weighted cost of capital used to discount future cash flows was set at 9% (on the basis of a range of values provided by the independent expert) in 2017 (9.0% in 2016). This rate was applied for the impairment tests carried out on all of the Group's CGUs. They all bear the same specific risks relating to the automotive supplier sector and the CGUs multinational operation does not justify using geographically different discount rates.
The tests performed at year-end 2017 did not show any indication of further impairment in goodwill.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the impairment test results to changes in the assumptions used as of December 31, 2017 to determine the value in use of the CGUs to which the Group's goodwill is allocated:

Note 11 Intangible assets

A. Research and development expenditure
The Faurecia group incurs certain development costs in connection with producing and delivering modules for specific customer orders which are not considered as sold to the customer, especially when paid for by the customer on delivery of each part. In accordance with IAS 38, these development costs are recorded as an intangible asset where the Company concerned can demonstrate:
 its intention to complete the project as well as the availability of adequate technical and financial resources to do so;
 how the customer contract will generate probable future economic benefits and the Company's ability to measure these reliably;
 its ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the contracts concerned (costs to completion).

These capitalized costs are amortized to match the quantities of parts delivered to the customer, over a period not exceeding five years except under exceptional circumstances.
Research costs, and development costs that do not meet the above criteria, are expensed as incurred.
B. Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include development and purchase costs relating to software used within the Group ­ which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of between one and three years ­ as well as patents and licenses, and the intangible assets acquired in business combinations (customer relationship,...); these assets are amortized on the corresponding contracts duration.

Note 12 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, or production cost in the case of assets produced by the Group for its own use, less accumulated depreciation.
Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except when they increase productivity or prolong the useful life of an asset, in which case they are capitalized.
In accordance with the amended version of IAS 23, borrowing costs on qualifying assets arising subsequent to January 1, 2009 are included in the cost of the assets concerned.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

Buildings Leasehold improvements, fixtures and fittings Machinery, tooling and furniture

20 to 30 years
10 to 20 years 3 to 10 years

Specific tooling is produced or purchased specifically for the purpose of manufacturing parts or modules for customer orders, which are either a) not sold to the customer, or b) paid for by the customer on delivery of each part. In accordance with IAS 16, this tooling is recognized as property, plant and equipment.
It is depreciated to match the quantities of parts delivered to the customer over a maximum of five years, in line with the rate at which models are replaced.
Investment grants are recorded as a deduction from the assets that they were used to finance.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee are recorded under assets at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The recognized assets are subsequently depreciated as described above. An obligation of the same amount is recorded as a liability.

22.2 Share-based payment
A - Stock options
Faurecia has a policy of issuing stock options to the executives of Group companies.

Options are measured at fair value as of the grant date using the Black & Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock options is recognized in payroll costs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period (the period between the grant date and the vesting date), with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
As of December 31, 2017, no stock options were still outstanding.

Movements in the aggregate number of options under all of the plans in force were as follows:

244,200

B - Free share grant
In 2010 Faurecia implemented a share grant plan for executives of Group companies. These shares are subject to service and performance conditions.
Free shares are measured at fair value by reference to the market price of Faurecia's shares at the grant date, less (i) an amount corresponding to the expected dividends due on the shares but not paid during the vesting period and (ii) an

amount reflecting the cost of the shares being subject to a lock-up period. The fair value is recognized in payroll costs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The amount recognized for the period is an expense of 21.1 million, compared to 17.8 million in 2016.

LITIGATION As a reminder, on March 25, 2014, the European Commission and the department of Justice of the United States of America and on November 27, 2014, the Competition Commission of South

Africa, initiated an inquiry covering certain suppliers of emission control systems on the basis for suspicions of anti-competitive practices in this market. Faurecia is one of the companies covered by these inquiries. As communicated by Faurecia on May 2nd, 2017, the European Commission has announced to close the case. The other inquiries are still ongoing.

/ Registration document 2017 65

1 Financial statements
The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

On May 19, 2017, the Brazilian competition authority (the CADE) initiated an inquiry covering Faurecia Emissions Control Technologies do Brazil and some of its former employees, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to the exhaust systems market in Brazil.
The Group has reached agreements in principal with the plaintiffs to settle all three pending class actions which were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against several suppliers of emissions control systems, including group affiliates, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to Exhaust Systems. When finalized with the court, these settlements, for non-significant amounts in line with potential defense costs, will put an end to these class actions.

Two class actions for similar allegations have also been filed in Canada but are at a very preliminary stage.
In the event anti-competitive practices are proven, possible sanctions include fines, criminal charges or civil damages. The Group is at present unable to predict the consequences of such inquiries and class actions, including the level of fines or sanctions that could be imposed: therefore, no accruals were accounted for as of December 31, 2017.
There are no other claims or litigation in progress or pending that are likely to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial position.

25.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits
Group employees may receive, in addition to their pensions in conformity with the applicable regulations in the countries where the Group companies employing them are located, additional benefits or post-retirement benefit obligations. The Group offers these benefits through either defined benefits or defined contribution plans.

The valuation and accounting methodologies followed by the Group are the following:
 for defined contribution plans, costs are recognized as expenses based on contributions;
 the liability for defined benefit plans is determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method, according to the agreements effective in each concerned Group company.

66

/ Registration document 2017

1 Financial statements
The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

The valuation takes into account the probability of employees staying with the Group up to retirement age and expected future salary levels as well as other economic assumptions (such as the inflation rate, the discount rate) for each concerned zone or country. These assumptions are described in Note 25.2.
Benefit obligations are partially funded by contributions to external funds. In cases where the funds are permanently allocated to the benefit plan concerned, their value is deducted from the related liability. An excess of plan assets is only recognized in the balance sheet when it represents future benefits effectively available for the Group.
Periodic pension and other employee benefit costs are recognized as operating expenses over the benefit vesting period.
BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefits plan are recognized in other comprehensive income.
In case of a change in regime, past service costs are fully recognized as operating expenses, the benefits being fully acquired or not.
The expected rate of return of defined benefits plan assets is equal to the discount rate used to value the obligation. This return is recorded in "Other financial income and expense".
The other post-employment benefits mainly cover seniority bonuses as well as health care benefits. The obligation is valued using similar methodology, assumptions and frequency as the ones used for post-employment benefits.

PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
A - Description of the plans
In France, the supplementary pension scheme comprises a defined benefit plan for all managerial employees granting a rent relating to salary tranche C.
In the United States, one plan was settled in May 2017. The two remaining defined benefit pension plans are all closed to new participants, respectively since 1996 and 2002. The first plan covers 647 participants and the second plan covers 350 participants.
In Germany, the main defined benefit pension plan still open covers 5,357 participants. The benefit granted is based on the number of years of service, starting after 14 years.
A specific supplementary pension scheme for Executive Committee members who have an employment contract with Faurecia S.A. or any of its subsidiaries, comprising a defined benefit plan for French members and a defined contribution plan for foreign members, was approved by the Board of Directors on February 11, 2015. It guarantees an annuity based on the reference salary, the Group's operating income, and the budget approved by the Board of Directors.

B - Assumptions used
The Group's obligations under these plans are determined on an actuarial basis, using the following assumptions:
 retirement age between 62 and 65 for employees in France;

26.3 Financing
The main components of Faurecia financing are described below:
2022 BONDS
In 2015, Faurecia issued bonds, due June 15, 2022, carrying annual interest of 3.125%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2015.
A first tranche of these bonds has been issued on March 17, 2015 for 500 million. An additional 200 million bond was issued on April 9, 2015, with the same due date and same coupon, at 100.25% of the nominal value. On May 19, 2015, the bonds of this second tranche were wholly assimilated to those issued on March 17, 2015.
They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA(1) after certain adjustments is lower than twice times the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to those of the syndicated credit loan.
They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds. The bonds benefit from guarantees from some group affiliates; the entities providing these guarantees are the same as those that guarantee the bonds due December 2016. These guarantees have been eliminated with the full redemption of these 2016 bonds.
2023 BONDS
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.

These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.
SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY
On December 15, 2014, Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.
In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2017, this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility includes only one covenant, related to consolidated financial ratios: Net debt(2)/EBITDA(1) must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
Finally, in 2017, Faurecia regularly issued commercial papers with a maturity up to one year for investors located mainly in France.
Faurecia is rated Ba2 by Moody's with positive outlook (issued on October 30, 2017) and BB with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings. On January 31, 2018, Standard & Poor's assigned to Faurecia a BB+ long-term corporate credit ratings, with a stable outlook.

(1) Operating income plus depreciation, amortization and funding of provisions for impairment of property, plant and equipement and intangible assets, corresponding to the past 12 months.
(2) Consolidated net debt.

(1) No financial instruments were transferred between categories in 2016. (2) All of the instruments in this category are financial assets or liabilities designated as measured on initial recognition. * The fair value of the bonds, excluding accrued interest, was established on the basis of the year-end market value (December 31, 2016): for
the 2022 bonds quoted 103.585% of par, at 725.1 million and for the 2023 bonds quoted 104.494% of par, at 731.5 million.

The main measurement methods applied are as follows:
 items accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, as well as hedging instruments, are measured using a valuation technique based on rates quoted on the interbank market, such as Euribor and exchange rates set daily by the European Central Bank;

 financial liabilities are primarily recognized at amortized cost calculated using the effective interest rate method;
 the fair value of trade receivables and payables related to manufacturing and sales operations corresponds to their carrying value given of their very short maturities.

Note 30 Hedging of currency and interest rate risks

30.1 Transactions in foreign currencies and derivatives
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables and payables are converted at the year-end exchange rate. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in the income statement as operating income or expenses for operating receivables and payables, and under "Other financial income and expenses" for other receivables and payables.
Faurecia uses derivative instruments traded on organized markets or purchased over-the-counter from first-rate counterparties to hedge currency and interest rate risks.
They are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet.
30.2 Hedging of currency risks
Currency risks relating to the commercial transactions of the Group's subsidiaries are managed centrally by Faurecia using forward purchase and sale contracts and options as well as foreign currency financing. Faurecia manages the hedging of currency risks on a central basis, through the Group Finance and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.
2017

Currency risks on forecasted transactions are hedged on the basis of estimated cash flows determined when budgets are prepared, validated by Executive Management; these forecasts are updated on a regular basis. The related derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges when there is a hedging relationship that satisfies the IAS 39 criteria.
Subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the euro are granted inter-company loans in their operating currencies. Although these loans are refinanced in euros and eliminated in consolidation, they contribute to the Group's currency risk exposure and are therefore hedged through foreign exchange swaps or financing in the concerned currency.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge future revenues is recorded in equity and taken to operating income when the hedged revenues are received.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge trade receivables and payables are recorded as operating income or expense.
The portion of the change in fair value of these hedges that is ineffective (time value of the hedges) is recorded under "Other financial income and expenses" together with changes in the fair value of instruments used to hedge other receivables and payables.

30.3 Interest-rate hedges
Faurecia manages the hedging of interest rate risks on a central basis. Such management is implemented through the Group Finance and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate hedges are recorded directly in "Other financial income and expenses" when the

hedging relationship cannot be demonstrated under IAS 39, or where the Group has elected not to apply hedge accounting principles.
The table below shows the Group's interest rate position, with assets, liabilities and derivatives broken down into fixed or variable rates. Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and interest rate hedges include interest rate swaps as well as in-the-money options.

The main components of the fixed rate debt are:
 bonds maturing in June 2022, issued in March and April 2015 for a total amount of 700 million;
 bonds maturing in June 2023, issued in April 2016 for a total amount of 700 million.
A significant part of the gross borrowings (syndicated credit facility, sale of receivables, short-term loans, commercial paper as applicable) are at variable or renewable rates. The aim of the Group's interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact of changes in short-term rates on earnings. The hedges

arranged comprise mainly euro-denominated interest rate swaps. In order to benefit from historically low interest rates, initially 2- and 3-year maturity hedges have been set up. These hedges cover a part of the interest on variable rate borrowings, due in 2017 and first quarter of 2018, against a rise in interest rates.
Interest rate hedging instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. Such value is determined based on measurements of market data, confirmed by banking counterparties.

A part of the Group borrowings being at variable rates as stated in Note 26.4, a rise in short-term rates would therefore have an impact on financial expense.
The sensitivity tests performed, assuming a 100 bp increase in average interest rates compared to the rate curve as of

December 31, 2017 show that the effect on net financial expense (before taxes) would not be significant, taking into account the profile of the Group's borrowings and derivatives in place as of December 31, 2017.

30.4 Counterpart risk on derivatives
Faurecia's counterparty risk connection with its derivatives is not significant as the majority of its derivatives are arranged with banks with strong ratings that form part of its banking pool.

1.1.3. Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements

This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers.
This report includes information specifically required by European Regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors.
This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.

These matters were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.
MEASUREMENT OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL
(Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements)

To the Shareholders,
Opinion
In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Faurecia for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2017, and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

Basis of the audit opinion
AUDIT FRAMEWORK
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section of this report entitled "Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements".
INDEPENDENCE
We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the applicable independence rules for the period from January 1, 2017 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular we did not provide any services that are prohibited by Article 5 (1) of regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors in France.

Justification of our assessments ­ key audit matters
In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were most significant in the audit of the consolidated financial statements, as well as how our audit addressed those risks.

92

/ Registration document 2017

Description of risk
The carrying amount of goodwill amounts to 1,217 million at December 31, 2017. Goodwill is allocated to the three cash generating units (CGUs) corresponding to the Group's operating segments: Seating, Clean Mobility, Interiors.
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once a year and more often if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs. A CGU is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment tests are performed to compare the carrying amount of assets and liabilities by group of CGUs with the higher of their value in use (equal to the present value of the net future cash flows expected) and their fair value including costs of disposal.
The cash flow forecasts used were based on the assumptions used to prepare the Group's 2018-2020 strategic plan, approved by the Board of Directors. Assumptions relating to volumes included in the strategic plan, are corroborated by external sources.
For a given group of CGUs, an impairment loss is recognized whenever its recoverable amount falls below its carrying amount.
We considered the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter for the following reasons:
 the amount of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements is material;
 defining the inputs to be used to perform impairment tests requires a high degree of judgment and estimation from management, in particular as regards future cash flows, discount rates (WACC) and long-term growth rates, which are inherently dependent on the economic environment;
 the model used to measure recoverable amount is sensitive to these estimates.
How our audit addressed this risk
We inquired management about any indications of impairment. We assessed the method used by management to determine the recoverable amount of each group of CGUs in order to consider its compliance with IAS 36.

1 Financial statements
The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

With the support of our asset valuation experts, we assessed the reasonableness of the key assumptions used by management to determine projected future cash flows and, in particular:
 compared the key assumptions used with independent market data. The key assumptions, such as discount rates, are used to determine the recoverable amount for the operating segment;
 verified the calculations as well as the main strategic plan data used in impairment testing;
 performed sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amounts calculated by management, in particular with regard to discount rates and the operating margin.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
ACCOUNTING AND RECOVERABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS
(Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements)
Description of risk
Capitalized development costs stood at a net amount of 1,214.5 million at December 31, 2017.
In accordance with IAS 38, development costs incurred in connection with producing and delivering modules for specific customer orders are recorded as an intangible asset pursuant to the conditions set out in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
These capitalized costs are amortized to match the quantities of parts delivered to the customer, over a period not exceeding five years except under exceptional circumstances.
Research costs, and development costs that do not meet the above criteria, are expensed as incurred.
These assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Impairment tests involve comparing the carrying amount of the assets allocated to a customer contract and that of the associated specific tooling to the present value of the expected net future cash flows to be derived from the contract. Future cash flows are also based on the Group's 2018-2020 strategic plan.
We considered impairment testing of development costs to be a key audit matter for the following reasons:
 the amount of capitalized development costs in the consolidated financial statements is material;
 defining the inputs to be used to perform these tests requires a high degree of judgment and estimation from management, in particular as regards future cash flows, discount rates (WACC), and the expected gross margin per program, which are inherently dependent on the economic environment.

How our audit addressed this risk
With regard to the capitalization of development costs:
 we obtained an understanding of the procedures implemented by management to determine the eligibility of development costs for capitalization and analyzed their compliance with IAS 38;
 we performed certain specific testing on a sample of customer programs to evaluate whether the related costs were eligible for capitalization.
With regard to the measurement of the recoverable amount of capitalized development costs:
 we inquired management about any indications of impairment. We assessed the method used by management to determine the recoverable amount of these assets in order to consider its compliance with IAS 36;
 with the support of our asset valuation experts, we assessed the consistency of the key assumptions used by management to determine projected future cash flows for a sample of customer programs and, in particular:
 compared the key assumptions used with independent market data, such as discount rates,
 verified the calculations and reconciled the main data used in impairment testing with strategic plan,
 reconciled the data specific to each program, such as projected delivery quantities and negotiated unit price per product, with the customer contract, where applicable updated to reflect ongoing negotiations.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the relevant Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
(Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements)
Description of risk
As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets stood at 232.6 million at December 31, 2017, while deferred tax liabilities stood at 18.6 million.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available in the short or medium term against which the temporary differences or the loss carryforward can be utilized.
The assessment of the ability to recover net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 (214 million) is based on the Group's 2018-2020 strategic plan for the long-term recovery of tax losses.
The Group's ability to recover deferred tax assets is assessed by management at the end of the year.

/ Registration document 2017 93

1 Financial statements
The Faurecia group - business review and financial statements

We considered the measurement and recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards to be a key matter in our audit due to the importance of the assumptions and judgments used by management to recognize these assets and to the materiality of their amounts at the end of the year.
How our audit addressed this risk
We assessed the consistency of the assumptions used by management to recognize and measure deferred tax assets and their compliance with IAS 12.
With the support of our tax experts, we assessed the probability that the Group will be able to utilize the tax loss carryforwards currently recognized in its balance sheet, in particular with regard to:
 deferred tax liabilities existing in the same tax jurisdiction that may be used to offset existing tax loss carryforwards prior to their expiry date;
 the ability of the Group companies concerned to generate future taxable profit against which the existing tax loss carryforwards can be utilized.
We also assessed the consistency of the main data and assumptions on which taxable income projections underlying the accounting and recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are based.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Verification of information relating to the Group provided in the management report
As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information presented in the management report of the Board of Directors.
We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosures resulting from other legal and regulatory requirements
APPOINTMENT OF STATUTORY AUDITORS
We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Faurecia by the Annual General Meetings of May 27, 2003 (PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit) and June 17, 1983 (ERNST & YOUNG Audit).
As of December 31, 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in the fifteenth consecutive year of its engagement and ERNST & YOUNG Audit was in the thirty-fifth consecutive year of its engagement.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance relating to the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements presenting a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union, as well as for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing any matters relating to its ability to continue as a going concern and for adopting the going concern basis of accounting, unless it intends to liquidate the Company or cease its operations.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the process of preparing financial information and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as any internal audit procedures relating to the preparation and processing of financial and accounting information.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.
Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
OBJECTIVE AND AUDIT APPROACH
Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance corresponds to a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit of the consolidated financial statements does not constitute a guarantee of the longer-term viability or quality of the Company's management.
A more detailed description of our responsibilities as Statutory Auditors in the scope of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is set out in the appendix to this report, and is an integral part hereof.

REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
We submit a report to the Audit Committee that includes a description of the scope of our audit work and the audit program implemented, as well as the resulting findings. We also bring to its attention any material weaknesses that we have identified in internal control procedures relating to the preparation and processing of financial and accounting information.
Our report to the Audit Committee includes an assessment of the risks of material misstatement that we deem to have

been most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which constitute key audit matters. We describe these matters in this report.
We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors in France. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.

Appendix
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
As part of an audit performed in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit.
They also:
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control;
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements;

 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This conclusion is made on the basis of audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in their audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;
 evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;
 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the audit of the consolidated financial statements as well as for the opinion expressed thereon.

In 2017, sales fell slightly, to 290.9 million from 302.2 million in 2016. Since 2010, the parent company has had a pivotal role for the rebilling of services to Group entities and it centralizes the Group's cash management activities.
In addition to providing services to Group subsidiaries, Faurecia invoices trademark royalties, calculated as a proportion of the subsidiaries' sales. These royalties, extended since 2015 to all companies wholly owned by the Group, totaled 92 million in 2017, versus 93 million in 2016.
Results of operations
The Company ended 2017 with a profit of 13.4 million, compared with 26.4 million in 2016.
Net financial income totaled 64.4 million compared to net financial income of 39.9 million in 2016.
This change resulted mainly from an increase in dividends received from the subsidiaries, which jumped from 37.1 million in 2016 to 63.9 million in 2017, due in particular to Faurecia Automotive España, an increase that was partially offset by a net increase in provisions for shares in 2017 amounting to 21.3 million for Faurecia Automotive GmbH, compared to a 5.9 million net reversal in 2016. 2016 also included the recognition of 31.5 million in financing costs for the early redemption of the 2016 bonds.
In 2016, the Company posted a loss of 1.7 million against nonrecurring items, versus a profit of 8.1 million in 2016.
Tax income amounted to 18.3 million, compared with 25.6 million for fiscal year 2016. This corresponds to the tax income recognized from the positive earnings of French subsidiaries that are part of the consolidated tax Group.
Net income for the fiscal year showed a profit of 94.4 million. This compares with a profit of 99.9 million in 2016.

Financial structure and net debt
The main components of the Company's financial structure are the following:
2022 BONDS
In 2015, Faurecia issued bonds, due June 15, 2022, carrying annual interest of 3.125%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2015.
A first part of these bonds was issued on March 17, 2015 for 500 million. An additional 200 million bond was issued on April 9, 2015, with the same due date and same interest rate, at 100.25% of the nominal value. On May 19, 2015, the bonds of this second tranche were wholly assimilated to those issued on March 17, 2015.
They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA(1) after certain adjustments is lower than twice the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to those of the syndicated credit loan.
They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds. The bonds benefit from guarantees from some Group subsidiaries; the entities providing these guarantees are the same as those that guarantee the bonds due December 2016. These guarantees have been eliminated with the full redemption of these 2016 bonds.
2023 BONDS
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.
These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.

(1) Operating income plus depreciation, amortization and funding of provisions for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, corresponding to the past 12 months.

SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY
On December 15, 2014, Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.
In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed, on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2017 this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility contains a single restrictive clause on consolidated financial ratios: the net debt(1)/EBITDA(2) must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's

total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
Finally, in 2017 Faurecia S.A. regularly issued commercial paper to investors, mainly in France, with maturities up to one year.
At December 31, 2017, the shareholders' equity in the Company before distribution of the period's earnings amounted to 3,021.1 million compared to 3,049.4 million at the close of 2016. This is a drop of 28.3 million.
At December 31, 2017, Faurecia's net debt was 215.2 million, factoring in its gross debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and advances net of intra-group cash and loans; this figure was 207.5 million at December 31, 2016.
Trade payables representing 18.4 million included 14 pastdue invoices that were settled after December 31, 2017; trade receivables represented 25.1 million at December 31, 2017, including 5.5 million past due and not settled, mainly with subsidiaries.

Note 1 Summary of significant accounting principles and policies

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles that are widely accepted in France based on the General Accounting System (Autorité des Normes Comptables [ANC] regulation No. 2014-03 of June 5, 2014, on the General Accounting System). The accounting conventions for preparing and presenting parent company financial statements were applied in accordance with the principle of prudence, with the following basic assumptions:
 going concern;
 consistency in accounting policies from one year to the next;
 independence of fiscal years.
The basic method used to assess the information recorded in the books is the historical cost method.
Only material information is shown.
1.1 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES
For the first time, the Company applied ANC regulation No. 2015-05 on financial futures and hedging transactions. This change constitutes a change in accounting policies that must be recognized according to the provisions of Article 122-2 of the General Accounting System. However, in accordance with an option offered by ANC regulation No. 2015-05, the Company decided to limit retrospective changes to transactions that existed as of the first application (January 1, 2017). In the case of the Company, the adoption of new principles has no impact on opening shareholders' equity, so no pro forma information is provided.
1.2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition or production cost. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
 buildings: twenty to thirty years;
 building improvements, fixtures and fittings: seven to ten years;
 other fixtures and fittings: ten years;
 office equipment and computers: three to five years;
 software: one to three years;
 furniture: ten years.
1.3 INVESTMENTS
Equity interests consist of long-term investments that make it possible to control the issuer or exercise significant influence, or that make it possible to establish business relations with the issuer.

Gross value is equal to contribution value or cost. Impairment is established if the value in use of the equity interests held fall below its entry value. Value in use is based on the subsidiary's revalued net assets, profitability and future outlook.
For investments intended to be sold, value-in-use estimates also take into account prices at which prior transactions were carried out, if any.
1.4 MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RELATED RECEIVABLES
Marketable securities are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
1.5 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Unhedged payables and receivables in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. At the balance sheet date, they are remeasured at the year-end exchange rate. Gains or losses resulting therefrom are recognized under "Unrealized foreign exchange losses" for unrealized losses and under "Unrealized foreign exchange gains" for unrealized gains. Unrealized translation adjustments are subject to a provision in the amount of the unhedged risk.
1.6 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at their par value.
1.7 PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The vested rights of employees under supplementary pension and retirement bonus plans are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The valuation takes into account the probability of employees staying with the Company up to retirement age and expected future compensation levels. In cases where the funds are permanently allocated to the benefit plan concerned, their value is deducted from the related liability.
1.8 NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Unusual or non-recurring items are included under "Nonrecurring income" and "Non-recurring expense".
1.9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Interest-rate risks are hedged, where appropriate, using financial instruments traded on organized or over-the-counter markets.
Hedging gains and losses are recognized on a symmetrical basis with the loss or gain on the hedged item.

15.3 Free share grant plans
Free share grant plans are set up for managers and professionals who perform management duties in Group companies. These shares are subject to presence and performance conditions.

The plan's performance conditions set by the Board of Directors' meeting of July 24, 2013, were fulfilled, so the corresponding 947,050 shares were granted in July 2017 through the distribution of treasury shares in accordance with the Board of Directors' decisions. The cost of these shares was reinvoiced by the Company to the subsidiaries employing the beneficiaries, except for those in countries where this reinvoicing was impossible.
To date, there is no decision by the Board of Directors on the terms and conditions of distribution for future plans (treasury shares or capital increase).
The performance conditions for the plan attributed by the Board of July 28, 2014 have been met, the corresponding shares, i.e. 761,865 will be distributed in July 2018.

Details of the other share grant plans as of December 31, 2017, are set out in the table below:

(1) Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits cover the following costs payable by the Company on retirement of employees: c post-retirement benefit obligations; c supplementary pensions paid to some employees.

For the latter, it is freed of its commitments by a capital stock deduction that covers the annuity for the insurance company, which is responsible for the service; the deduction is made from a fund established to cover pension schemes which are not yet fully acquired. Consequently, the Company has no further pension commitments towards former employees.

The actuarial valuation was carried out by independent actuaries. Calculations were based on a discount rate of 1.5% an inflation rate of 1.8%.
The change in the provision in 2015 was mainly due to the commitment relating to the specific supplementary pension scheme for Executive Committee members, comprising a defined benefits pension scheme for members who are French nationals and a defined contribution pension scheme for those who are foreign nationals, which was approved during the year. It guarantees an annuity based on the amount of the reference compensation.

The main components of the Company's financial structure are the following:
2022 Bonds
In 2015, Faurecia issued bonds, due June 15, 2022, carrying annual interest of 3.125%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2015.
A first part of these bonds has been issued on March 17, 2015 for 500 million. An additional 200 million bond was issued on April 9, 2015, with the same due date and same coupon, at 100.25% of the nominal value. On May 19, 2015, the bonds of this second tranche were wholly assimilated to those issued on March 17, 2015.

They include a covenant restricting the additional indebtedness if the EBITDA(1) after certain adjustments is lower than twice the gross interest costs, and restrictions on the debt similar to those of the syndicated credit loan.
They are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds. The bonds benefit from guarantees from some Group subsidiaries; the entities providing these guarantees are the same as those that guarantee the bonds due December 2016. These guarantees have been eliminated with the full redemption of these 2016 bonds.

(1) Operating income plus depreciation, amortization and funding of provisions for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, corresponding to the past 12 months.

Faurecia parent company ­ business review and financial statements

2023 Bonds
On April 1, 2016, Faurecia issued bonds for an amount of 700 million due June 15, 2023, carrying annual interest of 3.625%, payable on June 15 and December 15 each year, as from June 15, 2016.
They are also listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Global Exchange Market). The costs related to the bond issue are expensed in P&L over the life time of the bonds.
These bonds benefit from the same restrictions as the 2022 bonds and do not benefit from guarantees issued by subsidiaries.
Syndicated credit facility
On December 15, 2014 Faurecia signed a syndicated credit facility, with a five-year maturity, for an amount of 1,200 million. This credit facility was renegotiated on June 24, 2016, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, or June 24, 2021 and improve its terms and conditions.

In accordance with the credit documentation, all guarantees issued by some Group subsidiaries in favor of banks participating in this credit facility were eliminated when the bonds due in December 2016 were fully redeemed, on April 12, 2016.
As of December 31, 2017 this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility contains a single restrictive clause on consolidated financial ratios: the net debt(1)/EBITDA(2) must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Group complied with this ratio.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
Finally, in 2017 Faurecia regularly issued commercial paper to investors, mainly in France, with maturities up to one year.

Note 21 Financial instruments used to hedge market risks

21.1 Interest-rate hedges
The Company manages hedging of interest rate risks on a central basis. Such management is implemented through the Group Financing and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.

For its variable rate loans, the Company hedges arranged comprise mainly euro-denominated interest rate swaps, designed to hedge interest payable on variable rate borrowings.

The notional amounts of the Group's interest rate hedges break down as follows:

21.2 Hedging of currency risks
Currency risks relating to the commercial transactions of the Company's subsidiaries are managed centrally by Faurecia using forward purchase and sale contracts and options as well as foreign currency financing. Such centralized management is implemented through the Group Financing and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis:

 Currency risks on forecasted transactions are hedged on the basis of estimated cash flows determined when budgets are prepared, validated by Executive Management; these forecasts are updated on a regular basis;
 Currency risk on inter-company loans and borrowings to/from subsidiaries outside the eurozone that are denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency but referenced in euros is hedged through swaps.

1.2.4. Statutory Auditors' report on the financial statements

This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers.
This report includes information specifically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors.
This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.
To the Shareholders,
Opinion
In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Faurecia for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.
The opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
Basis of the audit opinion
AUDIT FRAMEWORK We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section of this report entitled «Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements».
INDEPENDENCE We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the applicable independence rules for the period from January 1st, 2017 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular we did not provide any services that are prohibited by Article 5(1) of regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors in France.
Justification of our assessments ­ key audit matters
In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your

attention the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were most significant in the audit of the financial statements, as well as how our audit addressed those risks.
These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.
ASSESSMENT OF VALUE IN USE OF EQUITY INTERESTS
(Note 1.2 to the financial statements)
DESCRIPTION OF RISK
The balance of investments at December 31, 2017 represented 3,177 million, representing 48% of the assets on the balance sheet.
As stated in Note 1.2 to the financial statements, the gross value of these investments is equal to contribution value or cost. An impairment loss is recorded if the value-in-use of these investments is lower than its entry value. Value-in-use is based on the revalued net assets, profitability and the future outlook.
For investments intended to be sold, value-in-use estimates also take into account prices at which prior transactions were carried out, if any.
Due to the materiality of these assets on the balance sheet, and the inherent uncertainty of specific inputs applicable to the assessment of their value in use, in particular the likelihood of achieving the discounted cash flows forecast by management in its three-year Business Plan, we considered the assessment of the value in use of equity interests to be a key audit matter.
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THIS RISK
We assessed the methods used by management to determine the value-in-use of each of these equity investments.
We obtained management's most recent Business Plans and the impairment tests for each of the significant equity interests in order to assess the valuations based on forecasts.
We assessed the consistency of the key assumptions used to measure expected future cash flows and in particular:
 compared, with support from our asset evaluation experts, the key assumptions used by management with independent market data, such as discount rates and the long-term growth rate;
 verified the calculations used in the impairment tests performed by management;
 reconciled the main strategic plan data used in impairment testing with the specific data for each entity.
For those valuations based on historical data, we assessed the consistency of the equity values used with the financial statements of the entities concerned, and considered that any adjustments to equity were based on documentary evidence.

Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the annual financial statements
OBJECTIVE AND AUDIT APPROACH
Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements taken as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance corresponds to a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit of the financial statements does not constitute a guarantee of the longer-term viability or quality of the company's management.
A more detailed description of our responsibilities as Statutory Auditors in the scope of the audit of the financial statements is set out in the appendix to this report, and is an integral part hereof.

REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
We submit a report to the Audit Committee that includes a description of the scope of our audit work and the audit program implemented, as well as the resulting findings. We also bring to its attention any material weaknesses that we have identified in internal control procedures relating to the preparation and processing of financial and accounting information.
Our report to the Audit Committee includes an assessment of the risks of material misstatement that we deem to have been most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute key audit matters. We describe these matters in this report.
We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6 of regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in Articles L. 822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors in France. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.

Appendix
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
As part of an audit performed in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also:
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the entity's financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control;

 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the Notes to the financial statements;
 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This conclusion is made on the basis of audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in their audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;
 evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

2 Risks and risk control
Participants and systems

2.1. Participants and systems

The Audit Committee, which is tasked with overseeing the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems (which are not limited to accounting and financial risks), informs the Board of Directors of the main actions taken by

the Group in this realm. Other participants provide information to the Audit Committee which conducts every year a formal review of the internal control and risk management systems.

2.1.1. Operations management

 The Group's Executive Committee examines the major operational risks inherent to the Group's business during the monthly meetings of the Operations Committees, and at least once per year it reviews the risk mapping prepared by the Risk Committee.

 The Executive Management of each Business Group is responsible for identifying and managing operational risks inherent to its business which are reviewed every month by its Operations Committee.

2.1.2. Functional departments

Focusing on their specific domains, the Group's functional departments are responsible for complying with current regulations and standards, improving their processes and working with the other departments in order to improve crossfunctional processes.
Finance department
PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group finance department, which reports to the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for outlining the rules and procedures, consolidating the financial statements, managing cash and financing, and carrying out management control, internal control and internal audits.
It is responsible for performing the following tasks:
 determining the Group's accounting and financial standards in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the tax provisions and accounting standards specific to each country, and ensuring compliance with them;
 preparing the annual statutory financial statements, the monthly consolidated financial statements and, more specifically, the interim and financial information to be reported;
 outlining, improving and ensuring enforcement of the internal control procedures needed to produce reliable accounting information. These procedures include a generalization of physical inventory taking at least once a year, the separation of tasks, and strict monitoring of access to accounting transactions based on the different businesses;
 managing and improving the information systems used to produce accounting and financial data.

The Country or Regional Chief Financial Officers that manage the shared financial service centers are responsible for:
 the production of the financial and accounting statements for all the units within their scope, in compliance with IFRS and local standards and the closure dates defined by the Group;
 compliance with and improvement to the internal control procedures specific to their scope;
 strengthening the role and skills of the accounting function;
 close collaboration with operational sites within their scope in order to work with them to solve internal control issues and to improve the overall effectiveness of the financial process.
Internal and financial controllers are stakeholders in the Group's strategy and sales, R&D and industrial activities at all levels and report hierarchically to site, Division and Business Group managers and functionally to the Group finance department. Through their function, they are stakeholders in the definition and achievement of the operational objectives.
This organization between, on the one hand, shared services responsible for producing the financial statements and complying with the standards, and on the other, the controllers considered as co-pilots for the management of operational entities, enables a real separation of tasks and a better development of skills in each role, resulting in better overall effectiveness and reduced risk of fraud.

/ Registration document 2017

2 Risks and risk control
Participants and systems

The following principles are implemented across the Group to prepare financial statements:
 completeness of transaction processing;
 transaction compliance with applicable accounting principles;
 periodic review of assets.
FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS
The goal of the reporting process is to provide all the financial and nonfinancial information needed to manage the Group and disclose the financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the rules decreed by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). A "reporting glossary" describes the content of all reporting data, and procedures explain how reporting should be conducted.
MONTHLY REPORTING
The HFM consolidation system provides for the reporting of both financial information (income statement and balance sheet data) and non-financial information (such as indicators relating to quality, production, purchasing, safety, human resources, etc.). Each business unit reports its final results of operations four days after the end of the month in accordance with Group standards. Every month, the Operations Committee reviews the operational performance and action plans of each Business Group.
BUDGET AND STRATEGIC PLAN
The Group draws up a five-year sales plan each year, in which programs play an essential role. This plan discusses the Group's business outlook by business and product line, and the Group's resources and profitability. It is consolidated using the same tool as for monthly reporting and it is also used to define the budgetary targets for the following year.
In order to effectively anticipate short-term changes and improve responsiveness, monthly reporting includes a rolling forecast for the income statement and cash flow statement for the current and subsequent quarters.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
High-performing information systems are vital given the volume of information that is processed, the quality and integrity required for the processed data, and ever-shortening deadlines for preparing the financial reporting. Since 2007, Faurecia has been using a Group ERP based on SAP software. This system is now used on all accounting platforms and covers most of the Group's industrial sites.
All the sites now comply with the so-called "Core Model", which entirely uses SAP for the processes of order placement and receipt, inventory management and valuation, delivery, invoicing, accounting and an increasing portion of operational reporting.
Other processes, such as upstream management of purchases, transportation management and career management, are expected to be incorporated into the SAP tool in the coming years.

Internal control
At the Faurecia group, internal control is a mechanism that encompasses a set of resources, behaviors, training, procedures and actions that aim to prevent risks that are likely to:
 have an impact on financial and accounting information published by the Group;
 cause damage to the Group's image and reputation;
 expose the Group to regulatory or legal sanctions from the various jurisdictions and competition authorities of the countries in which it operates;
 threaten the Group's employees and ecosystem (risk of kidnapping, natural disasters, epidemics, environmental risks);
 prevent the Group's customers from producing, delaying their production or hindering their product and service performance (critical equipment breakdown, quality risks, delay in product development);
 prevent the Group from being able to continue to finance its operations (loss of cash);
 threaten the confidentiality of the information held by the Group on its own behalf (intellectual property, data on technologies, financial data) or with regard to its employees (personal data).
TASKS OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The main responsibilities of the Internal Control department are:
 participating in projects to improve cross-functional processes (transportation, protection of the access and rights associated with IT applications, improving IT tools, etc.);
 training on internal control, some of which are now offered by Faurecia University, Faurecia's internal training center, particularly e-learning modules. As of October 2017, the "basic" module is mandatory for all Group executives;
 self-assessment campaigns touching all corporate management cycles (business management, direct and indirect purchases, inventory management, management of property, plant and equipment, salary management, tracking of standard costs, information system management, management of expats and other personnel transfers, etc.). A self-assessment questionnaire addressing the most important control items for the operational sites (plants and R&D centers) was disseminated in 2017 in order to help these sites strengthen their internal control mechanism (methods of proof, identification of weaknesses and corresponding action plans, local governance);
 regular communication with operational entities, functional departments and the Executive Committee in order to educate all the disciplines about the most important topics at the time (fraud, improvement actions, best practices, etc.).

/ Registration document 2017 123

2 Risks and risk control
Participants and systems

Internal control representatives are present at several levels of the organization (Group, Business Groups, Divisions, shared financial service centers) in order to support the approach without taking on the responsibilities of operations management.
PROCEDURES
Internal control is based on a set of principles and procedures: Group culture (Being Faurecia), which is grounded in six key values and the Code of Ethics, the Management Code and the Faurecia Excellence System (FES), which is its operational pillar that shapes how Group employees all over the world work and that structures the Group's identity.
The documentation on which the internal control system is based, is made up of the following items, which can all be accessed on the Group's intranet:
 the Code of Ethics and the Management Code;
 the Managers Empowerment, which outlines six general cross-functional principles for managers in some key areas: Acquire a new program; Assess Managers and Professionals; Decide on Capital Expenditures; Decide on Exceptional items; Manage Managers and Professionals Compensation; Staff Managers and Professional positions;
 the Faurecia Core Procedures (FCP) are set out within nine processes developed by each Group division respecting a common general framework and apply to all subsidiaries controlled by the Group. They are regularly updated and continually enhanced. The nine processes are as follows:
 Production Control and Logistics,
 Purchasing,
 Quality and HSE (Health, Safety and Environment),
 PMS (Program Management System) and Engineering,
 Sales and Marketing,
 Communication,
 Finance,
 Human Resources,
 Information Technology;
 Faurecia's Alert Management System (AMS) immediately informs Business Group management teams and, if necessary, the Group Executive Committee of any problems encountered in production and program management. This system also ensures a prompt and structured response including problem solving which the organization capitalizes.
GOVERNANCE
Internal control reports on its work and sustains the connection between the disciplines in the form of the Internal Control Governance Committee, which holds monthly meetings chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. This committee also includes the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the director of Internal Audit, the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officers of the Business Groups.

Its work is also reviewed at least once a year by the Board of Directors' Audit Committee and the Executive Committee.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit department assesses the effectiveness of the internal control and governance mechanism and checks that Group procedures are in compliance with local laws and regulations. It uses the Group's risk mapping to shape its tasks.
The Internal Audit department is under the responsibility of the Group Chief Financial Officer, with an option to directly alert the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Once per year, it submits the audit schedule to the Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for approval. Every quarter, it presents completed reports and the achievement of its objectives. It also reports to them regularly on the progress of its work and the measures taken to achieve its objectives. It reports to the Audit Committee at least twice per year on the result of its work and its schedule of actions.
Located at the Group's headquarters, it also has regional teams based in France, Germany, the United States and China.
It conducts its assignments wholly independently and systematically substantiates its findings with specific facts that have been duly verified. The recommendations it sends to the audited sites are monitored through (i) an assessment through a questionnaire completed six and 12 months after the final report, and (ii) an on-site post-audit if one is deemed necessary.
In 2005, the Internal Audit department drew up an Internal Audit Charter, which was reviewed in 2017 and which defines its roles and mission, its field of competence, and the audit methodology used.
Compliance and risk management
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
Faurecia is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact. Consequently, the Group is committed to aligning its operations and strategy with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment, and anti-corruption. This commitment is reasserted in Faurecia's Code of Ethics, which was updated in 2014 as part of the rollout of the Being Faurecia program, intended to strengthen the Group's culture and contribute to the creation of long-term value. The Management Code, which was established at that time to guide the day-to-day management of teams, customers and also suppliers, translated many of the principles set out in the Code of Ethics into operations. Each new employee receives a copy of the Code, which is available in the Group's main working languages and may also be accessed on the Group's corporate website and intranet site.

124

/ Registration document 2017

2 Risks and risk control
Participants and systems

The Code of Ethics is structured around four topics: respect of fundamental rights, development of economic and social dialog, skills development, ethics and rules of conduct. It is part of the Faurecia Core Procedures (FCP), and aims to develop accountability and employee empowerment.
The Compliance department is responsible for improving understanding of the Code of Ethics and Management Code within the Group.
This department, which was created in 2015, falls under the remit of the Chief Compliance Officer and relies on the regional compliance managers for North America, Mexico, Asia, and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa). It also relies on a network of compliance leaders, who are contact people in each operational division of the Business Groups.
It is associated with the Chief Executive Officer and is in charge of establishing an appropriate oversight system, outlining and rolling out the compliance plan identified in 2016, and disseminating its training and corresponding procedures regarding compliance.
In 2016, the Compliance department introduced an online training (MOOC), "Ethics", targeting the community of 17,000 M&Ps (managers and professionals, and in 2017, the "Antitrust" and "Internal Control Basics" MOOCs were launched.
In 2017, how-to guides on reporting and managing conflicts of interest and on the internal whistle-blowing procedure on allegations of noncompliance with the Code of Ethics were also issued.
WHISTLE-BLOWING PROCEDURE
The Code of Ethics provides a mechanism for the purpose of managing violations.
Any employee who becomes aware of a breach of the rules set out in the Code may use the whistle-blowing procedure; they may refer to their line manager or HR director verbally or in writing.
Depending on the nature and importance of the events reported, additional investigations may be launched, an inquiry may be set up or an Internal Audit decided upon.
The Code of Ethics also states that employees may use an external whistle-blowing procedure.
The scope of the external whistle-blowing procedure is limited to acts that relate to serious risks for the Group in terms of accounting, financial audit and anti-corruption. Given their importance, serious acts that compromise the bodily security or moral integrity of employees may also be taken into consideration as part of this external whistle-blowing procedure.

Therefore, any Group employees who are aware of a violation of rules on one of these items may report it through the external whistle-blowing procedure.
This external whistle-blowing procedure may be initiated only for situations that are likely to seriously affect the Group's business or seriously incur its liability.
The external whistle-blowing procedure prompts employees to contact through postal mail or e-mail an outside organization to which Faurecia has delegated the tasks of collecting information and conducting an initial processing of this whistleblowing procedure.
This organization has taken steps to ensure compliance with the principles and rules on data protection that are applicable in France and the European Union.
If the acts cited do not fall within the scope of the external whistle-blowing procedure, the alert will be destroyed immediately. On the other hand, if the acts cited do apply to the areas identified for this alert and if their importance justifies it, the outside organization will submit the case to the Faurecia group through its CEO.
The CEO may ask a member of his team to launch an investigation in order to assess the truthfulness and extent of the acts cited. The Internal Audit may be commissioned to complete the necessary investigations.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is handled by the Group Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. The main tasks of the Risk Committee are to update the risk map, ensure that the corresponding prevention plans are established and implemented and, more broadly, to ensure that the risks are monitored from one half year to the next.
The Risk Committee meets biannually and is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the director of Internal Audit, the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel and the Head of Internal Control are also members of this committee. Depending on the agenda, the risk prevention plan coordinators are also invited to attend meetings.
The Risk Committee's work is also reviewed at least once a year by the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee. The risks monitored by this committee are associated with safety to persons, quality, program management, IT risk, the reliability of supplies, asset protection and fire risk, exposure of industrial sites to certain types of natural disasters, international exposure of employees to health and safety risks, the reliability of financial information, compliance, the environment.

/ Registration document 2017 125

2 Risks and risk control
Participants and systems

In an effort to progress and improve the mechanism, the risk map is reviewed regularly and the inclusion of new risks is submitted to the Audit Committee.
In 2016, the Group appointed a risk manager, who reports to the Group Chief Compliance Officer. With the assistance of coordinators who have been appointed for each risk in the risk map, he oversees the prevention plans that have been established and reviewed by the Committee and manages the network of risks identified by the Group.
In 2017, the Group started the Faurecia Enterprise Risk Management Program (ERM) to define and oversee risk management actively and consistently. This program is adapted for all types of risk, no matter what their exposure and impacts, and applies to operational, financial, strategic, reputation and legal risks.
The ERM program has also been translated into five Faurecia Core Procedures; the related process, known as the ERM System, is constructed in a step-by-step approach and provides

the method that must be followed by each risk coordinator and the functions responsible for risks.
Since 2017, the issues monitored by the Risk Committee have been entered in a risk register.
Legal department
The Legal department consists of a team located in France and the main countries where the Group conducts business. It relies on legal practitioners who are experts in their field (competition, M&A, intellectual property, corporate, IT), teams of legal practitioners who focus on the work of the Business Group and a network of multidisciplinary legal practitioners who are responsible for the Group's different regions.
The Legal department draws on these diverse skills, constant legal oversight and the implementation of control and reporting processes to ensure the security of the Group's operations.

2.1.3. External participants

The mechanism outlined above is supplemented by the participation of external participants, including:
 the Statutory Auditors;
 third-party organizations which carry out the following certification processes for the entire Group over a threeyear cycle:
 environment (ISO 14001),
 quality (ISO TS/IATF).

 engineers from fire and property insurance companies who conduct a biennial audit on each of the Group's sites to:
 assess fire risks and any potential impact on production and customers,
 assess whether the prevention and protection measures in place are adequate,
 issue recommendations to reduce risks.

Description of main risks

2.2. Description of main risks

2.2.1. Operational and industrial risks

Risk associated with the automotive supplier business
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
The business of the Faurecia group, which manufactures and sells original automotive equipment for its automaker customers, is directly related to the level of sales and automotive production of each of its customers, which depends on many factors: the overall level of consumption of goods and services on a given market, trust in the economic actors on this market, level of vehicle buyers' access to credit and any existing government programs (i.e., programs to support the automotive industry or vehicle purchase incentive programs).
Therefore, the Group's sales and results of operations correlate directly to the performance of the automotive market in the major regions where the Group and its customers are located.
Faurecia's risk is also tied to the commercial success of the models for which the Group produces components and modules. At the end of a model's life cycle, the risk is also linked to the uncertainty of whether its products will be taken up again for the replacement model.
In addition, the orders placed with the Group are binding supply contracts for open orders without any guarantees in terms of volume, that is to say with no guarantee of minimum volume. They are generally based on the life of the vehicle model concerned. The Group could therefore be required to make certain investments which may not be offset by customer order volumes.
Thus the Group must continually adapt to the business and needs of its customers in terms of supply, production, services and research and development.
Finally, changes in the automotive sector could accelerate the concentration of automakers, ultimately resulting in the disappearance of certain brands or vehicle models for which the Group produces equipment. Major Group customers may also face a business slowdown resulting from a variety of situations, such as claims against some automakers with regard to emissions testing. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant impact on the Faurecia group's sales, results and future prospects.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Given its market share and diversified international presence, the Faurecia group has a natural potential to weight its customer risk.
Faurecia thus seeks to optimize the quality and diversity of its customer portfolio.
In 2017, the Faurecia group's four largest automaker customers accounted for 63.8% of value-added sales (Ford: 18.3%; VW: 17.8%; Renault-Nissan: 14.0% and PSA: 13.7%).
The Group also relies on the diversification of its sales by region by vehicle brand and model.
In addition, each Business Group monitors the competition on an ongoing basis so that it can respond in the best possible way to calls to tender from automakers and, in particular, to their specific demands for the supply of complex equipment.
Faurecia stays competitive through innovation and efficiency in product development. As a result, gross R&D expenditures totaled 1,152.3 million in 2017 (6.8% of value-added sales). The share of innovation grew over the same period. It amounted to 160 million.
The Group also uses a forward management method (fiveyear sales plan, yearly and half-yearly budget, monthly reviews) which enables it to fine-tune its means of production.

If one or more of the Group's main suppliers were to go bankrupt, or experience an unforeseen stock-out, quality problems, a strike or any other incident disrupting its supplies for which it were liable, this could impact Faurecia's production output or image, or lead to additional costs that would affect the Group's business, results and overall financial position.
In addition, should the Group, or one of its suppliers or service providers, default at any stage of the manufacturing process, Faurecia could be held liable for failure to fulfill its contractual obligations or for technical problems. The Group's driving motivation and its inherent supplier management strategy

Description of main risks

involve enacting a consistent, ongoing approach that helps not only to reduce, or even avoid, risks, but above all to generate over the medium and long terms a constant improvement in its value chain that, by benefiting Faurecia and its suppliers and sub-suppliers, allows them to experience sustainable technical, production and financial growth.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Faurecia group uses a large number of suppliers based in different countries for its raw materials and basic parts supplies.
In 2017, out of a total of 9,190 million in purchases (production and indirect purchases excluding monolith sales) from approximately 2,500 main suppliers, the 10 biggest suppliers together accounted for 25% of the Business Groups' combined purchases and 13% of value-added sales.
Purchases from the five biggest suppliers of each of the Business Groups together accounted for 16% of total purchases and 9% of value-added sales.
In this same year, purchases from the biggest supplier of each of the Business Groups together accounted for 6% of total purchases and 3% of value-added sales.
Faurecia closely monitors the quality and reliability of suppliers' production operations as well as their credit status and sustainability in order to ensure that the Group's supply chain is secure.
Suppliers' operational and financial performance is monitored on an ongoing basis so that any restructuring and protection measures that may prove to be required in order to achieve security of supply (quantities and costs) can be successfully taken.
Risk is also managed holistically, taking into account geopolitical, social, ethical, economic and financial risks, and monitoring specific factors related either to the supplier, such as management of fire risk, or to the management of the supplier itself, such as monitoring the level of business it handles.
Within this context, Faurecia's purchasing teams help suppliers to expand and to reduce their risks on both an industrial and a financial level, in particular, by providing operational support to improve their efficiency, quality, logistics, and cost control by means of specialist teams working with suppliers on their own premises. These teams also support suppliers in their international expansion. In addition, any new order placed with a supplier is the result of a Sourcing Committee decision following an investigation which includes an assessment of the risks associated with said supplier and supplier panel policy is, furthermore, monitored by a specialist product family purchasing organization.
Over time, suppliers will also be managed through the implementation of the duty of care plan stipulated by the French Law of March 27, 2017, on the duty of care by parent companies and ordering companies (see Section 4.3.3 of this Registration Document).

Program risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Most of the contracts entered into by Faurecia are awarded after a call for tenders put out by an automaker to supply complex equipment, to which Faurecia responds in the form of a Request for Quotation (RFQ).
Every contract entered into with a customer constitutes a "program" whose production phase, at the outcome of the development phase, may last from 5 to 10 years.
Every program is subject to control procedures and tools throughout its duration that aim to identify and eliminate the risks of implementation and reduction in profitability.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Program Management Core System (PMCS) lays out a strict succession of steps for the entire duration of a program, from bid processing to the end of product life.
As part of the bid procedure, a risk assessment is done in order to determine in advance, based on a list of 28 preset criteria and with an established oversight structure, the nature and level of the risks that should be eliminated during the program's development phase.
Program reviews are carried out monthly within each division and Business Group to define and monitor action plans, including the plans to eliminate the execution risks that are identified during the acquisition phase.
For each program:
 a prospective financial analysis is carried out in the form of a Business Plan regularly updated from the bid phase to the end of product life, which provides profitability indicators for the program over its life cycle;
 monthly indicators to measure its operational and financial performance are monitored. Each of these indicators is then consolidated by the Group;
 from the alert management system (AMS), which helps identify any major deviances from the program and the monitoring of their resolution;
 from reviews at each phase of development, Gate Review, by the Program Review committee and throughout the entire program following the process defined by the PMCS.
Each development center is also audited biannually by the Group on a representation sample of programs at different stages of development to formally evaluate the compliance of the PMCS.

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

Quality and safety risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Faulty products that are delivered or manufactured may alter the production of Group customers or incur additional costs that have repercussions on the Group's business, results or financial position. Under such circumstances, the Group is exposed, among other things, to the risk of actions to enforce a warranty, particularly following vehicle recalls.
Furthermore, as part of Faurecia's production activities, personnel are exposed to a variety of risks, including accidents, occupational illnesses or illnesses related to the workplace environment in general that may affect their health or bodily security.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Faurecia group manages quality and safety process and product risks from new order acquisition phases to manufacturing in the plants. The Group Quality department is responsible for this management at all stages of the process. It is present at all levels of organization from the multidisciplinary team developing new programs or the production plant up to the Group's management structure.
Specific indicators with monthly reports assess the risks, generate improvement plans, and mainstream actions to prevent major risks at all levels of organization. Faurecia sets annual safety targets in order to further reduce accident and quality risks, meet customers' needs and boost operational efficiency.
For major problems, the AMS alert system must be used.
A structured problem solving culture (immediate response within 24 hours and identification of root technical and management causes, Alert Closure) is constantly being developed by Faurecia's management: QRCI (Quick Response Continuous Improvement). Initially deployed to professionally handle quality problems, it has been extended to all opportunities to improve business operations, programs, HSE, scrap, inventory, deliveries, etc.
The Group's quality management has a structure of reviewers that is independent to Business Group operations organizations to conduct reviews on both production plants and R&D centers. They use a precise and rigorous questionnaire to assess the application and maturity of the FES's implementation. Assessment guidelines and Group procedures are regularly updated to reflect the changing needs of customers and weaknesses identified in the organization.
Each production site is rated either "Poor/Satisfactory/Excellent/ Benchmark". If a site is rated "Poor", it is required to prepare a corrective action plan which is presented directly to Faurecia's CEO with a view to reaching a "Satisfactory" level within a maximum of three months.

The Group's Quality department also conducts assessments and/or provides specific coaching in case of significant deviations in quality performance on the affected sites and a report and corrective action plan are submitted to Executive Management.
Risk related to the use of IT systems
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
The business processes associated with orders, supplies and invoicing are handled through central enterprise resource planning (ERP) using SAP for most Group entities.
In addition to this ERP, Faurecia uses the Hyperion application to consolidate financial data to have a complete and uniform picture of the accounting and financial data.
As such, the Group uses central and common systems and applications, and any malfunctions in them can impact the Group's business. There are other risks that fall under the general category of cybercrime: hacking, intrusion, data theft, fake president fraud, etc.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The ERP based on the SAP solution (known as Faurecia Core System) and the associated procedures meet the needs and constraints of the local entities as well as those of the Group while guaranteeing the integrity and traceability of the accounting and financial data. A specific procedure to control the separation of tasks for all entities and areas was deployed during 2016. This procedure is audited regularly in order to maintain efficiency. Preventative and subsequent controls are carried out using this software primarily in order to manage access to sensitive data and ensure strict separation of functional tasks: implementation of a computerized validation system for orders at several levels depending on the amount in question, centralized management of supplier standards by a specific team using a validation process with several stages.
As part of their audit of the financial statements, Faurecia's Statutory Auditors perform a review of some aspects of internal control in relation with the ERP SAP and the Hyperion application. This review covers in particular general IT controls such as access to the applications and data, change and operations management, as well as tests on some application controls.
Furthermore, all projects regarding information systems are subject to a specific methodology (PRMS for "Program Reporting Management System") to ensure regular control and monitoring of the projects associated with the strong governance principles and the appropriate tools.

/ Registration document 2017 129

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

In addition, particular attention is paid to the security and associated processing of computer data. The IT organization endeavors to constantly improve the levels of controls in order to guarantee in particular:
 protection against unauthorized access to connection applications;
 necessary controls to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data;
 the security and restoration if necessary of the data circulating within the information system;
 a separation of responsibilities between network administration, application development and server management;
 the availability of the services and systems. In order to guarantee service continuity at all times and to protect the Company's data and key processing, Faurecia has set up an emergency processing center for the major applications as part of a Disaster Recovery Plan. This center is active only in the event of a major problem in the main center.
Finally, a special program was rolled out in 2017 to limit cybercrime risks.
The main areas that fall under this program are:
 strengthened control of the management of access to the information systems (reinforcement of the password and antivirus management policy);
 separation between the industrial network and administrative network;
 establishment of a SOC (Security Operations Center) that can supervise flow over the network and generate alerts if needed;
 strengthening of security of mobile devices (PC and smartphones);
 data protection (classification, control of copies, etc.);
 review of security procedures in order to comply with the ISO 27001 standard.
Fire/explosion risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Due to its business, the Group's plants are exposed to fire risk, mainly linked to the presence of combustible materials (plastic, foam).
RISK MANAGEMENT
Policy and due diligence
Faurecia has worked with the Group's insurer to set out an industrial risk prevention policy. This policy aims to reduce accidents caused by fire and to encourage Group sites to achieve excellence in fire safety by obtaining the Highly

Protected Risk (HPR) label from Faurecia's insurer. This label assesses the fire prevention management system (human resources) and the protection systems that are in place (technical resources).
The Faurecia group's prevention policy rests on the following foundations:
 internal guidelines (HPR grid) developed with the Group's insurer and based on 20 items to apply;
 a schedule of periodic audits carried out by the insurer, following the HPR grid;
 site classifications based on fire prevention performance, falling into four categories: inadequate/needs improvement/ pre-HPR/HPR;
 incorporating fire safety factors into the early stages of any plant design or major refurbishing of existing sites, through fire partitioning and ensuring that adequate fire safety equipment, such as extinguishers, is available;
 recording and systematic analysis of fires or outbreaks of fire. The results of this analysis are shared with the plants' HSE network;
 the intranet-based fire safety management system, through which the prevention policy is relayed to the entire Group by placing technical specifications, experience-based information and best practices online;
 a single data platform to manage all audit reports, action plans for improvements, and the audit program in the same place.
The HPR performance indicator is tracked biannually by the Risk Committee.
Results and performance indicators
One hundred and five industrial sites, including twenty six new sites, were audited in 2017. 91% of active sites have already been audited at least once. The sites that have not yet been audited are recent sites that will be audited in 2018.
47% of the audited sites are classified as HPR or pre-HPR, which covers 66% of total capital.
Almost 100% of industrial projects are monitored by the Insurance department and/or Group's insurer, from design to completion of the facility.
In 2017, Faurecia set up a project-tracking database in order to centralize information and keep track of the important dates for the projects in question.
Environmental risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
In light of its industrial activities, Faurecia may be exposed to environmental risks such as risk of accidental pollution or risk related to the tightening of environmental regulations, which may incur additional costs and/or investment expenditure.

130

/ Registration document 2017

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

RISK MANAGEMENT
Policy and due diligence
In addition to the environmental policies of the Business Groups, in 2017 Faurecia formalized an environmental policy under which the Group commits to reducing the environmental impact of its facilities. Environmental risk analysis and control are based on ISO 14001.
Human Resources The Environment committee, which holds monthly meetings and is chaired by the Group Environment department and includes business experts, implements and manages the Group's environmental policy.
Each Business Group has appointed an HSE department, which is assisted by a network of HSE Managers at the division level (mainly regional) and HSE coordinators at each Faurecia site. These coordinators bring their expertise to the factory management team, are responsible for implementing procedures, and ensure compliance with regulations and Faurecia standards. This organization also enables best practices to be applied across all sites within a single Business Group and/or across the three Business Groups. In some cases, this feedback can lead to Group-wide regulations.
In June 2017, Faurecia set up an Energy committee in order to share best practices on reducing consumption, to promote cooperation among the various Group entities and to anticipate future regulations. This committee meets quarterly.
Financial resources The amount of investments reported by the sites for environmental protection, noise reduction and equipment compliance is indicated in Section 4.2.2.2 of this Registration Document.
The amount of the provisions for environmental risks is indicated in Section 4.2.2.5.7 of this Registration Document.
Faurecia has transferred a portion of the risk to the insurance market in order to hedge against damage that may result from environmental pollution (see infra, Section 2.2.4).
Results and performance indicators
Environmental risk analysis and control are based on ISO 14001. The numerical data on the ISO 14001 certified sites are indicated in Section 3.2 of this Registration Document. This performance indicator is tracked quarterly by the Executive Committee.
Regular audits by the Internal Auditors and accredited testing laboratories provide assurance that the environmental management system and pollution prevention actions are properly applied.
Since 2012, Faurecia systematically assesses the environmental impact of its industrial projects, by conducting environmental audits and subsoil investigations when appropriate. Furthermore, in the context of industrial restructuring resulting in plant closures, the Faurecia group systematically assesses

the environmental impact and carries out a soil and subsoil investigation when appropriate. In any event, Faurecia ensures that sites are restored in accordance with local laws and the future use of the land.
Risks linked to climate change and natural events
IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS
Because of its international presence, Faurecia cannot eliminate the risk of exposure of its industrial facilities to extreme climate events (flooding, cyclones, storms, etc.).
Faurecia has not identified water stress as a material operational risk because the Group's processes do not consume a lot of water. Nonetheless, the Group has endeavored to map its industrial sites based on the world map of water stress published by the World Resources Institute (WRI). Sites identified as being in high water stress areas and that are therefore vulnerable to climate change receive special attention. This point is discussed in more detail in Section 4.2 of this Registration Document.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Policy and reasonable procedures
The prevention of natural risks is incorporated into the Group's overall industrial risk prevention policy, aiming to reduce accidents linked to natural disasters in partnership with its insurer.
Since 2014, Faurecia systematically checks the exposure of its industrial projects to natural dangers. This is one of the criteria used to decide on the location of a new site.
All of the existing industrial facilities are covered by an exposure diagnosis conducted with the technical support of the Group's insurers and reinsurers. The sites that are most exposed to flood or earthquake risk undergo a special audit by technical experts (partnership with Allianz for flood risk and AXA for seismic risk).
The indicators for natural risks are tracked biannually by the Risk Committee.
In addition, in July 2016, Faurecia set up a real-time and aroundthe-clock hydro-meteorological monitoring system covering all of its industrial facilities. This support service, provided by the company Predict Service, warns sites of coming events via real-time e-mail or SMS alerts. Depending on the alert level, a series of reactions is defined in action sheets so that appropriate measures are taken to prepare for the event and to ensure the safety and resilience of employees.
Results and performance indicators
Among the sites within the reporting scope, 32 production plants have been identified as located in a potential flooding zone, four sites are located in a very strong wind zone (zone 3: 213-251 km/h) and one site is located in a very high seismic activity zone.

/ Registration document 2017 131

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

Four "flood risk" and nine "seismic risk" site audits were done in 2017. The purpose of these audits is to define the risks and identify the technical and organizational actions that need to be implemented. The setting up of mitigation measures (emergency plan, process safety, building safety, etc.) is monitored at Insurance department level with a "mitigation index."
Over the reporting period, 3,290 alert messages were issued by the Natural Event Surveillance department, of which 54 were classified as level 5 (the highest level). These included events such as Cyclone Vardah in India, Hurricane Irma in the United States and the earthquakes in Italy and Mexico. No physical injury was reported. Property damage and business interruption related to the natural events totaled 423,000 for the entire reporting year.
Risk related to the Company's external growth strategy
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
As part of its external growth policy, Faurecia has made, and may make in the future, acquisitions of varying sizes, some of which have been and may be significant on a Group-wide scale.
These acquisitions entail risks, such as:
 the assumptions of the Business Plans on which valuations are made may prove incorrect, especially in respect of synergies and assessments of market demand;

 Faurecia may not succeed in integrating the acquired companies, their technologies, product ranges and employees;
 Faurecia may not be in a position to retain some key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired companies;
 Faurecia may be forced or decide to terminate pre-existing contractual relationships with costly and/or unfavorable financial conditions; and
 Faurecia may increase its debt with a view to financing these acquisitions or refinancing the debt of the acquired companies.
As a result, the benefits expected from future acquisitions or those already made may not be confirmed within the expected time frames and/or levels and, consequently, may affect the Faurecia group's financial position.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of Directors determines the Group's overall strategy. The Executive Management oversees this strategy and allocates the resources required for its implementation of which the external growth policy which is supported by the team responsible for Business Development, which reports to the Group's Executive Vice-President responsible for strategy. This team is also very closely involved in the life of the entities resulting from growth operations (joint ventures, acquisitions) and so takes part in decision-making bodies.
Faurecia also sets aside any provisions that may prove to be required under applicable accounting standards, in particular, for the depreciation of assets.

2.2.2. Financial and market risks

Given its level of debt, the Group is exposed to significant risks related to liquidity and changes in interest rates. It is also exposed to currency risks as its production plants are located in a large number of countries outside of the euro zone. Faurecia's counterparty risk in relation to its derivatives is not significant as the majority of its derivatives are set up with leading banks that form part of its banking pool and of which rating do not create significant counterparty risk. Any new banking relations and the opening of accounts are subject to the Group Finance and Treasury department's authorization.
Generally, interest rate and currency risks are managed centrally for the Group as a whole by the Group Finance department.

Interest rate risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Rate risk results from interest rate changes, particularly the impact of a rate hike on the variable portion of the debt which would be reflected by a rise in finance costs.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Faurecia manages hedging of interest rate risks on a central basis. Such management is implemented through the Group Financing and Treasury department, which reports to the Executive Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis.

132

/ Registration document 2017

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

As a significant part of the borrowings (syndicated credit facility (when drawn), short-term loans, commercial paper as applicable) are at variable rates. The aim of the Group's interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact on earnings of changes in short-term rates. The hedges arranged comprise mainly euro denominated interest rate swaps. In order to benefit from historically low interest rates, 2- and 3-year maturity hedges had been set up to cover a part of the interest on variable rate borrowings, due in 2017 and first quarter of 2018, against a rise in interest rates. The Group's interest rate position based on the nature of the instruments used and the sensitivity of interest expense to short-term rates are disclosed in Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Before taking into account the impact of interest rate hedges, 24.1% of the Group's financial debt were at variable rates as of the end of December 2017, compared with 20% as of yearend 2016. The variable-rate financial debt primarily consists of short-term debt.
The main components of the fixed rate debt are:
 bonds maturing in June 2022, issued in March and April 2015 for a total amount of 700 million;
 bonds maturing in June 2023, issued in April 2016 for a total amount of 700 million.
Currency risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Faurecia is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of certain currencies, particularly due to the location of some of its production plants, as well as the fact that certain subsidiaries purchase raw materials and other supplies or sell their products in a currency other than their functional currency.
The Group is also subject to currency risk linked to the contribution of the subsidiaries, whose accounting currency is not the euro, to the consolidated results of the Group. The sales, results and cash flows of these subsidiaries, when converted into euros, are sensitive to fluctuations in their accounting currency against the euro.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements gives the description of the underlying currency positions and the derivative instruments hedging them, as well as the sensitivity of the Group's net income and shareholders' equity to fluctuations against the euro of the various currencies to which it is exposed.
Liquidity risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
To finance its investments and its other cash requirements, Faurecia is obliged to access finance sourced from both financial institutions and financial markets.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group's liquidity is ensured mainly by its bond issues and its syndicated credit facility.
In 2015 and 2016, Faurecia made two bond issues, each 700 million, reaching maturity on June 15, 2022, and June 15, 2023. Faurecia also holds a 1.2 billion line of credit with its banks that is scheduled to reach maturity at the end of June 2021.
As of December 31, 2017, this credit facility was not drawn.
This credit facility contains a single restrictive clause on consolidated financial ratios (as opposed to two in the previous credit facility): the net debt*/EBITDA** must be lower than 2.50. Compliance with this ratio is a condition affecting the availability of this credit facility.
This credit facility includes some restrictive clauses on asset disposals (disposal representing over 25% of the Group's total consolidated assets requires the prior approval of banks representing two-thirds of the syndicate) and on the debt level of some subsidiaries.
The various components of Faurecia's long-term debt and the maturities of the Group's liquidities are described in Notes 26.2 and 26.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

As is noted in Note 26.3 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2017, Faurecia was compliant with the financial ratio required by the syndicated credit facility:

Ratio

Limit Carrying amount as of 12/31/2017

Net debt*/EBITDA**

< 2.50

0.24

* Consolidated net debt. ** Operating income plus depreciation, amortization and charges to provisions for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, corresponding to the past 12 months.

In addition to the above-described bank and bond debt, part of Faurecia's liquidity requirements is met through receivables sale programs. Cash from receivables sold came to 1,107.1 million as of December 31, 2017 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements), including 1,038.7 million from receivables that were sold and derecognized (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).

Finally, in 2017 Faurecia regularly issued commercial paper to investors, mainly in France, with maturities up to one year.
As of December 31, 2017, Faurecia had diversified funds with staggered maturities until 2023. On that date, the average weighted maturity of the Group's main long-term financial resources (the bonds maturing in 2022 and 2023, the syndicated credit facility and the other main long-term borrowings), is 4.2 years.

/ Registration document 2017 133

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

On January 31, 2018, Faurecia group was assigned a BB+ long term credit rating with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's. In February 2018, Moody's upgraded its rating from Ba2 to Ba1 with a stable outlook and Fitch Ratings upgraded its rating to BB+ with a stable outlook.
Thus, in view of the Group's current situation, and notwithstanding the possible future consequences of any deterioration in its operations or outlook, Faurecia does not believe itself to be exposed to significant liquidity risk.
Risk related to raw materials
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
The Group is exposed to raw material risk via its direct raw materials purchases or indirectly through components purchased from its suppliers.
The Group's operating and net income can be adversely affected by changes in the prices of the raw materials it uses, notably steel and plastics.
In 2017, direct plastics and steel purchases accounted for approximately 9.0% of the Group's total purchases.
To the extent that the Group's sales contracts with customers do not include systematic price indexation clauses linked to the price of its raw materials, Faurecia is exposed to risks related to unfavorable fluctuations in raw material prices.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Efforts are made to reduce this exposure by continually negotiating conditions with customers and strictly managing inventories. Faurecia does not use derivatives to hedge its purchases of raw materials or energy.
Faurecia still has a low level of exposure to this risk however, since a large proportion of the raw material price fluctuation is passed on to customers on a "pass through basis". Faurecia's remaining exposure is, therefore, around 30% of the total raw materials exposure.
A 10% fluctuation in the price of raw materials, not including component purchases, would have a 0.2% impact on operating income (expressed as a percentage of total sales).
Customer credit risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
In view of the economic context in the automotive sector, Faurecia cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of its customers may not be able to honor certain contracts or suffer financial difficulties.
RISK MANAGEMENT
As of December 31, 2017, late payments represented 159 million, or 0.8% of consolidated sales for the year.
Details of trade accounts receivable and other receivables are provided in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

2.2.3. Legal and regulatory risks

Litigation
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
As a reminder, on March 25, 2014, the European Commission and the department of Justice of the United States of America and on November 27, 2014, the Competition Commission of South Africa, initiated an inquiry covering certain suppliers of emission control systems on the basis for suspicions of anticompetitive practices in this segment. Faurecia is one of the companies covered by these inquiries. As was conveyed by the Company on May 2, 2017, the European Commission announced that it had closed its inquiry. The other inquiries are ongoing.
On May 19, 2017, the Brazilian competition authority (the CADE) initiated an inquiry covering Faurecia Emissions Control Technologies do Brazil and some of its former employees, alleging anti-competitive practices in regard to the exhaust systems market in Brazil.
The Group has reached agreements in principal with the plaintiffs to settle all three pending class actions which were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against several suppliers of emissions control systems,

including Group affiliates, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to Exhaust Systems. When finalized with the court, these settlements, for non-significant amounts in line with potential defense costs, will put an end to these class actions.
Two class actions for similar allegations have been filed in Canada but are in their earliest stages.
Except for the Competition Authorities' inquiries and the class actions mentioned above, as of the date of this Registration Document there were no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Group was aware) likely to have, or have had a significant impact on the Group's financial position or profitability in the past 12 months.
In its decision of December 18, 2014, the Enforcement committee of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) considered that Faurecia S.A. and its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yann Delabrière, had failed to meet certain obligations defined in Articles 223-1, 223-2 and 223-10-1 of the AMF General Regulation pertaining to information related to the Company's objectives for 2012. On the basis of Articles L. 621-15 (paragraphs II (c) and III (c)) of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the AMF fined Faurecia S.A. and its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Yann Delabrière, 2 million and 100,000, respectively.

/ Registration document 2017

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

On February 26, 2015, Faurecia S.A. and Mr. Yann Delabrière, supported by the Board of Directors of the Company, lodged an appeal against this decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. In a ruling rendered on June 30, 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal, considering that the decision did not enable an assessment of the proportionality of the fine, decided that the financial penalty imposed on the Company should be overturned and, as a consequence, reduced to 1 million. As regards Mr. Yann Delabrière, the Paris Court of Appeal found no evidence of personal wrongdoing and maintained the penalty solely in his capacity as legal representative of the Company. On August 22, 2016, the Company and Mr. Yann Delabrière lodged a further appeal against this ruling before the French Supreme Court. The proceedings are currently pending before this Court.
Faurecia believes that neither the nature of the known or ongoing litigation as of this writing nor the amounts that pertain to it will materially affect Faurecia's consolidated financial position in the event of an unfavorable outcome.
However, Faurecia cannot guarantee that in the future Group's subsidiaries will not be involved in legal, administrative, or regulatory proceedings, particularly in view of the complex regulatory requirements applicable to the Group; technical failures, or breaches of contract by customers, suppliers or partners.
Situations such as those described above could have a significant unfavorable impact on the Group's operations and/ or financial position.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Litigation is tracked quarterly at the Group level and monthly at the Business Group level through reporting prepared by the Legal department.
Adequate provisions have been set aside to cover litigation facing the Group, in accordance with the facts and information available at the balance sheet date. Note 24.2 to the December 31, 2017, consolidated financial statements gives a description of claims and litigation currently in process and indicates the total amount of provisions for litigation.
Intellectual property risk
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
The Group places great importance on employing intellectual property laws to protect its products and processes, especially patents and trademarks, and on complying with third parties' intellectual property rights. Nonetheless, the Group may be exposed to infringement of its intellectual property rights by third parties. Such acts are likely to negatively impact the Group's business and results, and its image and that of the quality of its products. It is impossible to rule out involuntary infringement by

the Group given that there exist third party intellectual property rights that have not been published or identified. In such cases, the Group may be required to modify its products or processes or negotiate rights of use with third parties. Finally, the Group's intellectual property rights may be disputed by third parties that may dispute validity, for example.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group conducts an active research and development policy and stresses protection of the resulting innovations. To this end, the Group files patents on technologies, products and processes in many countries. The Group also uses trademark law to protect its name and product ranges. The Group holds a large, stable portfolio of intellectual property rights thanks to its internal teams of experts and specialists and a global network of advisers who conduct prior art searches and technology watches, and monitor the competition. The Group undertakes actions to prevent, terminate and penalize infringements of its intellectual property rights. For instance, the Group may act against third parties that use its patents, know-how or trademarks without its authorization, or it may file challenges or actions for invalidation against third-party patents whose issue the Group does not deem justified.
In 2017, to support its innovation policy and strengthen the protection of its rights, the Group set up a centralized structure that addresses all subjects of intellectual property, both technical and legal.
Risk relating to regulatory change
IDENTIFICATION OF RISK
Due to the international nature of its business activities, Faurecia is exposed to economic, political, fiscal, legal and other types of risks:
 any potential amendments to laws or regulations, or to the commercial, monetary or fiscal policies;
 customs regulations, foreign exchange controls, investment restrictions or requirements or any other constraint such as levies or other forms of taxation on settlements and other payment; and
 difficulties in enforcing agreements, collecting payments due and protecting property through foreign legal systems, in particular, where intellectual property protection is less stringent.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group relies on the expertise of its Legal, Tax and Finance departments which permanently monitor legislation and regulations in France and abroad via local intermediaries (employees, networks of lawyers, tax specialists, etc.).

2 Risks and risk control
Description of main risks

2.2.4. Insurance and coverage of risks

As Faurecia does not have any captive insurance entities, its system for safeguarding assets is based on the implementation and ongoing adaptation of its risk prevention policy and, as described below, its strategy of transferring its principal risks to the insurance market.
Fire, property damage and business interruption insurance
Faurecia has taken out a fire, property damage and business interruption insurance policy with a co-insurance group of major insurers led by Allianz. On July 1, 2017, in anticipation of a noticeable tightening of the high-risk insurance market, this policy was renewed for three years. Despite the major Recticel claim discussed below, the average premium rate remained stable. In 2017, the Group paid around 8.1 million (inclusive of all tax) for coverage of property damage and the business interruption resulting from this damage; this amount was higher due to the combined effect of a jump in the insured values and the increase in customer/supplier default warranties.
The coverage for buildings and equipment is based on new replacement value. Coverage is organized around a Master policy, which includes direct coverage for the freedom of services area, with local policies for subsidiaries in countries located outside this area.
The premiums applicable to the capital at risk (direct loss and annual gross margin) are directly dependent on the HPR classification given to the site following an audit by the insurance company.
In 2017, there was a major claim of supplier default related to the fire at the Recticel plant in the Czech Republic. The destruction of molds greatly disrupted the production of several customers. This claim was closed in November 2017 with the payment by coinsurance of an indemnity, which corresponded to the full customer/supplier default warranty. After negotiation during the July 2017 renewal, the customer/supplier default warranty limit was raised substantially. In return, Faurecia agreed to work on identifying and reducing the fire risks and natural risks to which the major supplier sites are exposed.
Damage insurance is supplemented by builder's risk insurance and insurance covering the transportation of goods or equipment and political risk.

The transportation insurance was subject to a renewal with Allianz following a bid that made it possible to expand the coverage to all the European entities and make the business interruption coverage automatic, all for a much lower premium.
Liability insurance
Since January 1, 2013, Faurecia's liability has been covered by a coinsurance group led by AXA. Liability insurance covers operating liability, product liability after delivery, including the risk of product recall. Liability insurance takes the form of a Master policy combined with local policies taken out in countries where Faurecia has subsidiaries.
Several claims were filed in the United States and in Europe between 2014 and 2017; most of them are still under investigation. Following an accident in the United States, an increase in claims for physical injury was recorded. This increase in claims affects the terms of the liability insurance plan.
The Groups' liability insurance schedule also includes specific policies such as environmental liability insurance and coverage of liability for damages resulting from accidents caused by employees' occupational illnesses.
In 2017, the Group paid approximately 6.8 million (inclusive of all tax) in premiums for its civil liability policies.
Cyber risk insurance
On January 1, 2017, Faurecia took out a cyber risk policy from CHUBB and AXA that covers potential business interruption following a paralysis of the information systems and Faurecia's liability in the event of a claim following a cyber event.

The business address of Board members is that of Faurecia.
Information on the expertise and experience of the corporate officers and details of their terms of office and other positions held by them are provided in Section 3.1.1.2.1.
3.1.1.1.1.1. Governance structure
2016 was marked by a major change in the Group's governance, namely the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer as from July 1, 2016.
This change is the result of a process initiated at the Board of Directors meeting of July 23, 2015, which adopted the principle of segregation of duties in accordance with Article 17 of the of the Company's bylaws.
At its April 13, 2016 meeting the Board of Directors subsequently resolved to appoint Yann Delabrière, who had served as

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since February 16, 2007, as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Patrick Koller, who had served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer since February 2, 2015, as Chief Executive Officer, with both appointments effective as from July 1, 2016.
At its meeting on April 11, 2017, the Board of Directors resolved to appoint Michel de Rosen as Chairman of the Board of Directors with effect from the end of the General meeting of May 30, 2017, to replace Yann Delabrière, whose term of office as a Board member, which came to an end on that same date, was not renewed.
During that same meeting, Patrick Koller, the Chief Executive Officer, was appointed as a Board member.
Given the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer effective as from July 1, 2016, the internal rules of the Board of Directors were revised to reflect, among others, this new mode of governance.

/ Registration document 2017 141

3 Governance and capital stock
Corporate governance

Under the terms of this document, the Chairman's role is defined as follows:
The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the effective operation of the Board and its committees, in accordance with good governance principles.
The Chairman must:
 promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance across the Group, particularly at the Board level, thus ensuring the effectiveness thereof;
 manage the relations between Board members and the Chairs of the committees and, in this respect:
 promote effective working relations and open communication, and foster an environment that enables constructive discussions and the sharing of information between Board members and the Chief Executive Officer, during and outside meetings,
 lead and govern the Board so as to create the conditions required for the overall effectiveness of the Board and its members, and ensure that all key and relevant issues are adequately prepared and discussed by the Board of Directors and the various committees in a timely fashion,
 schedule and set the agenda of the Board meetings, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board, to take full account of the Group's major challenges and issues raised by Board members, and ensure that sufficient time is devoted to thoroughly discuss significant and strategic matters,
 address any conflicts of interest,
 conduct, with the help of the Governance Committee, assessments of the Board of Directors, searches for new Board members and their induction program;
 organize, with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairs of the various committees, the preparation of and chair General meetings, oversee the relations and ensure effective communication with shareholders;

 manage the relation with the Chief Executive Officer:
 act as a competent advisor for the Chief Executive Officer on all issues regarding the interests and management of the Company,
 ensure that the strategies and policies adopted by the Board are effectively implemented by the Chief Executive Officer; without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Board of Directors and its committees, the Chairman is regularly provided information by the Chief Executive Officer about significant events concerning the Company's strategy, in line with the objectives set by the Board of Directors, as well as about major external growth projects, significant financial transactions, societal actions, or appointments of Business Group managers and other key positions within the Company. The Chairman receives from the Chief Executive Officer all information necessary to coordinate the work of the Board of Directors and its committees;
 coordinate or conduct specific projects. In particular, at the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman may represent the Company before stakeholders, public authorities, financial institutions, major shareholders and/or key business partners.
In 2017, Michel de Rosen coordinated the work of the Board of Directors in accordance with the bylaws and the internal rules and prioritized the introduction of practices to improve the way in which the Board operates. He took an active role in the following:
 committee work and reviews and attendance at committee meetings;
 the process of recruiting new Board members and, generally speaking, discussions about changes to the Board of Directors and its composition;
 the specific shareholding mechanism applicable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors;
 helping to prepare a questionnaire to assess the operation of the Board and Committees.
In addition, he visited a number of Group sites in France and abroad in the United States, China, Germany and Poland in particular and maintained a regular dialog with the Chief Executive Officer about the Group's key issues.

3.1.1.1.1.2. Independence of members of the Board of Directors
The AFEP-MEDEF Code, which Faurecia follows, provides that at least one third of Board members must be independent in companies with controlling shareholders and half of the Board in other companies.
In addition, at least two thirds of the members of the Audit Committee must be independent, and the committees responsible for appointments and compensation must have a majority of independent members.
As will be detailed below, the composition of the Board and committees of Faurecia is consistent with these recommendations.
Pursuant to the Code, a Board member is independent when they have no relation of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its Group or its management which might compromise the exercise of their free judgment.
Independence criteria provided for in the Code and reflected in the internal rules of the Board of Directors are as follows:
 not be or have been, in the past five years, an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company; an employee, executive corporate officer or Board member of a company directly or indirectly holding over 10% of its capital stock; an employee, executive corporate officer or Board member of a consolidated subsidiary;
 not be an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds the office of Board member or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (currently or who has held such an office for less than five years) holds the office of Board member;
 not have a business relationship with Faurecia that would represent a significant business activity with the company or the group in which the Board member has an executive management position;

 not have close family ties with a corporate officer;
 not have been the Company's Statutory Auditor in the past five years;
 not be a Company Board member for more than 12 years.
The Board of Directors, based on the Governance Committee's report, reviews the independence status of each of its members at least once a year and the independence of each new member upon their appointment.
At its meeting of December 21, 2016 and on the recommendation of the Governance Committee which met on the same date, the Board decided that the business relationship condition should be examined using a multi-criteria approach including a qualitative analysis which will be detailed in the Registration Document when necessary, this being one of the Board's internal rules.
At its meeting of February 15, 2018 and on the recommendation of the Governance Committee which met on February 8, 2018, the Board of Directors reviewed the situation of each of its members based on the AFEP-MEDEF Code's independence criteria. It used the multi-criteria approach, including a qualitative analysis, in order to assess the business relationship condition and its materiality.
The Governance Committee's recommendation is largely based on an assessment of the relationships, contracts and partnerships existing between Faurecia and the company or the group in which the Board member has an executive management position, conducted with the following: production purchases and non-production purchases, R&D and finance.
The Committee also used responses to a specific questionnaire directed at Board members considered independent.
Its assessment revealed that none of the Board members considered to be independent had material business relationships with Faurecia.

It is understood that, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Board members representing employees are not counted when calculating the percentage of independent Board members.
Therefore, and according to the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, as of December 31, 2017 Faurecia's Board of Directors was made up of 9 independent Board members out of 14, that is to say that more than one third of Board members were independent.
3.1.1.1.1.3. Diversity within the Board of Directors
Under the terms of its internal rules, the Board of Directors ensures that the necessary measures are taken to diversify its composition, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and applicable regulations.
The Governance Committee, responsible for formulating recommendations to the Board of Directors related to the appointment and reappointment of Board members, will consider the following: the independence of Board members, the requirement for the Board of Directors to have the expertise and experience necessary for their work, international diversity in order to reflect the Group's global footprint, gender balance on the Board of Directors. In addition, each Board member follows an induction program in the Group's core businesses with, in particular, site visits, meetings with Excom members and a training in governance.
As of December 31, 2017 the Board of Directors had six women members.
As of that date, the composition of the Board was therefore consistent with the provisions on balanced representation of men and women on Boards of directors and professional equality under the law of January 27, 2011. Please Note that Board members representing employees within the meaning of Article L. 225-27-1 of the French Code of commerce are not counted in this calculation.
In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the Board of Directors has two Board members representing employees, in accordance with Article L. 225-27-1 of the French Code of commerce introduced by the French Employment Protection Act of June 14, 2013, as amended by the French Employment and Labor Relations Act of August 17, 2015.
On that date, the Board had no Board members representing employee shareholders, the conditions of Article L. 225-23 of the French Code of commerce not being met.
3.1.1.1.2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with current legal and statutory provisions, the Board of Directors is a collective body that determines the Company's business strategy and oversees its implementation. Subject to the powers expressly granted to Annual shareholders' meetings and within the scope of the Company's purpose, it deals with all matters regarding the proper operation of the Company and settles matters concerning it through its decisions. The Chairman consults it on all Company and Group strategic decisions.

The Board's internal rules detail the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its committees. They describe the roles of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board. They detail the Board's modus operandi and specify that its work must be assessed on an annual basis. The internal rules specify the rights and responsibilities of Board members, particularly regarding the prevention of conflicts of interest, the holding of multiple offices, and the need for strict confidentiality in deliberations as well as diligence when taking part in the Board's work.
Given the segregation of the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer, effective as from July 1, 2016, the internal rules of the Board were revised to reflect, among others, the new mode of governance. This new version that has been applied since July 1, 2016 is made available To the Shareholders at the Company's registered office and also online at www.Faurecia.com.
The internal rules provide for the following tasks to be performed by the Board of Directors:
 Determination of strategic directions:
 determination and control of the implementation of decisions concerning the Company's main economic, social, financial, and technological strategies.
The medium-term direction of the Group's activities is defined by a strategic plan. The draft of this plan is prepared and presented by the Chief Executive Officer before being adopted by the Board of Directors.
In addition, as part of internal procedures, the Chief Executive Officer must obtain approval from the Board of Directors before carrying out any acquisition, disposal, or joint venture project representing a total asset value of over 100 million and/or with sales in excess of 300 million. Likewise, any significant transaction that is not included in the Company's strategic plan must be approved by the Board beforehand.
 Governance and management:
 review of governance structure: determination of Faurecia's executive management procedures, creation of committees of the Board of Directors, appointment of their members, determination of their tasks and operating procedures,

3.1.1.1.3. ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

By way of exception, the internal rules specify that it should meet at least once per year without the Chief Executive Officer in attendance to assess the performance of said officer and discuss governance issues.
Sufficient time must be devoted during each Board meeting to usefully and thoroughly discuss the agenda items.
The Chairman, assisted by the Secretary of the Board of Directors, is responsible for communicating the information and documents required for the Board meetings to the Board members in a timely manner.
In this context, the Board's internal rules stipulate that each Board member must inform the Board of Directors of any situation of conflict of interest, even potential, and consequently abstain from participating in deliberations concerning them, or not attend the Board meetings while they find themselves in a situation of conflict of interest, or resign from the Board membership. In case of non-compliance with these rules of abstention or withdrawal, the Board member could be held liable. In case of conflict of interest, the Board member concerned will not receive documentation relating to the Board meeting(s) in question.
No such situations arose in 2017.
Outside their meetings, Board members receive from the Chairman important or urgent information relevant to the Company and the Group. They also receive press releases distributed by the Company.
Any additional information or document requested by a Board member is automatically communicated to all other Board members.
Such information and documents may be provided during a Board meeting should privacy or timeliness considerations so require.
In accordance with the laws, a Board member may specifically designate another Board member to represent them at Board meetings.
Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the meetings of the Board of Directors may take place by video conference or any other means of telecommunication, in particular to allow for the actual participation of Board members who are unable to attend the meetings in person.

In the situation referred to above:
 any Board members who attend the meeting by video conference or any other means of telecommunication are deemed present for the purposes of quorum and majority.
The Board thus duly deliberates if at least half of its members attend the meeting in person or by video conference or any other means of telecommunication;
 the video conference or any other means of telecommunication used must meet the technical specifications that guarantee the effective participation of each attendee. The deliberations must be transmitted in a continuous and simultaneous manner. Adequate arrangements are to be made for the identification of each participant and verification of the quorum; the attendance register for the meetings of the Board of Directors must mention, where applicable, the participation by video conference or any other means of telecommunication of the Board members concerned;
 the meeting minutes must indicate the name(s) of the Board member(s) participating by video conference or any other means of telecommunication. meeting minutes must also indicate any technical incident relating to video conference or any other telecommunication means that disrupted the meeting, including any interruption and restoration of the remote participation;
 in case of a malfunction of the video conference system or means of telecommunications noted by the Chairman of the meeting, the Board of Directors may duly deliberate and/ or continue the meeting only with the members attending in person, provided that the quorum requirements are met;
 the above provisions do not apply to the adoption of the decisions referred to in Articles L. 232-1 and L. 233-16 of the French Code of commerce related, respectively, to the preparation of the parent company financial statements and management report, and the preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements and management report.
To optimize its discussions, the Board of Directors established committees in accordance with Article R. 225-29 of the French Code of commerce.

As of December 31, 2017, the following committees were active:
 a Governance Committee, whose role is to deal with all corporate governance issues. In this respect, the Committee assesses the Company's governance structure and its executive management procedures, making recommendations where necessary. It may also provide opinions at the request of other Board committees. Furthermore, the Committee manages the process for appointing the Board members and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, reviews the overall amount of attendance fees and their allocation among the members, and directs the corporate governance assessment process (assessment of the work of the Board members and committees, assessment of the members' independence status);
 a Management Committee, which focuses on issues related to the selection and compensation, including long-term compensation, of the Company's Executive Management. More generally, this committee deals with issues related to the performance, selection and compensation, including longterm compensation, of the main executives of the Company (Executive Committee members, Senior Management);
 an Audit Committee whose main role is to review the process for approving the annual parent company financial statements and the annual and interim consolidated financial statements, as well as the process for preparing the financial information. It is responsible for maintaining relations with the Statutory Auditors and managing their selection and independence. It also monitors internal control and risk management procedures. The Audit Committee examines the budget, monitors its execution and reviews planning documents. Lastly, it reviews the Group's financial position and planned security issues.
These Committees have a purely internal role in preparing some of the Board's deliberations. They issue proposals, opinions, and recommendations within their field of competence.
Each Committee has its own internal rules approved by the Board of Directors which sets their composition, membership rules and operating procedures, and specific roles.
The Committees report on their work to the Board of Directors after each meeting and perform a self-assessment of their activities on an annual basis.

Operation of the Audit Committee
The Committee meets at least twice per year, before the approval of the annual and interim financial statements and as needed to carry out its duties.
The time between the review of the financial statements by the Committee and their review by the Board must be at least two days. Exceptionally, the Committee Chairman may decide to shorten this period to take into account the participation of members who are not based in France.
The Committee informs the Chairman of the Board of Directors without delay of any issues encountered during the course of its work.
Meetings are held at the registered office upon convening notice sent by the Chairman and/or the Secretary of the

Committee. They may also be held by video conference or any other means of telecommunication. A committee duly deliberates if at least half of its members attend the meeting in person or by video conference or any other means of telecommunication.
The Committee reports on its work at the next meeting of the Board of Directors.
The Secretary is responsible for organizing and attending the Committee meetings, as well as for preparing meeting minutes to be submitted to the Committee for approval at the next meeting.

3.1.1.1.5. ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD'S PERFORMANCE
The Board of Directors carries out an assessment of its operation every year.
Every three years, it carries out a thorough assessment with the help of an external consulting firm. The last such assessment was performed for 2015.
The 2017 assessment was conducted internally, in December 2017 and January 2018, using a questionnaire sent to each Board member.
The results of this assessment were presented to the Governance Committee on February 8, 2018 and to the Board of Directors on February 15, 2018.
The assessment questionnaire covered the following topics:
 assessment of the implementation of recommendations arising from the 2016 assessment;
 organization of the work of the Board of Directors;
 scope of the issues covered by the Board and its committees;
 relations between the Board and Executive Management;
 opinion on corporate governance;
 assessment of the personal contribution made by each Board member to the work of the Board and the Committees.

Generally speaking, Board members voiced their satisfaction with the way in which corporate governance is currently organized and with the quality of relations between the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and Board members as a whole. They also stressed the quality of discussions and the clarity of the decisions taken.
In terms of organizing the work of the Board, in future, particular attention will be paid to the length of Board meetings so that certain topics dealt with by committees can be discussed in greater detail.
In terms of information, Board members highlighted the ongoing improvement in the information and supporting documentation received and confirmed the constant interest on risks and on any issues of a strategic nature, outside the meeting specifically devoted to these issues which is held in October every year.
The Board also acknowledged the desire for the next assessment of the operation of the Board and its committees, to be conducted by an external consultant and to include an assessment, by all Board members, of the actual contribution made by each individual member.
Lastly, meetings held without the Chief Executive Officer, any member of management and possibly the Secretary will be proposed if necessary by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Pursuant to the bylaws, each Board member must hold at least 20 Faurecia shares throughout his or her term of office.
Furthermore, the internal rules of the Board of Directors, as amended by the Board at its meeting of December 21, 2016 upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee which met on the same date, provides that each Board member must hold 500 shares in the Company, including 20 shares provided for in the bylaws, during the entire term of their corporate office. However, Board members receiving no attendance fees are only required to hold the 20 shares provided for in the bylaws and the law does not require Board members representing employees to hold a minimum number of shares. As of December 31, 2017, as shown in the table below, the Board members in question complied with the mechanism set out in the internal rules.

The Board of Directors' meeting on December 19, 2017 also decided that, in addition to Board members' obligation to hold shares, the Chairman of the Board of Directors must hold shares corresponding to one year's compensation (including the 500 shares held as a Board member) and must comply with this obligation within two years of being appointed as Chairman.
The Board of Directors' internal rules were amended accordingly.

Conflicts of interest
The internal rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that each Board member must inform the Board of any situation of conflict of interest, even potential, relating to issues mentioned in the agenda and draw conclusions therefrom with regard to their term of office. Thus, depending on the case, he should either abstain from participating in deliberations concerning him, or not attend the Board meetings during the time he finds himself in a situation of conflict of interest, or resign from the Board membership.
No such situations arose in 2017.
Thus, to the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, no conflicts of interest had been identified between the duties of each member of the Board of Directors and of Executive Management vis-à-vis the Company in their capacity as corporate officers and their personal interests or other duties.
To the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, there were no arrangements or agreements concluded with major shareholders, customers or suppliers resulting in a member of the Board of Directors or Executive Management being appointed in that capacity.
To the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of drafting of this document, no restriction has been agreed to by members of the Board of Directors or of Executive Management regarding the disposal of their interests in the Company's capital stock.
Aside from regulated agreements and undertakings, which are the subject of a report to the General meeting, no service agreement has been entered into between a member of the Board of Directors and Faurecia or any of its subsidiaries.
The Statutory Auditors' special report on regulated agreements and undertakings can be found in Section 5.5.1 of this Registration Document.
Transactions in the Company's securities by corporate officers
By the Board of Directors' decision of April 14, 2010, the Company established a Code of Conduct for Group employees and executives who have access to insider information by virtue of their positions and offices, with provisions on the management, ownership and disclosure of such information.

This Code was amended by the Board of Directors on February 8, 2017 to recognize (EU) Regulation No. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, on market abuse, which came into force on July 3, 2016, and Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on Anti-Corruption and Economic Modernization.
Under the measures to prevent insider trading within the Group the Code provides, among others, for blackout periods that require corporate officers to refrain from trading in Faurecia shares during certain periods surrounding the publication of interim results, annual results and quarterly sales. These periods are defined as follows:
 from the date of the annual December meeting of the Company's Board of Directors up to and including the third day following the announcement of Faurecia's annual results;
 within 30 calendar days prior to the announcement of interim results and up to and including the third day following the announcement;
 within 15 calendar days prior to the publication of quarterly sales and up to and including the third day following the publication.
The Code also describes the disclosure requirements for securities transactions, which apply to persons with managerial responsibilities within the meaning of the EU Regulation and to persons closely associated with them, and lists the transactions to be disclosed since the regulation entered into force.
In accordance with the European Regulation, corporate officers were informed of disclosure requirements for securities transactions applicable to them as well as to their close associates.
The Code points out the existence of a compliance officer ("déontologue") in the person of the Group Chief Financial Officer who, if there is doubt about the type of the planned transaction, will be responsible for issuing an opinion thereon.
It mentions the corporate officers' obligation to hold shares in registered form.
Lastly, more generally, it lists the sanctions for insider trading or disclosure of insider information, with particular reference to Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on Transparency, the Fight against Corruption and Economic Modernization.

Please note that Board members holding executive or management positions within PSA waived their right to receive attendance fees along with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Faurecia.

A 600,000 to 700,000 increase in the maximum annual amount of attendance fees will be sought at the General meeting of May 29, 2018, to recognize notably the increase in the number of Board members.

Mr. Patrick Koller's compensation
Chief Executive Officer
The elements of the compensation paid, or awarded, to Mr. Patrick Koller for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are subject to the Shareholders' vote, pursuant to Article L. 225.100, paragraph II, of the French Code of commerce, are shown in the explanatory notes to the resolutions included in Section 5 of this Registration Document.
Fixed compensation for 2017
As from July 1, 2016, the date on which the duties of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer were segregated, Mr. Patrick Koller's fixed annual compensation as Chief Executive Officer was set at 750,000 by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016.
On the recommendation of the Management Committee, which met on February 1, 2017, the Board of Directors maintained Mr. Patrick Koller's fixed annual compensation for 2017 as Chief Executive Officer at 750,000 in its meeting of February 8, 2017.

This compensation was set in reference to a comparison of compensation prepared by an outside consultant based on a set of twenty manufacturers listed in France with comparable revenues, capitalization and headcount.
Variable compensation for 2017
On the recommendation of the Management Committee, which met on February 1, 2017, the Board also laid down the rules for determining Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation for 2017 as Chief Executive Officer in its meeting of February 8, 2017.
The Board decided that Mr. Patrick Koller's total variable compensation would range from 0 to 180% of his fixed annual compensation according to the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets.
The achievement of quantitative targets entitles him to variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of his fixed annual compensation.

/ Registration document 2017 181

3 Governance and capital stock
Corporate governance

The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 8, 2017 are linked to the operating income and free cash flow:
 the operating income set by reference to the 2017 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The operating income will be taken into account for 40%;
 the free cash flow set by reference to the 2017 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The free cash flow will be taken into account for 60%.
The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2017 budget but are not made public for confidentiality reasons.
Qualitative targets have also been set in addition to quantitative targets:
 the deployment of the strategy through the implementation of organic and external growth priorities in line with the strategic plan (30% weighted on this criterion) i.e. to propose to the Board of Directors investment alternatives which will allow a real strategic choice; to add technology to existing Business Groups through external growth; to grow in China with local OEMs; to make bolt on acquisitions to accelerate the growth of areas identified as new areas of value creation (Value Spaces): to invest in start-ups to reinforce the Group's product offering;

 the deployment of the Group's initiatives in the fields of R&D productivity & efficiency, Global Business Services and Digital Productivity (25% weighted on this criterion) i.e. to define a saving strategy for each initiative; to set associated net savings to achieve; to implement first steps of a formalized plan; to demonstrate feasibility of global net savings objective at the end of the year;
 the management of program launches (25% weighted on this criterion); the objective is to achieve flawless launches of 14 programs identified as being at risk; and
 the reinforcement of the entrepreneurship, accountability and agility components of the Being Faurecia approach (20% weighted on this criterion) i.e. assessing the current situation through an internal survey; according to the results, organizing the design of an action plan; assessing the first feedback and change momentum.
Once all or part of the quantitative targets are achieved, the level of achievement of the qualitative targets will determine a multiplier effect of the achievement of 0.70 to 1.20 of the quantitative targets.
Therefore, if the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.

On February 15, 2018, on the recommendation of the Management Committee which met on February 12, 2018, by applying the principles described above and having noted that the qualitative targets had been attained as described above, the Board of Directors set Mr. Patrick Koller's 2017 variable compensation as Chief Executive Officer as follows:

Quantitative targets
From 0 to 150% of 100% of the fixed annual compensation if the levels of achievement of these targets set with reference to the 2017 budget are reached
Qualitative targets
Multiplier effect (ranging from 0.70 to 1.20) of the achievement of the quantitative targets, which may increase or decrease variable compensation

As regards the deployment of strategy, the Board of Directors of February 15, 2018 pointed to the completion of the acquisition of Parrot Automotive, Jiangxi Coagent Electronics Co. and Hug Engineering, investment in 8 start-ups, growth in China via 4 new JVs, record order books, 35% of orders involving Chinese OEMs,

technological partnerships with, amongst others, ZF, Malhe and Accenture (this last partnership only having been announced in early 2018). It also acknowledged five ongoing projects with OEMs relating to the Cockpit of the Future.

Regarding the deployment of Group initiatives in the fields of R&D productivity & efficiency, Global Business Services and Digital Productivity, the Board of Directors of February 15, 2018 acknowledged that savings plans had been defined and implemented for each initiative with effective cost reductions, as from the 2017 exercice.
In terms of the management of program launches, the Board of Directors of February 15, 2018 acknowledged that the number of at risk programs had been reduced to five due to the drafting, and implementation, of prevention plans. Within this context, the Board acknowledged the absence of any negative impact for customers.
Lastly, actions taken as part of the Being Faurecia initiative were, amongst other things, reflected by the introduction, following an internal survey (Management Survey) of several working groups on simplifying organization and reducing bureaucracy in relation to Capex management, reporting reduction and manufacturing execution; by the launch of two specific corporate governance projects, one in the United States, the other relating to the Cockpit of the Future ; by the move from the Senior Management to the Group Leadership Committee. by accelerated leadership training through Ignite and Drive programs and continued efforts in terms of developing diversity and finally by the launch of CSR initiative.
In accordance with Article L. 225-100 II, paragraph 2, of the French Code of commerce resulting from Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on Transparency, Anti-Corruption and Economic Modernization, this compensation will be paid to Mr. Patrick Koller after its approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 29, 2018.
Fixed compensation for 2018
On the recommendation of the Management Committee, which met on February 12, 2018, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 15, 2018, decided to increase Mr. Patrick Koller's fixed annual compensation as Chief Executive Officer, as of 2018, from 750,000 to 825,000, an increase of 10%.
The Board of Directors set this compensation by assessing several factors:
 mr. Patrick Koller's performance in assuming full responsibility for Faurecia's Executive Management, demonstrated through results of operations, profitability and market capitalization; before being appointed Chief Executive Officer in July 2016, Mr. Patrick Koller was Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer since February 2015, and before that had been responsible for one of the Group's BGs;
 the launch of the Group's transformation, which is based on new strategic priorities centered around clearly defined focuses with high technological value, substantial growth, changes in the Group's business, and significant international expansion benefiting from industrial geographic coverage.
The Board of Directors also took into consideration the results of a comparative study prepared by an outside consultant, Willis Towers Watson, based on a set of twenty manufacturers listed in Paris with comparable revenues, capitalization and headcount,

Mr. Patrick Koller's fixed compensation still being around 8% below the median, compared with 17% before the increase.
Variable compensation for 2018
On the recommendation of the Management Committee, which met on February 12, 2018, the Board also laid down the rules for determining Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation for 2018 as Chief Executive Officer in its meeting of February 15, 2018.
The Board decided that Mr. Patrick Koller's total variable compensation would range from 0 to 180% of his fixed annual compensation according to the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets.
The achievement of quantitative targets gives right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of his fixed annual compensation.
The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2018 are linked to the operating income and free cash flow:
 the operating income set by reference to the 2018 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The operating income will be taken into account for 40%;
 the free cash flow set by reference to the 2018 budget will give right to a variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% (maximum percentage) of the fixed compensation. The free cash flow will be taken into account for 60%.
The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2018 budget but are not made public for confidentiality reasons.
Qualitative targets have also been set in addition to quantitative targets:
 Execution of strategy in terms of Sustainable Mobility and Smart Life on Board, (40% weighted on this criterion). This will largely be a case of defining and deploying clear organization and accountabilities, focusing on order book growth, identifying and implementing external growth requirements, within the new Value Spaces;
 Management of program launches (30% weighted on this criterion), with particular attention given to 11 programs identified as being at risk;
 Being Faurecia (30% weighted on this criterion) with, in particular, the preparation of a medium-term action plan for selected convictions, defining objectives for 2018 and proposed objectives for 2019 for each of these convictions.
Once all or parts of the quantitative targets are achieved, the level of achievement of the qualitative targets will determine a multiplier effect of the achievement of 0.70 to 1.20 of the quantitative targets.
Therefore, if the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.

3.1.2. The Executive Committee

3.1.2.1. Executive Committee members
The Faurecia group's executive management function is performed under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) by an Executive Committee that meets every month to review the Group's results and consider general matters concerning the Group.
At December 31, 2017, it included the following members:
Patrick Koller Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Michel Favre Executive Vice-President, Group Chief Financial Officer
Hervé Guyot Executive Vice-President, Group Strategy
Thorsten Muschal Executive Vice-President, Sales and Program Management
Kate Philipps Executive Vice-President, Group Communications

Jean-Michel Renaudie Executive Vice-President, Faurecia Interiors
Christophe Schmitt Executive Vice-President, Faurecia Clean Mobility
Jean-Pierre Sounillac Executive Vice-President, Group Human Resources
Eelco Spoelder Executive Vice-President, Faurecia Seating
Jean-Michel Vallin Executive Vice-President, Faurecia China
Hagen Wiesner Executive Vice-President, Group Operations

3.1.2.2. Compensation of the Executive Committee

The total amount of compensation paid during fiscal year 2017 to the Executive Committee members in office at December 31, 2017, including the Chief Executive Officer, was 9,009,031.
The compensation of the Executive Committee, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, includes a variable bonus. Performing on target can result in a bonus worth 50% of the base salary. Should targets be exceeded, this percentage can rise to 100% of the base salary. 80% of the bonus is based on targets related to operating income and cash generation within the scope of responsibility, and 20% on the same targets measured across the Group. Within the corporate departments, 100% is based on targets measured across the Group.
In 2017, this bonus changed so as to be better aligned with the corporate officer's compensation: it switched from a half-yearly payment to an annual payment, and a multiplier factor ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 and based on four or five individual weighted targets was added. Consequently, the total amount of compensation paid in 2017 reflects only a half year of variable compensation, corresponding to the second half of 2016, which was paid in February 2017. The variable compensation for 2017 will be paid in early 2018.

Members of the Executive Committee also benefit from the performance share plan instituted by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2017, the plans No. 6, 7, 8 and 9 are ongoing. They were granted by the Board of Directors' decisions of July 28, 2014, July 23, 2015, July 25, 2016, and July 20, 2017.
The Board of Directors' meeting of October 12, 2017, decided that starting with plan No. 6 and for all plans established subsequently, all Executive Committee members must retain at least 20% of the shares acquired under each plan. This requirement of a percentage threshold for each plan will cease to apply once the Executive Committee member in question holds a number of shares that corresponds to one year of base gross compensation, factoring in all the plans already established, and it will again become applicable in the event that the member no longer holds the target number of shares corresponding to one year of base gross compensation.
In any event, this ownership requirement will no longer apply when the Executive Committee member in question steps down from the Committee.

If the employment contract of an Executive Committee member (excluding the CEO) is terminated, he or she may receive contractual severance pay of up to 12 months' compensation, depending on their position. This amount is not payable in the event of gross or serious misconduct.

3.1.3. The Senior Management

Each of the three Business Groups is organized into geographic divisions ­ Europe, divided when appropriate into North and South Europe, North America, South America, and Asia (China) ­ which manage operations in their region and also coordinate operations with customers headquartered in their region.
The three Business Groups also have a central staff that handles the main operational functions (sales and marketing, programs, manufacturing support, purchasing, quality, Human Resources and finance). These functions are also managed within the geographic divisions by equivalent teams. Additionally, some specialized areas are managed by worldwide product lines within the three businesses, such as seat mechanisms, acoustic treatments and decorative interior trims.
Senior Management at Faurecia consists of all the aforementioned management teams along with the Executive Committee and the key headquarters managers of the manufacturing and quality staff, as well as the Human Resources and Finance departments.

Faurecia Senior Management included 319 members as at December 31, 2017. This is Faurecia's operational management, responsible for the Company's operations, growth and performance. As such, the members of this team have an interest in the short-term results, through a system of variable bonuses. 80% of the bonus is based on targets related to operating income and cash generation within their scope of responsibility, and 20% on the same targets measured for the scope immediately above.
Members of this team also benefit from the performance share plan instituted by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2017, the plans No. 6, 7, 8 and 9 are on-going. They were granted by the Board of Directors' decisions of July 28, 2014, July 23, 2015, July 25, 2016, and July 20, 2017.
On January 1, 2018, a Group Leadership Committee was put in place as a replacement for the Senior Management.

3.2.1.2 Potential capital stock
As of December 31, 2017, the potential capital stock was comprised only of performance shares.
On that same date, there were no outstanding stock option plans in force as the last stock subscription option plan had expired on April 16, 2017. Therefore, Table 8 ("History of allocations of stock subscription options") as mandated by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and AMF recommendation No. 2009-16 is not applicable.
Furthermore, no option was exercised by any group employee during fiscal year 2017. Therefore, Table 9 ("Stock subscription or purchase options granted during the fiscal year to the top 10 non-corporate office employees and options exercised by them during the fiscal year") as mandated by AMF recommendation No. 2009-16 is not applicable.
PERFORMANCE SHARES
The Chief Executive Officer, as well as the Senior Management (replaced by the Group Leadership Committee on January 1, 2018) of around 300 people as at December 31, 2017, were beneficiaries of performance share plans established by the Company.
The Company's policy in this regard is based on simple, transparent, enduring principles. Therefore:
 performance shares have been granted annually since 2010 at the same periods, involving, since that year, an internal performance condition and a service condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
 since 2013, the conditions have also included an external performance condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
 since 2013, the vesting period applicable to the plans has been four years as from their grant date for all French and foreign beneficiaries; the plans comprise no holding period;
 the number of shares that may be granted to the beneficiary under each plan is determined using an external benchmark from which are deducted a minimum number of shares (50%) and a maximum number (130%). In all cases, the final allocation depends on the fulfillment of performance and presence conditions.

The performance conditions are the following:
 60% fulfillment of an internal performance condition related since 2016 to the Group net income after tax (before 2016, Group net income before tax), before taking into account any exceptional events. This internal condition is assessed by comparing the net result of the third fiscal year after the grant date of the performance shares against the one as forecasted in the Group's medium-term plan reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on the grant date of the performance shares; and
 40% fulfillment of an external performance condition, i.e., growth of the Company's net earnings per share assessed between the last fiscal year before the grant date of the performance shares and the third fiscal year ended after the grant date of the performance shares. This condition is assessed against the weighted growth of a reference group made up of twelve comparable international automotive suppliers over the same period.
The reference group is made up of the following European and North American automotive suppliers:
 Autoliv (Sweden),
 Autoneum (formerly Rieter) (Switzerland),
 Borg Warner (United States),
 Continental (Germany),
 Delphi (United States),
 GKN (United Kingdom),
 Adient (United States),
 Lear (United States),
 Magna (Canada),
 Plastic Omnium (France),
 Tenneco (United States),
 Valeo (France).
This group generally remains stable even it may be modified in the event of a major change concerning one of its members.

3.2.1.3 Trading by the Company in its own shares during 2017 (Article L. 225-211 of the French Code of commerce)
The General meeting of May 30, 2017, authorized the implementation of a share buy-back program, superseding that authorized in the tenth resolution of the General meeting of May 27, 2016.
TREASURY STOCK (EXCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY CONTRACT)
In 2017, the Company bought back 960,000 shares at an average price of 41.88 (weighted gross price) on the basis of the authorization of the General meeting of May 27, 2016.
Trading costs amounted to 24,125.60 excluding VAT.
The value of these shares, measured at their purchase price, totals 40,209,323.78.
These 960,000 shares were initially purchased to cover the performance share plans. However, the Board of Directors meeting of December 19, 2017, decided not to restrict the use of these shares to the objective in question, but to allow them to be allocated to the other objectives authorized by the General meeting.
In any event, none of these 960,000 shares was used in 2017.
At December 31, 2017, the Company held 814,320 treasury shares, i.e., 0.59% of the Company's capital stock on that date (see Note 22.3 to the consolidated financial statements).
LIQUIDITY CONTRACT
Since April 27, 2009, Faurecia has been implementing a liquidity contract that complies with the AMAFI Code of Ethics.
In 2017, under this liquidity contract, 1,776,319 shares were purchased, i.e., 1.29% of the Company's capital stock, for a total of 82,001,297.50, while 1,776,319 shares were sold for a total of 82,102,544.
As of December 31, 2017, assets in the liquidity account relating to the liquidity contract comprised 0 shares and 0 in cash.
In 2017, the capital gain made through the liquidity contract amounted to 101,246.50. Management fees for the liquidity contract came to 100,000 in 2017.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUY-BACK PROGRAM
(Defined according to Article 241-2 of the AMF's General Regulation)
A new share buyback authorization will be submitted to the General meeting of May 29, 2018, with the following terms and conditions:
Resolution twelve ­ Authorization to the Board of Directors aiming to allow the Company to buy back its own shares pursuant to Article L. 225-209 of the French Code of commerce, duration of authorization, purposes, terms and conditions, ceiling, suspension during public offerings
The General meeting, after having read the report by the Board of Directors, authorizes the latter, for a period of eighteen months, in accordance with Articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Code of commerce, to purchase company shares, in one or several installments, at such times that it deems appropriate, capped at 10% of the total number of shares in the Company's capital stock, adjusted to take into account any possible increase or decrease in the share capital that may occur during the program.
This authorization terminates the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the General meeting of May 30, 2017 (ordinary resolution eighteen).
Acquisitions are authorized in order to:
 support the secondary market or the liquidity of Faurecia shares, through an investment service provider under a liquidity contract, in accordance with the AMAFI (French association of stock markets) Code of Ethics, as allowed by regulations, with the stipulation that in this context, the number of shares used to calculate the aforementioned cap corresponds to the number of shares purchased, less the number of shares resold;
 retain the shares purchased and use these shares for exchange or payment at a later stage, as part of any possible external growth transactions;
 hedge stock option plans and/or free grant of shares plans (or similar plans) to the benefit of employees and/or Group corporate officers, as well as all allocations of shares as part of a group or Company savings plan (or similar plan), under a profit-sharing plan and or any other form of allocation of shares to the benefit of the Group employees and/or corporate officers;
 hedge securities giving access to the allocation of Company shares subject to the regulations in force;
 cancel the shares acquired, if applicable, in accordance with the current or future authorization of an Extraordinary General Meeting.

3 Governance and capital stock
Capital stock and shareholder structure

Such shares may be purchased by any means, including by acquiring blocks of shares, and at such times deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors may not, without the prior authorization of the General meeting, use this authorization during a public offering launched by a third party, involving company shares, until the end of the offering.
The Company reserves the right to use optional mechanisms or derivatives subject to the applicable regulations.
The maximum purchase price per share is set at 110 (one hundred and ten). In the event of transactions affecting the capital stock, in particular a division of shares, a reverse stock split or allocation of free shares, the aforementioned amount will

be adjusted in the same proportions (multiplication coefficient equal to the ratio of the number of company shares prior to the transaction to the number of shares after the transaction).
On this basis, and for information only, the maximum amount, which the Company would pay, assuming a maximum purchase price of 110 (one hundred and ten), would amount to 1,428,818,600 on the basis of the capital stock on December 31, 2017 (consisting of 138,035,801 shares), taking into account the 814,320 company treasury shares on this date.
The General meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors, with a sub-delegation option in accordance with legal provisions, to carry out these transactions, set the conditions and procedures thereof, enter into all agreements and carry out all of the required formalities.

4.1.1. Safety in the workplace

Safety in the workplace is one of the key elements of the excellence initiative embodied by the Faurecia Excellence System (FES). It forms part of the personal respect requirement which every site must satisfy. Faurecia's policy on health and safety in the workplace at the day-to-day level centers around two main goals: safeguarding staff health and improving staff safety in the workplace.
Thanks to Faurecia's commitment to enhancing occupational safety and working conditions, Faurecia has regularly reduced the number of work-related accidents since 2003. To speed up this change, in 2010, Faurecia launched a breakthrough safety plan which, in two years, enabled it to achieve its highly ambitious objective of reducing the frequency of work-related accidents with lost time per million working hours by two thirds.

 FR1t measures the number of work-related accidents involving a Faurecia employee or temporary worker, with or without lost time, per million hours worked.
Both indicators are calculated on a rolling six-month basis.
After each FR0t and FR1t accident, a Quick Response Continuous Improvement (QRCI) analysis is performed using a problem-solving method based on the best practices in terms of solving quality problems to ensure that the root causes of the accident are understood, that corrective actions have been effective and that preventative measures are implemented and shared across the various sites.

4.1.1.1. Workplace safety indicators
The change in the frequency rate of work-related accidents is analyzed in order to measure the effectiveness of actions carried out in this area. To guarantee the same level of workplace safety for all employees, temporary workers are included in the same manner as permanent staff in the following indicators:
The Group's excellence indicators are FR0t and FR1t:
 FR0t measures the number of work-related accidents involving a Faurecia employee or temporary worker, with lost time, per million hours worked;

The rates shown above, calculated on a rolling six-month basis, indicate the accident incidence rates approved as of the end of each fiscal year.
For 2017, the results for the first and second half of the year are shown separately.
In its plants, Faurecia also monitors the FR2t indicator, of which stability recorded especially vs 2016, is a strong sign of the absence of aggravation of FR0t and FR1t indicators. This indicator measures the number of first aid procedures performed following an incident per million hours worked. This

monitoring enables plants that have few accidents, with or without lost time, to focus on accident prevention and relevant priorities.
The monitoring of first aid concerns all autonomous production units, combined with application of the QRCI problem-solving method. This has enabled production managers to take greater responsibility for accident investigations and to increase their responsiveness.
The Group does not report the accident severity indicator as priority is given to accident prevention.

4.1.1.2. Safety initiatives for safer operations
Faurecia has fully integrated specific measures from its 2010 breakthrough safety plan into its practices and pursued the implementation of these actions all through 2017.
The purpose of the breakthrough safety plan is to reduce the number of work-related accidents and serious HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) alerts following work-related accidents by providing training in the Group's various mandatory HSE rules as well as in monitoring the enforcement of these rules.
As such, Faurecia provides specialized internal training to its network of employees, including temporary employees, in 13 mandatory HSE rules and 13 logistical HSE recommendations. The training includes well-targeted theory and practice modules with practical scenarios which allow employees to learn or improve their knowledge of the HSE rules.
The 13 mandatory HSE rules relate to personal safety. These rules are applied at all of Faurecia's sites.
Any plant reporting a serious HSE alert or an abnormally high work-related accident rate is audited by the Group's Quality department. An unsatisfactory audit result (level D) systematically results in a report being sent to the Group's Chief Executive Officer. No site has been on level D since the end of 2011. Faurecia ensures that these rules are applied at all the other sites by means of Faurecia Excellence System (FES) production audits.
Applying these 13 rules has made it possible to significantly reduce the number of serious HSE alerts and to achieve the FR0t objective.
Three mandatory HSE rules apply to the control of nonproduction operational risks. The first two cover consignment operations (stopping processes, locking and draining energy and blocking gravitational energy), the third requires the application of a "Personal ID" label when working with equipment. This prevents machines being restarted by others, the owner of the personal ID label being the only person entitled to remove it from the machine.
Four other rules apply to the protection of personnel during production operations. They cover protection against access to moving parts of machines through the establishment of protective devices such as light curtains, safety mats, radars and fixed barriers. The plant must ensure that the failure of one component of the safety loop will stop the machine automatically. Protective equipment is tested before production begins. If the protective equipment has any faults, the machine must not be used.
The other rules focus on the prevention of falls, finger pinch point injuries, traffic accidents, the bursting of hydraulic circuits, and fires and explosions.

In addition to the 13 mandatory HSE rules, Faurecia defined 3 rules on personal protection equipment (3PPE) for all Group sites. The application of these rules and their monitoring via FES production audits is contributing to the prevention of work-related accidents not resulting in lost time (FR1t). These rules related to protective equipment require the wearing of helmets during maintenance operations, gloves and cutresistant sleeves when using cutting elements or handling metal and thermal protection when working with hot materials. These rules also make it mandatory to wear ear protectors in noisy environments.
Furthermore, each Faurecia plant defines, on an individual basis, the personal protection equipment to be used by its employees or visitors. Faurecia safety footwear and clothing are mandatory in nearly all the plants. Ear protectors are mandatory in plants with high noise levels, as well as, in most cases, safety glasses.
A film has been made about the 13 mandatory HSE and the 3 PPE rules so as to raise awareness among Faurecia employees. This film, with the help of practical scenarios demonstrating the different rules, is also intended for FES training for managers and was notably used in Europe, North and South America and Asia. In particular, these training courses focused on learning about the Group problem-solving technique, QRCI (Quick Response Continuous Improvement) regarding HSE.
Faurecia further pursues its fire safety initiatives, particularly with the installation of sprinklers. In doing that, the Group not only ensures the safety of its staff, but also reduces the risk of production downtime due to fire.
The analysis of accidents has shown that many are related to work outside the standard production process. For this reason, the plants will now systematically review potential risks for this type of work.
Thirteen strict HSE recommendations were also developed. Five of these relate to plant safety, four to the safety of machine operators, two to vehicles and the last two relate to pedestrians. The Faurecia group has been monitoring the application of these 13 rules in all of its plants. In 2016, a new training module for the logistics teams was introduced, and it was continued in 2017.
The actions concerning the safety of contractors (including subcontractors) working at high levels were maintained. The contractor and subcontractor requirement levels have been raised and now require risk assessment, training and verification. A risk assessment is conducted with the contractor in order to detect all risks and devise preventive measures. Contractors are asked to guarantee that all employees (including temporary staff) carrying out tasks at high levels have been trained and are fully qualified. Each contractor must appoint a security manager who will guarantee that all measures devised during the risk assessment are applied and adhered to. As a result, only the contractors who have followed this process are authorized to work on the roofs at Faurecia plants.

4.1.1.3. Ergonomics and working conditions
Most occupational illnesses reported by employees involve musculoskeletal disorders. To reduce this, Faurecia has taken steps for several years to take the strain caused by workstations into greater consideration and to remedy the situation as much as possible.
Ergonomic reviews of workstations form part of the FES and the Group systematically carries out audits at each of its production plants on an annual basis.
As a result of these reviews, a variety of solutions have been implemented for manufacturing workstations. The reviews are also used to prepare a list of recommendations that are systematically taken into account during the design of products and manufacturing tools.
A number of recommendations from professional ergonomists and Group HSE coordinators are being factored into the Program Management System (PMS).

All of the Group's operations managers and plant managers have been given training in ergonomics as part of the acceleration of the deployment of the FES, which was launched during the second half of 2009 and continued in subsequent years. The goal of this program is to ensure that these managers play a real leadership role in the continuous improvement process, notably for ergonomics-related issues.
An Ergonomics memorandum is available to all Group process engineers and managers in charge of efficiency in manufacturing systems, to provide additional information on analyzing workloads and how to take into consideration the ergonomic constraints of workstations. This memorandum is aimed at providing basic training in this area for people such as members of Health and Safety Committees, who are involved in organizing work schedules or designing workstations.
Within the Faurecia Seating Business Group a new ranking software tool was deployed in 2016 for analyzing dangerous gesture and their impact on workplace strain (AGREPT ­ Analyse des Gestes à Risque et leur Effet sur la Pénibilité au Travail). This software simplifies the rating actions for ergonomists while facilitating the consolidation work at Division and Business Group level.

4.1.2. Skills development

Faurecia's employees progress within a meritocratic environment where their advancement is dependent on their potential and performance. The Group's growth and development is directly dependent on the commitment levels and skills of its teams and its capacity to set up the best teams of managers and experts, on a worldwide level. Effective management of Human Resources is, therefore, right at the heart of the Faurecia group's strategy and is based on three principles: involvement, performance and development. Internal promotion is a key priority. It is based on individual development and makes it possible to capitalize on automotive know-how, expertise and a high level of customer insight.
4.1.2.1. Being Faurecia
The Faurecia group has inherited a long tradition of technological innovation and manufacturing excellence, although it was created in 1997. Since then, the Group has grown rapidly both organically and through major acquisitions. It is now one of the top global automotive suppliers and employs more than 109,000 people in 34 countries.
During the first phase of its history, the Group focused on developing systems and processes necessary to ensure that it provides the same level of quality and operational performance to all of its customers around the world.
The Group has now entered a new phase of development, characterized by steadier growth and a greater emphasis on value creation.

Under these new circumstances, in 2017 the Faurecia group continued to advance its cultural transformation program, Being Faurecia, which was launched in 2014. Being Faurecia aims to redefine the corporate culture and its management model. The program seeks to create an environment that promotes an entrepreneurial spirit and autonomous operating teams. As part of this approach, the Human Resources development strategy has been recalibrated. The priority given to internal promotion has been reaffirmed and most of the Human Resources development processes have been reviewed and improved.
Faurecia is positioning itself as a company that is focused on creating value, is customer-oriented, innovative and has management principles based on self-control, the pursuit of excellence and entrepreneurship.
The corporate values are now broken down into managerial values (entrepreneurship, autonomy and accountability) and behavioral values (respect, exemplarity and energy). The Group developed a Management Code to encourage exemplary behavior within the organization. Relying on practical situations that managers face during their daily activities, this management guide defines the exemplary behavior that is expected from managers.
It has reinforced the decentralized organizational principles. All decision-making processes have been reviewed. The number of such processes has been reduced significantly and their content has been pared down in order to validate the autonomy of the teams at the different levels of the organization.

Human Resources and social policy

In 2017, new initiatives were launched within the framework of Being Faurecia. This topic continues to receive special attention in the Corporate Training offering, such as through leadership training, Diversity Management modules and in the area of Compliance. As part of this, the digital learning platform has been a key distribution driver. Finally, a program to expand collaboration has flourished through the advent of many learning communities set up to promote horizontal cooperation within the organization.
The fourth anniversary of Being Faurecia was celebrated at all Group sites. They have encouraged all staff to take on Board the Group values and bear witness to the Group's strong commitment to the success of its cultural transformation.
To measure commitment and assess practices, in late 2016, a survey was conducted with a representative sample of managers in order to measure the level of adherence to and integration of Being Faurecia within teams. The survey polled a representative sample of 1,000 people. The encouraging results demonstrated considerable progress in the change in expected behaviors.
To thoroughly analyze particular points of resistance that were reported by employees, the Executive Committee appointed cooperative working groups that were comprised of managers from different regions and functions and tasked with offering concrete recommendations for improvements. Three working groups sponsored by an Executive Committee member were formed to address the following topics: manufacturing performance, management of investment requests and reduction of reporting in the plants. The preliminary conclusions were presented, and improvement actions are in the process of being introduced.
Some thoughts over the past months on the CSR field will lead the Group to define, validate and deploy its 10 convictions on this topic in 2018. To allow the implementation of a continuous improvement approach on the chosen axes, a list of indicators will be defined with progress objectives attached.
4.1.2.2. Training policy
4.1.2.2.1. PRINCIPLES
Within the Group, training is considered a strategic investment.
It is a key tool in the implementation of genuine continuous improvement, backed by the Faurecia Excellence System (FES). The training plans focus on ethics, integrity and improving results. In this context, training actions are favored, as are internal training programs.
As training is a tool for development, specific actions are implemented to encourage individual development and to increase team effectiveness.
Training also facilitates the development of the organizational structure and operational principles prevailing within the Group. In this context, the changes induced by the Being Faurecia strategy are gradually incorporated into the Group's training programs.

Lastly, training is a management tool. It is the responsibility of supervisors (identification of needs, communication with interested parties) and is implemented with the support of the Group's Human Resources network.
4.1.2.2.2. PRIORITIES
The priorities identified in training plans are used to achieve the goals set for different business units. They are structured around the following themes:
 improving plant performance (safety, quality, costs and deadlines) and ensuring optimal production start-up;
 enhancing the attractiveness of customer offerings;
 increasing technological expertise in products and processes;
 increasing the professional qualifications of staff, fostering their career development and enhancing their employability;
 developing managerial skills in line with Faurecia's Leadership Competency Model;
 anticipating and managing identified skills requirements over the medium term;
 strengthening a shared culture focusing on value creation and entrepreneurial spirit, while respecting the fundamentals of Faurecia's internal codes (ethics and management), in particular compliance with competition law;
 ensuring the use of common working methods to increase efficiency;
 developing people's ability to work in an international setting.
4.1.2.2.3. 2017 KEY FIGURES
During 2017, the training provided throughout Faurecia represented more than 1.7 million hours.
4.1.2.2.4. FOCUS ON FAURECIA UNIVERSITY
In 2017, Faurecia University reached an immense audience, training more than 9,000 employees over the period. The three regional campuses successfully delivered Corporate training and created targeted programs addressing regional issues. In addition to the Nanterre campus, these universities have specialized teams and sites in Auburn Hills (Michigan), Puebla (Mexico) and Shanghai (China).
1. Role and responsibilities of Faurecia University
Faurecia University aims to assist with management development and offer a firm foundation for the cultural transformation the Company has embarked upon.
To this effect, Faurecia University assists managers throughout their careers by:
 ensuring their integration within the Group;
 helping them to acquire functional skills necessary for their professional growth;
 offering training to help them acquire and improve their managerial skills and to develop their leadership skills;

216

Human Resources and social policy

 preparing them for key positions (plant manager, program manager, R&D manager);
 preparing them in advance for taking on leadership responsibilities.
To address these issues, the university uses up-to-date, interactive educational methods and the best digital tools available.
2. Mode of governance
Faurecia University has an Advisory Board comprising the members of the Group's Executive Committee. The Advisory Board met twice in 2017. In addition to attending these plenary meetings, the Advisory Board members are closely involved in creating new programs and are especially active in certain key programs.
3. A firmly established training offer
The Leadership Development offer, which was introduced in 2016, had broader impact in 2017, reaching 1,400 managers (vs. 700 managers in 2016). It covers a full range of leadership skills broken down by themes and levels of responsibility. This undertaking aligns Faurecia with the best practices in the world in terms of investment in its employees' skills to make the Group a major player in the transformation of the automotive industry.
The DRIVE program, which has separate levels for managers and experienced managers and is broken down into different modules on leadership, is thriving, especially through its modules on change management, innovation and team dynamics. This offer has benefited from the growing experience of its partner, Impact International, a renowned English firm that specializes in managerial training, and the rising involvement of dozens of Faurecia managers, who have enhanced this training by sharing testimonials and stories about their experiences. The outstanding instructors and in-depth work combining e-learning, coursework and group role-plays have made this training a vital rite for Group managers that guarantees their success in their assignments in Nanterre (France), Auburn Hills (United States), Puebla (Mexico) and now Pune (India).
IGNITE, the offer for executives that was designed and implemented with the London Business School, was delivered to two-thirds of the executives, who could follow a basic module focusing on «transformation» and another module on «team management.» These modules gave executives the tools to deepen their ability to operate in the new ecosystem of the automotive industry and to engage their teams as their environment changes around them. The steady presence of members of Faurecia's Executive Committee, who shared their stories during training and interacted with the executives, is one of the many ways in which the organization demonstrates that it is committed to and responsible for helping its managers grow.
Faurecia University has continued to expand its high-level training offers targeting the sales function in partnership with IESE of Barcelona, it has started a new program on negotiation and purchasing, and it has helped executives

in the financial function improve their skills so they can better advise managers.
In 2017, digital training took on a new dimension through the Learning Lab, an internal training platform open to all Group managers and employees. The training, which take the form of short, animated, engaging, original videos combined with questions, have been a hit and have propelled Faurecia to the ranks of the most advanced organizations in the field. The success of the digital training stems from multimedia access (PC, tablet, smartphone), a library of more than 120 digital courses on topics ranging from the fundamental aspects of Faurecia (FES, Program Management System, basic transactions, gender diversity, ethics and compliance, etc.) to leadership, management and many aspects of the transformation of the business activity. This digital training is being phased in as a key training vehicle.
The numbers tell the story: around 20,000 managers and professionals took courses on the Learning Lab in 2017.
Furthermore, since the opening of the Learning Lab in 2016:
 more than 3.2 million knowledge-testing questions were answered with a supported response;
 more than 250,000 videos were viewed;
 more than 110,000 hours were spent learning.
The Faur'us digital platform further adds to the collaborative and social dimension of this learning by offering the possibility of sharing collaborative and open work methods, thus providing access to rich and diverse knowledge and increasing the collective intelligence. Over 800 communities, involving over 15,000 employees in varied domains daily, were active in 2017.
The Faurecia Seating, Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Clean Mobility Business Groups rolled out training courses in technical academies dedicated to their specific products and processes.
4.1.2.3. Employee empowerment
The Group's success is closely bound up with its capacity to actively involve all its employees in their work on a day-today basis and to create effective and autonomous teams. Employee accountability is one of Faurecia's key performance levers and is also one of the mainstays of the Faurecia Excellence System.
Group employees follow development programs so as to be able to meet their responsibilities. Staff benefit from development opportunities enabling them to increase their level of responsibility, the aim being to constantly improve team skills.
Employees are also encouraged to make an active contribution to continuous improvement. Managers are trained in team leadership so as to be able to effectively support operational efficiency and individual employee development.

Plant Management Committees are key participants in industrial progress. On this basis, they help to make employee empowerment an operational reality and to assist in the deployment of FES tools in plants.
After an overhaul in 2016, training modules on employee empowerment were rolled out more quickly in 2017:
 fundamentals of employee empowerment: this module is geared to the Plant Management Committees. It aims to develop their role in the day-to-day management of teams by using the FES. The link between the seven basic principles of employee empowerment and their impact on the business has been improved thanks to the use of digital tools. About 500 people benefited from this module in 2017;
 site Human Resources officers: this module aims to cultivate current and future Human Resources officers. Following the update of the module, it now focuses on strengthening the links between day-to-day responsibilities and employee empowerment. About 80 HR professionals benefited from it in 2017;
 a new "Massive Open Online Course" (MOOC) platform was launched in 2016. Within this framework, ten modules dedicated to employee empowerment were made available online. At the end of 2017, 3,500 employees had completed them.
In order to maintain a strong improvement momentum within the Company, the employees are encouraged to express their ideas for improvement based on their daily experience. The number of ideas for improvement acted upon remained stable at 13 per employee in 2017.
Furthermore, 38% of supervisors at Faurecia have a level of education equivalent to a Bachelor's degree or higher. This is in line with the Group's objective of recruiting young graduates to have sufficient internal talent reserves to secure the next generation of autonomous production unit managers and, in the longer term, plant managers.
4.1.2.4. Developing the potential of engineers and managers
Faurecia integrates and develops the potential of its engineers and managers so as to improve their performance and skills and offer them attractive career paths. The effective development of engineers' and managers' potential is at the core of the Being Faurecia program. The Group seeks to continuously improve the performance of its managers and ensure their professional development so that they can realize their potential.
At the same time, the Group constantly adapts its allocation of Human Resources to meet short-term business demands and prepares for the medium-term to ensure that the Group always has best-in-class in terms of managers and technical experts, driven by the pursuit of excellent customer service.
4.1.2.4.1. RECRUITING AND RETAINING TALENT
Faurecia has grown substantially in recent years, and now has headcounts of just over 109,000 people, more than 18,000 of whom were engineers and managers as of the end of 2017.

Over the last four years, the volume of external hires has stabilized, at slightly over 2,300 engineers and managers. In 2017, hires were mainly carried out in Asia (1,001), Europe (784), and North America (537); the countries that recruited the most in these regions were China (583), the United States (348), India (329) and Mexico (183). At the same time, the number of hires remained somewhat stable in France (354) and declined in Germany (120 compared to 142 in 2016).
43% of new employees were assigned to production, 35% to sales, R&D and program functions, and 22% to support functions.
In 2017, Faurecia continued to focus on recruiting recent graduates and early-career professionals in order to ensure that the Group recruits and retains the talent of the future. Programs and preferential partnerships with postsecondary institutions are in place in many countries where the Group operates so as to publicize internship and job opportunities among students.
To ensure the success of newly recruited employees, Faurecia offers all new hires a personal induction program enabling them to find out more about the Company, its values, strategy and organization, and to become acquainted with its culture and operating systems. Some countries have organized special events, such as orientation days, to expedite the integration of new hires.
Developing and promoting international exposure is essential for a Group that employs 66% of its engineers and managers outside Western Europe and carries out 78% of its recruitment outside this region. Within this framework, Faurecia can offer its people many international assignments as well as the opportunity to take part in international projects.
Lastly, a stable employee base is essential for safeguarding our investment in human capital. In 2017, the resignation rate of engineers and managers was stable: (-8.3% compared to -8.4% in 2016). This figure is improving in North America (10.9% vs. 11.8% in 2016) but increasing in Europe (6.9% vs. 5.6% in 2016), mainly in Central Europe (12.1% vs. 9% in 2016). In China, it was 8.4%, below the market average. The resignation rate for senior management positions was 4.5% in 2017.
4.1.2.4.2. THE EMPLOYEES OF TOMORROW
In 2017, the Group continued to implement two Faurecia Talent Initiatives in order to attract and retain the employees of tomorrow, two key factors in sustaining the Group's growth.
The aim of the first project was to improve gender diversity at the time of recruitment and for employee development in general.
An action plan was defined by working groups, covering both Group-wide Human Resources issues and the introduction of dedicated social networks, while respecting local cultural particularities. It covers six areas:
 improvement of working conditions, in particular through the deployment of telework and the implementation of concierge-type services, in order to promote a better balance between personal and professional life;

218

/ Registration document 2017

4 CSR
Human Resources and social policy

 cultivating women's careers: the People Review was adapted and now includes a section on female talent. At the same time, a process was launched to accompany the spouses of expatriate employees through external and individualized support to prepare the best departure, to facilitate cultural and professional adaptation, and to help find local employment;
 the talent acquisition strategy was also reviewed: country recruitment officers reviewed the list of target schools, giving preference to those with an even male-female ratio. The list of Ambassadors was completed to ensure that women are duly represented. The recruitment agencies were also made aware of the Group's ambition to welcome more female talent. Lastly, the internal training on recruitment now covers the issue of diversity awareness;
 training is a lever to speed up this cultural change: Faurecia University makes certain that diversity management is an integral part of the training delivered to managers, and it has handled the establishment of training programs targeting women in order to help them bolster their influence, impact and visibility;
 studies have been launched in key countries to ensure pay equity. The results of the two statistical studies carried out show no major differences;
 the women@faurecia network was created to support initiatives in favor of gender diversity. With the support of local representatives, the members of the network organize internal events and also participate in associations and activities.
Implemented in 2016, these actions are starting to bear fruit. The proportion of the number of women increased slightly and now represents 23.3% of managers and one Notes a positive trend as regards front-line positions at the sites (20.8% in 2017 vs. 19.7% in 2016), front-line positions in the Divisions (11.6% in 2017 vs. 9.2% in 2016) and senior management positions (10.6% of top management in 2017 vs. 9.7% in 2016).
The goal of the second project is to recruit more young graduates. Although 44.5% of new recruits to entry-level management positions were young graduates, which is in line with the sector average, this figure is not high enough to inject the required level of talent into the Group to guarantee its growth. Working groups were set up and tasked with identifying the action the Group could take globally and locally to help it find a way to quickly increase the recruitment rate of young graduates.
To help it reach its target to recruit more young graduates, including female graduates, the Group relies heavily on the VIE international corporate volunteer program. In 2017, the number of international corporate volunteer (Volontariat International en Entreprise, VIE) contracts continued to grow, with 294 signed, compared with 280 in 2016. It is noteworthy that almost 50% of the young engineers and managers who completed their VIE assignments in 2017 were recruited by Faurecia, mainly in France (43%), Germany (27%), and the rest of Europe (12%). Furthermore, nine VIEs were hired in Asia and seven in North America.

4.1.2.4.3. CONSOLIDATING THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE CULTURE AND HAVING EXEMPLARY LEADERS
A fair, objective performance assessment is a cornerstone of employee development and a key Being Faurecia concept. In 2017, the Group launched the third campaign of its new performance appraisal system, STAR (Setting Targets, Achieving Results), a comprehensive approach combining three components:
 a management by objective component that aligns individual performance with business objectives;
 the evaluation of behavior enables the measurement of commitment to the Group's values. They consist of three managerial values (entrepreneurship, autonomy and accountability) and three individual values (respect, exemplarity and energy). A Management Code was developed to illustrate the behavior expected from managers in the main situations they might face. This Code is intended to be a practical guide for managers to develop exemplary behavior;
 lastly, the managerial skills assessment makes it possible to identify each individual's strengths as well as areas where there is room for improvement so as to construct practical and effective individual development plans. The Code, which describes the managerial skills that must be mastered at each level of the organization, is at the center of performance management and the identification of the potential and development of future leaders.
In 2017, managerial engagement and the quality of reviews remain objectives of the STAR campaign. In order to reinforce the message, the three priorities identified the previous year were retained: improve the quality of feedback, strengthen internal equity in terms of performance reviews and improve the robustness and follow-up of development actions.
In order to be more consistent with internal managerial practices, the scale of performance levels was trimmed from five to four levels in 2017. Identifying and giving recognition to the best-performing employees is especially encouraged.
4.1.2.4.4. DEVELOPING SKILLS AND OPTIMIZING CAREER MANAGEMENT
The Group's internal promotion policy revolves around offering career opportunities to employees who succeed and demonstrate their potential.
Despite a high recruitment rate, the rate of vacancies filled internally amounted to 50.6% overall in 2017, down on the 2016 figure (58%). The percentage is closer to 74% for Senior Management positions. The results for managerial posts were achieved through the implementation of robust succession planning and individual development plans, based on individual reviews made at least once a year at all levels of the Company (sites, divisions, Business Groups, Group) and on a rigorous use of Faurecia's managerial skills model.
In 2017, 15.6% of engineers and managers benefited from internal mobility.

Human Resources and social policy

In line with the Group's expertise management policy, Faurecia particularly rewards performance in technical and technological areas. The Group offers its experts a specific career program, which has the added advantage of allowing it to enhance business-specific skills within each product line. In 2017, Faurecia had 322 experts, including 45 senior experts and 4 master experts. 39 new appointments, consisting of 34 experts and 5 senior experts, were in the process of being approved as of the end of 2017. The skills portfolios for the target areas of expertise were reviewed in 2017 in order to incorporate the skills in HMI (Human Machine Interface), ergonomics and on-board comfort, the Cockpit of the Future and more.
4.1.2.4.5. FOSTERING TALENT, AN AMBITIOUS OBJECTIVE
To prepare the managers of tomorrow, talent identification should start as early as possible. The applicants are offered diverse career paths to realize their potential. These paths include inter-functions/inter-divisions mobility, project work or short-term assignments. The plan aims to help employees step out of their comfort zone and provide them with general management skills.
External assessments are offered to current and future leaders. The aim is to help all individuals better understand their development potential so they can make the best career choices. Individual development plans are defined as part of this process. In all, 61 assessments were carried out in 2017 (total since the beginning: 256).
Alongside these internal activities, a reinforcement plan was rolled out in France, Germany, the United States and China to recruit high-potential applicants for whom an accelerated career path is defined and implemented. At the end of 2017, 22 people were participating in this program.

The Group also places great importance on the international dimension of its Senior Management team, while taking steps to attract, develop and retain local talent across the globe. In keeping with this strategy, 55% of the Group's senior managers are non-French nationals (compared to 57% in 2016), and 53% of engineers and managers identified as having Senior Management potential are from countries outside Western Europe (compared to 43% in 2016).
The Executive Committee strengthened its involvement in managing talent. It now assesses the Group's high-potential staff twice a year, with a particular focus on potential executives. In addition to the People Reviews normally organized at the Business Group, Division and functional levels, Key Reservoir Reviews were carried out in North America, Asia and South America in order to develop internal mobility and to optimize local talent management. Since 2016, a new process called "Cross BG Point HR" was also set up at Group level in order to develop the mobility of Senior Managers between Business Groups.
Following audits carried out in 2017 by the Top Employer Institute, Faurecia is among the 31 companies which were awarded the "Top Employer Europe" label for 2018. This global recognition can be added to the Top Employer certification received by key countries of the Group in Europe: France, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic, Poland; in Asia: China, India and on the American continent, in the United-States.
The Top Employer label rewards companies for the excellence of their practices in terms of management of human capital especially in the field of attraction and development of talents, compensation and social advantages, training and development of competences.

4.1.3. Strengthening economic and social dialog

4.1.3.1. An environment of contrasting business activity by region
In 2017, Faurecia's overall level of business continued to increase due to sustained growth in Europe and Asia and gradual resumption of business in South America.
This trend was reflected by continued growth in the workforce which rose from 79,818 at the end of 2016 to 86,319 at the end of 2017 (up 8.1%).
Industrial redeployment initiatives affected 17 sites in 2017, impacting 1,205 jobs in 10 countries, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America.
Against this backdrop, thanks to the commercial success of a number of vehicles and to sales that far surpassed the growth

of automotive production, the number of registered employees in Europe increased by 4.4% despite restructuring undertaken in some Western European countries.
Despite a sharp drop in automotive production in North America, Faurecia's strong resistance in the region helped the number of registered employees to rise by 4.1%.
In South America, the number of registered employees surged by 33.5% due to high order intake and the contribution of the business of the FCA-Pernambuco joint venture.
Finally, thanks to significant gains in market share, particularly among Chinese automakers, Faurecia continued to grow in Asia, where the number of registered employees jumped by 23.9%, thus consolidating all the growth potential on this market and the positive commercial dynamic achieved with local automakers and foreign automakers operating in the region.

4.1.3.2. Greater social dialog and consultation with employee representatives
Pursuant to the component on the development of economic and social dialog of the Code of Ethics in force since 2007, complemented in 2014 by the Being Faurecia program, the Group's various entities continued an active policy of dialog and negotiation with employee representatives.
In 2017, this policy resulted in the establishment of 308 site or company agreements in 22 countries, including 137 in France, 72 in Germany, 27 in Brazil, 12 in Mexico, 11 in Argentina, 6 in Italy and 5 in the Czech Republic, United States, and Uruguay.
26% of these agreements related to working conditions and working hours, 24% to statutory profit-sharing and incentive plans and 20% to wages and benefits.
More specifically, in terms of targeting increased competitiveness and/or performance, negotiations were successfully concluded in 2017 at a number of sites where this was a key issue to keeping the business going or to winning new programs, thereby avoiding any new plans for industrial redeployment. As a result, two new competition agreements covering a Spanish site and a French site were finalized within the Group's various businesses. With these new agreements and those entered into in previous fiscal years, this brings to almost 46 the total number of sites covered by competition agreements since 2012.
In addition, in all the countries in which it operates, the Group is keen to implement existing plans so as to reduce the impact on jobs arising from a slowdown in business. For example, these measures represented the equivalent of 608,207 hours in 2017, down by more than 36% compared to fiscal year 2016. At the same time, in the event of any industrial redeployments, the Group prefers to make use of internal mobility, both on a geographical and cross-divisional level, as well as voluntary redundancy plans. In the event that a site closure is required, the Group endeavors, where this is possible, to put in place re-industrialization projects by providing financial and/or operational assistance to industrial players that are likely to propose redeployment solutions to its employees. In cases where compulsory redundancies cannot be avoided, providing support for those employees seeking redeployment is a priority.
Created in 2003, the European Works Council is a key body in the Group's economic and social dialog, the preferred forum for exchanges with employee representatives on the Group's strategy, results and outlook.
The functioning of this body is governed for four years by the agreement signed unanimously on January 11, 2016. There are 25 seats, giving representation to each of the 15 European countries where Faurecia operates.
As a result of the appointment process for members of the European Works Council under this new authorization, more than 30% new members were appointed. A three-and-a-halfday-long training was then held in Barcelona, Spain, in March

2017 in order to give these members the resources to best perform their duties.
To meet the needs of the members of this body, this training focused on closely analyzing the content and potential offered by the new agreement, and on the fundamental economic concepts and their application within the Group and its industry.
In light of the current transformation of the automotive sector and visible fundamental trends, there was also a module on the issues and impacts of the "Mobility" revolution.
The European Works Council met in plenary session on May 10 and 11, 2017. The Council Board, comprising representatives of the six biggest countries in terms of workforce (i.e., France, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Spain and Portugal), met three times during the year.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the last Board meeting of the year was held at a site on November 28, 2017. On that occasion, the Board members visited the Faurecia Interiors plant and Dacia assembly site located in Pitesti, Romania.
Finally, in accordance with the new regulations ensuing from the French law of August 17, 2015, on employment and social dialog, the Group appointed two Board members representing employees to sit on Faurecia's Board of Directors beginning on November 1, 2017.
Pursuant to the provisions of the bylaws, one is appointed by the union organization obtaining the most votes in the first round of the elections mentioned in Articles L. 2122-1 and L. 2122-4 of the French Labor Code in France; the other is appointed through an anonymous vote by the Faurecia European Works Council (FEWC).
In order to effectively prepare for discharging their duties, in late 2017 the two Board members representing employees completed a specialized set of training sessions organized with Sciences Po.
4.1.3.3. Respect of fundamental rights
Faurecia adhered to the UN Global Compact in 2004. By doing so, the Group committed to abiding by and promoting, in its business practices, a set of values and principles drawn from international texts and conventions relating to human rights, labor standards and the environment. Changes within the Group, the new requirements of customers and new guidelines bearing on corporate social responsibility and sustainable development prompted Faurecia in 2007 to prepare a new version of its Code of Ethics mirroring the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Core Conventions. This Code of Ethics was updated in 2014 as part of the roll out of the Being Faurecia program, intended to strengthen the Group's culture and contribute to the creation of long-term value. The Management Code, which was established at that time to guide the dayto-day management of teams, customers and also suppliers, translated many of the principles set out in the Code of Ethics into operations. Faurecia developed an e-learning tool on

Compliance that lets managers and professionals test their knowledge on the Group's Code of Ethics and Management Code. After its 2016 launch in North America and China, in 2017 this MOOC was rolled out in Europe and in the rest of the regions where the Group operates.
4.1.3.3.1. PROHIBITION OF CHILD LABOR
Faurecia complies with national laws and regulations relating to child labor. It will not employ children under the age of 16, under any circumstances, and complies with the provisions of the ILO regarding the health, safety and morality of young people aged between 15 and 18. The Group ensures that its suppliers and partners adhere to the same principles.
4.1.3.3.2. ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED LABOR
Faurecia is committed to the free choice of employment and the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor. It ensures that its suppliers and/or partners adhere to the same principles.
4.1.3.3.3. FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
Faurecia recognizes the existence of trade unions worldwide and the right of workers to form the union organization of their choice and/or to organize workers' representation in accordance with the laws and regulations in force. The Group undertakes to protect union members and leaders and not to make any discrimination based on the offices held.
The Group is also committed to promoting a policy of dialog and negotiation. Given its decentralized legal and managerial structure, this policy is implemented through collective bargaining agreements signed with the sites, on the one hand, and companies, on the other.

4.1.3.3.4. ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION
The Group is committed not to discriminate against anyone, notably on the basis of age, sex, skin color, nationality, religion, health status or disability, sexual orientation, political, philosophical or union-related opinion in its recruitment and career development initiatives. Every employee has the right to work in a healthy environment, free from any form of hostility or harassment qualified as unlawful under the regulations and practices in force in the countries where the Faurecia group operates.
In particular, Faurecia forbids any unlawful conduct construed as sexual or moral harassment, including in the absence of any hierarchical or subordination relationship.
4.1.3.4. Changes in compensation and benefits
The total amount of compensation paid, including social contributions, increased by 6.02% across the Group as a whole: 3,243.4 million in 2017, compared with 3,059.1 million in 2016. Meanwhile, the number of employees at the end of the year increased by 8.1% (+8.9% for engineers and managers).
The Group adheres to current minimum wage legislation in each country. Wage negotiations are held in the majority of countries. In 2017, 62 agreements were concluded on wage/ bonus/compensation packages and 77 on profit-sharing/ incentives.
A system of variable compensation, based essentially on business units performance, applies in a uniform manner in all countries in which Faurecia operates. At end-2017, around 4,000 managers (after the disposal of the Exteriors business), out of a total of more than 18,000 managers on open-ended contracts, were eligible for such variable compensation.

4.1.4. Company savings, incentive and profit-sharing bonuses in the development of the Group

4.1.4.1. Employee savings plans in France
In France, the Group has over the past few years implemented several mechanisms to allow employees to accumulate savings.
Since 2004, employees have had access to a Group employee savings plan (PEG) open to amounts distributed under profitsharing and incentive plans, as well as voluntary contributions.
Thirteen funds are available, including Faurecia Actionnariat, a mutual fund investing exclusively in Faurecia stock. At end2017, total funds managed in the employee savings plan (PEG) stood at 53.5 million, of which 35% were invested in Faurecia Actionnariat (2,846 employees).

Employees also have access to the Group retirement savings plan (PERCO), set up in late 2012. Like the employee savings plan, payments into the Group pension savings plan can be made from discretionary and non-discretionary profit-sharing plans as well as voluntary employee contributions. At end-2017, total funds managed in the retirement savings plan (PERCO) stood at 3.7 million.
A defined-contribution pension scheme was also introduced in 2006 for group executives and was opened up to voluntary contributions from employees in 2013. The various retirement savings plans have more than 95.8 million under management.

4.1.4.2. Incentive plans in France
The incentive agreements entered into by the Group's various French companies mostly establish how voluntary incentive payouts are calculated based on two sets of indicators:
 financial indicators at Company level. This part accounts for about 40% of the overall payout and is calculated annually;
 operational performance indicators calculated at site level and selected from among Faurecia Excellence System indicators. This part accounts for about 60% of the overall payout and is calculated half-yearly.
Under these agreements, the payout is capped at 5 to 6% of payroll ­ although in exceptional cases it may be raised to 6.7 to 8% if objectives are exceeded ­ and is allocated partly in proportion to salary and partly applied on a uniform basis depending on hours worked.
In 2017, 18.5 million was paid out to employees under the incentive plan (17.6 million in 2016), of which 7.2 million were invested in Group employee savings plans in France (PEG or PERCO).
4.1.4.3. Profit-Sharing in France
The mandatory profit-sharing agreements of the various group companies stipulate, for the most part, that employee profitsharing calculated in accordance with the legal formula must be allocated among employees prorated on the basis of their compensation for the year in question, subject to compliance with regulatory limits.
The amounts allocated to the profit-sharing reserve may be held in a no-access account or invested in the corporate mutual funds set up in connection with the Group employee savings plan (PEG) or retirement savings plan (PERCO).

In 2017, 7.6 million was paid out to employees under the profitsharing plan (8.5 million in 2016), of which 2.6 million were invested in Group employee savings plans in France (PEG or PERCO).
4.1.4.4. Stock subscription options and performance share plans
Faurecia has set up performance share plans for its Senior Management, with a view to promoting motivation and fostering loyalty. It follows a procedure established by the Board of Directors at its meeting of December 17, 2009.
The Combined General meeting of May 27, 2016 authorized the Board of Directors to grant a maximum of 2,000,000 performance shares.
Based on this authorization, on July 20, 2017, the Board of Directors allocated a maximum of 816,300 performance shares to 336 beneficiaries, including 36 high-potential managers. The latter include an internal requirement relating to the Group's net income (after tax) in 2019 and an external requirement comparing net earnings per Faurecia share between 2016 and 2019 with reference to a group of 12 comparable international automotive suppliers. It should be noted that the last six plans were allocated in the same period of the year.
As at December 31, 2017, there were 2,637,293 performance shares that could be allocated through July 2021 subject to the fulfillment of the corresponding performance conditions.

4.1.5. Administrative efficiency of Human Resources

The rationalization of the Human Resources IT system begun in 2007 reached another milestone in 2017. GlobalView, the SAP-based payroll and employee management platform, was rolled out in Romania (3,250 people), Poland (7,230 people) and India (2,560 people) during the first half of the year. At the end of 2017, almost 80,000 employees (in 19 countries) were being paid by GlobalView, 93% of the Group's registered employees.
Dual initiatives have also helped to improve payroll processes: complete outsourcing in the new countries covered by GlobalView and the continued deployment of shared service centers. At the end of the planned deployment, 75% of employees will be paid through a Faurecia shared service center and 25% through an external platform directly managed by the GlobalView provider. This process was backed by the deployment of a Group Manage Payroll Procedure (MPP) in 2015, which was deployed in all group countries in 2016, in order

to handle the internal control and audit of the pay processes by country.
At the same time as rolling out the payroll system, automatic interfaces continued to be set up with the Group's Human Resources reporting, engineers and managers database and accounting system to improve administrative efficacy and make data more reliable. 80% of the GlobalView perimeter is now interfaced with these different systems.
The optimization of administrative procedures also took another step forward as a result of the implementation of a talent management tool and a tool for managerial assessment of individual performance. The corresponding individual development plan was put in place to complete the module, the use of which became widespread in 2017. Human Resources is thus equipped with a modern tool for managing its employees' individual development online. Transparency with

Human Resources and social policy

regard to employees and their managers is a key factor when it comes to improving managerial processes and information system quality.
Lastly, to streamline its Human Resources Information System (HRIS), and in the continuation of its digital transformation, the Group confirmed the deployment of a project team dedicated to setting up a complete Human Resources suite called "SAP Success Factor", integrated with the payroll platform. This project will result in the establishment of a new global Human Resources management platform, called "PASS", covering all the functional needs of the Human Resources function within the Group by the end of 2018. Every Human Resources

employee, manager and partner will thereby have access to a single digital HR management tool across the Group.
Concurrent with the implementation of these technical changes, the content of the monthly HR reporting was simplified in 2017. Thanks to the efficient, fast communication methods that are already in place and the frequency of direct dialog at every level of the organization, the Group was able to eliminate the monthly descriptive "HR report." More broadly, the Group is striving for standardization, automation and simplification in its HR reporting. To this end, five quantitative and monthly indicators will be eliminated in 2018.

The Group's total headcount grew by more than 10,600 people in 2017, up to almost +11% due to a constant activity, many program launches, the continuation of reinforcement of competences and the integration of new activities in China and South America.
The proportion of staff employed on open-ended contracts decreased from 74.5% to 71.8%.
Over the period, the proportion of staff on fixed-term contracts rose from 6.4% to 7.2%, and the proportion of temporary staff rose from 19.0% to 21.0% under the effect of sustained business in Europe and Asia.
In 2017, the number of employees grew mainly in Asia (+4,201 people), in Europe (+3,601 people) and in South America (+1,470 people).
The Group's registered employees increased by 6,501 people in 2017 (+8.1%).
This increase was especially noticeable in Asia (+23.9%, or +2,355 people), due mainly to the integration of two new legal entities in China; in South America (+33.5%, or +1,416 people),

particularly in Brazil with the consolidation of the joint venture signed with Magneti Marelli; and in Europe (+3.2%, or +1,359 people) due to the growth in business in these regions.
Almost 5,000 new hires under open-ended contracts were made in 2017.
The number of temporary employees rose by more than 4,100 people, including almost 4,000 operators in 2017, up to more than +22.0% due to the activity level in particular in Europe and Asia.
As of the end of December 2017, the percentage of temporary employees was 21.0%, 2 points higher than in 2016.
In Europe, the rate rose from 17.3% to 20.3%. It reached 19.0% at the end of 2017 in Western Europe, compared to 22.2% in Central Europe.
Growth in the use of temporary labor was most marked in Poland, France and Slovakia.
This percentage remained high in Asia (more than 40%), as the percentage of temporary labor is structurally high in China.

The number of employees who left the Group totaled 20,136 in 2017, compared with 17,173 in 2016, an increase of 17.3%.
The number of resignations has increased by 19.1% to reach 6,847. They represent 34.0% of the departures in 2017 vs 33.5% in 2016. Of these, 69.2% were operators and workers (mainly in central Europe and in Mexico), 8.8% were technician, foremen and administrative staff and 22.0% managers and professionals.
The percentage of resignations of managers and professionals is slightly decreasing. It amounts to 8.3% in 2017 vs 8.4% in 2016. The percentage of resignations of technician, foremen and administrative staff increased from 6.7% in 2016 to 7.1% in 2017. Eventually, the percentage of resignation of operators and workers rose, during the same period, from 8.2% to 9.6% which

is the main explanation of the global increase of the number of resignations. The most sensible increase of resignations of operators and workers is in Central Europe (Poland, Romania) and in Mexico, in a very stressed working environment.
The number of lay-offs increased from 11.6% to reach 7,699. The relative part of individual and collective layoffs decreased, from 40% to 38% of the total of recorded departures, mainly in the United States and in Mexico.
The number of departures for other causes increased by 23.6% to reach 5.590. The relative part of departures for other causes rose from 26.3% à 27.7%. Of these, 91.5% are due to termination of open-ended contracts or to resignations during the course of open-ended contracts essentially in Mexico.

4.2. Environment

As a major player in pollution control systems and sustainable mobility, Faurecia has long been committed to weighing environmental issues as it engages in activities spanning product design to product end-of-life, management of the environmental impact of its production plants, and collaboration with suppliers. Reducing environmental impact

is central to the Group's product approach. It encompasses lowering vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) thanks to weight and volume reduction and improvements to energy efficiency (for example, by using energy recovery techniques), such as controlling polluting gas emissions, and the expanded use of biobased natural materials.

4.2.1. Approach

4.2.1.1. Key dates in the Group's commitment to environmental performance

4.2.1.2. Materiality assessment and assessment of group environmental issues
The materiality assessment, which was strengthened in 2016 with the initiation of dialog with stakeholders, identified six relevant and significant environmental issues for the Faurecia group.

The most important issue that emerged from the dialog with stakeholders was the structured and targeted formalization of environmental governance. In devising a Group environmental policy, Faurecia took into account this prominent expectation. Key performance indicators were also identified in order to track each material issue. The table below summarizes the issues and indicators:

Faurecia's materiality assessment was done through interviews with its internal and external stakeholders, on the basis of the most important environmental issues, taking into account those identified by the SASB (1) for "automotive subcontractors."

In order to manage these indicators and track their performance, Faurecia has opted to update its materiality assessment every three years, unless its business or scope changes significantly. In 2017, the Group's list of material environmental issues did not change.

4.2.2. Environmental issues

4.2.2.1. Issue #1: Formalize a structured, targeted environmental governance
4.2.2.1.1. GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNING BODIES
In 2017, Faurecia formalized an environmental policy under which the Group commits to reducing the environmental impact of its products and processes by developing new solutions that fit with a circular economy approach. This policy draws on the Company's Code of Ethics and its Being Faurecia culture of value creation. The launch of this policy coincided with the "Green Attitude" campaign, which is currently being rolled out at all of Faurecia's sites. This campaign aims to strengthen the environmental culture of the teams and educate them about behaviors in their daily work that can help improve the Group's environmental performance. This step corresponds to the launch of Faurecia's breakthrough environmental plan.
To implement and manage the environmental policy, the Group relies on an Environment committee that includes business experts and is led by the Group's QHSE department and comprised of the HSE departments of the Business Groups and the Purchasing, Strategy & Innovation, Risk Management, Loss Control and Communication departments. It meets monthly.
Since June 2017, an Energy committee has been meeting quarterly to share best practices in reducing energy consumption and encouraging cooperation among the Group's different entities.
4.2.2.1.2. TRAINING EMPLOYEES AND TEMPORARY WORKERS IN CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Upon being on-boarded, new employees, both permanent and temporary, attend an education session on environmental impact management on the certified sites so they can immediately learn about the environmental best practices of the site where they work.

For the most part, environmental training is done internally. The sessions deal with environmental impact and risk management, waste classification and management, chemicals management, implementation of natural disaster emergency response plans and also the environmental monitoring of subcontractors' sites.
Training focusing on the environmental impact of the product is also planned for the employees of the Faurecia Clean Mobility Business Group.
The training provided by external organizations consists mainly in acquiring in-house expertise, such as mastering the ISO 14001 certification process.
In 2017, more than 37,918 training hours were dedicated to the environment (calculation at constant scope (1): +13% from 2016).
Faurecia concurrently bolstered its educational actions on environmental protection by introducing in September 2017 a global communication campaign, "Green Attitude," which focuses on four topics: the protection of the soil and subsoil, energy management, the quality of discharge into the atmosphere, and waste management.
This campaign takes the form of posters that illustrate 10 good environmental behaviors people should adopt, and it is supplemented by an online training that raises awareness about these topics.
4.2.2.1.3. INVESTMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The main investments in environmental protection pertain to three environmental commitments: waste management, pollution control with the improvement of treatment systems for pollutants discharged into the atmosphere and water, and energy efficiency of the sites. In 2017, investments in environmental protection amounted to 5,971,459, of which 2,425,713 went to energy efficiency.

(1) The calculation at constant scope is used to compare changes between 2 years in %. Constant scope corresponds to sites present over both the current year and the previous year.

ENCOURAGE ENERGY SAVINGS AT SITE LEVEL
11 energy audits were done in 2017 during the reporting period, supplementing the 54 audits done in 2016.
With a view to capitalizing on the results of these audits and mainstreaming best practices, the Group has, on the basis of the action plans issued to each site, drawn up a document listing all the recommendations relating to a site's energy management. Among the document's recommendations are installing a variable-frequency drive with an electric motor that can produce energy savings of 10% to 60%, and adjusting water temperature based on the outside temperature, an action that can also save energy (10% on average). The rational use of the energy resource can also involve the recovery of condensation heat from a boiler room or an air compressor, previously equipped with a heat transformer, to produce domestic hot water.
In 2017, 100 sites (of which 74 were production plants), or 42% of the sites included in the reporting scope, implemented initiatives to increase energy efficiency in their buildings and production tools. In total, more than 2.4 million were invested.
The actions most commonly mentioned by the sites to maximize energy efficiency were the installation of intelligent lighting and heating systems, the use of LEDs, putting machines and equipment in sleep mode and buying or refurbishing production machines that consume less energy. For example, the Braganca (Portugal) site invested in a system that recovers heat from compressors and a lighting system for its parking garages that is powered by solar panels.
In connection with the Company's digital strategy, the Business Groups have started to roll out a method to measure and monitor sites' energy consumption. This approach aims to use innovative tools to better control and manage this energy consumption.

An entire section of the "Green Attitude" campaign is devoted to energy savings in order to bolster these actions at the sites.
ENCOURAGE THE REUSE OF ENERGY SOURCES AND ENHANCE RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The best practices implemented by sites include the installation of solar panels, the use of cogeneration boilers, the recovery of heat energy from the welding process, and the use of heat released by compressors to heat production areas. These are initiatives that are expected to expand in the coming years with the roll-out of the Group's low-carbon approach.
4.2.2.3. Issue #3: Encourage the circular economy
4.2.2.3.1. SUSTAINABLY USING RESOURCES BY OPTIMIZING SUPPLY SOURCES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES
Life cycle analysis
The supply of natural resources and raw materials varies at different stages of a product's life cycle. To guide its choices and strategy and those of automakers, Faurecia is more frequently using life cycle assessments (LCA) at different levels: its products, the complete vehicle, materials extraction through delivery to the automaker, and throughout the car's life cycle (including consumer use and recycling).
Framed by international standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, this methodology consists of assessing the environmental impact of products designed and manufactured by Faurecia for use in automobiles. It involves the fullest possible impact assessment, including climate change (including CO2), the consumption of non-renewable resources (oil and coal) and eutrophication.
LCA allows both Faurecia and automakers to:
 make the right design choices for current vehicles (with gasoline or Diesel internal combustion engines) and for those of the future using alternative fuels and with more environmentally-friendly emission control systems;
 assess and avoid impact transfer by focusing on alternative solutions (e.g., by developing a lighter but non recyclable product).

This is an especially useful innovation tool for evaluating benefits as well as any impact transfers as far upstream as possible through a comprehensive overview of the environmental impacts that paves the way for future innovations. For instance, the measurement of the environmental impact generated by new products or materials is always supplemented by a detailed LCA, investigating issues of particular relevance (in line with objectives such as weight reduction or lower energy consumption).
This tool also enhances understanding of the impacts of the entire automotive industry on the environment. Faurecia is therefore heavily committed to developing and using LCA in liaison with automakers and auto sector partners as the means of gaining a shared understanding of environmental challenges.
As environmental regulations tighten, especially for the automotive industry, the Life Cycle Assessment working group led by the collective industry organization Plateforme de la Filière Automobile (PFA) endeavors to share assumptions on the methodology of life cycle assessment in the automotive industry and engage in dialog on the main assessment results that are available. Through its involvement in this group, which will continue its work in 2018, Faurecia has gained a holistic approach in partnership with its customers and in anticipation of possible future regulatory requirements.
Under the auspices of the Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA), Faurecia participates in the Ecodesign working group, which aims to stimulate dialog and deepen knowledge on this topic for the automotive industry. The subjects addressed include the different LCA methodologies, the business impact of environmental issues, and the exchange of information on ecodesign.
For each innovation and development project, the different components of eco-design ­ the presence of substances of concern, recyclability, the environmental impact and interior air quality ­ are systematically checked by the designer using an eco-design checklist. If necessary, an in-depth study may be carried out (life cycle analysis for an innovation that aims to reduce weight, VOC and odor tests, etc.).
Raw material consumption by Faurecia sites
To produce automotive equipment, Faurecia's three Business Groups use a variety of raw materials that come from nonrenewable resources: metal, plastic, fibers and synthetic fabrics. To enact its desire to limit its impact on natural resources, Faurecia's strategy revolves around:
 managing consumption of materials;
 including recycled materials;
 developing biobased materials.

Managing consumption of materials
A major aspect of reducing environmental impact is managing consumption of materials. This translates, for operations under Faurecia's operational control, into the optimization of the product design, the optimization of the material during the part manufacturing process, and the management of manufacturing processes. The use of product simulation has enabled considerable reductions in the number of prototypes used for destructive testing over the last few years. On the manufacturing side, the simulation of parts transformation processes and the digitalization of production resources to manage variability thus avoiding high scrap levels and breakdowns are tangible examples.
Inclusion of recycled materials
Faurecia offers an increasing number of recycled plastic parts.
Within Faurecia Seating, depending on the type and category of vehicle, various components are now partly made of recycled polypropylene. Taking all these components together, recycled plastics can now account for 15-20% of the materials comprising the seats manufactured by Faurecia.
Within Faurecia Interiors, the incorporation of recycled material is taken into account and validated in new product development, with the same constraints and specifications as virgin materials.
In addition, Faurecia maximizes the incorporation of recycled natural fibers (mainly cotton) in its vehicle soundproofing systems.
Within the Faurecia Composite Technologies division, innovation projects aim to use a maximum of carbon fibers

from fabric scraps, continuous fibers from current technologies (RTM Preforming) both from the automotive and aerospace industry. These fibers are integrated into SMC (Sheet Molding Compound) or BMC (Bulk Molding compound) type compounds. These materials are then compression formed to obtain structural parts that meet the mechanical specifications required by automakers.
Life cycle analysis studies show that the use of recycled materials can reduce the environmental impact of manufactured products. Faurecia, like its automaker customers, has considerably extended its panel of suppliers of recycled materials. This allows us today to offer increasingly technical applications with increasingly wide material grades.
In 2017, 6.5% of all plastics purchased by the Group were recycled plastics. Taking into account the increase in business activity, this is equivalent to the 2016 proportion.
Part of Faurecia's industrial sites recycles internally on a daily basis; whenever the production waste can be recycled, it is directly reintegrated into the production process. Plastics and fibers can be subject to this.
In 2017, an average of 8% of fibers were reused internally as raw materials, i.e., up 2.5 points from 2016. As a result, the Marckolsheim site in France increased its use of reused fibers internally on the felt process from 544 to 734 tons. A tearing machine is used for this process, making it possible to recycle 100% of the site's felt fibers. Felt borders, rejects and scraps return through ducts to the preparation room and are torn and made into bales of waste that are then fed back into the loaders as recycled material.
Developing biobased materials
Striving to take up positions that span the entire product life cycle, Faurecia develops and incorporates biobased materials and prioritizes natural fibers. Lignolight technology, using compressed fibers for between 50% and 90% of the resin, applied to door panels, improves density by 40% compared with traditional components. NAFILean technology (NAtural Fiber Injection), which combines natural hemp fibers with polypropylene resin, reduces weight by 25% compared with talc-loaded polypropylene. This technology is now in production on the door panels for the new Peugeot 308 and the new Alfa Romeo Giulia for the instrument panel structures. NAFILITE, a second generation of this product, is currently being manufactured. This technology can further reduce weight by 10%. Faurecia's portfolio includes natural fibers combined with polypropylene fibers.

/ Registration document 2017

4 CSR
Environment

Natural fibers currently account for 27.9% of the total amount of fibers used by the Group. This is globally the same as the 2016 proportion.
To the extent possible and in accordance with its environmental policy, Faurecia endeavors to foster the circular economy. For example, the Vigo site in Spain, which makes wood interior parts, uses as raw materials the waste generated by the furniture and pallet industry.
"Paperless" approach Environmental awareness is an integral part of the corporate culture and it is incorporated at every level of the organization. In conjunction with the Digital Enterprise strategy, creative solutions to digitalize payslips and supplier invoicing are in the process of being introduced in the Group. 85% of employees in the Clean Mobility France business and nearly all employees based in the United States receive digital payslips. The entire North America invoicing system will be completely paperless in the near future, and 800 digital supplier accounts have already been created.
4.2.2.3.2. OPTIMIZE THE USE OF WASTE TREATMENT PROCESSES
Production waste
In order to best preserve the resources needed for their production process (energy and raw materials), Faurecia's industrial sites try to recycle and recover a maximum amount of the waste generated throughout the production chain.
In 2017, Faurecia sites record the following waste reprocessing rates:
 61% of waste was recycled (1) externally (calculation at constant scope +2% from 2016);

 13% of waste was reclaimed through energy recovery (2) (calculation at constant scope -3% compared to 2016);
 1% of waste was reused externally, without transformation, i.e., a stable percentage compared to 2016.
In total, 75% of waste from Faurecia sites was recycled, recovered or reused externally in 2017.

In 2017, the sites generated 230,216 tons of waste (calculation at constant scope: +5.5% compared to 2016). This increase resulted from heightened business activity. Non-hazardous waste constitutes 93% of the waste generated by the Group.
Since June 2015, the Faurecia Seating Business Group has been having sites commit to stopping their waste from going to landfill. 10% of its hazardous waste currently goes to landfill (+3.5% at constant scope compared to 2016). The Business Group started off by taking stock of the available disposal lines in the countries in question and identifying technical and economical alternatives to landfill.
Faurecia Seating drew on this analysis to set targets for reducing landfill waste, with a first step in 2019 (reference year 2017):
 80% reduction of hazardous waste going to landfill;
 60% reduction of nonhazardous waste going to landfill.
The launch of the "Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain" approach enabled Faurecia to review the recycling practices for metallic waste to ensure that this waste is sent to a recycling line and that it is bought back at the current price existing in the country where it is located. This approach has allowed the Group to manage the practices of each site and improve their efficiency. The metal recycling rate is 99.9%. Scrap is sent to the foundry before being resold on the market, contributing to the circular economy system.
Product recyclability
Faurecia incorporates recyclability in its ecodesign approach by anticipating the end-of-life phase and optimization of production waste recovery.
European Directive 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 on end-of-life vehicles stipulates inter alia that vehicles will have to be 95% recoverable by weight, of which 85% will have to be actually reusable or recyclable, by January 1, 2015.
Given such onerous regulatory requirements, automakers are placing ever-greater demands on their suppliers in terms of end-of-life product recyclability.
All of Faurecia's Business Groups are affected by these obligations and, depending on the characteristics of the component in question, have implemented plans and solutions

to ensure that end-of-life products are processed as efficiently as possible in the future.
As regards current solutions, an innovative product must be measurable both in terms of improved technical and economic performance and its environmental impact. Faurecia is committed to a process of forecasting and recovering future end-of-life products. Selective trials overseen by Faurecia comprise the first phase of a comprehensive approach by the automotive sector in partnership with industrial firms, academia and auto "clusters", to forecasting volumes of materials available for recycling in the future.
Faurecia Interiors, after performing tests on the recycling and recovery of complex products via disassembly, has begun similar operations after shredding vehicles. Industrialscale recyclability studies and tests have been undertaken with certain car-shredding plants, both on existing products and materials being developed, including agro-composites. For example, the NAFCORECY (NAtural Fiber COmposites RECYcling) project was able to demonstrate, with the help of European companies specialized in recycling, that parts made of NAFILean (polypropylene with natural fibers) can be processed with post-shredding technologies for end-of-life vehicles or recycling technologies used for industrial waste.
Faurecia Clean Mobility refurbishes Diesel particulate filters at the Messei site in France; this removes accumulated ash in order to reuse the filters instead of installing new filters. Research work within the Faurecia Composite Technologies division on using composite materials has focused on developing new materials/procedure couples from polyamid or polypropylene thermoplastic resins. These resins substitute for thermosetting polyester or epoxy resins to enable a shredding recycling circuit to be implemented with the reuse of the shredded materials according to a defined introduction rate to make new reinforced thermoplastic injection parts.
All possibilities for recycling end-of-life products are studied with a view to integrating the best solutions, ensuring reduced environmental impact and taking into account all utilization cycles at the design stage.
Faurecia also uses life cycle analysis to "eco-design" its products, integrating all of the above criteria as early as possible into the innovation and development processes.

4.2.2.4. Issue #4: Reduce and control carbon emissions and their consequences
Reducing carbon emissions, a major component in fighting climate change and supported by the 2015 Paris Agreement, was subject to French Law No. 2015-992 of August 17, 2015, on energy transition for green growth. In this context, Faurecia, which is also a signatory to the French Business Climate Pledge of the One Planet Summit of December 2017, has launched a low-carbon approach.
In 2017, the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) issued a score of B (management), up from the 2016 score of C (awareness), thus recognizing the Group's positive environmental strategy for reducing its environmental impact and its CO2 emission levels.
Emission sources
Use of products sold
Purchased products and services
Scope 2 (real scope)
Scope 1 (real scope)
Following this greenhouse gas diagnosis, Faurecia is currently working with an external provider to fix long term objectives of reduction of GHG emissions based on the "Science Based Target" initiative. This approach allows aligning the objectives of the Group with a worldwide trajectory limiting the global warming to 2° C.
The low-carbon roadmap and corresponding key performance indicators will be rolled out in 2018.
However, the Group has already begun to take action on its main emission sources:
 use of products sold: in order to lower the carbon impact of its products, Faurecia is taking steps to reduce the weight and volume of components and subassemblies, improve energy efficiency (e.g., by using energy recovery technologies) and expand the use of biobased or recycled natural materials;
 purchased products and services: to the extent possible, Faurecia aims to prioritize recycled products in order to lessen the environmental impact of its purchases;
 scope 1 and 2: Faurecia is actively reducing its energy consumption (see subsection 4.2.2.3).

This strategy is in keeping with Faurecia's past actions: the Group has been estimating its direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) since 2012, and since 2016 it has been estimating its emissions from the Company's entire value chain, including upstream and downstream of its activity (scope 3).
Three major emission sources for the Group emerged from the estimates done since 2016 based on the GHG protocol:
 use of products sold (1);
 purchased products and services;
 scope 2.
All the other sources are considered immaterial because each one accounts for less than 2% of emissions.

Carbon emissions calculation methodologies Scopes 1 and 2:
Direct greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in CO2 equivalent. Emissions from fuel consumption are calculated using the international emission factors recommended by the French Administration (Decree of October 31, 2012 and European Decision No. 2012/601 for CO2 and Circular of April 15, 2002 for other gases).
Fugitive emissions are calculated using emission factors from the 5th report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Indirect electricity-related emissions are calculated from emission factors published by the IEA (International Energy Agency® version 2014).
Scope 3:
For each scope 3 emission source, in line with the recommendations of the GHG Protocol, Faurecia favored a so-called conservative approach. The assumptions and values used, especially in the case of data uncertainty, tend to overestimate emissions.
Emission factors come mainly from ADEME.
4.2.2.5. Issue #5: Manage the sites' environmental impact
4.2.2.5.1. IMPROVING THE SITES' ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH ISO 14001 CERTIFICATION
As part of the implementation of Faurecia environmental policy, some of the Business Groups have included in the review of their HSE policy, the objective of an ISO 14001 certification for all of their production sites. Through this certification, Faurecia commits to responding to its customers' requirements and thereby to demonstrating its environmental performance.
In 2017, Faurecia continued to show progress in its environmental management of the production plants: 78.1% of sites had an ISO 14001 certification, up from 76.3% in 2016. Nine new plants were certified during the reporting year.
In 2017, 50 production plants were ISO 14001 2015 certified, distributed across the Business Groups as follows: 15 Faurecia Seating sites, 19 Faurecia Clean Mobility sites and 16 Faurecia Interiors sites.
In addition, in 2017, 39 assembly sites (known as Just in Time sites) and R&D sites were ISO 14001 certified.
The percentage of sites with ISO 14001 certification is tracked every six months by the Risk Committee.

4.2.2.5.2. LIMITING VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) EMISSIONS
Process emissions
Faurecia is committed to limiting airborne emissions of regulated Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which are subject to specific rules as they contribute to the formation and accumulation of harmful compounds such as ozone in the environment. In 2017, VOC emissions amounted to 1,933 tons (i.e., +13% from 2016 at constant scope). This VOC increase can be explained by the creation of a new shaping activity at one site, an input error last year at one site and a technical incident on an incinerator at one site.
The sites from the Business Group Faurecia Interiors are the Group's main source of VOC emissions (71%), due to activities requiring significant use of glues and paints. Four production plants (5% of Faurecia Interiors sites) account for nearly 50% of VOC emissions. To reduce its emissions in the air, this Business Group is working on the development of new generation of painting lines that produces less volatile organic compound emissions.
Calculation methodology
The annual reference emissions on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) is calculated using the Solvent Management Plan (SMP) required by the European Council Directive 1999/13/ EC of March 11, 1999 on the reduction of volatile organic compounds emissions caused by the use of organic solvents in certain activities and facilities. The SMP is a mass balance for quantifying the inputs and outputs of solvents in an installation.

Product emissions
For several years Faurecia has been studying VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions that impact vehicle interior air quality (VIAQ). As part of its commitment to reducing these emissions, the Group is developing or designing low-emission materials or products for Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Seating. In collaboration with its suppliers, the Faurecia Composite Technologies division, within Faurecia Clean Mobility, is developing new polyester resin or styrene-free vinyl ester based materials with the aim of reducing VOC associated emissions both in its plants during part manufacturing and in vehicle interiors. In this context, Faurecia also takes part in working groups on VIAQ (Vehicle Interior Air Quality) at the United Nations level, in collaboration with manufacturer representatives; these groups aim to monitor the health of people on-Board and continuously improve Faurecia's and the automotive industry's knowledge in measurement methodologies and the impact of group products present inside vehicles.
4.2.2.5.3. LIMITING WATER CONSUMPTION Faurecia has processes that consume water efficiently: the water consumed by the sites is mainly for domestic use (see graph breaking down consumption by use). Faurecia's total water consumption in 2017 was 3,112,588 m3 (calculation at constant scope, i.e., -10% from 2016). Improving water consumption hinges on local actions and on investments in water savings. For example, the Kennelbach, Austria, site invested in a new-generation water treatment system, which helped cut the site's consumption of process water by 26%.

Identification of sites located in high water stress areas
As its processes do not consume large quantities of water, Faurecia does not consider the risk of water stress to be material for its business. Nonetheless, the Group has endeavored to map its sites based on the world map of water stress published by the World Resources Institute (WRI). 20 sites in the reporting scope are located in high water stress areas. Of these 20 sites, 3 experienced water shortages in 2017. The sites classified in high water stress areas are working on establishing action plans for conserving water. To this end, 2 sites in India purchased rainwater recovery systems. This investment helped the Bangalore site cut its consumption of groundwater by 9% per year.
4.2.2.5.4. LIMITING ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE INTO THE WATER AND SOIL
This risk, inherent in the industrial activity of a site, is well understood by the Faurecia sites and their operators, who are trained to react in the event of accidental spillage. In addition, all the ISO 14001­certified sites include prevention of this risk in their management system.

Since 2012, Faurecia has been assessing the environmental risks of its industrial projects, by systematically conducting environmental audits and subsoil investigations research when appropriate. Furthermore, in the context of industrial restructuring resulting in plant closures, the Faurecia group systematically assesses the environmental impact and carries out a soil and subsoil investigation. Pursuant to French Decree No. 2012-633 of May 3, 2012, Faurecia has identified two French sites subject to the obligation to provide financial guarantees for their safety. At July 1, 2017, the established amount of guarantees was 295,768 for the sites in question.
4.2.2.5.5. LIMITING USE OF CHEMICALS AND HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS
The three Business Groups have a formalized policy for managing chemicals and hazardous products.
Controlling the use of chemicals: the REACH regulation
Substance management systems are put in place across the entire supply chain, from suppliers to manufacturing customers, for all products delivered by Faurecia. Among other benefits, this approach gives the Group access to complete information on the substances entering into its products, in order to ensure that all actors in the supply chain comply with regulatory frameworks on chemicals and their safe use, such as the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) regulation. Thanks to this approach, Faurecia also keeps a close watch on new developments in its supply chain in order to investigate substitutes for certain substances when necessary.

Among its initiatives in this area, Faurecia has developed an anticipatory approach to the identification and sharing of information within the supply chain on chemicals or constituents of concern, based on a list of chemicals or constituents considered as potentially of concern for its products and their use. In some cases, such as catalyst protectors in exhaust systems (ceramic fibers), Faurecia has defined an internal procedure that is more stringent than REACH.
Faurecia also takes part in work carried out alongside automakers and various industry federations or associations in order to anticipate possible restrictions on the use of substances in the coming years and coordinate efforts to propose alternatives where necessary. The federations and associations involved include the French Vehicle Equipment Industries Alliance (FIEV), the French Automotive Industry Cluster (PFA), the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA), and the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA). Faurecia leads the task force on REACH as well as the one formed to address issues raised by the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL).
4.2.2.5.6. REDUCING THE SITES' IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY
Reduce the impact of sites close to a protected area
23 sites, comprising 15 production plants, 7 assembly sites and 1 research and development site, are located less than 3 kilometers from a protected area. These protected areas close to the Faurecia sites are Natural Areas of Ecological Fauna and Flora Interest type 1 or 2, areas that protect species becoming or already endangered (leopards, ground squirrels, terrestrial squirrels...), and natural water area (rivers and streams) protection zones. 78% of these sites are located in Europe, 17% in Latin America and 4% in South Africa.
Some sites have taken voluntary steps to protect biodiversity. Several sites, in India, China and Brazil, take action on a yearly basis, planting trees and holding an environmental action day to raise awareness among employees and their families.
Limit noise and olfactory nuisance
In 2017, two sites were the subject of official complaints lodged by local residents about noise made by handling gear in use, dumping into metal buckets, and employee activity, mainly at night and on weekends. Corrective action was taken immediately.
4.2.2.5.7. PROVISIONS
In 2017, provisions for environmental risks were set up for an amount of K5,981. Provisions are mainly related to site remediation costs.

4.2.2.6. Issue #6: Factor in environmental criteria within the supply chain
Preserving the environment is one of the founding principles of the sustainable procurement procedures introduced by Faurecia, called "Buy Beyond". These procedures are

based on the Group's Code of Conduct, which sets out the environmental requirements to be met by Faurecia's suppliers and service providers.
More information on Faurecia's environmental specifications with regard to its suppliers, as well as their assessments, is provided in Section 4.3 below.

4.3.1. Territorial, economic and social impact of Faurecia's business

4.3.1.1. On employment and regional development
Faurecia has grown substantially in recent years, and now has headcounts of just over 109,000 people, more than 18,000 of whom were engineers and managers as of the end of 2017.
Over the last four years, the volume of external hires has stabilized, at slightly over 2,300 engineers and managers. In 2017, hires were mainly carried out in Asia (1,001), Europe (784), and North America (537); the countries that recruited the most in these regions were China (583), the United States (348), India (329) and Mexico (183). At the same time, the number of hires remained somewhat stable in France (354) and declined in Germany (120 compared to 142 in 2016).
Developing and promoting international exposure is also essential for a group that employs 66% of its engineers and managers outside Western Europe and carries out 78% of its recruitments outside this region. Within this framework, Faurecia can offer its people many international assignments as well as the opportunity to take part in international projects.

4.3.1.2. On neighboring or local populations
Faurecia's ambition is to purchase materials as close as possible to its sites in order to help develop local industry, and minimize the associated impacts (logistical, environmental, etc.). For purchases of mass-produced parts, the percentage of purchases made within a given area is between 87% and 96% depending on the location of Faurecia's production plants.

In 2017, 100% of indirect purchases were made locally.
Furthermore, the current Code of Ethics stipulates that in the name of continual improvement, the Group must always be assessing the impact of its products and the activity of its plants on the environment and the communities with which it interacts.
Finally, Faurecia is involved through local actions, which are discussed in Section 4.3.2.

4.3.2. Stakeholder relations

4.3.2.1. Conditions for dialog
Faurecia has developed and maintains the conditions and tools for dialog with a number of interested parties or stakeholders in its business.
FAURECIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
Faurecia bases its growth on socially responsible actions and behavior across all its businesses and all the countries in which the Group has its plants, suppliers and sub-contractors. In view of this, Faurecia builds close, long-term relationships with its suppliers, based on mutual growth and benefit. Faurecia believes that the principles of social, environmental and economic responsibility are critical criteria for the award of contracts to its suppliers.
Great importance is placed on communication and transparency to ensure strategic alignment with partners. Conventions are regularly held, with the official presentation of performance awards in different areas (Quality, Innovation, CSR ­ Corporate Social Responsibility, etc.). Faurecia has close relationships with its suppliers and organizes Strategic Supplier meetings, in which attendees share and discuss strategies to be pursued to strengthen mutual development, and Innovation days aimed at exploring, identifying, promoting and developing new innovation ideas.
Faurecia guarantees its suppliers' reliability not only in terms of the quality of their products, but also in terms of their adherence to CSR criteria (see Section 4.3.3).
Faurecia thus communicates with its suppliers and subcontractors to raise their awareness of sustainability issues. As such, the Suppliers section of the Faurecia website has a page devoted exclusively to information and requirements in terms of compliance by its current and potential partners with the Group's CSR criteria.
FAURECIA AND ITS CUSTOMERS
Faurecia has very close relationships with virtually all major global automakers. It also works closely with its customers to develop the design and functionality of the product range on offer.
The research and innovation unit thus covers upstream activities prior to program acquisitions. This Unit is critical to enabling the Group to provide an appealing and competitive offering to its customers, which it achieves by designing new products and technologies, as well as researching and developing generic products and processes.
The program engineering unit covers vehicle applications. This downstream unit is responsible for ensuring that programs are completed within the required time-frames, cost and quality levels.
Vehicle application programs follow a unique process, bringing together all the participants needed to develop and launch a new, mass-produced product. The Program Management

System (PMS) process, describes all the requirements at each phase of the program. Every program is given periodic interim reviews, first by specialists and then at the close of each phase by management, so that its progress can be seen.
The PMS consists of five phases:
 obtain and validate customer needs;
 develop the product;
 test the product and develop the manufacturing process;
 plan and validate production machinery;
 ramp up line speeds and launch mass production.
To track performance throughout the development process and steer it towards excellence, Faurecia has introduced the idea of program management excellence. This new approach involves the foregoing elements plus:
 system audits of the program requirements to ensure disciplined implementation;
 performance indicators, reviewed monthly, to signal future risks.
These various tools have made it possible to significantly improve such programs' performance financially and in terms of quality, lead times and launches of mass production.
In addition, Faurecia's production plants regularly receive awards from their customers.
FAURECIA AND ITS RESEARCH PARTNERS
To support technological development and innovation, Faurecia carries out an open policy toward academia, research laboratories and start-ups.
Faurecia relies on industrial chairs at universities in France and Germany, and in France it plays a key role at the Jules Verne (Nantes) and M2P (Metz) Technological Research Institutes (IRT).
Specific cooperative actions are also implemented on a caseby-case basis for innovation projects that require technologies related to Faurecia's core business lines. As such, initiatives are under way in the United States, through a first partnership with the DMDII (Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute) for topics related to the industry of the future, in China, and in India with a recent contract signed with the IISC (Indian Institute of Science) of Bangalore to develop innovative Human Machine Interfaces and different types of sensors.
In 2016, Faurecia also developed a business of research and start-up evaluation at the global level to discover technological innovations and invest whenever needed through a dedicated company known as Faurecia Ventures.
Faurecia has developed innovation partnerships with most major global automakers. These partnerships indicate the Group's intention to build long-term close relationships with automakers by offering them the latest innovations, providing potential exclusive arrangements, and better meeting their

246

4 CSR
Societal actions

demands. From the start, these innovations have been associated with target vehicle programs. These partnerships can be applied with suppliers when cooperation is needed.
FAURECIA AND ITS INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL PARTNERS
Faurecia is always looking to develop new partnerships and strengthen existing ones.
For example,

On December 22, 2017, Faurecia announced the establishment of an agreement to acquire 100% of the Swiss company Hug Engineering, which is held by the German group ElringKlinger, a leader on the European market in complete exhaust gas purification systems for engines greater than 750 HP and one of the main global players in its segment.
The corresponding press releases and other information on the industrial and commercial partnerships are posted on the website www.faurecia.com of the Group.
FAURECIA AND THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY
The Faurecia group places special value on all the stakeholders in the financial markets. Management's priorities are to establish relationships based on trust and to encourage interaction and the sharing of information. The Group therefore promotes constructive dialog on its financial results, strategy and news stories.
Faurecia is diligent about providing accurate, complete, regular and transparent information that complies with current regulations and best practices in financial communication.
The approach
The Faurecia group provides investors with a large number of documents that cover the business, strategy and all the financial information it is required to publish in accordance with market regulations. The documents available are the Registration Documents, interim financial reports, the Company's bylaws, the internal rules of the Board of Directors, and the documents that disclose regulated information. All these documents can be found on the Group's website, www.faurecia.com, in French and English. The financial information is regularly supplemented by the publication of press releases announcing important events related to the Group's business activity. All these press releases are posted in the "Newsroom" section of the website.
At the end of every quarter, the Group puts out a special release geared toward financial analysts and institutional investors:
 every April and October, the Group publishes the change in its sales by business and by region. This release is the subject of a conference call to which analysts and investors are invited;
 in February and July, the Group publishes all its annual and interim results of operations. An in-person or videoconference meeting is then scheduled; analysts and investors are invited.
Throughout the year, Faurecia encourages face-to-face dialog between the Executive Management and players on the financial market, during conferences and events in France and abroad, in the form of individual or group meetings.

In order to deepen its relationship with individual shareholders, Faurecia set up a telephone line (0805 651 206). This number is toll free and allows individual shareholders to get information and answers to questions they might have about the Group's business activity; it also allows individuals to become shareholders. They can also contact Faurecia by e-mail, at actionnaires@faurecia.com.
items measured
In 2017, outside of meetings to present the annual and interim results and conference calls when the 1st and 3rd quarter sales were reported, Faurecia met almost 500 investors and financial analysts at conferences, meetings and individual meetings.
In addition, on June 27, 2017, Faurecia held an Investor Day in order to discuss the strong potential for profitable growth of its Clean Mobility business and the medium-term outlook of its market.
In 2018, Faurecia plans to hold another Investor Day on the Cockpit of the Future. Faurecia strives to be a major player in the creation of products and services for the connected and autonomous vehicles of the future. During this event, the Group will unveil its vision of the market and discuss how it intends to respond to the market's new developments.
FAURECIA AND CERTIFICATION BODIES
The Group's environmental policy requires its three Business Groups to improve the environmental performance of their sites with the implementation of an ISO 14001 ­ certified environmental management system for the production plants.
Detailed information can be found in Section 4.2.2.5 of this Registration Document.
FAURECIA AND THE EDUCATION SECTOR
In the many countries in which the Group operates, Faurecia has established privileged partnerships with schools, universities and other higher education establishments, whose geographical locations and training offer best meet its requirements. Ambassador networks made up of alumni of these institutions who now work at Faurecia play a central role in telling students about internship and job opportunities, and in explaining to future employees the career paths and jobs at the Company.
Faurecia also participates annually in many student-oriented events all over the world, such as student rallies, job fairs, various types of workshops and case studies: for example, in France, "Hackathons" or "technical challenges" with groups of students, leading themed classes, or sponsoring promotions; in China, the strategic partnership with the Sino-European School of Technology of Shanghai University (UTSEUS) includes

themed courses, workshops, scientific collaboration projects and participation in industrial projects for students.
The Group also organizes a number of visits to its sites each year to introduce its business activities to students. In China, an open house gives students a chance to see how the site operates and to learn about jobs and the Faurecia culture.
Finally, some countries have created programs to facilitate the integration of recent graduates whose first job is in the Group. There is the rotation program in the United States, which lets graduates go through a circuit that includes assignments in several company departments and get individual support from a mentor in upper management. China has the "Innovation Challenge" for all recent graduates who have joined the Company during the year, in order to speed up their integration and create a sense of community. Finally, there is the VIE international corporate volunteer program open to recent graduates or young workers from France and other EU countries.
4.3.2.2. Partnerships or sponsorship
Around the world, Faurecia's sites and employees frequently take part in many local community-based initiatives under a shared banner: FUELS ("Faurecia Unites its Employees around Local Solidarity actions").
The FUELS program was created in North America in 2010, where it first took the form of an annual food collection. Rolled out at Group level in 2014, the program was also expanded to include more local economic, social and cultural issues.
In 2017, 20 FUELS campaigns were carried out in 12 countries worldwide, and in total, Faurecia's sites launched over 25 other corporate initiatives. The main causes defended are as follows:
 fight against hunger: this is the cornerstone of the FUELS programs and one of the causes that mobilizes the most people, with the targets exceeded each year. Faurecia employees lend a hand at local food banks, collecting and distributing meals. The participating countries are France, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United States, Canada, India and, since 2017, Italy;
 aid to children: many collection efforts are organized: toys, clothing, school supplies, etc.
In addition, more and more volunteer programs are being instituted, such as road safety awareness days (Mexico), lifesaving (Poland) and recycling and the environment (China).
Faurecia also signed in 2017 a sponsorship agreement with the Collège de France to anticipate major technological developments in chemistry and artificial intelligence.

4.3.3. Subcontractors and suppliers

4.3.3.1. The inclusion of social and environmental issues in the purchasing policy
Faurecia's Code of Ethics outlines the principles of ethical conduct that apply on a daily basis to all of Faurecia's employees in their internal and external relationships, and to Faurecia's partners, and it explains how the Group practices the values of respect for customers, shareholders, people and the environment.
The roll-out of the sustainable purchasing policy, "Buy Beyond", launched by Faurecia Interiors in 2013, continued in 2017 within the Group's Purchasing teams. The policy displays Faurecia's commitment to basing its growth on socially responsible actions and behaviors in all its activities and in all the countries where the Group has domestic and international business. In view of this, Faurecia is committed to building close, long-term relationships with its suppliers, based on mutual growth and benefit.
Faurecia believes that the principles of social, environmental and economic responsibility are major criteria for the award of contracts to its suppliers. It is essential for Faurecia that its suppliers meet standards of behavior that are consistent with and reflect its own commitments.
It requires its suppliers to abide by the Buy Beyond purchasing policy by enforcing, within their own organization and their own global supply chain, the Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Subcontractors, which was implemented by Faurecia in 2013 and which is always included in the mandatory bidding documents sent to suppliers.
Supplier quality audits, which are a prerequisite to joining Faurecia's panel of suppliers, also include CSR issues.
Against this backdrop, each purchasing team is assisted by an external CSR partner in order to better understand, verify and optimize the practices of its suppliers in terms of social, environmental and economic responsibility. This external assessment of CSR compliance by the Group's suppliers, and the related documentary audit, are in keeping with the organization and requirements laid down in the Code of Conduct and ascertain compliance with REACH and conflict minerals regulations.
The Group relies on this assessment and the related documentary audit to enact French Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017, on the duty of care by parent companies and ordering companies.
For example, at the end of 2017, Faurecia Interiors evaluated the CSR performance of around 900 suppliers, representing 90% of its direct purchases, and around 500 additional suppliers were assessed by the other Business Groups.
This assessment is incorporated into the purchasing process, is routinely taken into account in the award of contracts and is also included in the criteria for performance evaluation of suppliers.

Faurecia is also training its Purchasing and Supplier Quality teams, who are tasked with the implementation of the Buy Beyond policy, which involves both training efforts focusing on internal purchasing teams as well as monitoring progress made on CSR issues by suppliers. Faurecia Interiors has implemented ambitious improvement targets in CSR maturity for its partners and supports them in drafting and monitoring their action plans whilst providing support to achieve them.
Furthermore, with respect to diversity, in North America (USA and Canada), Faurecia has integrated diversity management within its purchasing policy, thus responding to the growing demand from its customers to expand job opportunities to company-creating women and minorities. In return, this policy helps Faurecia meet its customers' expectations in terms of diversity as diversity is one of the assessment criteria used by its customers. In recognition of these efforts, in May 2017 General Motors honored Faurecia with a Supplier IMPACT Silver Award for "excellence in diversifying their company's supply chain with Tier 2 suppliers."
4.3.3.2. The extent of subcontracting and the inclusion in dealings with suppliers and subcontractors of their social and environmental responsibility
The fundamental commitments demanded of Faurecia's suppliers relate to compliance with laws and responsible supply chain management, as illustrated in the diagram below:

Along with the measures implemented as part of the Buy Beyond purchasing policy described above, Faurecia has established substance management systems throughout the supply chain, from suppliers to the customer, for all products delivered by Faurecia. Among other benefits, this approach gives the Group access to complete information on the substances entering into its products, in order to ensure that all actors in the supply chain comply with regulatory frameworks on chemicals and their safe use, such as the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) regulation and that relating to conflict minerals. The Group constantly monitors regulatory developments relating to substances and works to prepare compliance with regulations due to enter into effect that will have an impact on its business activities around the world, sharing this information and related recommendations with all its entities.

For instance, Faurecia Interiors is currently pursuing an anticipatory approach to the identification and sharing of information within the supply chain on chemicals or constituents that may be impacted, based on a list of chemicals or constituents considered as potentially of concern for its products and their use. Apart from REACH, this approach is also applied in connection with Faurecia's responses to the annual questionnaires received from its customers relating to the producers and countries of origin of minerals covered by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank law on conflict minerals.
Change in subcontracting is quantified by indicators provided in Section 4.1.6 of this Registration Document.

4.3.4. Fair practices

4.3.4.1. Action to prevent corruption
RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION
Code of Ethics
Faurecia is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact. This means that the Group has committed to aligning its operations and strategy with 10 universally accepted principles, including anticorruption efforts.
This commitment is reaffirmed in Faurecia's Code of Ethics. This Code, created in 2005 and revised in 2007, was updated in 2014 as part of the Being Faurecia program intended to reinforce the Group's culture, thus contributing to the creation of long-term value. The Management Code, which was established at that time to guide the day-to-day management of teams, customers, suppliers, etc., translated many of the principles set out in the Code of Ethics into operations.
The Code of Ethics is structured around four topics, including ethics and rules of conduct. It also includes a whistle-blowing procedure if the Code of Ethics is breached.
The ethical principles and rules of conduct apply to:
 Use of funds, services or Group assets
Any funding of political activity is forbidden, as are any unlawful payments to public authorities or officials. Assets, liabilities, expenses and other transactions made by Group entities must be recorded in the books and financial statements of these entities, and should be kept truthfully and accurately, in accordance with the applicable principles, rules and laws.
 Relationships with customers, providers or suppliers
Acceptance of gifts and entertainment from customers and/ or suppliers is subject to limits. As such, it is prohibited to accept any gift or gratuity from customers or contractors worth over 100 per year and per business partner, regardless of type.

Furthermore, the payment of any amount in cash, in kind or otherwise to any customer or supplier representative in order to obtain either a contract or a business or financial advantage is prohibited.
The selection of suppliers must be based on quality, need, performance and cost. As stated in the current Purchasing procedures, agreements between the Group and its authorized representatives, agents and consultants or any other contractor must clearly state the actual products/services to be supplied, the basis for compensation or price and all other terms and conditions. This rule also prohibits any investment in suppliers and any purchase of property or service from providers or customers for personal use.
 Conflicts of interest
Employees shall not draw any personal advantage from a transaction carried out on behalf of a group company, notably with customers and suppliers.
An employee must also not attempt to select or organize the selection of a company, in particular as a supplier, in which either the employee, an associate or a family member has, directly or indirectly, a financial interest.
Whistle-blowing procedure
The Code of Ethics provides a mechanism for the purpose of managing violations.
Any employee who becomes aware of a breach of the rules set out in the Code may use an internal alert procedure; they may refer to their line manager or HR director verbally or in writing.
Depending on the nature and importance of the events reported, additional investigations may be launched, an inquiry may be set up or an Internal Audit decided upon.
The Code of Ethics also states that employees may use an external whistle-blowing procedure.
The scope of the external whistle-blowing procedure is limited to acts that relate to serious risks for the Group in terms of accounting, financial audit and anticorruption. Given their importance, serious acts that compromise the bodily security

250

/ Registration document 2017

4 CSR
Societal actions

or moral integrity of employees may also be taken into consideration as part of this external whistle-blowing procedure.
Therefore, any Group employees who are aware of a violation of rules on one of these items may report it through the external whistle-blowing procedure.
This external whistle-blowing procedure may be initiated only for situations that are likely to seriously affect the Group's business or seriously incur its liability.
The external whistle-blowing procedure prompts employees to contact through postal mail or e-mail an outside organization to which Faurecia has delegated the tasks of collecting information and conducting an initial processing of this whistleblowing procedure.
This organization has taken steps to ensure compliance with the principles and rules on data protection that are applicable in France and the European Union.
If the acts cited do not fall within the scope of the external whistle-blowing procedure, the alert will be destroyed immediately. On the other hand, if the acts cited do apply to the areas identified for this alert and if their importance justifies it, the outside organization will submit the case to the Faurecia group through its CEO.
The CEO may ask a member of his team to launch an investigation in order to assess the truthfulness and extent of the acts cited. The Internal Audit may be commissioned to complete the necessary investigations.
Compliance department
The Compliance department, the organization of which is described in subsection 2.1, is responsible for improving understanding of the Group's Code of Ethics and Management Code.
ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION
In 2016, the Compliance department unveiled an online MOOC training, "Ethics", which is aimed at the community of 17,000 group Managers & Professionals.
In 2017, how-to guides on reporting and managing conflicts of interest and on the internal whistle-blowing procedure on allegations of noncompliance with the Code of Ethics were issued.
In addition, training sessions were organized at the industrial sites and at the level of Business Group divisions in connection with the verification assignments carried out by the Internal Audit team.
Along with these actions, and in accordance with French Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016, on transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life, a mapping of noncompliance risks and especially the risk of corruption was completed and is incorporated into Faurecia's overall risk mapping process. In 2018, it is subject to a strengthening of the monitoring of the anti-corruption risk on the basis of questionnaires sent to the populations that are exposed to risk.
The actions taken by the Group to prevent corruption and the areas to improve are regularly presented to and discussed by the Group's Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer.

These actions include in particular the sending, by Faurecia to its subsidiaries, of a self-assessment questionnaire in which subsidiaries indicate whether they are in compliance with the Group's principles and processes.
4.3.4.2. Measures taken benefiting the health and safety of consumers
The main trends that impact automobiles are the urbanization of populations, the reduction in the consumption and the diversification of energy resources, changes in mobility, connectivity, consumer protection and health and the increased role of women in society. Faurecia takes these "mega" trends into account; most of the time they are translated into the automobile industry through the reduction in consumption and emissions, including electrification, connectivity and autonomous vehicles.
Faurecia also takes part in working groups on VIAQ (Vehicle Interior Air Quality) at the United Nations level, in collaboration with manufacturer representatives; these groups aim to monitor the health of people on-Board and continuously improve Faurecia's and the automotive industry's knowledge in measurement methodologies and the impact of Group products present inside vehicles.
Faurecia is a supplier of components that play an important role in passive safety and thus help save lives or limit injuries to drivers or passengers. Seats help provide about 80% of rear impact protection, about 30 to 40% for frontal impacts and, depending on the automaker, and between 30% to 80% for side impacts. The instrument panel incorporates all the issues relating to the deployment of airbags.
Over the years, Faurecia has taken position as a key partner for automakers in this area, initially by emphasizing the importance of safety and then by developing products and expertise that allow the Group to devote research efforts, in a measured and confident manner, to all anticipated changes. Each link in the safety chain is associated with design rules that guarantee the system's performance and its longevity.
The advent of the automated vehicle and the Cockpit of the Future approach reinforce the need to treat vehicle interior safety as a new system that Faurecia needs to help master.
The new combinations of interior design, safety and comfort are key elements of the new interiors. Faurecia masters some of them, but is also creating an ecosystem enabling it to advance in these areas. In 2017, Faurecia signed a partnership with ZF to work on integrating interior safety in vehicles and on developing the technological building blocks needed for new use scenarios.
The product design initiatives that have been taken are described in greater detail in subsection 4.2 of this Registration Document.

5.2. Explanatory notes to the resolutions

5.2.1. Explanatory notes to the ordinary resolutions

The first three resolutions that are submitted to your vote concern the approval of the financial statements for the 2017 fiscal year and the appropriation of income.
The fourth resolution concerns related party agreements and undertakings.
Resolutions five and six are governance-related, the first on ratification of Ms. Valérie Landon's cooptation as a Board member, the second on increasing overall attendance fees as of fiscal year 2018.
In accordance with paragraph 1 of Article L. 225-37-2 of the French Code of commerce, resolutions seven and eight ask you to vote on principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding compensation for executive and non-executive corporate officers.
Resolutions nine to eleven ask you to vote on elements of compensation for executive and non-executive corporate officers paid or granted for the past fiscal year, in accordance with Article L. 225-100 paragraph II of the French Code of commerce.
Finally, resolution twelve concerns the share buy-back program.
5.2.1.1 Approval of the financial statements and appropriation of income (1st to 3rd resolutions)
APPROVAL OF THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2017 (1st RESOLUTION)
You are asked to approve these financial statements, which show a profit of 94,364,262.41.
You are also asked to approve the total charges and expenses mentioned in paragraph 4 of Article 39 of the French General Tax Code, i.e., 136,282.35, which corresponds to the nondeductible portion of the leases on passenger vehicles and the corresponding tax, which amounts to 46,922.01.
APPROVAL OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2017 (2nd RESOLUTION)
We are seeking your approval of these financial statements, showing a net profit (Group share) of 610.2 million.

APPROPRIATION OF INCOME (3rd RESOLUTION)
You are being asked to appropriate the income in accordance with French law and our bylaws.
As such, you are asked to approve the appropriation of the net income for 2017 as follows:

Origin
 Profit for the fiscal year  Retained earnings Total to be appropriated

94,364,262.41 1,227,485,803.32 1,321,850,065.73

Appropriation
 Dividends  Retained earnings Total appropriated

151,839,381.10 1,170,010,684.63 1,321,850,065.73

The Board of Directors has decided to suggest distributing a gross dividend of 1.10 per share.
When dividends are paid to private individuals resident for tax purposes in France, they are subject to a single 12.8% flat-rate levy on the gross dividend (Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code), or, optionally, to income tax on a sliding scale after a 40% tax allowance (Article 200 A,2. and 158-3 1° of the French General Tax Code). This option must be exercised when the income tax return is filed and, at the latest, before the deadline for the filing of said return. Dividends are also subject to social security contributions at a rate of 17.2%.
Should the number of shares carrying dividend entitlement change compared to the 138,035,801 shares that made up the capital as of December 31, 2017, the total dividend will be adjusted accordingly and the amount of the retained earnings account will be determined based on the dividend effectively distributed.
The ex-dividend date will be June 1, 2018 and the dividend will be paid on June 5, 2018.

5.2.1.2 Related-party agreements and undertakings (4th resolution)
In light of the Statutory Auditors' report on related-party agreements and undertakings, you are asked to acknowledge that there have been no new agreements like those referred to in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Code of commerce.
The Statutory Auditors' report also refers to the agreements and undertakings that were authorized prior to 2017 and that continued during that year, namely:
 a defined contributions pension scheme (Article 83 of the French General Tax Code) and a defined benefits pension scheme (Article 39 of the French General Tax Code) established for the whole Group in France and authorized for Mr. Patrick Koller, as Deputy Chief Executive Officer, then Chief Executive Officer, by decisions taken by the Board of Directors on April 13, 2016, and July 25, 2016, and, in accordance with a decision by this last Board meeting, subject to a performance condition specific to Mr. Patrick Koller for the defined benefits pension scheme;
 an additional specific defined benefits pension scheme (Article 39 of the French General Tax Code) in favor of the members of Faurecia's Executive Committee, authorized for Mr. Patrick Koller in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, by a decision of the Board of Directors on July 25, 2016;
 a termination payment for Mr. Patrick Koller as Chief Executive Officer, authorized by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016 and subject to performance conditions.
5.2.1.3. Governance (5th and 6th resolutions)
Under the terms of resolution five, you are asked to ratify the temporary appointment by the Board of Directors on October 12, 2017 of Ms. Valérie Landon to serve the remainder of the term of office of Ms. Amparo Moraleda who resigned at the end of the Board of Directors meeting of the same date. Ms. Valérie Landon would remain in office until the end of the meeting convened in 2021 to approve the financial statements for the previous year.
Information on Ms. Valérie Landon's expertise and career path is set out in Section 5.4 of the 2017 Registration Document.

The Board of Directors decided that Ms. Valérie Landon qualifies as an independent Board member under the independence criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations, which your Company has chosen as a reference Corporate Governance Code.
We would also like to draw your attention to the resignation, effective from the end of this General Meeting, of Mr. JeanPierre Clamadieu, who has been asked to fill other positions.
Consequently, at the end of this General Meeting, your Company's Board of Directors will have fifteen members, including two Board members representing employees.
Not including Board members representing employees, eight members of your Board of Directors, or more than one third, will be independent, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, and six members of your Company's Board of Directors will be women. The Board of Directors' composition would then be in accordance with the January 27, 2011 French Act related to balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and to professional equality.
Under the terms of resolution six, you will be asked to increase the annual attendance fees allocated to Board members from 600,000 to 700,000. This decision would apply to the fiscal year in progress and would continue until a new decision is taken by a General Meeting.
600,000 was the amount set by decision of the General Meeting of May 27, 2015. Since then, the number of Board members eligible to receive attendance fees has increased, particularly due to the addition of two Board members representing employees, and the applicable payment scale has been revised, amongst other things, to increase compensation for Committees' chairpersons and to allow for payment of an additional travel allowance for all Board members not physically resident in France.
Please note that your Company regularly compares the fees paid to its Board members with those paid by comparable companies. CAC Next20 companies were selected for the most recent comparison which showed that the average fees paid by your Company were slightly below the average fees paid by comparable companies.

Please note that neither the Chief Executive Officer, nor the Chairman of the Board of Directors, nor Board members holding an executive or management position within the shareholder PSA receive attendance fees.
5.2.1.4. Principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding compensation to the executive and non-executive corporate officers (7th and 8th resolutions)
The principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding compensation to the executive and non-executive corporate officers as required by paragraph 1 of Article L. 22537-2 of the French Code of commerce derived from French Act No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016, on transparency, anti-corruption measures and the modernization of the economy are described below; these paragraphs constitute the report referred to in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned Article presenting the seventh and eighth resolutions for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer respectively.
In this regard, Faurecia's Board of Directors, acting on the recommendations of the Governance Committee for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and on the recommendations of the Management Committee for the Chief Executive Officer, with both Committees being comprised of a majority of independent Board members, ensures the enforcement of the principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of listed corporations regarding the determination of the compensation of executive and nonexecutive corporate officers of companies whose securities are traded on a regulated market.
Accordingly, these principles and criteria are reviewed and discussed annually by the Board of Directors, which, at its meeting on April 19, 2018, decided to continue the policy begun in 2017.
PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING, ALLOCATING AND AWARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (7th RESOLUTION)
In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors ensures in particular that the compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is adapted to the missions given, consistent with best market practices and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders in the Company's business.
On this basis, the Board of Directors has decided that the fixed annual compensation is the only component of compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, excluding any other compensation. A company car is also provided to him.
Hence the Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive any variable compensation, termination payment or noncompetition indemnity, nor does he collect attendance fees. Moreover, the Board of Directors does not plan to pay any exceptional compensation.
The Board of Directors has not set any rules regarding the frequency at which fixed compensation of the Chairman of

the Board of Directors is reviewed; however, it is understood that in practice the Board of Directors reviews this compensation regularly.
To do this, the Board of Directors refers to a comparative compensation analysis prepared by an outside consultant based on a sample of French listed companies that have a separated governance structure, and it takes into account the current Chairman's profile and his role as it appears in the Board of Directors' internal rules and that is described as follows:
"The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the effective operation of the Board and its committees, in accordance with good governance principles.
The Chairman must:
 promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance across the Group, particularly at the Board level, thus ensuring the effectiveness thereof;
 manage the relations between Board members and the Chairs of the committees and, in this respect:
 promote effective working relations and open communication, and foster an environment that enables constructive discussions and the sharing of information between Board members and the Chief Executive Officer, during and outside meetings,
 lead and govern the Board so as to create the conditions required for the overall effectiveness of the Board and its members, and ensure that all key and relevant issues are adequately prepared and discussed by the Board of Directors and the various committees in a timely fashion,
 schedule and set the agenda of the Board meetings, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary of the Board, to take full account of the Group's major challenges and issues raised by Board members, and ensure that sufficient time is devoted to thoroughly discuss significant and strategic matters,
 address any conflicts of interest,
 conduct, with the help of the Governance Committee, assessments of the Board of Directors, searches for new Board members and their induction program;
 organize, with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairs of the various committees, the preparation of and chair General Meetings, oversee the relations and ensure effective communication with shareholders;
 manage the relation with the Chief Executive Officer:
 act as a competent advisor for the Chief Executive Officer on all issues regarding the interests and management of the Company,
 ensure that the strategies and policies adopted by the Board are effectively implemented by the Chief Executive Officer; without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Board of Directors and its committees, the Chairman is regularly provided information by the Chief Executive Officer about significant events concerning the Company's strategy, in line with the objectives set by the Board of Directors, as well as about major external growth projects, significant financial transactions, societal actions, or appointments of Business Group managers and other key positions within the Company. The Chairman receives from the Chief

Explanatory notes to the resolutions

Executive Officer all information necessary to coordinate the work of the Board of Directors and its committees;
 coordinate or conduct specific projects. In particular, at the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman may represent the Company before stakeholders, public authorities, financial institutions, major shareholders and/or key business partners."
PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING, ALLOCATING AND AWARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (8th RESOLUTION)
In accordance with the principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of listed corporations, the Board of Directors makes sure to structure the various elements of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer so as to view his actions on a long-term basis and enable an alignment of his interests with the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
On this basis, the Board of Directors has decided that the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, who is not an employee, shall be structured as follows:
Compensation
The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is based on three main components:
 fixed compensation;
 short-term variable compensation representing 100% of the fixed annual compensation at target and up to a maximum of 180%;
 long-term variable compensation that has a weighting within the overall compensation which is equal to the short-term variable compensation at maximum,
being understood that within this compensation, the variable portion is predominant and the Board of Directors does not anticipate paying any exceptional compensation.
Fixed compensation
The Board of Directors has not set any rules regarding the frequency at which the fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is reviewed; however, it is understood that in practice the Board of Directors reviews this compensation regularly.
To do this, the Board of Directors refers to a comparison of compensation prepared by an outside consultant based on a set of twenty manufacturers listed in Paris and with comparable revenues, capitalization and headcount.
Annual variable compensation
For annual variable compensation, the performance conditions incorporate quantitative targets, which are predominant, and qualitative targets that may increase or reduce the variable compensation, it being understood that the award of variable compensation subject to performance conditions is not reserved solely for the Chief Executive Officer.

Therefore, the Chief Executive Officer's variable compensation may range from 0% to 180% of his fixed annual compensation depending on the achievement of the quantitative and qualitative targets:
 the quantitative targets entitle the Chief Executive Officer to variable compensation ranging from 0% to 150% of the fixed annual compensation.
These quantitative targets are connected to operating income and free cash flow:
 the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to variable compensation of between 0% and 150% (maximum percentage) of his fixed annual compensation, depending on the operating income set with reference to the budget for a given year, being understood that achievement of budget means the target being realized at 100%. Operating income accounts for 40%;
 the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to variable compensation of between 0% and 150% (maximum percentage) of his fixed annual compensation, depending on the free cash flow set with reference to the budget for a given year, being understood that achievement of budget means the target being realized at 100%. Free cash flow accounts for 60%.
The expected levels of achievement of these targets are set by the Board of Directors with reference to the budget for a given year but are not made public for confidentiality reasons;
 the qualitative targets are set each year by the Board of Directors. They encompass strategic, business development, and managerial targets, and/or connect with the Group's values or convictions when it comes to CSR; a weighting is given to each of them and wherever possible, they are tied to quantitative indicators.
If some or all of these operating income and free cash flow quantitative targets are met, the qualitative targets met are used to determine a multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. If the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account.
It must be noted that in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article L. 225-37-2 of the French Code of commerce, the payment of the variable compensation elements outlined above depends on the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting approving the compensation elements in question for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, under the terms and conditions stipulated by Article L. 225-100-II-2 of said Code.
Long-term variable compensation (performance shares)
The Chief Executive Officer is eligible for the performance share plans established by the Company, subject to performance and service conditions identical to those set for all the beneficiaries of the plans (i.e., the approximately 300 members of the Senior Management at December 31, 2017, which became the Group Leadership Committee on January 1, 2018).
As stated above, the Chief Executive Officer's long-term variable compensation has a weighting within the overall compensation equal to the short-term variable compensation at maximum.

5 Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2018
Explanatory notes to the resolutions

At the end of each plan's allocation period, the Chief Executive Officer must hold at least 30% of the shares allocated under the plan in question until the end of his term as Chief Executive Officer. This mechanism was made stricter in 2017 through the establishment of a rule stipulating that furthermore the Chief Executive Officer must hold a number of shares that corresponds to three years of base gross compensation, factoring in all the previously established plans, in which case the requirement to hold a minimum percentage of shares per plan will be deemed to have been met.
The Company's policy in this regard is based on simple, transparent, enduring principles. Therefore:
 performance shares have been granted annually since 2010 at the same periods, involving, since that year, an internal performance condition and a presence condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
 since 2013, the conditions have also included an external performance condition applicable to all French and foreign beneficiaries of the plans;
 since 2013, the vesting period applicable to the plans has been four years as from their allocation date for all French and foreign beneficiaries; the plans comprise no holding period;
 the number of shares that may be granted to the beneficiary under each plan is determined using an external benchmark from which are deduced a minimum number of shares (50%) and a maximum number (130%). In all cases, the final allocation depends on the fulfillment of performance and presence conditions.
The performance conditions are the following:
 60% fulfillment of an internal performance condition related since 2016 to the Group net income after tax (before 2016, Group net income before tax), before taking into account any exceptional events. This internal condition is assessed by comparing the net income of the third fiscal year after the grant date of the performance shares against the one as forecasted in the Group's medium-term plan reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on the grant date of the performance shares; and

 40% fulfillment of an external performance condition, i.e., growth of the Company's net earnings per share assessed between the last fiscal year before the grant date of the performance shares and the third fiscal year ended after the grant date of the performance shares. This condition is assessed against the weighted growth of a reference group made up of twelve comparable international automotive suppliers over the same period.
The reference group is made up of the following European and North American automotive suppliers:
 Autoliv (Sweden)
 Autoneum (formerly Rieter) (Switzerland)
 Borg Warner (United States)
 Continental (Germany)
 Delphi (United States)
 GKN (United Kingdom)
 Adient (United States)
 Lear (United States)
 Magna (Canada)
 Plastic Omnium (France)
 Tenneco (United States)
 Valeo (France)
This group is identical to last year's and is intended to be stable, even if it may be altered in the event of a major change affecting one of the players.

The Company's long-term compensation practices are reexamined on a regular basis to ensure their compliance with best market practices.
Pension
The Board of Directors also decided to grant to the Chief Executive Officer the same pension scheme as for the members of the Executive Committee.
This scheme is made of an additional defined contributions pension scheme available to all Group executives in France and an additional defined benefits pension scheme.
In accordance with French law, this additional defined benefits pension scheme is subject to performance conditions.
The Board of Directors has also decided that the annual amount of the total pension annuity paid to the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the compulsory and additional Faurecia group schemes may not exceed 45% of his reference compensation, defined as being equal to the annual average of the total gross compensation collected within the Company during the three calendar years preceding the termination of service or departure from the Executive Committee.

In this regard, the total annual gross compensation includes the annual base compensation and all bonuses and variable elements of compensation pertaining to the three calendar years preceding the date of the termination of service, aside from any termination payment, exceptional compensation, sums granted under plans such as performance shares plans, benefits in kind and reimbursement of business expenses, contributions paid by the Company to fund additional pension schemes and personal risk insurance and any other allowances paid by the Company.
Additional defined contributions pension scheme
The Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the defined contributions pension scheme (Article 83 of the French General Tax Code), which is available to all Group executives in France who have completed at least one year of service at the time of their retirement.
This scheme applies to the A and B brackets, amounting to 1% for the A bracket and 6% for the B bracket of the pay without the beneficiary's participation.

5 Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2018
Explanatory notes to the resolutions

Additional defined benefits pension scheme (Article 39 of the French General Tax Code) subject to performance conditions
The Chief Executive Officer is eligible for an additional defined benefits pension scheme that includes two parts:
 a part that is available, subject to eligibility conditions, to all Group managerial staff in France who have at least five years' seniority upon their retirement.
Benefits are calculated solely on the basis of bracket C and potential rights increase each year by 1% of this bracket being understood that the reference compensation taken into account upon retirement is the average of the annual compensation collected during the preceding three years in bracket C.
With regard to the Chief Executive Officer, the benefit of this scheme is backed up by the following performance condition, which is tied to his annual variable compensation:
 in case of 80% or greater achievement of the annual variable compensation targets, a 1% increase in potential rights (restricted to bracket C of the compensation) will be granted for the fiscal year in question,
 in case of 80% or lower achievement of the annual variable compensation targets, the increase in rights will be reduced in proportion to the achievement of the targets (e.g., a target that is 30% achieved will result in a 0.30% increase in potential rights);
 an additional part decided by the Board of Directors of February 11, 2015, in favor of Faurecia's Executive Committee members holding an employment contract (current or suspended) or a term of office in France, who have been on the Executive Committee for a minimum term of three calendar years as of the implementation of this scheme or accession to the Executive Committee.
The Company guarantees French beneficiaries an annual pension level determined according to the Company's operating income, in relation to the budget, as approved by the Board of Directors based on the formula:
 Xi * R
R = annual reference compensation (as defined in the preamble in the paragraph "Pension")
Xi = entitlement for each year of seniority, (i) equal to:
 3% if the operating income for the year is strictly more than 105% of the budgeted operating income;
 2% if the operating income for the year is between 95% and 105% of the budgeted operating income;
 1% if the operating income for the year is strictly less than 95% of the budgeted operating income.
The operating income for year N is defined based on the income statement as of 12/31/N approved by the Board of Directors in year N+1 and the initial budget for year N approved by the Board of Directors in year N-1.
Each year, the Board of Directors therefore decides how much should be granted, following approval of the financial statements.

In any event, on retirement, the annual pension paid under this plan plus any rights granted by other supplementary plans implemented by the Faurecia group are subject to two limits in addition to the 45% limit referred to in preamble:
 the sums paid by the Group must not exceed 25% of the reference compensation;
 the sums paid by the Group are capped at 8 times the annual social security limit.
Should either of these limits be exceeded, the relevant pension will be reduced accordingly.
Termination payment
The Chief Executive Officer is also the beneficiary of a termination payment, the Board of Directors having decided that the CEO can not be an employee and as a consequence can not enjoy the protective regime attached to such status.
This payment is backed by granting conditions in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:
 the payment is due in case of termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office on the Company's initiative, subject to his not being terminated due to serious or gross misconduct;
 the payment is not be due in case of resignation or retirement;
 the payment is subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions:
 achievement of a positive operating income during each of the three fiscal years preceding the termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office,
 achievement of a positive net cash flow during each of the three fiscal years preceding the termination of the Chief Executive Officer's term of office;
 the amount of the payment is equal to 24 months of the reference compensation (fixed compensation and variable target-based compensation) insofar as both of the conditions described above are met during each of the three fiscal years in question; in practice, this is equal to the fulfillment of six criteria;
 should one of the six criteria not be met, the termination payment is reduced proportionally by 1/6 and may equal to 0 should none of these six criteria be fulfilled;
 should the Chief Executive Officer's term of office be shorter than three years, the method of calculating the termination payment is identical, but the number of criteria is adjusted to take into account the actual length of the term of office.
Finally, the Chief Executive Officer is eligible for a company car and the medical/life/disability insurance scheme established within the Company.

Presentation
Mr. Patrick Koller's annual fixed compensation as Chief Executive Officer was set at 750,000 by the Board of Directors' decision of February 8, 2017. It was unchanged from the compensation set by the Board of Directors on July 25, 2016, as of the segregation of the duties of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which took effect on July 1, 2016, the date on which Mr. Patrick Koller became Chief Executive Officer. This compensation was set in reference to a comparison of compensation prepared by an outside consultant based on a set of twenty manufacturers listed in Paris and with comparable revenues, capitalization and headcount.
At its meeting of February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors set the rules for determining Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation for 2017 as Chief Executive Officer. The Board decided that Mr. Patrick Koller's variable compensation may range from 0% to 180% of his fixed annual compensation depending on the achievement of quantitative and qualitative targets. The achievement of the following quantitative targets entitles him to a variable compensation ranging from 0% to 150% of his fixed annual compensation:  40% of his variable compensation is based on operating income set by
reference to the 2017 budget;  60% is based on the free cash flow set by reference to the 2017 budget.
On the recommendation of the Management Committee on February 12, 2018, the Board of Directors meeting of February 15, 2018, reviewed the extent to which these quantitative criteria had been met:  As regards the operating income, the Board of Directors formally noted
that 150% of this initial quantitative target had been reached;  As regards free cash flow, the Board of Directors formally noted that
150% of this second quantitative target had been reached. As a result of these two achievements, 150% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached: this entitles to quantitative variable compensation of 1,125,000 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed.
On February 15, 2018, the Board of Directors also reviewed the achievement of the qualitative targets set by the Board on February 8, 2017, which, if some or all of these targets are met, are used to determine a multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. If the achievement of the quantitative targets is equal to 0, the multiplier effect of the qualitative targets will not be taken into account. Therefore:  As regards the deployment of strategy through the execution of the
priorities of organic growth and external acquisitions in line with the strategic plan (30% weighting on this criterion), i.e.:  recommending to the Board of Directors alternative investments that
would offer a genuine strategic choice;  adding technology in the existing Business Groups through external
acquisitions;  growing in China with local OEMs;  completing targeted acquisitions in order to speed up the growth of
areas identified as new value-creation areas (Value Spaces);  investing in start-ups to reinforce the Group's product offering.

The Board of Directors pointed to the following achievements in 2017,  the acquisition of Parrot Automotive, Jiangxi Coagent Electronics Co. and Hug Engineering;  investment in eight start-ups, growth in China through four new joint ventures;  the record order book, with 35% of orders applying to Chinese OEMs;  technological partnerships including those with ZF, Malhe and Accenture (announced in early 2018);  five Cockpit of the Future projects under way with OEMs.
The Board of Directors considered that 120% of this criterion has been met;
 As regards the deployment of Group initiatives focused on R&D productivity and efficiency, so-called Global Business services and digital productivity services (25% weighting on this criterion), i.e.:  defining a savings strategy for each initiative,  setting associated net savings to achieve,  implementing the first steps of a formalized plan,  demonstrating the feasibility of the overall savings target at the end of the year.
The Board of Directors considered that the savings plans were defined and implemented for each initiative with recorded cost reductions starting in 2017. The Board of Directors considered that 115% of this criterion has been met;
 As regards the management of program launches (25% weighting on this criterion), with the objective being to achieve flawless launches of 14 programs identified as being at risk, the Board of Directors noted that the number of at-risk programs was reduced to five thanks to the establishment and implementation of prevention plans. Within this context, the Board acknowledged the absence of any negative impact for customers.
The Board of Directors considered that 115% of this criterion has been met;
 As regards the reinforcement of the entrepreneurship, accountability and agility components of the Being Faurecia approach (20% weighting on this criterion), i.e.:  assessing the current situation through an internal survey,  according to the results, organizing the design of an action plan,  assessing the first feedback and change momentum,
The Board of Directors considered that the initiatives conducted were manifested, among other things, in:
 following an internal survey (Management Survey), the implementation of several working groups on simplifying organization and reducing bureaucracy, focusing on Capex management, reducing reporting and executing production;
 the launch of two specific corporate governance projects, one in the United States and one pertaining to the Cockpit of the Future;
 the change of the Senior Management to the Group Leadership Committee;
 an acceleration in leadership training through the Ignite and Drive programs, and continuous effort in diversity development;
 the launch of a CSR approach.

The Board of Directors considered that 110% of this criterion has been met.
As a result, the Board of Directors felt that the standard achieved in relation to these four qualitative targets was such that a multiplier of 1.15 should apply to the two quantitative targets.
On this basis, on February 15, 2018, the Board of Directors decided on variable compensation for fiscal year 2017 for Mr. Patrick Koller in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer equal to 750,000 × 100% × 150% × 1.15, for a total of 1,293,750 corresponding to 173% of his fixed compensation collected for 2017 as Chief Executive Officer.

At its meeting of July 20, 2017, the Board of Directors decided to grant up to 39,400 shares to Mr. Patrick Koller in the context of performance shares plan number nine, based on the authorization granted by shareholders at their General Meeting of May 27, 2016 (thirteenth resolution adopted in extraordinary session). These 39,400 shares correspond to 0.03% of the capital as of December 31, 2017.
The Board of Directors made the definitive acquisition of these shares contingent on the following:  60% on an internal performance condition: Group net income after
tax as of December 31, 2019, before taking into account capital gains from the disposal of assets and changes in the scope of consolidation, as approved by the Board of Directors, assessed against net income for the same fiscal year as it had been forecast in the Group's mediumterm plan reviewed and set by the Board of Directors on the date the shares are garnted; and  40% on an external condition: the growth between 2016 and 2019 in the Company's net earnings per share compared with the weighted growth of a reference group of 12 international automotive suppliers comparable to Faurecia over the same period.
If these performance conditions laid down in plan number nine have been met in full at the end of the 2019 fiscal year, Mr. Patrick Koller will be granted the maximum 39,400 shares of which he will take ownership on July 20, 2021.

At the proposal of the Appointments and Compensation Committee on July 20, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized, on July 25, 2016, the principle of a termination payment payable to Mr. Patrick Koller, in line with the procedure set out in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Code of commerce, meeting the following requirements:
 this payment will be due in case of termination of Mr. Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer, on Faurecia's initiative, subject to this termination not occurring due to Mr. Patrick Koller's serious or gross misconduct;
 this payment will not be due in case of resignation or retirement;  the remittance of this payment is subject to the achievement of the
following performance conditions:  achievement of a positive operating income during each of the three
fiscal years preceding the termination of Mr. Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer,  achievement of a positive net cash flow during each of the three fiscal years preceding the termination of Mr. Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer;  the amount of the payment will be equal to twenty-four months of the reference compensation (fixed and variable target-based compensation) insofar as both of the conditions described above are met during each of the three fiscal years in question; in practice, this is equal to the fulfillment of six criteria;  should one of the six criteria not be met, the termination payment will be reduced proportionally by 1/6 and may equal 0 should none of these six criteria be fulfilled;  should Mr. Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer be shorter than three years, the method of calculating the termination payment will be identical, but the number of criteria will be adjusted to take into account the actual length of the term of office.

Presentation
On July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors confirmed that although Mr. Patrick Koller no longer had an employment contract, he would continue to benefit from both schemes after July 1, 2016, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. Defined contribution pension scheme:  defined contribution pension scheme on the A and B brackets,
amounting to 1% for the A bracket and 6% for the B bracket of the compensation without the beneficiary's participation;  estimated annual pension as of December 31, 2017: 4,218;  scheme available to all Group executives who have at least one year's seniority upon their retirement. Defined benefits pension scheme:  progressive increase in potential rights in relation to seniority and compensation: potential rights increase each year by 1% in bracket C;  reference compensation and maximum percentage of income permitted under the supplementary pension scheme: the reference compensation taken into account is the average of the annual compensation collected over the last three years, while benefits are calculated only for the C bracket;  estimated annual pension as of December 31, 2017: 31,431;  scheme available to all Group executives who have at least five years' seniority upon their retirement.
Pursuant to Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Code of commerce in the version resulting from Act No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015, the Board of Directors decided, on July 25, 2016, to subject Mr. Patrick Koller's right to benefit from the defined benefits pension scheme (Article 39 of the French General Tax Code) to the following performance condition which is linked to his annual variable compensation:  in case of 80% or greater achievement of the annual variable
compensation targets, a 1% increase in potential rights (restricted to bracket C of the compensation) will be granted for the fiscal year in question;  in case of 80% or lower achievement of the annual variable compensation targets, the increase in rights will be reduced in proportion to the achievement of the targets (e.g., a target that is 30% achieved will result in a 0.30% increase in potential rights).
This scheme, which was authorized for Mr. Patrick Koller, Chief Executive Officer, by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016, was approved by the General Meeting of May 30, 2017 (5th ordinary business resolution).
This scheme benefits Faurecia's Executive Committee members holding an employment contract (current or suspended) or a term of office in France, having been on the Executive Committee for a minimum term of three consecutive calendar years as of the implementation of this scheme (January 1, 2015) or accession to the Executive Committee.
The estimated annual pension as of December 31, 2017 is 332,323.
This scheme, which was authorized for Mr. Patrick Koller, Chief Executive Officer, by the Board of Directors' decision of July 25, 2016, was approved by the General Meeting of May 30, 2017 (5th ordinary business resolution).

5.2.1.6. Share buy-back program (12th resolution)
This resolution will authorize the Board of Directors to purchase your Company's shares for the following purposes:
 to maintain a liquid market for your Company's shares through an independent investment services provider acting under a liquidity contract;
 to retain the shares and subsequently offer them in the context of external acquisitions;
 to allot shares to employees and executive and nonexecutive corporate officers of your Company or its affiliates, through the allotment of stock options or performance shares, either as part of their compensation or in respect of their profit sharing entitlement;
 to allot shares upon the exercise of rights attached to securities conferring an entitlement to the allotment of shares in your Company; and
 to cancel shares.
These shares may be purchased by any means, including through block purchases of shares, at times deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors must obtain prior authorization from shareholders at the General meeting in order to exercise this authority during a public offering initiated by a third party in relation to shares in the Company, until the offer period has ended.
Your Company reserves the right to use options or derivatives within the framework of applicable regulations.
The authorization to be granted to the Board of Directors includes a:
 maximum purchase price (110);
 a cap on the overall amount that may be appropriated to the buy-back program (1,428,818,600 based on the Company's capital as of December 31, 2017 in view of the treasury shares held on that date); and
 a cap on the number of shares which may be purchased (10% of your Company's capital on the date of purchase).
This authorization will be granted for a period of 18 months and will bring an end to the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by shareholders at their General meeting of May 30, 2017 under their eighteenth ordinary resolution.

5.2.2. Explanatory Notes to the extraordinary resolutions

The thirteenth resolution will allow the Board of Directors to reduce the capital by cancelling treasury shares.
Resolution fourteen concerns an authorization to grant performance shares.
Resolution fifteen concerns an amendment to the bylaws.
Lastly, resolutions sixteen and seventeen relate to the plan to convert your Company into a European company.
5.2.2.1. Cancellation of treasury shares (13th resolution)
This resolution will authorize the Board of Directors to cancel shares in your Company purchased pursuant to the twelfth resolution or under previously authorized share buy-back programs, up to a maximum limit of 10% of the capital stock, and to reduce the capital stock accordingly.
This authorization will be granted for a period of 18 months.

5.2.2.2. Employee and corporate officer share ownership: authorization to grant performance shares (14th resolution)
Extraordinary resolution fourteen aims to seek authorization to allow your Board of Directors to grant performance shares, free of charge, to group employees and corporate officers under the terms of Article L. 225-197-1 et seq. of the French Code of commerce. Shares granted under this resolution may be existing or future shares.
This resolution would cancel any unused portion of the current authorization, granted for 26 months by the General meeting of May 27, 2016 (extraordinary resolution thirteen).
The meeting of May 27, 2016 authorized your Board of Directors to grant a maximum of 2,000,000 performance shares, the total number of shares awarded to corporate officers not exceeding 10% of this total.

/ Registration document 2017 269

5 Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2018
Explanatory notes to the resolutions

The Board of Directors used this authorization in 2017: based on the decision of July 20, 2017, it granted a maximum of 816,300 shares, including a maximum of 39,400 shares to the Chief Executive Officer.
Given the use made of this resolution in 2016 when 989,945 shares were granted, the authorization granted by the General meeting of May 27, 2016, was used to grant 1,806,245 shares.
Generally speaking, and not including two plans which were both granted in 2010, a performance share plan has been granted by your Board of Directors every year. To date, nine plans have been granted on the basis of authorizations given by the meeting:
 two plans in 2010 (Plan No. 1 and Plan No. 2);
 one plan in 2011 (Plan No. 3);
 one plan in 2012 (Plan No. 4);
 one plan in 2013 (Plan No. 5);
 one plan in 2014 (Plan No. 6);
 one plan in 2015 (Plan No. 7);
 one plan in 2016 (Plan No. 8);
 one plan in 2017 (Plan No. 9).
In fact, the condition attached to the 1st plan in 2010 was met and the maximum number of shares were vested in beneficiaries in June 2012 (for French tax residents for tax purposes) and in June 2014 (for beneficiaries being tax residents in other countries).
The conditions attached to Plans No. 5 and No. 6 were also met: Plan No. 5 shares vested in their beneficiaries in July 2017; Plans No. 6 and No. 7 shares will not vest until July 2018 and July 2019 respectively.
That was not, however, the case with Plans No. 2 to No. 4; because the conditions set by the Board were not met, no shares were vested in beneficiaries under these three plans.
Plans No. 8 and No. 9 are now in progress.
Under the terms of the new authorization on which you will be asked to vote, the total number of free shares granted would not exceed 2,000,000 (two million), given that this is the maximum number that may be granted for the whole of this authorization period.
The total number of shares that may be granted for free to executive and non-executive corporate officers may not exceed 10% of the aforementioned amount.
The free share grant to the beneficiaries would become permanent at the end of a vesting period whose length would be set by the Board of Directors and that may not be shorter than three years. The General meeting would authorize the Board of Directors to decide if it wishes to stipulate a lock-up period at the end of the vesting period.

By decision of the Board of Directors, the permanent share grant shall be subject to fulfillment of the following performance conditions:
 Group net income before or after tax and before taking into account any exceptional events. This internal condition is assessed by comparing the net income of the third fiscal year after the grant date of the performance shares against the one as forecasted in the Group's medium-term plan reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on the grant date of the performance shares; and
 the growth of your Company's net earnings per share assessed between the last fiscal year before the grant date of the performance shares and the 3rd fiscal year ended after the grant date of the performance shares. This condition is assessed against the weighted growth of a reference group made up of twelve comparable international automotive suppliers over the same period.
Alternatively, or in addition to the conditions listed above, the Board of Directors may, for certain beneficiaries, set performance conditions with targets that are measured in relation to specific criteria of a quantitative and qualitative nature, assigned to a given Group organization.
This authorization will be granted for a term of 26 months.
5.2.2.3. Bylaws amendment (15th resolution)
You will be asked to extend the term of your Company prematurely for another 99 years as of the date this General meeting. The purpose of resolution fifteen is then to amend the current Article 5 of the bylaws, under which the term of your Company is due to end on December 31, 2027.
Once approved, this bylaws amendment will apply right from the end of this General meeting.
5.2.2.4. Conversion of your Company's form by adopting the form of a European company (16th and 17th resolutions)
The Board of Directors will ask you to decide to convert your Company into a European company (resolution sixteen) and to amend your Company's bylaws accordingly to adapt to this new form (resolution seventeen).

ECONOMIC ASPECTS
A very high percentage of your Company's sales and those of its subsidiaries are generated in Europe (in 2017, total sales made by your Company and its subsidiaries in Europe stood at 8,500.4 million, or 50.1% of total value added sales).
Some 45,000 employees (around 55,000 employees in total, including temporary staff) located in Europe, out of which around 10, 000 employees are located in France, account for approximately half of the Group's headcount.
Your Company's adoption of European company form would reflect its European dimension, its equity interests and its businesses, both in relation to its employees and its customers and partners, would raise its international profile with all stakeholders and would establish a feeling of belonging for employees outside France.
Already adopted by large companies, European company form have the advantage of being based on a uniform structure, recognized within the European Union, in line with the economic reality of your Company, both in terms of its employees and its customers and partners.
Adoption of this form is also part of the transformation of the Group and of its strategy towards an activity with a strong technology dimension.
LEGAL ASPECTS
Legal system and conversion procedure
The conversion is primarily governed by the provisions of (EC) Regulation No. 2157/2001 of October 8, 2001, on the statute for a European company (the "Regulation"), the provisions of Council Directive No. 2001/86/EC of October 8, 2001, supplementing the statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of workers (the "Directive") as well as current French legislation and regulations applicable to European companies and, where compatible, those applicable to sociétés anonymes (joint-stock corporations).
Your Company meets the conditions required by current legislation for conversion into a European company, insofar as:
 it has capital stock in excess of 120,000;
 your Company has, for more than two years now, directly controlled several subsidiaries in the European Union, including ET Dutch Holdings B.V. (Netherlands), Faurecia Automotive Espana, S.A. (Spain), Faurecia Automotive GmbH (Germany), Faurecia Automotive Belgium (Belgium);
 Ledouble firm, auditor of the conversion, appointed by order of the President of the Nanterre Commercial Court on 16 March 2018, issued a report stating that your Company's net assets are at least equivalent to the capital stock plus reserves that cannot be distributed by law or under the bylaws.

If you approve the plan to convert your Company into a European company, the final conversion of your Company into a European company and its listing in the trade and companies registry can only take place once the procedure relating to the involvement of employees provided for in Articles L. 2351-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code is complete.
in this regard, in accordance with the provisions of the Directive, a Special Negotiating Body (SNB), made up of employee representatives from all of Faurecia's direct or indirect subsidiaries and establishments concerned with their registered office in the European Union or in the European Economic Area is in the process of being set up.
Negotiations may go on for six months from the date on which the SNB is set up.
SNB negotiations on employees' involvement in your Company may end as follows:
 an ad hoc agreement that will determine the set-up, and terms and conditions, of employees' involvement in Faurecia SE;
 in the absence of an agreement, the application of the subsidiary arrangements provided for by the Directive and Articles L. 2353-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code to organize the involvement of employees in the European company.
You are being asked to grant all powers to the Board of Directors to (i) acknowledge the completion of negotiations on the terms and conditions of employee involvement in the European company and to acknowledge, where applicable, of the signing of an agreement for that purpose, (ii) consequently to note that the prerequisite to registering the Company in its new form that is contingent on the completion of negotiations on employee involvement has been fulfilled, and (iii) to carry out the formalities required for registering the Company in the form of a European company.
Consequences of the conversion for your Company
As a European company, your Company will be governed by its bylaws, the regulation and current French legislation and regulations applicable to European companies and, where compatible, those applicable to sociétés anonymes (joint-stock corporations).
The conversion will not result in your Company being wound up, nor in the creation of a new legal entity.
Your Company will retain the Company name of "Faurecia" which will be followed by the initials "SE".
The conversion will not change the term of your Company nor its corporate purpose.
The duration of the current fiscal year will not change and financial statements will be prepared for said fiscal year, under the same conditions as before.
Your Company will continue to have a unitary Board, in accordance with the option given by the regulation and so will continue to have a Board of Directors, the composition of which will not change. The terms of office of the Board members, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and the Statutory Auditors and Alternate Statutory Auditors in progress at the time of your Company's conversion into a European company will continue until they are scheduled to end.

Explanatory notes to the resolutions

All the authorizations and delegations of authority and powers granted to the Board of Directors in its current form as a société anonyme (joint-stock corporation) and that are in force on the date on which the conversion of the Company into a European company is completed shall be, on said date, automatically transferred to the Board of Directors of your Company in its new form as a European company.
Your Company's registered office and head office in its new form as a European company will remain unchanged and will continue to be located in France at 2, rue Hennape, 92000 Nanterre, until the delivery (scheduled for Autumn 2018) of the new global headquarters which is currently being built in Nanterre. In any event, the registered office and head office of your Company cannot be separated, by application of Article L. 229-1 of the French Code of commerce.
Amendment of the bylaws
Draft bylaws for your Company in the form of a European company appear in the appendix to this document, amendments to the current bylaws being underlined. The draft adapts your Company's current bylaws to accommodate the form of a European company and does not take into consideration the bylaws amendment, not relating to this conversion plan, which you are asked to approve under the terms of resolution fifteen described above.
The regulation provides for a limited number of rules regarding the operation of the European company and largely refers back to domestic legislation on the matter.
Not including adjustments to the wording, as in Article 1, to clarify the background of your Company's incorporation, or to reiterate the rules currently applicable to the société anonyme (e.g. the necessity for a Board member being a company to appoint an individual as permanent representative, decisions by the Board being taken at the simple majority of present or represented Board members or the regulated agreements and undertakings regime), the main amendments will aim at reflecting the following rules:
 as of the conversion of your Company into a European company, the quorum for meetings of the Board of Directors will be as follows: half the Board members shall be present or represented (whilst at the moment the quorum is as follows: half the Board members shall be present);
 rules for calculating voting majority at General meetings of shareholders shall be amended in accordance with the regulation. In fact, whilst for a société anonyme, an abstention or a blank voting slip are the equivalent of a

vote "against" the resolution, in a European company on the other hand, the "votes cast", which are used to calculate the outcome of the vote for a given resolution, do not include votes attached to shares for which a shareholder has not voted or has abstained or has submitted a blank ballot paper or a null and void ballot paper.
Consequences of the conversion for shareholders
The number of shares comprising the capital stock and their par value will remain unchanged. Your Company's shares will still be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris regulated market.
The conversion will also not affect each shareholder's share in your Company's voting rights. The Company's bylaws on double voting rights will remain unchanged.
Please note that the conversion will increase shareholders' political rights, the regulation recognizing the right of one or more shareholders with at least 10% of the subscribed capital stock of the European company to ask for a General meeting to be convened and for an agenda to be set, this provision not having any equivalent in relation to the société anonyme governed by French law. In fact, under the system applicable to a société anonyme governed by French law, a request by shareholders for a meeting to be convened supposes recourse to a court-appointed official.
Consequences of the conversion for employees
The conversion will not bring about any change in the individual or collective rights of Faurecia's employees or those of its subsidiaries. Relations between individual employees and their employers will continue to be governed by current national rules; collective relations will continue to evolve in line with national rules.
You will find additional information on the plan to convert your Company into a European company as well as on the resolutions that you are being asked to approve, in the draft conversion treaty approved by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2018 (especially available on the Company's internet website) and in the text of the draft resolutions that you have received.
5.2.2.5. Powers (18th resolution)
To conclude, the eighteenth resolution concerns the powers to be given to complete formalities relating to the General meeting, particularly filing and publicity formalities.

Explanatory notes to the resolutions

Registered shares are recorded in an individual account as per the terms and conditions provided by the applicable legislative and regulatory provisions.
These individual accounts can be "pure registered share" accounts or "administered registered share" accounts, at the shareholder's option.
Share ownership is established either via share registration in an account opened in the name of the owner(s) with the Company (case of registered shares) or with an accredited broker (case of bearer shares).
ARTICLE 8 FREE TRANSFER
Shares are freely negotiable.
ARTICLE 9 RIGHTS ATTACHED TO SHARES
Each share entitles the holder to an ownership interest in the business assets, in the sharing of profits and of liquidation surpluses, in proportion to the number of shares existing.
All shares composing the share capital, now or in the future, shall always be grouped together as regards fiscal charges. Consequently, any taxes or similar which, for whatever reason could, subsequent to a reimbursement of the capital of these shares, become due in the case of just some of them, either during the lifetime of the Company or on dissolving the Company, shall be apportioned over all the shares making up the share capital during said reimbursement(s), in such a way that all present or future shares give their holders, following adjustment for any par, non-redeemed value of shares and for different share categories, the same advantages and entitlement to receive the same net amount.
Whenever it is necessary to possess several shares to exercise a right, shares held individually or in a number below the requisite number do not entitle their holder to any right against the Company, it being up to the shareholder in such a case to personally seek to collect or group together the requisite number of shares.

This option must be exercised when the income tax return is filed and, at the latest, before the deadline for the filing of said return. Dividends are also subject to social security contributions at a rate of 17.2%.

If the number of shares giving rights to dividend varies from the 138,035,801 shares representing the capital stock on December 31, 2017, the total amount of the dividend will be adjusted accordingly and the amount of the retained earnings account will be set on the basis of the dividend actually payable.

The dividend will be paid out on June 5, 2018.

The ex-coupon date will be June 1, 2018.

The General meeting, after having read the report by the Board of Directors, authorizes the latter, for a period of eighteen months, in accordance with Articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Code of commerce, to purchase company shares, in one or several installments, at such times that it deems appropriate, capped at 10% of the total number of shares in the Company's capital stock, adjusted to take into account any possible increase or decrease in the share capital that may occur during the program.
This authorization terminates the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the General meeting of May 30, 2017 (ordinary resolution eighteen).

Acquisitions are authorized in order to:
 support the secondary market or the liquidity of Faurecia shares, through an investment service provider under a liquidity contract, in accordance with the AMAFI (French association of stock markets) Code of Ethics, as allowed by regulations, with the stipulation that in this context, the number of shares used to calculate the aforementioned cap corresponds to the number of shares purchased, less the number of shares resold;
 retain the shares purchased and use these shares for exchange or payment at a later stage, as part of any possible external growth transactions;
 hedge stock option plans and/or free grant of shares plans (or similar plans) to the benefit of employees and/or Group corporate officers, as well as all allocations of shares as part of a group or Company savings plan (or similar plan), under a profit-sharing plan and or any other form of allocation of shares to the benefit of the Group employees and/or corporate officers;
 hedge securities giving access to the allocation of Company shares subject to the regulations in force;
 cancel the shares acquired, if applicable, in accordance with the current or future authorization of an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Such shares may be purchased by any means, including by acquiring blocks of shares, and at such times deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors may not, without the prior authorization of the General meeting, use this authorization during a public offering launched by a third party, involving company shares, until the end of the offering.
The Company reserves the right to use optional mechanisms or derivatives subject to the applicable regulations.
The maximum purchase price per share is set at 110 (one hundred and ten). In the event of transactions affecting the capital stock, in particular a division of shares, a reverse stock split or allocation of free shares, the aforementioned amount will be adjusted in the same proportions (multiplication coefficient equal to the ratio of the number of company shares prior to the transaction to the number of shares after the transaction).
On this basis, and for information only, the maximum amount, which the Company would pay, assuming a maximum purchase price of 110 (one hundred and ten), would amount to 1,428,818,600 on the basis of the capital stock on December 31, 2017 (consisting of 138,035,801 shares), taking into account the 814,320 company treasury shares on this date.
The General meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors, with a sub-delegation option in accordance with legal provisions, to carry out these transactions, set the conditions and procedures thereof, enter into all agreements and carry out all of the required formalities.

 should one of the six criteria not be met in a given year, the termination payment would be reduced by one sixth and therefore could be equal to zero if none of the six criteria were met;
 should Patrick Koller's term of office as Chief Executive Officer be less than three years, the calculation of the termination payment would be the same, but the number of criteria would be adjusted to take into account the actual duration of his term of office.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.

To the Shareholders,
In our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the COFRAC (1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the Statutory Auditors of the company Faurecia, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2017, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the "CSR Information," pursuant to the provisions of the Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).

Independence and quality control
Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the Article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations.

Responsibility of the independent verifier
It is our role, based on our work:
 to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information);

LIMITED ASSURANCE ON CSR INFORMATION

Nature and scope of the work
We undertook around ten interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:
 assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;
 verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information.
We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices.
For the CSR Information which we considered the most important (1):

5 Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2018
Reports

For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company.
Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information.
We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated.
Conclusion
Based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria.

Background

6.1. Background

1891. The first automobiles, in the modern sense, are made, powered by gasoline engines. The first steel tubes follow, patented by Peugeot. They are produced mainly at Audincourt, in the Doubs region of eastern France.
1914. Bertrand Faure opens his first workshop, making seats for Paris trams and underground trains, at Levallois-Perret.
1929. Bertrand Faure acquires the license for the Epeda process, enabling the Company to improve its seats for the automotive industry and develop a new product, the spring mattress. Both businesses take off significantly after the Second World War. Bertrand Faure clients include Renault, Peugeot, Citroën, Talbot, Panhard-Levassor, Berliet and Simca.
1950. Bernard Deconinck, the son-in-law of Joseph Allibert, who formed the Allibert company in Isère in 1910, decides to invest in an enormous injection press from the United States. He could use this equipment to mold large plastic parts from a single clamping unit. He changes his customer base from refrigerator manufacturers to the automotive industry.
1955. The Frères Peugeot company, with subsidiaries including Peugeot et Cie, starts producing automotive equipment. The companies diversify over the years, making seats, exhaust systems, and steering columns. They extend operations outside France, dropping some products to concentrate on new lines.
1972. François Sommer, grandson of Alfred Sommer, merges his automotive floor coverings company with that of Bernard Deconinck's company, Allibert. They combine their know-how in textiles and plastics to found the Sommer Allibert group.
In the early 1980s, Sommer Allibert invests heavily to meet the needs of the automotive industry and becomes a leading specialist in interior vehicle fittings for all of the major automakers. International expansion follows, with the acquisition of Spainbased Lignotock, and an extended presence in Germany from 1993.
1987. Cycles Peugeot merges with Aciers & Outillages Peugeot to form Ecia (Équipements et Composants pour l'Industrie Automobile), the PSA Peugeot Citroën group's specialist automotive equipment subsidiary. Over the next ten years, Ecia undergoes concentrated industrial and geographical development.
1990. The company Epeda Bertrand Faure, which started out as a manufacturer of seats and benches for transport vehicles, such as automobiles, railroad passenger cars and streetcars, gradually diversifies into other business segments: first bedding with the Epeda and Mérinos brands, then luggage under the Delsey name in 1982, and finally aeronautics with Ratier-Figeac in 1987. Nevertheless, its core business is still manufacturing components for car seats, particularly for the French market.

From 1977, it acquires businesses in Portugal, Spain and Canada and gains a toehold in Germany, but the Company's international expansion enters a new phase in 1990 when it acquires the Rentrop group in Germany. Epeda Bertrand Faure then becomes the European leader in automotive seating. Throughout the 1990s until 1998, the Company concentrates its expertise in automotive equipment, selling off its other businesses in bedding (Epeda and Mérinos), aeronautics (Ratier-Figeac) and luggage (Delsey).
1992. Ecia sells its cycle business, then its tool business the following year and makes significant acquisitions in companies specializing in exhaust, with Tubauto and Eli Échappement in France, Leistritz Abgastechnik in Germany and Silenciadores PCG in Spain. Ecia then becomes the European leader in exhaust systems. At the same time, its Automotive Seating Division joins forces with the Spanish automotive equipment supplier Irausa to form Ardasa. The Company supplies exhaust systems, seats, interior fittings and front ends to Volkswagen, Renault, Daimler Chrysler, Opel, Honda and Mitsubishi.
December 11, 1997. Ecia makes a friendly takeover bid for Bertrand Faure, bringing its direct and indirect stake in the Group to 99%. While Bertrand Faure sells its luggage (Delsey) and aeronautics (Ratier-Figeac) businesses, Ecia sells its motorcycle business (Peugeot Motocycles) to the PSA Peugeot Citroën group in 1998.
June 1, 1999. Ecia and Bertrand Faure merge giving birth to the Faurecia company, resulting in the PSA Peugeot Citroën group holding a 52.6% stake in Faurecia by the end of 1999. Faurecia then reports sales of over 4 billion, with a workforce of 32,000. Apart from boosting its size and its global position in automotive seating, Bertrand Faure also provides Ecia with a broader geographical and commercial presence, especially in Germany, where the Company has strong links with automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW.
Late 1999. The Faurecia group develops its exhaust systems business in North America by acquiring the US company AP Automotive Systems.
October 2000. Faurecia purchases Sommer Allibert. The PSA Peugeot Citroën group finances the transaction, thus increasing its shareholding in Faurecia to 71.5%. Well established in Germany and Spain, the Group commands a significant European market share for vehicle interior fittings, especially door and instrument panels and acoustic modules.
2001. The acquisition of Sommer Allibert is completed with a public offer to buy out Sommer Allibert's minority shareholders. The resulting group has sales of 9.6 billion. Faurecia then buys out the remaining minority shares held by external shareholders in Sommer Allibert's German subsidiary SAI Automotive AG.

Background

2002. The Faurecia group acquires 49% of the South Korean catalytic converter maker Daeki Industrial, number two in its market. The same year, Faurecia forms a joint venture with the Taiwanese automotive equipment company GSK, with a view to making seats at Wuhan, in China.
2003. Faurecia follows up these acquisitions by buying the South Korean exhaust systems company Chang Heung Precision, which has market share of over 20%. This gives Faurecia's exhaust systems business a manufacturing presence in all continents. In Europe, the Group and Siemens-VDO finalize an agreement to strengthen and expand their joint venture (SAS): this company assembles cockpits for BMW, Daimler Chrysler, the Ford group, Renault-Nissan and the Volkswagen group.
2005. The Group strengthens its presence in Korea by increasing its shareholding in Daeki (specializing in exhaust systems for Hyundai) to 100%, and signs a joint-venture agreement with the South Korean company Kwang Jin Sang Gong (specializing in door modules for Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors).
2007. The Group takes over the bumper activity of Cadence Innovation France, thus strengthening its market position in this sector in France.
2009. Faurecia acquires Emcon Technologies (formerly Arvin Industries), and becomes the world leader in exhaust systems. This business combination strengthens Faurecia's position with automakers in Germany (as Arvin Industries acquired Zeuna Stärker in 1998), the USA (particularly Ford), South America, India and Thailand. It gives Faurecia a route into the niche commercial-vehicles market (trucks and off road). With this allequity acquisition, One Equity Partners (JP Morgan Chase & Co.'s private equity arm), holds a 17.3% stake in Faurecia and PSA Peugeot Citroën's interest is reduced to 57.4%.
Faurecia buys out its joint-venture partner Tata to become the sole owner of Taco Faurecia Design Center. The company is renamed Faurecia Automotive Engineering India and becomes Faurecia's development center in India.
2010. Faurecia becomes the European leader in automotive exterior parts by acquiring the German activities of Plastal, and subsequently Plastal España S.A. With these transactions, the Faurecia Automotive Exteriors Business Group enlarges its customer base, which now includes Ford and Germany's four premium automakers, upgrades its product range, and strengthens both its industrial presence and its R&D capacity. It is able to expand internationally, setting up a joint venture in China with Huaxiang, supplier of exterior parts to FAWVolkswagen.
After taking an 18.75% stake in Xuyang group, in China, the Group is able to expand the line of products and services offered in the strategic areas of complete seats, interior systems, acoustic modules, and interior covers. A strategic alliance with the Geely and Limin groups marks a significant new development stage for Faurecia Interior Systems and Faurecia Automotive Exteriors in China.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, Faurecia Automotive Seating buys the "seat comfort technology" business of the German company Hoerbiger Automotive Komfortsysteme GmbH, and diversifies its technological offer in complete seats.
Finally, to strengthen the technological prowess of Faurecia Interior Systems, the Group acquires Angell-Demmel Europe GmbH, the world leader in decorative metal parts for automobile interiors.
2011. In January, Faurecia takes a 21.2% stake in the Danish company, Amminex A/S, thus strengthening its technology towards diesel-emission control.
Faurecia also reinforces its presence in China by signing, in January, a new joint venture agreement with Ningbo Huazhong Plastic Products Co. Ltd to make exterior automobile parts; and, in June, by enlarging the scope of its cooperation with the Changchun Xuyang group. This allows it to develop locally, specifically with the FAW group. In July, it signs an agreement with the Economic and Technological Development Zone of Yancheng for an investment project allowing Faurecia to develop its seat-mechanism activity.
In November, Faurecia launches a 350 million bond issue maturing in December 2016. (The issue is supplemented by another 140 million issue in February 2012 with the same maturity date). Another syndicated line of credit is arranged for 1,150 billion, in two tranches: A (690 million) and B (460 million), maturing in November 2014 and November 2016 respectively.
2012. On May 3, Faurecia announces its acquisition of the Ford ACH interior components plant in Saline, Michigan (USA). This plant supplies cockpit modules, instrument panels, door panels and center consoles for 12 automotive programs assembled in 8 Ford plants across North America.
In parallel with this acquisition, Faurecia signs a joint venture agreement with Rush group Ltd, a Rush group company. The joint venture, called Detroit Manufacturing Systems (DMS), takes over activities such as the assembly and sequencing of interior parts at a new plant in Detroit.
On February 14, Faurecia announces that in addition to its 350 million bond issue in November 2011, it has placed another issue with a nominal value of 140 million.
On April 27, Faurecia announces that it has placed a new bond issue with a nominal value of 250 million, maturing in June 2019.
On August 30, Faurecia announces that with effect from that date, it has acquired Plastal France (Plastal SAS), a supplier of plastic body parts for Smart branded vehicles (Daimler group). The transaction follows the previous acquisitions of Plastal Allemagne and Plastal Espagne in 2010, and includes the manufacturing and assembly plant and the operational headquarters in Hambach (France).

connected vehicles. The first step will consist in acquiring a 20% stake in Parrot Automotive. Faurecia could increase its stake to 50.01% as from 2019 and acquire all Parrot Automotive shares by 2022. If the talks are successful, the project will be launched in the first half of 2017.

AGREEMENT THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD CHANGE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY OR THAT COULD DELAY, POSTPONE, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL
To the best of the Company's knowledge there are no arrangements in place whose operation could result in a change in control of the Company at a future date.
There are currently no deeds, bylaws, charters, regulations or provisions in place that could delay, postpone or prevent such a change in control.
AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY WHICH ARE AMENDED OR TERMINATED IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
The syndicated loan agreement entered into by the Company on December 15, 2014 includes an acceleration

clause under which ­ subject to certain conditions ­ each bank may require immediate payment of outstanding sums in the event of a change of ownership of the Company. The bonds issued on April 1, 2016 and on February 21, 2018, provide for early repayment in the event of a change of control.
None of the above transactions include a minimum Peugeot S.A. shareholding clause.
AGREEMENTS STIPULATING PAYMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES
There are no agreements of the type referred to in Article L. 22537-5, paragraph 10 of the French Code of commerce in favor of members of the Board of Directors or employees.
MEASURES TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL IS NOT EXERCISED IN AN ABUSIVE MANNER
The Company is controlled in the sense of Article L. 233-3 of the French Code of commerce, as shown in the table breaking down ownership in Section 3.2.1.
The measures taken by the Company to avoid abuse of control are described in this Registration Document:
 section 2.1 of this Registration Document: "Participants and systems in risk control";
 section 3.1.1.1.1 of this Registration Document: "Presence of independent members on the Board of Directors and its specialized committees";
 section 3.2.1.2.1 of this Registration Document: "Factors related to conflicts of interest".
MAJOR CONTRACTS
To date, Faurecia has not entered into any major contracts that would entail a significant obligation or commitment for the Group, other than those that fall within the ordinary course of business.
DEPENDENCE
See Section 2, "Risks and risk control", and especially risk associated with the automotive supplier business, supplier risk and intellectual property risk.
SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The Group's 300 manufacturing sites, including 30 research and development centers spanning 34 countries worldwide, enable it to maximize its local presence and implement its just-in-time delivery strategy. None of its manufacturing equipment taken on an individual basis represents a material value in relation to the property, plant and equipment of the Group as a whole. They are mostly dedicated to client programs. As a result, utilization rates are largely dependent on business levels. With very few exceptions, utilization rates for equipment and facilities are not monitored centrally or systematically.
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information on the Group's property, plant and equipment.

NOTE ON METHODOLOGY RELATING TO REPORTING ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS
Social and environmental indicators are reported following the guidance in the relevant Faurecia Core Procedure (FCP). The procedures form part of the Faurecia Excellence System (FES), which defines the working methods for Group employees worldwide and underpins the Group's identity.
The aim of the FCP covering environmental reporting is to organize the annual collection, compilation and communication of data in this area via a Group software operated by Tennaxia. The scope of reporting covers Group sites identified by the HSE managers in each Business Group (sites with a low environmental impact are excluded).
The Group software rolled out at the relevant sites describes, among other things, the list of indicators being reported, the checks, in particular consistency, carried out throughout the reporting process as well as the instructions for use.
The data, duly collected, checked and input into the software is approved at division, Business Group and Group level before being consolidated.
The FCPs covering employee-related matters notably define the reporting standards as regards headcount and other key employee data within the Group. All Faurecia group sites are covered. These procedures are based on monthly reporting via the Metis_HR software, which is then used to consolidate the data. Checks are carried out throughout the data reporting process, and at the end of this process the data are analyzed by the Group Human Resources department.
The environmental and social data in this Registration Document are independently audited by Ernst & Young et Associés. The opinion given in Section 5.5.2 summarizes their conclusions from their work.
